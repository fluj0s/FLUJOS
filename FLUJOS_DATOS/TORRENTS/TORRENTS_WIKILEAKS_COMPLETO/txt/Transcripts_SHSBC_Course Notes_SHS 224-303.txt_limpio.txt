competence and an intention to go on and do his job this gives the pc certainty that the auditor will go on and be effective this gives the auditor altitude the processes we are counting on today are cchs and 3dxx they take case all the way south and auditors can apply these processes well the first test of process is can an auditor other than ron do it an auditor can do any process that does not require of him more adjudication than can be given him by an emeter if you ask him for further judgment some will be able to do it but the majority will not auditing the cchs requires that an auditor be able to observe constancy or change instructors must make sure that students learn how to do this an auditor can be taught to list and to read meter against list what requires is instruction of precise nature there is only one right way to do cchs to list and to null given high level of competence in these spheres dissemination will proceed by leaps and bounds you can do these drills in the absence of complete understanding of them though it is better to have understanding to avoid introducing unnecessary ritual fortunately we know why these processes work youve also got to be able to prepcheck so you can audit an arc breaky pc who is madly withholding from you the least common denominator of ruds is withholds and the least common denominator of withholds is missed sometimes you have to find them to get things moving again to get ta action etc all of freuds work and all of the work of faculty psychology is wrapped up in prepchecking with prepchecking you can find and eradicate childhood traumas we have also wrapped up the work of freuds squirrels jung adler etc pavlov wrote four hundred page manuscript for stalin on how his data on animals could be applied to humans this has never been brought to light abroad communism used it to fixate attention on the third dynamic to the exclusion of all others capitalism capitalism lets you have what youve got if they cant get it away from you socialism socialism lets you have half of what you already own communism communism doesnt let you have anything that you own this is total games condition between the individual and the state early faculty psychology tried to relieve people of things from pavlov on psychology has tried to do things to people therefore pavlovian conditioning would have to be undone with cchs since it is an effort to do things to people rather than to alleviate things in people 225 details on difficulties with prepchecking lrh states that he is taking it out of the lineup on sane case on cchs if you ever have any trouble getting them to do the actions their ruds are very probably out prepchecking missed withholds will get them in you could approach it by doing white farm and getting off the withholds that all she reading terminals have missed l ron hubbard type 3 idate17462 volnum1 issue133 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec133 how and why auditing works 6204c17 shspec133 how and why auditing works the twopole nature of the universe has to do with why auditing works there is mathematics connected with it developed by buckminster fuller dimaxian geometry this proves that the universe could not exist without two poles the lowest level of observation is being something at this level you cannot see something because you are being it know thyself has been introduced as trap for thetans the only way you could know yourself seemingly would be to view yourself but then how could you be yourself the very definition of observation appears to involve the communication formula duplication but how can you duplicate something without an intervening space between the thing and its duplicate unless you are asising the thing so unless observation is asising it must involve space and therefore separateness the gpm contains in it anything you need to know about the nature of problems problems are balanced forces in opposition hung up in time world war i for instance in gpm the intentions of one kind of beingness oppose the intentions of another type of beingness exactly equally if two sides of problem are not equal they dont hang up because one side overwhelms the other this is rare situation hence the fewness of items person has been many more beings than are in the gpm the gpm stays with person because of the balanced timeless quality of it there is also free track which can contain engrams that can be run out the gpm is the unfree track it is really quite unlikely that two valences would balance like that they would tend to get unbalanced or wear out but gpms are stuck in pt each gpm has lots of minds in it each with an accumulation of locks if each valence had two hundred lock items and gpm had say twenty packages in it you would have four thousand minds in the gpm the locks can be just as effective as the items themselves the lot of it plus the free track on both sides is the reactive mind running free track unravels lot but never quits explains everything packages composed of terminal and oppterm tend to lock up the rest of the track other things collide with them right in the middle you have the waterbuck and the tiger adjacent is the priest and the vestal virgin then there is god and the devil all these oppositions each pair perfectly balanced accumulate to themselves other identities that are hanging around and you get collapsed track these are represented in the bank by spherical masses inside each spherical mass there are compartments of thought because the person usually had head in which he did his thinking so the gpm tends to approximate head with thinkthinkthink in the middle of it and it is usually empty all through the gpm there are little compartments with ideas in them so you get trapped thought ideas enclosed by force these can be dramatized when 226 spherical shapes are counterposed against other spherical shapes these things are hung up one against the other to such degree that neither one can go away this is the final material form the gpm takes all this comes down to fixated attention concentration upon the oppterm electronically power can be generated until you have two poles fixed in separate positions in space the mind is composed of energy which exists in space and condenses down to masses in the reactive mind there is time all time is now we must assume that if we have flows electrical masses current standing waves etc there must be two poles involved otherwise there would be flows people would never have somatics this has lot to do with cchs auditing is effective only in the presence of at least two poles this doesnt mean you cant ever selfaudit but it does mean that when you do it effectively you have two poles the pc who never cognites is bugaboo to auditors he is running on one pole pole that has thought in the middle of it and standing energy waves outside of it he is in the thought area and he keeps running through the energy when he has ideas they are the ones packaged in that thought zone he is being that mass not viewing it he is not viewing another mass either he is also not viewing the auditor he is being something and observing nothing only if he can observe other things will he make gains because then he has another role if he is just being that one thing he will be unable to change it would be ok if he could view something like glass there he would have two poles he could asis the cigarette lighter in this situation you would get tons arm action also in session if you can get the pc to look at the auditor you have twopole situation if that isnt happening you get change on cchs on 3dxx you will get ta action as long as the pc can look at the masses in his mind giving at least two poles there are two ways cchs could be run 1 dummox style the auditor makes the machinery work to do the process this will still produce results in 500 hours or so 2 right style get the pcs attention on the auditor and the environment by maintaining 2wc with the pc you handle the pcs attention towards his mind by taking every twitch as an origin this gets him to look at what he is doing and exteriorizes him from it then you can get change because he is looking at what he has teen and done and isnt still being it it is good idea to key out as many masses as you can before starting 3dxx you want to key out looks inverted loops etc you dont want to mess around with this in 3dxx otherwise he is always dramatizing these locks and has ptps 227 when the pc is listing items he has been every one of those items or raised hell with them in getting him to list you have made him exteriorize to some degree from say five hundred identities the one the pc is being in pt does not discharge because he is being it if he wasnt in it it would discharge and quit reading this is the one that hangs up in time the hardest the oppterm is what he is concentrated on now you have twopole situation right there in the bank and the two will start to discharge the thing that makes the gpm hard to tie down and makes 3dxx sometimes hard to do is that he is obsessively being the internal items and sometimes so slightly being the initial ones you find that sometimes the terminal and the oppterm are widely separated in the gpm early on commonly you get terminal and plausible oppterm only there are twelve items between before they meet each other when they dont hit square on the nose and go poof you have intervening packages the pc has noknowingness of his beingness he may think that he is being man but actually he is being waterbuck andor tiger ask joe why he is biting his fingernails hell say oh am i he never thinks to ask himself who or what would bite fingernails it is probably to scratch out waterbucks eyes person starts worrying about himselves well he has to step back and look all processes are exteriorization processes just exteriorize the pc from different things cchs make pt comfortable enough so the pc can exteriorize from various parts of the past in which he has been sitting for trillenia cchs dont go all the way but the pc sure feels like they do all the way up from cchs to 3dxx you have twopole situation first with the pc as an object then on up to the pc being being stepping back to look at mass on routine 1 we were exteriorizing somatic the pc exteriorized as mass 3dxx exteriorizes people out of past identities the pc hasnt even been in his head for an incalculable period of time if you run cchs smoothly and correctly the pc can asis old facsimiles and come gradiently out of old bits and pieces of the past he goes through sequence of exteriorizations it shifts the bank and the pc feels better about pt when we have him as close to pt as possible he should move on to 3dxx he will come out of masses as mass duplicating those identities ta action comes from the pc looking at something whether or not he is being something else feelingness is lowerscale substitute far lookingness touchyfeelies work for that reason knowing this you could invent some new cchs but these would only be as good as they cause twopole situation to exist in the session you must keep directing the pcs attention to his bank or else he will never come out of the bank for any think process to work the pc has to be one mass in his mind looking at another mass in his mind when you have that you can have ta in the cchs the auditor and the environment act as the other pole if the auditor audits cchs like steam engine they will work even then but more slowly than when the auditor makes pt ok to the pc on cchs you must 1 keep pt attractive to the pc 2 do them precisely 3 keep in 2wc 4 keep the pcs attention on what is happening with his somatics if you do these things the pc will just sail on the cchs they are not slow process they are very fast process 228 an instant before somatic turns on the pc is being it then when he feels it he is exterior from it so you are setting up twopole situation in the bank by getting the pc to exteriorize sufficiently to stop being the somatic and to see it in 3dxx you are finding out what the pc has been and when he sees it he ceases to be it 3dxx exteriorizes the pc from the past identities he has been and does this in assessing very fast it is like telephone poles flying past he has been in every one of the items he gives you you can actually thus kick pc out of his bank you will only get ta action as long as the pc is looking at something or at least feeling something ta action twopole situation you are doing something wrong l

action one should assume that something very gross is going on the oddity of scientology is that the textbook solution works unlike any other field or previous practice in practically every other subject the guy on the job is meeting up with situations that arent covered in the textbook rut in scientology it is when you depart from the textbook solution that you get in trouble this flies in the teeth of all ones past experience so you tend to approach the solution with little variation and deviation every pc is individual and all his originations are different from every other individuals but what the auditor does is always the same if the auditor departs from the textbook solutions he is asking for trouble auditing takes imagination to speak of unusual solutions just good ability to communicate the best of auditors goof at times the commonest mistake is not realizing that when the pc has said it it is blown and taking up all the pcs answers or origins for further discussion such auditors underestimate the power of 2wc the auditor should assume especially in ruds that it has blown until he tests it on the meter and finds differently he should acknowledge well what the pc says because that is part of the blow mechanism if the auditor goes on to take it up it keys the pc in again when you acknowledge it look pleased and relieved that it is all handled if it still reads give it only as much time and attention as is needed to slip it out of the way using same brushoff process if you are unlucky enough not to have the process work you must have been doing something else by giving flawless session the auditor can hold the ruds in anyone can make goofs but they shouldnt be frequent since we want the pc to be confident confidence is result of auditor consistency ruds on the environment will stay in if the auditor is consistent about the auditing environment the pcs confidence drops when you q and or act inconsistently the result is difficulty of keeping ruds in ie lack of consistency leads to lack of confidence leads to ruds going nut pc notices the care that is taken with him this aids in building his confidence he gets unconfident if each session is full of surprises and the auditor keeps changing things around if you keep having to use middle ruds it is probably something you did during the session even very nervous pc can gradually come to realize that the auditor wont permit anything to happen to him during the session he will permit the auditor to be responsible for the environment 229 checking on those pcs who were getting ta disclosed the fact that while ta doesnt necessarily take place just because ruds are in if rudiments are out ta will not take place this means that ta is proportional to the degree ruds are in not to the state of the case that is monitored by what is being run on the case to be sure so the truth of it depends on the fact that the right process is being run l ron hubbard type 3 idate19462 volnum1 issue135 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec135 determining what to run 6204c19 shspec135 determining what to run details about currently used processes especially prepchecking and 3dxx the rock is the first thing the pc had been ta drifts during session dont count as ta motion eg on problems intensive that you are doing to see whether the ta moves with new pc if the ta is generally between 475 and 50 that is not ta motion to speak of motion is what happens in twenty minutes and it is up and down the way to get ta when the pc doesnt have much is optimally to alternate cchs and prepchecking good cchs and good prepchecking will be real winner but even indifferent cchs and prepchecking will be winner they should be done in different sessions person who cant asis things because he is being it all wont asis much on either cchs or prepchecking but there will be small effect note that the ta he gets while talking to you isnt adjudicative it is the ta he gets while thinking that counts if he doesnt get adequate ta during subjective processes you will know that it will be difficult to get and keep ruds in on him so he needs cchs and prepchecks to keep his ruds in if cchs turn into wrestling match the auditor has missed withhold finish up the session next session prepcheck with the zero question has withhold been missed clean it up if you can do it in not more than three sessions if it is that sticky he is having trouble asising but he will have gotten some missed withholds off so cchs can operate again when they are fairly flat go back to prepchecking etc if in doubt when to switch over go by the auditors code 13 auditors code of 1954 always continue process as long as it produces change and longer see the creation of human ability p 3 and run the process to nochange or switch over when you have gotten gain on cchs or on the prepcheck whichever you are doing the goal you have is to get the rudiments in because then you will get ta the pc has outruds in life continually if you could get rid of all the bad feelings he has about his environment and people you would have done more than any earlier therapy he would also be able to be in session with pc who is getting ta you will bring up his external ruds with cchs and his internal think ruds with prepchecking the combination of the two acts as an introvertextrovert action havingness goes down on think processes and is remedied on cchs you should realize that the longer it takes you to get an item an overt or whatever the longer it takes to accomplish something with auditing the harder it gets because length drifts in the direction of noauditing an item per month is far less auditing than an item per week the longer it takes the more ruds go out and the more violently they go out the less chance you have of getting the item ruds are the most out on the least auditing they can go further out in auditing than they ever do in life this gives another reason for auditing in the direction of wins for the pc 230 pcs at first set very largeeffect session goals despite the fact that they can have only very minor effects the win has to be real to the pc for him to know that he has had one so it has to be consistent with where he is on the effect scale if you keep giving him effects you know he can have he will come up by little gradients the worse off he is the longer it will take to get win alternating cchs and prepchecking gives good chance for him to start getting wins he will then start getting ta as he gets confident in his auditor and feels safer in the session environment he will start looking around as he realizes that he doesnt have to be all the things he is being in order to survive he can look at one of them out of eight million things he is being you will then get some ta prepchecking had the virtue as training process of giving pcs wins at the same time as it was giving the auditor lots of familiarity with the emeter if the pc fell apart on 3dxx if he got all messed up and outruds he could be put back on cchs and prepchecking routine l ron hubbard type 3 idate26462 volnum1 issue138 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec138 professional attitude 6204c26 shspec138 professional attitude rundown on prepchecking there are several things that monitor the success of auditing one of these is professional attitude the substance of the professional attitude is that someone is here to be healed and the auditor is going to heal him regardless of the pcs politics religion or pace etc the auditor is professional who is healing beings who need healing it doesnt matter who the pc is this is very hardboiled attitude actually an auditor is as good as he can assume professional attitude towards the pc in front of him regardless of any personal opinions or the pcs opinions creed etc that attitude alone has brought the healing professions along through the trillenia there are splinter groups of healers who may be far more effective than medical doctors but who dont have professional code of conduct these practitioners are far less well respected because they are not that professional or they havent created belief in the public that they have professional attitude this is also why husbandwife teams dont audit each other well there is too much personal concern and too little professional attitude as an auditor you will have terrific wins when you realize that case is case matter what the pcs body looks like and when you audit with professional attitude having professional attitude is also necessary because failure to do so will get in the way of your processing results push it home and stand by it where the public is concerned and you will inherit the world of healing where other splinter groups have not this doesnt necessarily mean having particular mockup or appearance it just means that anyone who comes for processing gets audited as himself dont process anyone because of anything just process him this will become very comfortable attitude to have in session one with additives or personal quirks it will result in public trust you had also better not be an auditor after the session or the pc will tend to continue to be in session after the session is supposed to be over act like an auditor during the session not before or after 231 the public demands only that they be treated by someone who is interested in them if you always do good job both technically and professionally you will be in good shape technical perfection itself is very impressive prepchecking is harder to do than routine 3 processes it is the first test of whether an auditor knows his business furthermore if you cant do good job prepchecking you will never do good job on routine 3 there will always be something missing dont ever decide what should read and what shouldnt observe prepchecking gets the pc in session and frees up his attention so he can be audited it can also give fantastic changes and gains if run searchingly as total psychotherapy of this lifetime it completes the work of freud and any cathartictype therapy it is therefore very comprehensible to the public it could he used to help someone clean up some troublesome area if you expect too much of prepchecking however you will have some loses the basic thing that has been going wrong in running routine 3 is that the auditor doing the process was also trying to do sec check or ruds session trying to mate an eagle with shark this also accounts for the fact that people couldnt find goals because the ruds were out you cant combine sec checking or prepchecking session with routine 3 session but green auditor will try if the auditor starts to give one sort of session but finds he has to go on to another sort of session he gets the impression of loss of control of the pc if keeping the pcs ruds in is that big problem he shouldnt be doing routine 3 processes he should be on cchs prepchecks also get him used to being model sessioned and get him so that he will stay in session you will have enough difficulty with routine 3 without adding the difficulty of prepchecking at the same time the whole reason routine 3 kept being varied and moved around was that the ruds kept going nut on people and they werent able to find items prepchecking is the remedy for that it sets the pc up so that when you list you can just list and find goals terminals and oppterms it is luckily also very interesting to the pc from the viewpoint of auditor training routine 3 processes are too hard on case to be done wrong they cant safely be used as training activity prepchecking though it is harder and has the liability that you can miss withholds with devastating results is better training activity the theetieweetie case walks around with the idea that everybody should know all the time this is the perpetual missed withhold case he is in bad shape whenever you ask him question you get missed withhold because you should have known the answer if you ask three questions you miss three withholds he thinks everyone should know everything he is thinking so there is mass of continuous missed withholds prepchecking will handle it as keyout on 3dxx you will come up with an item like swami and then the circuit ceases but these cases are hell to prepcheck because they think you must know if they know so they dont have any withholds they have never done anything you have to know this phenomenon so you can straighten it all out that is the hard case to prepcheck not the sinner 232 prepchecking is not easy but it is very precise and must be done very professionally since your personal reaction and personal interest interjected into the session ruins the pcs willingness td get off real overts he will only give up safe withholds if you have anything but calm professional attitude it is also necessary to keep missed withholds cleaned up particularly if he gets misemotional on you auditors have terrible time getting this through their heads and just pulling the missed withhold prepchecking is easy to do if it is done right it makes doing routine 3 ridiculously easy by comparison also l ron hubbard type 3

this lecture the toughest thing to do is to get the auditor to ask simple question have i missed withhold on you its utterly wild there is even case of someone letting someone die rather then saying it there is even another way to say it is there something i should have found out about you auditors failure to do this makes lrh feel like he is on an involuntary withhold he feels like he is screaming in soundproof room people will actually let pc sit there yapping and screaming as though they the auditor had responsibility for what is going on when all they have to do is to ask for the missed withhold missed withholds cause lot of phenomena even gpms are caused by missed withholds it is almost as if the basic principle of existence is when existence is good thou hast not missed withhold and when existence is bad thou hath missed withhold missed withhold properly asked for the meter cleaned remedies each one of these things and many more 1 pc failing to make progress we know now that ptps stem from missed withholds and they stop progress 2 pc critical of or angry at the auditor nonwithholdy pc wont get angry at an auditor goof it doesnt matter whether the auditor was guilty as charged by the pc or not if the pc natters about it he has had withhold missed it is not what is known the thing he is nattering about that is wrong with the pc so you dropped his goals list into the spittoon so what if he says what the hell are you doing he has had withhold missed earlier in the session dont get reasonable about it complaints come from missed withholds get then pulled dont develop them dont follow them just pull them and get on with the session 3 pc refusing to talk to the auditor this happens fifteen to twenty minutes before the blow refusal to talk is simply the realization that one cant because one isnt being heard failing to acknowledge can stick the pc with an involuntary withhold that becomes missed you see this in prayer guy talking to god is talking to circuit if god is talking back sooner or later the circuit will blow and he will have fantastic missed withhold he will get angry at the catholic church or whatever when he suddenly gets answer to his communication one way to handle this is to acknowledge the living daylights out of the pc another is to ask if you have missed withhold 233 4 pc trying to leave session this is reverse flow of screaming at the auditor you create missed withhold with every failure to acknowledge pc originations or answers eventually the pc will scream at you if you refuse to receive communication from the pc you can create an arc break 5 any needle pattern if the needle is active regardless of what you are saying or even when you are not talking the pc has missed withhold all needle patterns are caused by missed withholds see 6202c15 shspec145 new trs p 240 below needle pattern is series of missed withholds culminating in constantly active needle it is dirty needle that can be wide or narrow you can and should correct such pattern get the ruds back in 6 pc not desirous of being audited this applies to anybody not just pcs but how could you miss withhold on stranger when you havent even talked to him well you are the one who is supposed to know see p 184 above on what nonscientologist thinks knowledge is knowledge of his withholds so it is automatic if your presence is good enough you can get past all the argument and actually pull the withhold 7 pc boiling off mechanically this is stuck flow but the reason for the stuck flow is missed withhold pc even going little fuzzy has missed withhold however minor it may be 8 pc exhausted this is caused by missed withhold as unlikely as it seems 9 pc feeling foggy at session end this is like boiloff you will get little nitpicky missed withholds like i wanted to take smoke break an hour ago and didnt mention it for this you can preface the missed withhold question with in this session 10 pcs havingness drops missed withhold is notreach isnt it thats havingness havingness comes up when missed withholds are cleaned up 11 pc criticising auditor to others here we are going out into life even if the auditor wasnt perceptive didnt acknowledge etc he has still missed his withholds we only learned this piece of tech fairly recently and by the way people studying scientology think that every time we come out with something new old things cease to be true eg they think the arc scale see scientology 08 pp 102 and 103 went out because we have just said that the effects scale exists this is not true 12 pc demanding redress of wrongs he is saying that you should audit him for free or some such thing it doesnt matter if everything he says is true the solution isnt to be found in court but in missed withholds you can ask what should the organization have found out about you to handle this 13 pc critical of organizations or people of scientology or of scientology these things can have enormous effects and yet be trivial even laudable in and of themselves say guy donates money to research foundation and finds out that it has been credited to his account 234 instead the foundation has missed withhold on him right there he has tried to say something and it hasnt been acknowledged he has tried to communicate something and the communication has not occurred every question you dont answer becomes kissed withhold letter registrars should be aware of this the missed withhold comes from the they should know what im thinking they should have found out you can end an entheta campaign by sending detective around to investigate then they figure you know and the campaign stops because you have unmissed the withhold better out really find out what as going on and publish the truth believe it or not they wont attack you worse than before they will leave you alone the original attack wasnt based on your overts matter how many they may have been it was based only on the withholds missed by you 14 lack of auditing results this is cousin to 1 above progress handling this assists organizations immensely cleaning up missed withholds gives auditing results hence new pcs etc 15 dissemination failures what have i failed to find out about you handles this the trouble is that it is too simple so auditors miss it the missed withhold extends into virtually every other area of scientology tr4 the

craftsmanship fundamentals session missed withhold is anything the pc thought but didnt tell the auditor that is fins for the session but in prepchecking you want meat not skim milk you want meaningful acts it isnt necessarily antisocial or unmannerly acts like masturbation or nosepicking embarrassing acts that you are looking for what you are looking for is overts not just seamy withholds there is difference comments on the above tvd you can have chain based on notknowingness even if there is nothing there to be notknown this isnt common missed withhold of nothing you never give up on the fundamentals when the pc gets nattery he has missed withhold whether the natter has any basis in reason or not not many you audit by those you should get your own reality on this it can be crammed down your throat but it is better understanding since stable datum fixed in by confusion and not by understanding isnt available in tight spot this leads to auditing by being reasonable fundamentals are meant to be used if i tell you something is fundamental dont just believe it is find out if it is or is not in your own universe it will be but if you never find this out for yourself you will just keep going on by rote and ritual if you do find this out for yourself you will not need all your old stable data or superstitions 235 what i expect of an auditor is to audit the pc that is right there in front of him by the most fundamental fundamentals that he can command and understand he will always get wins that way and he wont be in fog about any of it he will be able to evaluate importances in the ritual in prepchecking your what question will often miss the mark by bit because after all until you have done the prepcheck you dont know exactly what the chain is and if it is that unknown to the pc how could you know all about it before you found out from the pc besides all basic incidents must be unknown at least in part or the chain would blow auditing by fundamentals you know enough about the chain to formulate what question that will come close enough to get what you need as you go earlier you find yourself asking about similar things but not the exact same overt at the earlier time you get what question that describes the incident in workably general terms and go from there hoping for the best all you have to null is the incident that you got the what question from prepchecking is not an exact activity it depends on the pc in front of you because it is inexact you must do it in the framework of total exactitude that is given in model session trs metering all your fundamentals that must be known solidly when you have that you can play by ear with confidence and results any craftsman can create the illusion of terrific ease and offhandedness however the common denominator of all great art is great ability to do small detail if one tries to shortcut the ability to do the details and just does the offhanded action the result is slop an auditors tiny details consist of the meter trs model session etc how do you get to be superb auditor by knowing all these small parts perfectly if you find yourself wondering about any one of them you must practice drill to get it straightened out you can go over these items and ask yourself if any of them have been shaky in recent sessions and work on what you find dont let embarrassment stop you from finding out what needs to be worked on only when you have mastered the detail will you be free to audit the pc in front of you you wont be free to audit the pc in front of you as long as you are enslaved by dont knows among your auditing tools because you get chain of error that mounts in she session based on the basic notknowingness dont think that you will get results real honesttogod results if you are anything less than master of the craft that is the discouraging point of auditing the running of repetitive processes without attention on the pc hoping far the best does make lot of people well as does engram running this could get longtime auditors stuck in win but we havent had techniques prior to 1962 that reached all cases we have them now but they

ardate000 shspec143 prepchecking 6205c03 shspec143 prepchecking here is how to make prepchecking not work ignore the pc and omit the datum that it is easier for pc to confront think than mass gpm is thought chamber surrounded by mass the pc is perfectly happy to look at the thought chamber but doesnt like looking at the mass so he gets the thought first and confronts the mass an gradient this is why it is possible to get much deeper into the gpm with goal than with an item he can confront the goal because it is thought running routine3 we have the pc confront all the little masses the lock items first and then he will gradually get to where the goal starts showing up toward the end of the list the goal ticks because it is surrounded by mass then you list the item and it appears towards the end of the list you went into the gpm on the wings of thought and you follow through with the ugly burr and buzz of heat cold and lightning the somatics this is like taking jet plane to africa eventually you have to walk but in running routine 3dxx you travel by thought only short distance using the prehav scale take the first level that keeps banging from then on it is all mass listing items the pc does the same thing with his withholds and missed withholds pcs will confront any quantity of thought and ideas if the auditor doesnt push and shove the pc will go nowhere except on the wings of thought which dont really get the pc anyplace in 1956 lrh noticed that lots of thinkconfront didnt change graph much it at all by 1959 he had determined that you had to be able to confront the mass to get anyplace the pc is working on secondhand thought anyway pulled out of locks in the gpm you will be fooled by such processes as rising scale processing in this process though the process is pure thoughtconfront if the pc made gains it is because he confronted some mass or changed position in the gpm every now and then you do get some results with confronting thought and because of your own willingness to go an confronting thought you buy it as good procedure but it is the rearrangement on mass that really produced the gain it is the same in prepchecking every now and then you will get good win by taking thought instead of deeds you have to get action to get masses to move the pc can add thinks to his case faster than you can pull them off in session there is doingness going on except thinking so it is fine to take thoughts as session missed withholds his thoughts in pt cancel out the thinks of past goals which is why you have to keep ruds in while listing something in pt is much more important to the pc than something that happened billion years ago even though it is the billion years back stuff that aberrated him but auditing is done in pt and the pc is always trying to sell the auditor on the ideas that 1 his thinkingness is what is wrong with him 2 pt is far more important than anything the auditor is trying to go into the auditor must not q and with his own human agreement with this he must have certainty that the longer ago it happened the more effect it had on the pcs aberrated state and that doingness and havingness are more important than thinkingness 237 you clear up ruds as close to pt as possible and you prepcheck as far from pt as possible given the goal of each procedure that is the most effective thing to do you dont have the time or inclination to clear up ruds on the whole track because you are handling the whole track with beefier processes just because you can do something in ruds by pulling thinks dont be fooled into supposing that running think will get you anywhere in prepchecking in prepchecking you have to get dones there is basic difference on importances between the auditor and the pc concerning the location of the charge in prepchecking you cannot let the pc direct the questioning he will stay close to pt and in think if you dont have good auditor control good prepchecking is impossible you can key things out by shallow looks this is fins for ruds but you dont get any resurgence to speak of permanent change if the pc is thinking about it now he did it then you must operate on the basis that the chain is long and has basic that is unknown to the pc all this is available to you by taking locks off the top and going back under good auditor control of the pc you only get charge off later incidents to the point where the pc can see earlier the chain the auditor is getting the pc to go down has r for the pc because he has c with its further reaches the withhold system steps 2 3 4 and 5 of prepchecking when all appear and who see p 186 above and see hcob 21mar62 prepchecking data when to do what for more current procedure takes the charge off each incident brings the incident to view so that he can asis it and then go earlier he will go earlier god help you if you go into the gpm with this but persevere find an incident that happened earlier memory is occluded by the most recent overt on the chain recovering memory of who one was in ones last life has virtually therapeutic value though it is very interesting to the pc and gives some resurgence you are prepchecking chains of similar incidents the charge is built up out of the first unknown in routine 3 you are dealing with packages of engrams called identities so routine 3 deals with whole lives of engrams all in bundle leading to the gpm prepchecking deals with chains of incidents and when you get the earliest unknown the whole chain will blow the pc will know where things come from and will feel better the permanent gains you can expect from adroit prepchecking are 1 the pc understands his case better 2 he sees where things come from 3 he feels better about life people and the environment around him buy

the briefing course year ago new training pattern laid down in the academies new course materials have been added but practical section has been added to get people to confront doingness as well as thought data is very important but its 238 application in doingness is harder to confront so we are putting in practical section to make sure that correct application occurs practical has always been there in the comm course and upper indocs this adds practical to the actual auditing along with added trs etc you could learn great deal about the mind and reactions of pcs if your technical procedure was perfect your understanding of the mind at present is blurred by the lack of an absolutely perfect application of scientology to the pc because of distractions entered in by imperfect auditing one stable datum is when confronted by the unusual do the usual every pc thinks his case is different from everyone elses actually he is thetan and he is here his case operates like everybody elses as far as fundamentals go the pc will give you sales talk on his unusuality on all his differences it is his privilege to come up with unusuals nonduplicates of everyone else of course he will with the bank he has got the moment the auditor buys the pcs unusualness he is teamed up with the reactive mind and the bank the auditor process the pc thenceforth if your application of auditing is wild and variable and everything looks all different to you you will get wild ideas about the human mind one could be blamed for varying procedure if they didnt know that standard auditing exists this is now know everything pc can do has standard auditor response that handles it it is the fact that these auditor responses do work in all cases that makes them standard responses universities sometimes have courses where the subject is hidden the students are there the professor is there but the course is double talk there is real subject eg art appreciation music appreciation domestic relations people confuse education with thinkingness you can go through school without ever understanding anything furthermore early classroom training is all data practical so giving doingness along with theory tends to break up the automaticity that equates education with total think education has become huge practical joke theory practical auditing gives two thirds doingness and one third think that is about what it takes there would be new tr for each new activity the result will be very smooth effortless auditing there will be uncertainties because the auditor knows the correct cause for every pc response and the proper response for very pc action this means that there is need or place for cleverness in handing pc only standardness in handling pcs there are certain stable data in the theory if you didnt have these you wouldnt know where you were going or why these stable data are the fundamental things there are certain practical actions that you must be able to do and few auditing skills to be used in auditing processes these things can be organized to go together and to complement each other to some degree see hcob 3may62 practical auditing skills for summary of practical auditing skills ie the student should learn 1 the basic fundamental precepts few bits of inescapable theory 2 certain basic practical actions basic to auditing 3 auditing skills that are relatively easy to do these three will be tied up together so that they complement each other 239 class ia processes include op pro by dup scs and assists op pro by dup was originally invented solely as training process for auditors to teach them that duplication wouldnt kill them it enabled auditors to give repetitive commands without alterising so instead of asking do birds fly the auditor wont go off and ask are our feathered friends airborne it gets rid of obsessive change scs runs out bad control people must have been miscontrolled to object to control but the auditor must control the pc or he fails utterly control and duplication are the roughest hurdles for an auditor to get over student auditors should both give and receive op pro by dup and scs as first action see hcob 14may62 case repair for more data on op pro by dup and scs assists are the other basic auditing action to teach beginning auditors they can give spectacular results all these processes teach body mauling which is good thing now that upper indocs are removed because they lead people to misrun cchs and none of these processes goof up the pc if done wrong they all repair themselves if they are done right to repair the wrongly done process unlike engram running for instance which is not selfcorrecting these three processes constitute class ia class ib is arc sw in model session plus havingness this is sit down process that gives verbal repetitive think processing it will occasionally make someone sane who didnt know he was nuts and it gives the auditor reality on banks and timetracks as he sees the pc cycle in time you can run it positively and negatively which handles someone who winds up in agony when you try to run pleasure moments this process has tremendous horsepower class iia is prepchecks and cchs prepchecks

the 2wc tr for cchs and model session in cchs the pcs physical reaction is considered to be an origination the auditor asks what happened just then pc what auditor that jerk of your head just then pc oh i had somatic auditor thank you this is the only communication used in the cchs if the pc originates something verbally you acknowledge it per tr4 and go on do not indulge in any extensive 2wc on the pcs answer to your query you ask the 2wc question at the end of command cycle this prevents him from taking control of the session though by the end of the command cycle he will frequently have forgotten what it was this form of 2wc is intended only to exteriorize the pc from somatic by getting him to look at it if his answer when you ask what happened doesnt pertain to the physical change you noticed you can ask what happened with your shoulder etc otherwise the pc can grind on and never notice what he is doing it is allowable to encourage him bit eg by asking how is it going as needed but this should only be done rarely there are emeter drills to teach auditors to recognize body motion and pc sell pcs will try to make items appear to read or to make ruds look clean by gradually loosening their can grip learn to set up the meter smoothly and quietly so that you dont distract the pc needle pattern reading is rather new needle pattern is series of missed withholds culminating in constantly active needle it is dirty needle that can be wide or narrow you can and should correct such pattern get the ruds back in if you get dirty needle on calling goal you need to know that the goal isnt in it is kicking because there is missed withhold connected with it goals and items can be held in and made to look like goals and items by suppressions invalidations and missed withholds if you are good at it you can tell whether pc has missed withhold or an invalidation by the needle pattern you can and should correct the needle pattern to keep the pcs ruds in so that you can do routine 3 needle patterns vary from little buzzt patterns not just tick to larger patterns it is rare to find one on goal or item but it causes trouble if it is there so clean up the missed withhold inval reads with tick the dirty needle has given routine 3 more trouble than anything else there is tr for testing for clean needle described in an hcob of recent date it asks if something is free ie clean on the needle and then repeats the same action this applies to all auditing you go out by the same door you came in in other words when leaving an item you must check it for cleanness by using exactly the same phrase you originally used when starting to run the item if you ask has this goal been invalidated dont leave it with are there any more invalidations on this goal that is different question and you dont know if the first one cleared so this applies to all metered questions and if you are checking something tell the pc that that is what you are doing the best ptp process is the responsibility process what part of that problem could you be responsible for possibly 241 q and with the pc ranges from doing what the pc says to worrying about what the pc was worried about q and tempters could be done as drill to teach the student to just clear his original question holding up against pc suggestions is also an anti q and drill holding constant against adversity is learning to

shspec146 auditing errors there are two types of auditing activity in which you engage 1 rudiments type of activity you are trying to straighten something out right now not to dig something up done against the needle 2 auditing activity done against the tone arm long wide sweeps of the needle may count as ta motion here you are trying to dig something up you have to get good at sliding from one type of activity to the other say the pc suddenly declares that the list is complete you have to shift fast to middle ruds and check for missed withholds there are also negative middle ruds eg in this session have you tried not to withhold anything or in this session have you tried not to invalidate anything suppress anything etc there are two reasons why your pc keeps picking up more and more missed withholds one is that you have missed withhold and the other is that the pc is strenuously and attentively keeping his ruds in running the session and being very careful not to withhold etc it doesnt matter what you use as middle rudiment it could be an endtype rud halftruths untruths etc or whatever seems to be needed to keep the body of the session going the faster you get the rud in the better you are not looking for more than clean needle even if it only stays clean for ten seconds if you want rudiment to stay in you get your session ruds in and use the body of the session to prepcheck particular rudiment so it will stay cleaned up you can drive yourself and the pc nuts by not acknowledging everything the pc says in answer to your questions even if what the pc says doesnt actually answer up you have to be clever in prepchecking to probe around and actually help the pc to find out things he didnt know about it is possible that there will be chain and that the overt will blow after he tells it to you when you are doing rudiments dont go into process to handle an outrud until you have given it several chances to blow by inspection if you do run process get in and out fast treat it as lightly as possible the best ruds process is the one that gets the ruds in fastest time spent on ruds is time robbed from the session so dont get started handling ruds if you can avoid it just dust them off pcs will obligingly get rid of things that you dont seem to think are very important when you are in the body of prepcheck you want to give some importance to the overts you are searching for by apparently taking responsibility for the pcs overts just to the degree of being very interested and thorough about getting them you throw an element of responsibility into the session and the pc will come up with more data 242 l ron hubbard type 3 idate17562 volnum1 issue147 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec147 prepchecking 6205c17 shspec147 prepchecking rudiment is that which is used to get the pc in shape to be audited in that session the body of prepcheck session has the purpose of letting the pc live in that lifetime you are after duration so you have to have thoroughness rudiment has to be clean but not permanent the processes you are using are insufficiently fundamental to do permanent job end rudiments are simply to get the pc back to the world of the living and smoothly out of that session middle ruds are even more evanescent in the body of prepcheck session we are going to do something that will change the pcs attitude towards living and improve his ability to confront life in this lifetime so we will do anything we can to straighten out some point that is askew in his attitude what is an overt all things are contained in the concept of interiorization into and exteriorization from there is beingness in this universe that is bad there is also none that is absolutely good but there is badness and goodness about beingnesses and that is an individuals ability to interiorize into or be something or exteriorize out of and not be something when an individual longer has power of choice over that fact he can be considered to be aberrated on that point there are vias by which you enter certain beingness steps of becoming that beingness there can be degrees of freedom of choice about entering or leaving something for instance there is difference between the position of career officer and the drafted private or slave war and slavery reduce power of choice that is what people object to in them not the blood and gore after all one really campaigns against highway deaths which are greater than the total world war i toll not to mention racing deaths you can almost evaluate practices and beingnesses relative to peoples power of choice over being them or not being them where an individual has high degree of freedom we find fairly highscale activity there is another activity going on reactively beneath this cycle of beingness notbeingness beingness see fig 9 the pc has decided to be something then for some reason he has found that he cant unbe this thing easily so he uses mechanism of committing overts against this thing in order to cease to be it he commits these overts and withholds himself from this beingness on repetitive cycle and his overts will get worse and worse and his effort not to be it will become more and more violent until he stretches out to maximum distance after reaching that point he will still commit overts against it but every new overt and withhold will bring him closer to becoming the thing again this is grim so he has beingness tries to postulate himself out of it and for some reason it doesnt work then he will commit overts against that beingness and that type of beingness he will think he is really separating himself from it to midpoint after which every overt and withhold brings him closer to totally enforced beingness which is complete overwhelm now he doesnt even think he has ever tried to unbe it all knowingness on the subject of unbeing it vanishes as well he becomes it on an inversion that is what is the matter with overts and that is what thetan is trying to do with overts he is trying to unbe 242a figure 9 the cycle of enforced beingness 1 an individual assumes beingness 2 he doesnt want to be it any more 3 he tries to postulate himself out of it 4 he fails to postulate himself out of it 5 he tries to unbe it by committing overts 6 he withholds himself from it 7 he alternates overting and withholding escalating up to point of maximum separation 8 continued overts and withholds bring him closer to the beingness again 9 he goes into total overwhelm and becomes the beingness enforcedly on an inversion 10 all knowingness on the subject of unbeing it vanishes he doesnt even think that he has ever tried to unbe it 243 this cycle takes place on all dynamics on the second dynamic it is very apparent overts and the feeling of being unable to get out are very apparent in this area similarly on the third dynamic one can try to individuate from group to the point where one is being group and damning all individuals as in communism which results from an overwhelm by the group back down the track somebody has been god one day he decides to stop being it commits overts becomes it enforcedly and then one day you will find that it is terminal spiritualists are obsessively being spirits however the spirits they are being are other than themselves so in handling ow with prepchecking you are working with the mechanisms that bring about routine 3 bank remember that if the individual is being any one of the items you get in routine 3 he was it then wanted not to be it and couldnt unbe it and started using the ow mechanism to separate himself from it and ended up getting into it obsessively because that cycle takes place in this lifetime note that the pc has certain beingness and connections with all dynamics the item you are trying to handle is his current identity if you held the pc to this lifetime in the prepcheck you might well recover material that would otherwise be lost to this identity going backtrack in prepchecking would just be handling free track in other identities this might be better handled with routine 3 most of the chains can be deadended in this lifetime though not all this lifetime is not pure identity it is colored by beingnesses he has had in the past in order to straighten out this lifetime you must be pretty good and you cant be superficial you will get nowhere taking nothing but the pcs criticism of someone since criticism is just the last shadow the total defeat he can longer be this thing he can only criticize if he is so unhappy being it what did he do to it to make it such an unhappy thing to be getting overts is the mechanical statement what your goal is is to find out how he joe doakes made mary lou such miserable person to be because obviously he was being mary lou in this lifetime he has been every one of the eight dynamics in this lifetime to some degree he will discuss them all with you if you unplowed him from the one he was trying most obsessively not to be he would be free to be it and it would blow off in smoke you would have returned to the individual his power of choice of beingness hence the pts rundown question who would you really hate to be if you can return to the individual his power of choice of beingness you will get tremendous resurgence on the case you could go at it this crudely who havent you liked recently you get reading terminal you are trying to solve how did you make _______ horrible thing to be another way to put it is what have you done to _______ it must be chain because you have to get to the first part of the cycle as you run this his opinion of the terminal will change he will stop being unwilling to be it and there is now sector of existence from which he is not retreating so his reachingness into it is improved his doingness in that sector can occur because his beingness of that sector has been reoriented you cant reach into or affect any area from which you are retreating also person will not do anything that certain beingness can do when the person cannot be that beingness 244 so you could find the thislifetime person who could do the things that the pc wishes he could do run off his overts on that person and at the least the pcs worry about not being able to do those things will cease perhaps he will now even be able to do the thing ie you could ask what do you wish you could have done who could do that then run ow or you could ask who couldnt walk who couldnt go anyplace who was terrific runner who went everywhere etc aunt chrysalis was crippled the pc wanted to kill her he gets into being aunt chrysalis prepchecking will at least improve the pcs condition even though his whole track needs to be straightened out you do need to get actual overts not thinks about what he would like to do or wanted to do that only tells you that he has been wanting not to be whoever the thoughts are about thinking about something is an harmonic of wishing someone who tells you that he has had unkind thoughts about his father is just telling you he wishes he werent his father getting off these unkind thoughts is not therapeutic to spring him out of his enforced beingness you must break up the system that got him there you must get at the ows that he has been using in order not to be his father criticism wish not to be disagreement disagreement is what the meter reads on if one is willing to be something that thing wont read on meter what the pc is trying hardest not to be is what he has done the most to also the identities he is totally overwhelmed by wont read you will get change as long as you take his thoughts and alreadyknowns and criticisms that is what he has been telling everybody for years with change the pc has to cease to fight being it

withholds 6205c22 shspec151 missed withholds q and is really q an some of the forms of q and are 1 double questioning auditor questions the pcs answer 2 changing because the pc changes you are questioning the fact that he is changing 3 following the pcs instructions that is q an of hubbard you are questioning his answers by assuming that the pc knows more about his case than you the auditor do the auditor must stay at cause over the session and put the pc at cause over his case if the auditor doesnt make the pc confront the pc will obey his bank which says dont confront full cycle of action must exist with an auditing command this puts tremendous responsibility on the auditor to ask the right question so there can be two mistakes 1 wrong auditing question like what should we run on you today or have you had motivator lately 2 failure to let an auditing cycle complete itself you can get in trouble by asking have i missed withhold on you because the pc can give motivator response this throws endruds out the first endrudiment question is have you told any halftruth untruth or said something only to impress or tried to damage anyone in this session see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised which puts the pc out of session then you have to question the pcs answer to handle 245 the situation so dont ask an ambiguous question ask the type of question that makes q and very unlikely perfect question is one that produces an answer that doesnt have to be questioned since if you question his answer he will feel unacknowledged he will feel he cant talk to you and will go out of session even do you have an arc break is imperfect since if he says yes the non q and response is only an acknowledgement not what is it an auditor who changes when the pc changes is demonstrating so much impatience to produce an immediate effect that he will never give anything chance to get completed he lacks confidence in the usual working often because he is unaware of what the usual is he will easily go off into extraordinary solutions because he lacks confidence in the ordinary solutions because he has never done it sometimes auditors q and because the pc gets nasty and furious and they back out the commonest form of q and however is failure to acknowledge the pcs answer because one is questioning it this can cause pc to react furiously or eventually to go into apathy as an extreme response to being made to feel that he is having withholds missed before this point there is twilight zone of semioutof sessionness where all the rest of the ruds keep flying out as result of occasional nonacknowledgement or wrong questions if you ask an auditing question like do you have ptp and get an inadequate answer you can meter check it if it still reads dont just keep asking the same question ask something that will be answerable without producing q and when pc drifts out of session he is drifting on his feeling that he is unable to communicate with the auditor the way to throw him out permanently is to punish him for getting off withholds and to make him feel that he will never be able to communicate his withholds to the auditor the auditor doesnt have to be sweet and nice he does have to get his auditing questions answered permitting the pc to answer something else also throws endruds out and makes the pc feel the auditor didnt hear him since he knows really when he is really answered you must ask question that can be answered and get that question answered if you do that smoothly pcs will do almost anything for you when you see session running off the rails dont look at the pc as peculiar ape and dont develop good communistic selfcriticism just look at the questions you are asking in session ask yourself if they are answerable by the pc and if you are accepting the pcs answers if you are doing these things right it must be the pcs environment that is caving him in l ron hubbard type 2 idate23562 volnum0 issue6 rev0 rdate000 addition0

the emeter we had breakdown in 1961 where everybody was misreading meters now it is happening again see pp1456 for discussion of observing the needle auditors are ignoring reads on ruds questions and auditing over outruds they are not seeing instant reads for some reason the ford foundation was founded the same day as the hubbard research foundation and for the same purpose to find out about life however their idea of scientific research is looking on via through symbols in contrast when lrh observed the generally crummy appearance of students few weeks ago he looked for the reason without presuming what he would find this is good way to do research he found out that if ruds were out there would be ta so he had old prepchecks cleaned see p 229 above people thought the meter wasnt reacting because the auditors tr1 was out however that was not the reason auditors just failed to see reactions that were there if with modern processes the pc isnt looking better and doing better someone isnt reading the meter an auditor can get into not reading the meter by invalidating the meter this comes about because he has been audited by someone who missed reads on him which caused him to lose confidence in the meter he feels it should have read on and it didnt read this is lie and hangs up like any other lie if it had read the auditor would have seen it so the meter doesnt work so i wont pay attention to it when im auditing this neednt happen lot meters get invalidated the inval of the missed read gets suppressed it hangs up and builds whole chain you clean it up by prepchecking has any auditor failed to find meter read on you that you thought should have reacted that gets the unknowns out of it it has unknowns in it because it occurred in midsession when the pcs attention was on something else the mechanism of enchantment is similar to this it could work something like this at time when thetans could mock up their own bodies one thetan could put in command phrase on another thetan in the middle of subjecting him to severe secondary or engram the command phrase could be you are now deer and the enchantee would cease to mock up the prince or whatever he was mocking up and mock up deer and he would be an enchanted deer so you lay in an inval of the meter at time when the pcs attention is on his withholds or something he gets further withhold on top of it thereafter he distrusts meters and cant read them it would take more than that motivator however it would take some overt that is actually motivator also the pc is at the auditors mercy being out of pt etc you have to audit in way that doesnt impede the pc from going clear you avoid restimulation of the gpm until the pc is ready to go clear and you can then blow the gpm to bits auditing roughly can create inadvertent implants 247 incomprehensible people are people who wouldnt want your goal see p 259 the individuals goal line is important things that cross against his goal to get clear are all auditing errors smooth auditing is designed not to bat his goal back not to impede him making him think the meter doesnt work is very upsetting to him even if analytically he is relieved not to have been found out of course once the pc is utterly arc broken the meter doesnt read so the auditor can get to the point where he doesnt see or believe the reads that he gets you can get random reads on the words in the question or on some stray thought but if you recheck it it drops out or at least doesnt appear in the same place an instant read is instant it is not contained in the body of the question those are prior reads the lag in an instant read is essentially nonexistent the auditor is actually talking to thought in the bank auditors often mistakenly think the pc can analytically influence the meter but he cant the pc cant even influence the meter on via as an instant read he can do it by thinking of something that he knows there is unknownness about but in this case the read will be latent since there is time in the reactive mind only nowness you get instant reads from the reactive mind furthermore the pc doesnt know what produced the instant read at least he doesnt know all about it or it wouldnt read reading item contains unknowns the reactive mind is cauldron of unknowns that always exist in now consistency of needle action is determined by consistency of unknown and its immediacy in pt so use the questions in hcob 23may62 very important emeter reads prepchecking how meters get invalidated this contains questions about invalidation of meter reads both from the point of being an auditor and from the point of view of being pc to clean up meter inval it is important to get this straightened out for the sake of pcs if you see the pcs instant embarrassment it is as good as an instant meter read you do have to observe however and it is tough to get people to to this note lrh first mentions routine 3ga at the end of this tape routine 3dxx is mentioned in the confidential tape 6204c26 shspec139 rundown on routine 3 routine 3dxx routine 3g is mentioned in 6205c01 shspec141 routine 3g this is routine 3 employing goals it is possible

useful data or important data get lost among the rest data are not all equal 248 most scientists are defending cult ask them for data and they will obfuscate the data and overwhelm you with mass of unweighted data machinegunned out with amplification another way to obscure things is to evaluate the reader and put in lots of footnotes referring to obscure sources etc this is typically

plowed up enough with 3gaxx you find goal then find goal that would oppose it then do another assessment for goals that would not oppose it then assess for goals that would want that goal you get four goals that all tick alike then you list all four and you would theoretically get the four items which are actually two items in the same way as in 3gaxx i cant say what the life expectancy for this process is it is probably longer than 3ga in answer to the question since we dont have modifier now how do you keep gpm keyed in if it should key out and you get free needle actually the modifier is only the label on one of the items that you are listing on that listing you are still fighting the same package as in routine 3d by listing each one of those lines you keep it pulled in as much as you would anyway you might have more trouble keeping things stirred up for the second goal but by then the pc should be able to approach the gpm more closely so there should be trouble stabilization is just going on and on getting more goals and more fourlists until you couldnt get the meter to read if you hit the guy over the head with club you are not likely to find the guy flying off in keyout because every time you find goal you will wrap your paws around every element of it that was part of the gpm stabilization is getting rid of any masses the clear might run into which would get him reinvolved with the bank formerly before stabilization he could have gotten enturbulated again but by doing 3ga again and again you will get to where there is gpm to key in it is so intricate to keep the gpm there at all in the first place as you get rid of more packages you get rid of things that could cause the person to go unclear again something else can be done with the person drill him into the reacquisition of skills that is not doing anything to clear it is going into ot which is the recovery of skills of the thetan clearing is just getting the bricks off the track not the recovery of skills it looks to the thetan as if he will get his head knocked off if he does certain things what really knocks his head off is his inability to reach sustainability which is inherent in his bank not in the physical universe as long as he has aberrations he will key himself in by indulging in such exercises if there is nothing to key in he wont get keyed in 249 prepchecking is the best setup procedure assuming very competent auditor problems intensive see hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion and p 134 above note that as used at the time of this tape prepchecking was used in place of sec checking in the problems intensive is like junior grade prepcheck but it can be done by notveryskilled auditor with skilled auditor prepchecking and cchs are by far the best difficult though it is to teach auditors to prepcheck well ive been experimenting the past many weeks trying to work out some repetitive process which could be used at lower levels to get some benefit there is lot of value to it doubt this involves threeway bracket what have you suppressed what has another suppressed what have others suppressed same phrasing with invalidated same with failed to reveal same with been careful of youve got these buttons and you could run them back and forth and undoubtedly get somewhere in 37 12 hours you could get as far with this as i could in one hour of prepchecking the problems intensive using the changes list getting the biggest selfdetermined change finding the chronic ptp and so on gives you way to do something for the pc particularly if you are not very skilled at prepchecking but if you are it is to some degree waste of time there are pcs who dont respond to much else besides prepchecking the changes list prior confusion people in it prepcheck them route is very interesting to the pc and gives wins but otherwise it is an excursion it is also useful for teaching the auditor to assess because you get everybody the pc knew prior to the time of the change this means that the auditor learns to list the importance of havingness is that if the pcs havingness goes down he will have odd reactions you check look around the room and tell if you can have anything if it reads turn down the sensitivity and get can squeeze havingness being down brings masses in on the body and the pc will get reads with small body motions as when he looks around and moves even his eyes the pc is bundle of piano wire with masses packed in against the body with low havingness these masses are likely to start talking circuits turn on the reason missed withhold reads with double tick is that the person is pulling back against himself pulling masses against the body the same as when havingness is down extreme nohavingness results in getting needle action when the pc moves his ear watch it in routine 3 especially you dont want to do goals assessing on lowhavingness pc when you find the right havingness process the drop on the second squeeze after few commands should be third to half dial drop l ron hubbard type 3 idate29562 volnum1 issue153 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec153 security check prepchecking 6205c29 shspec153 security check prepchecking the material of this lecture is summarized in hcob 10may62 prepchecking and sec checking details on prepchecking procedure when prepchecking ruds you are talking to the person about those things which are very pertinent to the subject of auditing these we have to have in if the pc is living life of secrecy we will find that ruds will go out even after having been put in broadly with prepchecking there is possibly something so wrong with the pc that joburg same as form 3 see p 239 above 250 is needed to clean him up cases that go mad actually have number of missed withholds it is the missedness that makes them go mad their reach into an area is very difficult their departure from an area is difficult and the number of crimes they have under their hats is incredible their ruds go out as fast as you can get them in because there is tremendous weight of unknownness on the case the more closely the crimes are related to injuring scientology the less you will be able to get ruds in do recognize that if you cant keep the pcs ruds in the pc has overts matter how innocent he may seem people who invalidate emeters and have hell of time in session are having hell of time in life just because of their overts the easy way to get it off is to take some broad pervasive thing like joburg which has every crime known to man or beast on it using the joburg you will clip some corner of what they have been doing the pc would be damaged if the withholds were known so he doesnt give them up easily when one gets too many overts and withholds that are too damaging to oneself one wants to get the hell out the extremity of blowing from missed withholds is dying if you are auditing such case expecting that his overts will be of the magnitude of picking flowers in someone elses garden you will let them go ahead and croak out of kindness such pc has short attention span like if they are sick etc so the auditor has to be fairly quick he must parallel what the mind is doing find where the person doesnt want to go back to and what the people there dont know about the person what he is hiding etc since the pat list doesnt go straight to the area where the pc has his attention it has the liability of boring the pc to death before you get to his particular crime or item you must do it well and positively to minimize his dispersal of attention so handle things swiftly when you are cleaning up the relatively uncharged questions the ones that clean up with one incident good speed would be ten to twelve chains really prepchecked well per hour plus twelve or so null questions that speed keeps up the pcs interest fairly precise patter is being developed you need to word question so it keeps getting hot read and you need to get the question itself answered not some motivator version if you take motivator you will often find yourself spending long time and going nowhere just throwing endruds out eg halftruths untruths damaging others etc see p 244 above like mad when you realize you have done this go back and check it dont go on pursuing the wrong course canned lists scrape up areas that pcs are trying to avoid done well you can now prepcheck rudiments so that they will stay in and you can go on to routine 3 in checking up on past prepchecks look over only the what questions not the form in toto or the zero questions the process of prepchecking increases the persons responsibility so form 3 questions may now be alive that werent when it was done before the what questions that have really been nulled wont come alive again if you find one of these alive you are justified in chewing out the auditor the ones that are null will be stably gained 251 l ron hubbard type 2 idate30562 volnum0 issue1 rev0 rdate000

in the thought impulse system this is the idea that the auditors thought impulse is instantly and wordlessly transmitted to the pc so the meter reads then that is not the way you should be reading meter lrh has been doing research to see how vital how valuable ruds process is and how deep it will go if it is run as repetitive process we find that it is like trying to empty the ocean with small spoon that which is kicked into view by routine 3 is not kicked out of view by any repetitive process it is odd that this tremendous bulldozer 3ga wont run forward at all in the absence of these gnats flying at the back of it the answer to this puzzle is that the rudiments apply to present time and this universe now even if you get rud in on pc really solidly these rudiments processes are incapable of even dusting the gpm they will do only microscopic keyout if someone has gpm keyed in any repetitive rudiments process will do virtually nothing to it prepchecking can do keyout you can move it around with cchs but there are tremendous difficulties in assaulting gpms there is very effective process for cleaning up past auditing except for routine 3 auditing what didnt you know what didnt another know what didnt others know it is very lovely and effective it will sometimes do things for very arc breaky session but against lockedin gpm it has influence though it may look as though it is doing something repetitive rudiments processes can do things with the free track and whole track engrams that are not in gpms there is another good process multiple bracket on suppress what have you suppressed what has another suppressed in you what have you suppressed in another what have others suppressed in you what have you suppressed in others what has another suppressed in others when you start to run it you think it will clean up the whole track youd think it couldnt help cleaning up the whole track it makes you feel so horrible you could use invalidate in the same way and fail to reveal dont know same thing careful of could be very interesting but none of these processes is worthwhile as means of cleaning up the whole case this is because they are all thought manifestations figurefigure buttons what the pc has buried is the fact that his postulatingness is basically thinkingness it is on lower scale think is below effort on the know to mystery scale it is not postulatingness which is at the top of the scale none of these 252 buttons will carry him through effort they just keep swatting him on the nose routine 3 processes are what it takes to get the pc above the effort band the pc is doing his figurefigure in the middle of the gpm masses he is getting his thinking dictated to him from circuits he is getting the word from circuit to circuit b from all kinds of conflicting and oppositional identities as you audit him you have to keep him from being alarmed and defensive about present time otherwise he is not up to confronting the effort and the masses he has large number of automatic thinks going these are all characterized under the existing beginning middle and end rudiments these buttons keep him so involved with thinkthink that he cant go upscale to get him to go upscale you need routine 3 processing this works by labelling and identifying masses which brings about differentiation among masses and gets the pc up to confronting masses your effort is not to get him to confront those masses it is to get the conflict of those masses identified and resolved any way you wish to do so it is actually pretty easy to do once you know what you are doing you can unhinge the almostimpossible balance of the gpm so that it can longer hang up and create itself out of the pcs energy the identification and labelling of the mass is the borderline between the thinkthink and the mass it lets the pc become aware of the mass whereupon it blows it is trick for thetan to confront the mass it is what mass to confront that is important when the pc confronts the anatomy of the gpm it disintegrates the way to get the pc into the gpm is with goals assessment see p 236 above on the theory on running goals in routine 3 the goal that the pc gets identifies the mass he is sitting in and when the pc gets it looked at it disintegrates goals assessment thus helps you identify which part of the gpm the pc is in it identifies the thinkthink that is going on and the principal mass that he has to get out of when you start listing down the gpm items all the pressures and electronics that hold the item in place start lifting so he cant stay there anymore he is not aware that he is in the item or being it he thinks he has to keep this one game because it is the only game he can play pcs are reluctant to get rid of mass because they feel that that is the only game around but the pc is really either not playing that game or having fun playing it when he gets his attention unfixated from that particular game he sees that there are other games around and he can start enjoying life he thinks he is in games condition but he is actually in nogames condition the only way you can boost the pc through the effort band is to permit the pc to have his full attention on the objects that you are trying to haul him out of if his attention is distracted by things in present time he has that much less attention free for addressing the task of going upscale through the know to mystery scale he feels that he doesnt have enough attention units to look at anything he is distracted by the thinkthink because masses with influential ideas are impinging on him rudiments processes have herding nonimpeding action the relationship of rudiments to routine 3 process is like that of hedge beside road it keeps the pc guided and heading forward outruds are like stones on the road ruds processes do not move the pc along the road they can retard the pc from going on if done wrong or if very badly done they can actually reverse progress 253 with rudiments you collect all the pcs power of blowing things by straightening up his attitudes towards the auditor and the environment pc whose ruds go out gets recoil phenomenon if he looks at gpm then gets his attention jerked off he gets mass straight in the teeth the pcs attention acts as pressor beam it had part of his bank in focus and when his attention swept sideways it is suddenly as though you took the pole out of the hand of pole vaulter when he was half way up to the bar keeping ruds in includes not yanking the pc out of session this process of getting hit by something causes dispersal which causes the pcs ability to differentiate to lessen tremendously he confuses things and his anchor points are driven in the lower toned he is the less focussed he is or can be anyway and the more easily his ruds will go out even if he suppresses the outrud when an auditor has successfully put the pcs ruds in several times the pc will stay in session easily because of his confidence in the auditor he will learn that his attention can be properly directed by the auditor and that the auditor wont get him into trouble but dont get too cocky at this point the level of pc confidence adequate to prepchecking is probably not adequate to routine 3 because the stress in routine 3 is so great that the ruds have to be in much better and stay in well if the pc gets much auditing with rudiments out he gets more and more nervous so matter how little you expect from the session you should always get the pcs rudiments in in this way you will gain the pcs confidence that you can get his rudiments in and that he will at least get that degree of gain anyhow it is the auditor not the state of the case that makes the pc hard or easy to audit the first edge in may be difficult especially if there has been bad auditing that has made the pc nervous as time goes on however the tough pc whom you cant do anything with because he cant blow anything will improve as you gently and persistently get his ruds in shortsession him if necessary run something really easy so he has wins just get the ruds in little by little session by session as he stops being anxious about his ruds being in his needle will get cleaner clean needle should show up by the end of his second session you give him wins matter on what the first two times you get ruds in on pc you shouldnt expect the pc to respond well to rudiments check by the third time if the auditor got the ruds in thoroughly in all three sessions in the third the needle will be cleaner if that has not happened the auditor did not get ruds in in the earlier sessions the third rudiments check would be valid the fourth and fifth are still more valid rudiments are absolutely vital even though they wont move the gpm at all strangely enough the gpm also will not move at all without them l ron hubbard type 3 idate31562 volnum1 issue155 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec155 middle rudiments 6205c31 shspec155 middle rudiments the middle rudiment consists of package question that handles suppressions invalidations missed withholds and careful of middle ruds may also contain the halftruth untruth impress and damage end rud see p 244 the question or command end rud and the influence the meter end rud have you failed to answer any question or command i have given you in 254 this session have you deliberately tried to influence the emeter see hcob 21dec61 model session script revised to expand the middle ruds further you could run in the auditor and the room the former less advisedly and the latter only if there was lot of disturbance in the environment if you need more you would do better to shortsession the pc with endruds break then beginning ruds it is sometimes more economical to start new session than to patch up the one you are running ordinarily in prepchecking and routine 3 only one package middle ruds question would be mandatory you always do middle ruds in prepchecking and routine 3 you should use time or subjectlimiter is there anything you have suppressed invalidated failed to reveal or been careful of the first blank could be in this session on goals on listing or even in auditing when it gets outside the framework of one session it becomes the equivalent of prepcheck and must be regarded as such in this case it is best to take on the subject of goals is there anything you have suppressed as zero question and prepcheck it if you did this before starting routine 3 the pc would come up shining if you do one of these as prepcheck zero question do all four they obey all the rules of prepchecking you get the overts you should realize that the overt is often against self the chain may only go to last year ok so it goes very rapidly the buttons you are using are good strong think buttons prepcheck buttons are the basic think buttons of the thetan the above section on middle rudiments is of interest as part of the ontogenesis of modern prepchecking the first term used was prepclearing which was intended as euphemism for sec checking when sec checking was used as an auditing action intended to be preparatory to clearing see p 184 the term prepchecking replaced prepclearing for general usage after short space of time see p 186 prepchecking was here defined as way to get each rudiment in fairly permanently so it wouldnt be likely to go out during 3dxx at this time the withhold system was used for prepchecking later p 194 lrh made distinction its prepcheck and the whole activity is prepclearing in may of 1962 lrh suggests the possibility of repetitive prepcheck process using some of the midruds buttons p 249 the middle ruds buttons also began to be prepchecked as standard thing p 251 repetitive prepchecking came in officially in july 1962 as an application of repetitive rudiments technology to prepchecking see hcob 3jul62 repetitive prepchecking while any zero question could be used for this type of prepcheck prepchecking of middle rudiments modern prepcheck buttons was emphasized use of the withhold system was soon cancelled because it was too hard to teach p 278 modern prepchecking was essentially present by the end of july 1962pp 291293 except that more buttons were added to the midrud buttons the final list of prepcheck buttons was brought out in hcob 14aug64 scientology two prepcheck buttons 255 middle rudiments have use in prepchecking you can use them to get rudiments in when you use them as rudiments run prepchecking like any rud where you acknowledge and check on the meter assuming that the pc has answered the question you may have to get the pc to repeat it if you didnt understand take the onus on yourself by saying i didnt get that this is part of tr4 dont ever be fake if the pc has heavy accent you will do better to ask for repeat on every answer than to fake understanding which leaves you with missed withholds on the pc this applies particularly to these middle rudiments since the pc has to have answered the auditing question the other use of middle rudiments is prepchecking them as zero question the question have you ever suppressed anything is zero question not middle rud use middle ruds with great thoroughness but with great discretion not just willynilly dont distract the pc with them when he is thoroughly into something else you can ask the four middle ruds as package in this session is there anything you have suppressed invalidated failed to reveal or been careful of watching each one if one falls stop there and get the rud in when that is done dont repeat what is clean or what has been cleaned just go on the general rule in routine 3 is to put in middle ruds when shifting doingnesses this is more frequent than the use in prepchecking so it should be done short sweet speedy and expertly though carefully you cant afford to drag or fumble on it dont insist on getting the pcs overts shortsession if necessary dont distract the pc with middle rudiments when listing for the goal you can use middle rudiments when the pc looks confounded and stops listing when he really gets boggy they should not be used every time the pc stops to think if it is hard to get the middle ruds to go or to stay in in the next session use the middle ruds to prepcheck listing the middle ruds play against themselves that is fail to reveal careful of and suppress can mean the same thing to the pc or they can at least be similar eg the pc who is being careful to reveal everything is really failing to reveal something so with the middle ruds you get several cracks at the same thing where did careful of come from it came straight from psychoanalysis because all psychoanalytic patients end up being very careful we dont want that in scientology and it is an embracive attitude or action it isnt really suppression or help it is just common denominator the end product of all aberration is being very careful this goes hand in glove with lrhs recent research into the overtmotivator sequence the more people consider doingness dangerous the less they do that is direct index to aberration the level of inactivity is measure of the degree of aberration the more sane activity the less aberration careful fits right in there what the pc gives you in ruds is seldom what you should run in the body of the session since if the pc knew what was wrong it wouldnt be wrong so dont run bodyofthesessiontype processes on things that come up in rudiments as rule the pc knows too much about it 256 you can go astray in prepchecking by taking up some outrud unless it is ptp of long duration of course it must react frequently they dont never correct anything that isnt out if you cant get something in and it is still reacting and you are going to leave it tell the pc dont make profession out of one middle rudiment be honest if it is still live and you are leaving it tell the pc dust off ruds lightly dont make whole session out of ruds l ron hubbard type 3 idate12662 volnum1 issue161 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec161 middle rudiments 6206c12 shspec161 middle rudiments when you ask second question or double question pc you are omitting tr2 and q and aing gorgeously tr2 is an auditor weak point an adequate acknowledgement is worth great deal do you have ptp i had fight with my wife what about this is q and in trying not to q and one can err by not getting the auditing question answered it is not q and is comm lag that exists until the pc answers the auditing question this requires that the auditor hear what the pc said so tr2 should include understanding and acknowledging auditors create more arc breaks by failing to understand but pretending to the auditor now has missed withhold just put the onus on the auditor for failing to understand and get the pc to repeat it on tr10 point out something the auditor should know what the pc is pointing at and may need to ask it is fins for him to do so all rudiments must contain an answer to the question asked if they do the auditor must just understand and acknowledge that is all that happens only when it is manifestly impossible to clean it up with repetitive single questions does the auditor resort to ruds process the rudiments are now good enough so that if the pc gets the auditors question and answers it and the meter is cleaned on that exact question and the auditors trs are any good then you dont need any rudiments process in using repetitive rudiment you ask the question acknowledge the pcs answer and check the meter if not clean repeat the question until after cycle of pc answer acknowledgement and meter check the meter is clean this actually acts as process in itself dont wait around for the pc to find eg ptp if the meter is clean when you ask for it if it is null just acknowledge and go on you are actually thereby giving the pc his answer or you are giving him the answer the meter gave the last question is thus answered by the auditor for the pc this completes the communication cycle just repeating phrase to the pc will deintensify it in the bank if it is equivocal because of dirty needle or poor metering check it again let the pc know what you are doing and why do this enough so that the pc isnt left wondering in the dark always keen the pcs r in tell him what is going on pc who is screaming is less arc broken than one who wont talk to you you should put in middle ruds when the pc is having trouble listing more goals give the package question slowly enough so that you can stop and clean whatever reads then go back to listing goals you should attack mid ruds so as to spend minimal time on them so every time listing slows down zip through them every fifth session or so they have enough outofsession nonsense going to benefit from some prepchecking suppose the pc gets resistive in session where you did get beginning ruds in go ahead on middle ruds and prepcheck using middle ruds for zero questions this will pick up things like inval of goals 257 as subject or listing as subject that is the commonest thing that causes the pc to stop listing on pc who is on the verge of telling you what to do all the time critical pc who is continually suppressing suggestions about your auditing you can use she buttons suggest and fail to suggest these fit in well with prepcheck in middle ruds you are only interested in the immediate session to keep the needle clean and readable and to keep the pc in session when doing your fourline list on the goal do midruds between lines in prepchecking you put in middle ruds after each what question is null then recheck the what question this is fancier way to ask for missed withholds so dont also ask for them if she pc is down on havingness consistently you could do middle ruds then havingness then recheck the what question use midruds when the pc has slowed down shut up run into problems etc middle rudiments make an excellent communication bridge you can put anything in with the middle ruds following it if you are prepchecking against prepared sec check list and you get five or six questions cleaning up with only the zero question do the middle ruds in case he is suppressing something if the middle ruds were found to be out you go back and do what you were doing over again except in listing the use of middle rudiments can be extended to specific subject object or activity if you are checking out goal for instance you can put in midruds on that goal keep it fairly specific or you will be getting into prepcheck you could probably put in every other rudiment with the midruds for instance say the pc gives the same ptp twice and it still reads on beginning ruds you could put in midruds on that problem naming it in the commands lrh doesnt advise this but it could be done sometimes you add halftruths etc from end ruds but if you really have to do this it is smarter to end off and restart the session if the pc needs this short sessioning is better anyway you can also do end ruds on prepchecks where they are useful to pick up overts and withholds if you cant get midruds in you can try prepchecking them pc who has somewhat dirty needle and has to have midruds done often will benefit from midruds prepcheck if that doesnt do the job the pc should probably have more cchs and general prepchecks lrh has become expert in fish and fumble ig the pcs needle was dirtying up and not getting cleaner after ruds he would start the session with fish and fumble to clean up the needle before doing anything else he would say after beginning ruds i want you to carefully consider your auditing nothing happens now carefully consider your wife lots of reads now clean it up tracing down only one pattern at time the double tick should be handled first because it is missed withhold it takes bright auditor to clean it well it is necessary to ask something that will keep the read or just to pursue the read one started with or to formulate what question you can really clean it up so the needle doesnt get dirty again the way bad auditing could dirty it up again is for the auditors tr2 to be so bad that everything the pc says is automatically an inadvertent missed withhold fish and fumble procedure is also given as tr in hcob 14jun62 class iic trs 258 one of the virtues of fish and fumble is that it is fast way of cleaning up the needle though it could be overused it is usually necessary only two or three times the vital read to clean up first is the double tick the missed withhold it is pretty easy using fish and fumble just to clean it up fish and fumble make it possible to do goals assessment which otherwise would be virtually impossible it does require the auditor to be inventive in figuring nut what overt might be connected to the read that the pc is telling you about you need to get the pattern of the mind which is that if there is something the pc is reading on he has either done something to or with it if you are doing prepchecking fish and fumble gives you wideopen chance to clean up the needle fish and fumble cleans up the needle so that you can prepcheck and is barbaric cousin to the prepcheck l ron hubbard type 3 idate14662

himself straight into the mechanics of 3ga the arc break that results from such an action on the part of the pc is the sort on which the bank is built and may be too heavy to be handled by ruds that is the button that makes 3ga what it is it is based on the mechanics of taking full responsibility in limited way for one purpose there is pandeterminism here the person dedicates himself to the goal of the gpm as prime postulate doing anything else is devt for the pc this sets up situation where everything else is an otherness is departure from all pandeterminism the pc has had it since any other action is an alterisness of the basic purpose doing anything else is breakdown of his own very isolated determinism this is how the pc backs out of the physical universe thereby running into it again with thud thus other occurrences besides those which fulfil the goal are not asised they are alterised and mass gathers around them you should realize that it is missed withhold that louses up the session what if the pc took responsibility for never getting any withholds off he could make such postulate you would then have an arc break that rudiments could undo maybe even process couldnt undo it since it goes straight to the heart of the gpm and keys in all those basic purposes by this action the pc has keyed in the highest button in the bank withholding not that pcs are responsible for withholds but they are responsible for action of one kind or another so when the pc takes responsibility for the highest button in the bank wow if you try to run pc on what withholdingness have you taken responsibility for he would get more somatics than he knew existed because you are trying to run the gpm out from the topside down it is not clear at this time what you could do with this situation this is under investigation at this time so the final question on withholds in model session is under test lrh is trying to find something that could undo the possibility of the pcs having postulated that he wasnt going to tell you anything or talk to you in that session here he has found button in excess of all other buttons 3ga was designed to handle this button with ease but not to handle the above situation probably the reason for an occluded childhood is having taken full responsibility for not communicating eg ill never tell you anything again im mad at you 259 the likelihood of the pcs making such postulate and hanging up the session as part of the gpm is remote if you are following the textbook solution dont let untrained auditors attempt listing or 3ga the only danger in listing is for some untrained unskilled auditor to try to run 3ga they can get pc into more trouble than you can easily get him put of 3ga solves 3ga if you run 3ga wrong you can make it right with more 3ga it is peculiarity of problems in this universe and in the mind that prime solution runs out its own errors that is the test of prime solution you make an error with this solution and it corrects the error so therefore it is not cure 3ga is the first thing that is not cure cure does something about prior problem 3ga operates on the prime postulate it wouldnt even register as goal if it werent prime postulate on some section of track so it isnt solving anything but it puts the person in situation where he doesnt have to be solved very tricky the trouble with finding wrong goal is that listing it will beef up the bank worse than any creative process ever run you are running an alteris and you will get an alteris mass is an alteris so the longer you run the wrong goal the more mental mass you are going to get if you suggest goal to the pc the misownership of it will seize it up in the gpm and cause it thereafter to read it will be reading on misownership like everything else in the gpm if you list it the mass will increase and increase and the pc will feel worse and worse at this point lrh mocks up world mental health organization which would inspect hospitals etc it would subscribe to the international congress of ethics in healing and it would require doctors to give an account of their facilities results technology credentials etc the right to inspect gives the right to command it is the first step in taking control l ron hubbard type 3 idate14662 volnum1 issue157 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec157 listing 6206c14 shspec157 listing in 3ga you can form up the wording for an ordinary goal quite easily for instance if the goal is to catch catfish you would use ___ ___ 1 want to catch catfish 2 not want who or what would ___ 3 oppose catching catfish 4 not oppose note that we had to change the wording of the goal to fit in the oppose and not oppose lines if there is any doubt about the acceptability of changing the wording of the goal just put the words the goal after want etc this has to be done frequently with negative goal in order to avoid an awkward double negative this procedure is still imperfect but there is way to get it perfect see p 285 for an amendment on the wording the goal is prime postulate that has accumulated onto itself number of identities by which the purpose could be executed the goal or the pc in taking on this goal as prime postulate has assumed these identities because there were people who didnt want the goal who were stupid and incomprehensible see p 247 so one had to prove to them that the goal was ok there were other people who desperately opposed this goal there were bunch more who were somehow associated with it if you cant express these four flows on your listings the process wont go clean 260 to change wording in midflight can be quite upsetting to the pc so after you have done the prepcheck and the goal is reading beautifully be sure of that wording it should register be certain that it is the wording for the four flows for that goal this is not to say that you will never change the wording of listing sometimes you have to when you find that the line never has listed you will probably list on low sensitivity to get reads on the tone arm easily every fifth session prepcheck she whole subject of goals listing and auditing newly just as in goals assessment and run middle ruds every time you stop running list whether they are needed or not there is period of action for each list that decreases the length of time list is active before you leave it becomes progressively shorter ta action will be good then it will get slow do midruds then go to the next list establish pattern we cant tell where this prime postulate the goal will sit on the pcs crack or what gpm cycle this thing precedes we dont know that so we dont know how much bank we are relieving in running this goal but normally half an hour of listing on list seems overly long when starting off on muckedup pc you would probably only be able to do one list per session to get all the ta out this procedure is not necessarily recommended since it is unbalancing and impractical so you had better do the listing by count of stems or by minutes at first however if you stop pc in the middle of an automaticity he gets suppression so allowing for automaticities you should more or less list an arbitrary number of items for each list listing say fifteen minutes for each list none of those lists will be exhausted by doing it this way if the pc gets into an automaticity for heavens sakes dont stop him in his tracks because he will do suppress if pc is listing rapidly and freely let him go on listing none of these automaticities will go for more than 150 items more or less on listing it is very bad form to 1 tell the pc to wait while you write down an item 2 fail to write down an item either one is crime you pays your money and you takes your chance learn to write faster than is about all you can do pcs can be encouraged to common lag but this is not advised either your four lists should be kept to approximately equal lengths one may tend to be shorter eg not oppose if this happens list the short one as extensively as possible and list the others as briefly as you can in the first part of listing you list by arbitrary number it doesnt matter too much what the number is since there is so much mass to get into however later on you will find yourself running into free needle and it is crime to continue to list line on which free needle has appeared because you are running process that is not producing change when you get the fn you test the next line if it doesnt disturb the fn test the next line and so on when you have all four flows fning that goal is dead go find the next goal if line does stop the fn list it to fn or for awhile until you see that it is not going to fn then go on to the next line this evens out all the charge so that at the end all the lists will be equal not in length but in amount of charge blown 261 i must caution you against the sins of overlisting listing flat process is an auditors code break see the auditors code of 1954 13 always continue process as long as it produces change and longer this is in the creation of human ability p 3 it will upset the pc but that is not why you shouldnt do it the goal you are operating with on this pc is not the prime postulate by which he entered this universe it is only the beginning of some cycles that you have laid your paws on by goals assessment it has some harmonic against an earlier goal so if you overlist you push the pc back into an earlier gpm or pull up earlier track out of place so just list the lines to fn not beyond fn it is relief to talk to you about what you do with free needle toward the end you will find the time so short on each list that putting midruds in every time you change lists is too frequent so do it after the pc has listed ten to fifteen items however many lists that may be the only reason pc stops listing is that he has some middle rudiment out this is true for both goals listing and lines listing pc can accumulate enough charge between sessions that the middle ruds have to be prepchecked to clean it all up never get the idea that the pc can run out of items pcs dont think of items they deal them off the bank if he had more items to deal off he would have more gpm so the pc stops listing only when the midruds are out and he therefore cant get into communication what do you do when you have brought one goal four lists to fn in earlier days you would have called him clear you could still call him clear and get his fn back with little cleanup of ruds any time watch your acknowledgements in listing writing the item down is acknowledging you can also go mhm and make little encouraging noises dont give fullstop ack that ends cycle and acts as an inval an auditor listing can feel so much like secretary with all that inflow that he loses control of the session so when you have stopped listing give good acknowledgement and do brisk middle ruds looking like proper auditor in listing you must look like an auditor during ruds because you look so little like an auditor the rest of the time then when the midruds are clean you go back to listing with good auditing command it is the last command you will give until you stop listing that list it is an awfully long auditing answer the pc lists for two pages then you go mhm any more you repeat the question gently who or what makes for plurality of answers the pc doesnt lose the command if he runs down you can give the command again to get more if he simply refuses to go on get middle ruds in also get them in at the end of the list give the pc the rfactor that you are going to do midruds before we go on with this list get them clean and get more items an item is very delicate it is easy to squash one or to glum one up it is also tempting to fake understanding an item but if you do it enters missed withhold into the session which will blow up right then when you didnt understand something admit it i didnt get that tr2 says you understand if you dont falsity enters in which will destroy the session 262 do good admin on lists keep parity you will notice when an actual goal is listed out that an item will transfer from list to list when an item has been in all four lists that is just about the way is is the item has been or all four flows when all four flows are discharged the item is fully discharged against other items and lies null after listing is complete find new goal the list will be shorter the time to find it is less you get dwindling quantity of everything eventually you will wind up with theta clear it is my guess youll find type of goal you find in the basics of scientology these things will suddenly register is there one basic goal for all pcs oh yes but they cant reach it and its not real you want the goal that registers now not the perfect goal theyll get back earlier and earlier on the track and eventually hit the prime postulate clear is as stable as you cant find prior prime postulate as the gpm is listed the repetition of the items gets the discharge off the prime postulate that you call goal the definition of goal is basic postulate for which the individual has taken full responsibility as the bricks the items built up on the postulate tend not to resist the postulate anymore the postulate runs out you get the thing diminishing and getting thinner the pc is now sitting there with all the experience accumulated along the line and none of the mass because there is alteris connected with it l ron hubbard type 3 idate19662 volnum1 issue159 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec159

summarized in hcob 23jun62 model session revised this model session will make auditing much smoother it is remarkable in that it doesnt need any extra processes except for the pcs havingness the rudiments here are repetitive processes asked only as long as you get an instant read hcob 25may62 emeter instant reads defines instant read and should be known it is really instant on the end of the last letter of the last word of the question item or command 263 if any read seems equivocal you should check it out it isnt true that the pc knowing the question will react before you have said it all you are not auditing knowing being you are auditing notime reactive bank the bank waits for the entire command and then reacts instantly if the read occurs on br and not on k when you are asking for an arc break it is prior read and you ignore it it is the read that starts on k that you want this is not hard its easy so be sure you use the meter properly the results are marvellous that way sad to say ruds done with prior and latent reads will mess up the pc only ask question twice or more if it had an instant read if there is instant read on the question ask it only once it is of great benefit to have repetitivecommand model session it doesnt change process on the pc all the time so you clean up what you ask for not some variation and there is variation in what you do you ask question get an answer check it on the meter etc it is very easy to do once you find that it works it is so easy that people dont do it at first they do something else which is hard everyone has to some degree the desire to demonstrate that they are an expert because what they are doing is difficult the real experts fool you they make it look effortless and easy when you start auditing on simple coaudit you may find that it is perfectly easy then you will go all the way around the dial to get back to that ease one becames all thumbs over the horrible unknownness of it all once one has gotten into it so the simplicity of this model session is fooler you enter in with the idea that there must be something else to do and with all the alterises wide open the expert has flattened the alteris impulse the amateur goes along fine up to the moment where the pc says something unclear there he gets confused and doesnt know the next time he comes to this point he alters he is nervous about discussing someones problems anyway so he alters and q and as if he gets into habit of doing this he gets results and thinks tech doesnt work but he has never tried it the first discussion of model session was in 1958 when millie galusha and lrh took the things auditors tended to say and made pattern made the session constant then the reason for doing this was recognized the consistency of pattern ran out old sessions at saint hill it became the earmark of professionallooking auditor the rfactor on auditing came up enormously using model session now all the questions in model session can be extended to become repetitive questions if necessary to handle the charge this use of repetitive processes to get ruds in makes model session even more valuable new pcs lack r model session being consistent puts in r this increases the pcs trust he is not being startled the auditor will thus be more real and solid to the pc you have established expectancy in the pc you have also put in arc using model session without departure will get interesting results all by itself if you put someone into session ran only model session and took him nut every day for three days running the pc would start talking about my auditor all by itself model session also has the power to smooth out the pcs needle this is even more true when it is combined with prepchecking and havingness new pc tends to look like someone who is swimming 264 two or three feet out of the water they slip in gradually they dont know what to expect or what will be demanded of them once they find out they will be relieved you could run any set of harmless questions three days running and the pcs reality on session and arc with the auditor would be much greater dont expect any one question in model session to straighten out the pc it is not onebutton proposition dont expect to clean up dirty needle on pc with missed withhold handling or with any one particular action it is done with smooth auditing not part of auditing the needle cleans up gradually as the pc goes through session after session every now and then you will be thrown off because one pc in hundred will react with big change you tend to get stuck in that win and then you keep expecting to find the magic button what really happened was that you had been gradually improving the case before you hit that point freud had luck and then got hung up in the win clear is not made with 3ga alone it is good auditing plus 3ga that produces clear neither part alone to that degree model session is part of clearing by keeping the session predictable and present time clean enough to be audited in thus you get an undistracted pc asking the pc is it all right for to audit you violates the rule of not putting the pcs attention on the auditor so it is not good to ask the are you willing to talk to about your difficulties is ok because it gets him to look at his case and talk to the auditor so it gets him into session in middle ruds you have fourquestion package you look for an instant read on each part if you get read on one the repeated question is the single rud question for instance if invalidated reads you ask what was it get the pcs response ack then recheck invalidated when it is clean go on to check the rest of the four parts in singles if you like to keep him from getting confused the body of the session is where middle ruds are used end rudiments have had some additions the multiple halftruth question is handled the same as midruds on the emeter question one asks how not what was it on question or command drop the one that didnt read on critical you clear it with done on room run havingness if it reads or if havingness is down as indicated by can squeeze havingness began as way to bring joe winter back

meter 2 not knowing model session script 3 asking question second time when it was clean the first time dont alteris the cleanness of the needle you can put an instant read on meter by reading clean question twice it is reading on protest 4 not checking again after you have had the question read 5 not saying that you couldnt tell what the read was when you couldnt never pretend on meter read 6

answer period professional auditor is harder to put into session than raw meat pc he knows more and is more critical not in bad sense actually the raw meat pc is just as critical but he wont say so if professional auditor is almost impossible to get into session he has been audited with ruds out professional can be audited to outofsessionness faster than anyone else because he knows when something is being done wrong you can pick up and fish out pc cognitions by tone of voice or some irrelevant remark by the pc which is an appreciation of something it is not vital to do this in fact you probably shouldnt even do it it can boomerang an irrelevant remark would be when the pc is sailing along and you suddenly say wow that needle fell half dial this distracts the pc but if you can appreciate what thy pc is doing he feels more acknowledged its tr2 trick if the pc starts crying and you go in with hard boiled or crisp nononsense tone of voice the pc feels unacknowledged he needs to have certain feeling that the auditor is with him this is why you will sometimes hear lrh sounding bit sympathetic your voice should reflect some comprehension of the mood of the pc so that he will feel that you are with him dont fail to respond to what the pc is doing hut dont let the pc put you at effect either there is fine line between the two when in doubt keep it simple and by the book people have trouble with tr4 because they dont understand what the pc is saying lrh is perfectly willing to be at the effect of the pc to the degree of properly acknowledging the pc but further thus when you acknowledge the pc by responding to him he knows that he is having an effect on you and he will stop trying to produce an effect you can make mistake on this you can intend to show agreement and the pc can take it as derogatory if he is so inclined simple acknowledgement avoids this situation it is just when you know your tools and know what is happening so well that now an top of it you are free to be appreciative if the pc should get upset and start blathering entheta lrh would tend to ignore it he would not even tr4 it he would just give the next command the above degree of relaxation only extends to tr2 not to entering chitchat into the session to the degree that you dont use 2wc in model session you will succeed better 2wc slows down the progress of the session when used in model session or any part of ruds if the pc is all jumped up at the beginning of session you could instead of letting the session handle it say what has gotten into you as part of your rfactor that way you would get him talking to you at least then start the session and put some order into his confusion some pcs waste session time with conversation you need to establish control with good solid acknowledgement pcs will try to take session control away from you on ruds question if the pc says and the meter says yes you should acknowledge the meter where the pc and meter disagree forget the pc and trust the meter dont worry about this making the pc wrong because hell hes wrong anyhow there 266 is trick in this you are not contradicting him when you say that reads just pay attention to the pcs yes or in ruds only answer the meter and you will never give the pc the feeling that you are countering what he has just said if pc were to ask lrh have you run cchs on the instructors too he would say thank you for asking we will now go into end ruds get them in give the pc break and do beginning rudiments this would be terrible symptom of outofsessionness the pc is not interested in his own case if the pc gives you an irrelevant question acknowledge it and handle it but realize that it shows something is out midruds at least so get him in session if he is in session and asks question it is generally fine to answer it if you did something wrong never think that you will lose session control by admitting it you actually only lose control by demanding to be right it is not unusual for the pcs havingness to be up at session start but down by the end of session though this doesnt always happen this is symptom of rough auditing unconfidence arc breaks and low havingness are interchangeable havingness goes down in the presence of arc breaks when havingness is up arc breaks disappear if the auditing is at all rough you will get dwindling of havingness confidence in the auditor is proportional to smoothness of the auditing you want to be predictable to the pc early in pcs auditing he tends to be more critical of his auditor than he will be later this is symptomatic of nervous pc who has been roughly handled in life and earlier auditing as your pc continues to be wellhandled in auditing this factor drops out and the pcs havingness will stay up also as the auditor improves his skill the pcs havingness will stay up the auditors tone of voice is not important it is irrelevant remarks that matter you can make remark without saying anything for instance you may have surprised tone at seeing clean needle that is bad thing to do it all comes under the heading of putting the pcs attention on the auditor instead of on his bank sounding robotic will do the same thing sudden yank of the pcs attention off the bank onto the auditor environment or meter will cause those masses that the pc has been holding away from him to hit him in the face you will have devil of time digging him out you can yank the pcs attention by getting the pc absorbed in question 1 and then before he answers asking him question no2 it is an irrelevant action you should neither inform the pc about the meter when he doesnt want to be so informed nor withhold information when he wants the information the question will come up do you ever use middle rudiments while doing beginning or end rudiments there are situations where it might happen but if the auditor has the pc well under control it shouldnt have to come up it is great relief to pc who has had q and prone auditors to get an auditor who just smoothly carries on when he the pc arc breaks and screams and spatters he finds that he can trust the auditor to audit him predictability alone will hold someone in session regardless of what other actions you take on the other hand any unusual solution you adopt makes auditing seem unpredictable and becomes curse to you predictability breeds pc confidence 267 and relaxation and it makes him able to go into session when you add the powerful buttons of the beginning middle and end ruds you can really get somewhere strive for predictability the more nervous they are the more dispersed they are the more predictable and steady you should be l ron hubbard type 3 idate26662 volnum1 issue164 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec164 emeter quality 6206c26 shspec164 emeter quality some of the data in this tape is contained in hcob 28jun62 dirty needles how to smooth out needles the whole crux of auditing today is the sensitivity of the emeter and the ability of the operator to read one there is recent bulletin on how to clean up needle see above reference needles can get rough and active clean needle reacts when the auditor speaks and does nothing the rest of the time there is gradient running from occasional ticks and tocks on up clean needle reads right it gives instant reads not prior reads needle that is twitchy gives prior reads because the pc is as it were segmentalized mentally next there is needle that is reacting continuously enough that one of its actions coincides with your instant read and you get reads that are equivocal because the needle is so active that you cant read it the most extreme dirty needle is in such constant and continuous motion that you could never get an instant read on it because it has blank spot for the end of the sentence to go into fortunately you can smooth out this kind of needle with havingness see p 249 for more data an the effect of havingness on reads this is fortunate because you cant use the needle to find anything wrong and fix it the path of thought transmission is from the thought in one person th the recorded symbol to relay in someone elses mind to the thought again that is why you can find goal in english which was originally expressed in phoenician the thought is there prior to the symbol by which it is transmitted the dirtiest needle would be the one from the bank that registered the least thought and generated the most thought autogenerated reactive thought you are watching circuit go zip and zap the auditor has impingement on this bank the restimulations that the mind is getting are often in this case from the external environment at all this person is totally introverted and is just autogenerating restimulation circuits are making each other think of things the pc thinks of cat then circuit thinks of another cat and another circuit then thinks of tiger then another one thinks of tank cars which leads to milk he has had sufficient restimulation in the past to last for trillenia he is wholly on the backtrack and the physical universe doesnt even exist there is worse one yet the stage four needle this is the same restimulation going on all the time the stage four needle is like rotating neon light it wont react even to the auditor kicking the pc in the shine there isnt even crossrestimulation there is also reverse stage four needle that goes down stick swoop up these stage four needles represent fixed condition one thought there is another condition the stuck needle which doesnt move or react this could be stage four needle stuck in ridge as though the neon sign got stuck while rotating with high sensitivity you will get some read out of this pc 268 any needle that doesnt clean isnt all right the reason you are running cchs havingness prepchecking rudiments and so forth is to get clean needle if youve got clean needle why bother doing it clean needle reads when you say so it may rise and fall bit as the pc breathes but thats all if you have that you can go ahead with your goals assessment there is reason not to what is the best operation to clean needle lrh has cleaned some up with fish and fumble hitting the middle of circuits etc but the best method is to put the pc into state of confidence this is done with predictability of sessions in most cases it is mistake to try to sort nut all the needle actions particularly on needle that is continually agitated how can you fix that one up it is the case that most needs 3ga which however you cant run on it person with dirty needle has had his purpose shifted too many times he has lots of conflicts cchs run very gently would help you must be minimally random and maximally predictable excessive randomness is the main mistake of psychiatry the more drastic the case the more drastic the measures they use what insane people need is utter predictability and randomity at all just motionless objects and quiet space the crazier the person is the more predictable is the handling get quiet attendants spread people out so that they can ignore each other have some motionless figures around that will be there tomorrow allow mail or phones get some boulders food rest and predictability are the keynote you have business auditing someone who is really nutty they are bundle of alteris give them chance for the confusion to blow off and they will be ok it is not true that an index to insanity is constantly moving needle as an auditor you can create dirty needle in anyone just by not getting ruds clean being unpredictable in session forgetting things leaving them out and changing frequently without completing cycles but the pc wouldnt be driven insane and some insane people would have perfectly clean needles you could sit them down find their goal and audit them on out to clear this is true because insanity is specialized condition it is the sensation of trying to reach and not being able to you can turn on this sensation in someone by saying get the idea that you must reach but you cant reach and that you must withdraw but you cant withdraw if he gets these ideas he will feel stark raving mad for fraction of second insanity is more of sensation than anything else total unpredictability produces almost the same effect running havingness tends to keyout circuits although not invariably predictability also does this so if the auditor ran smooth gentle series of cchs circuits would key out and the pcs needle would clean up if this doesnt happen either you are not being predictable or this person needs to confide in you and you need prepchecking the highscale companion to cchs or he needs rudiments and havingness if you have audited the pc for four to five sessions and his needle is getting dirtier you have been auditing on too high gradient of unpredictability if you are running cchs and prepchecking you will have to undercut it by dropping back to model session cchs and havingness with complicated actions on the cchs the dirtier the needle the simpler you need to get decide to get simpler after about three sessions your concentration should be in the direction of clean needle 269 if the needle is getting dirtier as you audit the pc suspect the meter first assuming that you are reading it right and doing perfect model session and ruds evidently the meter isnt getting the rudiments in maybe the leads are disconnected or the battery may be down or the meter may be broken this is the test say to the pc do you have ptp you see the meter is clean ask the pc if he wanted to say anything about that if he has generally got something to add the fact is that your meter doesnt go as far south as you have to go to get rudiments in auditing with rudiments out is the only thing that will dirty up needle after session where the rudiments are actually but unobservably out the pc feels as roughed up as violin being used for canoe paddle and after session where the rudiments were thoroughly in the pc feels sleek as cat who has been fed fish if your meter never detects anything reactive on pc it isnt sensitive enough this can happen when the pc is near clear also when there is not enough reactivity left to show on the meter at this point also you have to ask the pc if there is anything else oddly enough you will still get reads adequate for goals if you run pc with rudiments only partially in the pc will wind up rough if you run session with rudiments thoroughly in the pc winds up very smooth the needle gets dirty because circuits are pulled in circuits are pulled in because the pc is way back on the track and low on havingness you get the pc out of circuits and up to pt by running extroversion processes and bringing his havingness up the worse you audit the pc the lower his havingness will be and the more you will get circuits keyed in and the dirtier the needle will get l ron hubbard type 3 idate26662 volnum1 issue165 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec165 prepchecking 6206c26 shspec165 prepchecking prepchecking is based on fundamental of dianetics which is that related incidents form chains on the time track the time track is consecutive occurrences in time recorded in pictures which classify themselves in chains picture persists because of the violation of purpose involved in the incidents where the pc intended one thing and got something else alteris is violation of purpose eg going out to hang someone and being hung or going out to kill the mayor and electing him pictures are held in place by this violation of purpose when you run out the basic purpose intention the pictures will fold up cf expanded dianetics the pictures hang up in the mind classified in chains each of which has basic and basicbasic the basicbasic is the first time on the track you did or experienced or decided that kind of thing but you can have basic on each chain in each lifetime there is basic picture on chain there is basic purpose on chain which the chain violates and that is what hangs the up you need that data for 3ga but nor for prepchecking all you need to know to prepcheck is that there is time track with classified chairs on it the chain will free when you find the basic on it it doesnt have to be basicbasic recent thislifetime experience is all you need if you go back to basic purposes you will get into 3ga before you are ready the basic is generally in childhood this life occasionally it is in 270 prenatals or even past life charge can remain on the chain when the basic is longer unknown this is why the what question will be null if you have gotten all the way back zero questions will come live as his responsibility rises prepchecking consists of locating chains of sufficient charge to aberrate the conduct of the individual then it provides system that knocks out the basic on the chain the withhold system see pp 186 and 237 above the charge is there in pt because of the pcs misassociation of the past with pt this is misidentification all this is in dmsmh so is 3ga as the basic purpose of the individual dmsmh p 238 and science of survival book ii p303 even at the age of two or three years an individual seems to know what his basic purpose is in life later this becomes corrupted by individual and social aberrations but is recovered in dianetic processing possibly past lives have something to do with forming basic purpose originally we ran the withhold system on the incident closest to pt after finding reading zero question the zero questions are found in sec cheeks of which there are many if you get two reads on zero question you had better prepcheck it there is danger in being too fundamental in doing prepchecks for instance if you got zero question by doing dynamic assessment you may run into the gpm which you dont want when you get an incident that is an answer to the zero question and the read is still there after the pc tells you about it you formulate what question by dibbling and dabbling around until you find one that reads the same as the zero question this is the weakest part of the prepcheck system when the what question has been found it is now time to let the pc get it all off using encouraging halfacks until he runs down then send him earlier you know the earliest is something he cant just spot easily so you dont ask for that you ask for earlier until he is as early as he can go without much assistance or using the meter the pc uses earliest the auditor uses earlier the earliest incident the pc can recall is the barrier to earlier memory there is always barrier incident here is where the auditor starts using the withhold system when he has done it couple of times he has blasted the track open more so he can find an earlier incident then you use the withhold system on that one to get out all the unknowns then test the what question on the meter if it still reads go earlier again keep using the withhold system to open up track finally the what question will be flat so you get middle rudiments in then recheck the what question the crimes one is looking for need not be sordid or highly reprehensible ones though people who have been psychoanalyzed often try to come up with spectacular believing that that is what is needed to clear it if your pc does this be sure to add the end rudiments question about halftruths etc to your middle ruds auditors are prone to the virgin complex the auditor wishes to think that he is the first one the pc has told things to so he may go for the really sordid stuff that he pc wouldnt have told anybody else 271 if you go at this without prepared list like sec check the pc will surely give you the least aberrated chain which is the most known to them if cleaned up this chain will produce the least case change the pc will give you this chain because it is safe one pcs like security this is why lists of arbitrary questions are more productive of case gain than more general prepchecking you can also use the rudiments as zero questions along with finding goals or auditing or whatever he does lot eg his job as long as he doesnt tell you that that is what is wrong with him if it is as advertised it aint the balance and the delicacy of auditing is getting the pc to talk to you about things that he doesnt know he should talk to you about and preventing him from rambling on about things that wont advance the session without letting him see how he is being steered naturally he will tend to bounce off things that are aberrative they are there because he hasnt asised them which he has avoided doing because he doesnt want to confront them you have to let him discover that he is confronting something auditing in this manner will make you look clever to the pc as if you knew just where he was heading you do because you are traveling on series of fundamentals you are only trying to pull up basic on chain of incidents than were wrong conduct on pcs part he knows they are wrong conduct so he has them buried you dont want to make him guilty you only want to clean up the chain every now and then you will hit something that is real pay dirt for instance when the pc has occluded the top of chain the rest of the chain will be really hot it is symptomatic of charged chain that the incidents are out of sequence all mixed up as the pc straightens it out the time factor unscrambles as you go earlier you find that the incident he thought was earlier is really later these incidents are mainly locks they are all overts clearing person with prepchecking is not possible however hundred hours of it would go long way if you go on prepchecking forever you will get more bank appearing because you are not on the pcs goal line prepchecking will make for more sanity than any psychoanalytic system ever developed the earliest version of this was straightwire and spotting someone who had an aberration or difficulty similar to the pcs that was fabulous when it worked which wasnt always l ron hubbard type 3 idate28662 volnum1 issue166 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec166 rudiments 6206c28 shspec166 rudiments part of the data on this tape is contained in hcob 2jul62 repetitive rudiments how to get the rudiments in here is why you have difficulty with rudiments when you do let us consider an emeter on totally arc broken pc it wont read the gradient on this is the more arc broken the pc is the less the meter reads it should go by the opposite gradient the more the arc break the greater the needle response but it doesnt the fact is the more the rudiment is out the less the needle responds in session you often find the second third and fourth ruds out when checked later this is because when you dont get rud in the later ruds dont read well auditor can blunder 272 by not checking what he is trying to put right after getting something answered for instance say you are putting havingness in in beginning ruds you run the pc on some havingness then skip checking the question tell if it is all right to audit in this room on the meter the omission of that step throws the remainder of your rudiments out you would be amazed at how many answers the pc has that he never has chance to give you all of which become missed withholds he only stops giving you answers after you have made flub on metering rudiments there might be several ways to get ruds in the current one is to ask get the pcs response and test it on the meter if it is clean leave it this works fine as long as you never miss if the pc is bit arc broken and you dont get response you say it is clean and from then on you have had it that is the frailty of that system there is another system ask the ruds question indicate that reads what was that the pc answers check the question if it is clean ask the pc do you agree that that is clean that gets you off the hook somewhat another system is the one that used to be used in sec checking ask the pc the question until the pc runs out of answers then check the meter if there is read get what it is recheck if it reads say there is another read here this is the correct phrasing while it still reads will make the pc wrong and arc break him this system prevents missed withholds from developing because it gets the pc talking to the auditor about his case you get more fundamental read that way but you will have to steer the pc because what you have got is unknown to the pc you are plumbing the bank the disadvantage of this system is that some auditors cant leave the middle rudiments alone they spend all their time on them in goals session you should be getting middle ruds in only when everything goes null and you are getting reads of any kind on any goals you wont go over several goals without getting read unless the middle ruds are out dont try to cure nosituations if the pc says something while you are nulling the goals list just use tr4 be sure you acknowledge him or you will have to put in middle ruds because he will feel you missed withhold you expect the goal to read at least once on your threetime repetition get middle ruds in when you get consecutive xs on listing you put in middle ruds when the pc runs out of items you do it when you change from one list to the next also but the important time to put in midruds is when one of the fourlists is shorter than the others and the pc runs down you use midruds as booster in listing or nulling and to test flatness of what question in prepchecking in you overuse them you will drive the pc out of session because it is noauditing situation so using the sec check system to put middle ruds in can overdo the amount of time spent on midruds but this system will get out the unknown rud that is the real killer watch out for the pc who says also dont get caught up in repetitively asking ruds questions against the meter three times maybe but if they are that hot the pc can find the answers this system does get the pc into session if not used senselessly and at length in the middle of goals listing 273 the best time to use this system in prepcheck session is on beginning ruds to be sure everything is grooved in there is problem there lrh cant say there is one perfect system there are number of types of pcs but all pcs agree that auditing is scarce and that it must take place and be effective so any system that wastes auditing time or seems to will rut ruds out so ordinarily in prepcheck system get beginning ruds in really well using the sec check system but polish off middle and end ruds routine three is not as interesting to the pc as prepchecking though it is important the pc is anxious during nulling more than interested so dont use the sec check repetitive ruds system on routine three the pc is impatient he hears the padlock rattle if you have to use an extraordinary system to get ruds in the pc is too nervy for routine three anyway the system is just too timeconsuming for any pc in the middle of routine 3 he should already be in shape to stay in session when you put him on routine 3 anyway dont give ruds that much importance suppose your pc always has latent answers after you have found the rud clean in this case you can say we have the significant withholds off of that or that is clean of important answers or at least we have the reactive answers off it you want to indicate that there is needle response not necessarily that the pc may have more answers however you dont want the pc to carry on after it is clean nor to invalidate his having thought of something the pc can get whole theory worked out on how some thoughts arent important and some are reactive etc etc if you are going to make an evaluative statement at least make it an accurate one l ron hubbard type 3

nice clean free needle is at mockery level where the needle appears clean but the case is really nowhere this case will rise up into trouble even if starting pc wasnt at mockery level you would still want to run some model session and havingness sessions before going into 3ga so that he would get an idea of what auditing was the anxiety factor will otherwise get in the way you could run ruds and havingness then give him prepcheck session even if it were only grooved in the direction of goals then you could go on to his goals list just be sure it is not the dead thetan case which will blow up in your face if you do 3ga somebody invented method for doing cchs where they started asking did you notice that physical change all the time it got to be quite method it is an evaluation the whole point of cchs is to get the guy to look if he looks he will exteriorize from that particular somatic this is deft delicate action the auditor is undertaking not sledgehammer procedure or rote activity pcs will put the process on automatic and go out of session running like woundup doll unless you stay in 2wc with them in cchs the auditor is only interested in physical originations on the part of the pc because cchs are physical not mental processes you count on the fact that he has originated something at that point if you can bring him to observe as live being he will get better and better 274 but if you tell him he has got to observe he wont he will feel bludgeoned and criticized the old drill that you use is fishing cognition this is called training 13 see hcob 11jun57 training and cch processes pp1617 if you dont succeed ok you didnt succeed an auditor in his desire to make somebody well often pushes the pcs teeth down his throat he gets anxious to have beneficial effect and starts pressing when he does this he drives the pc out of session by adding note of urgency or impatience this puts the pcs attention on the auditor what if the pc is responding to someone elses voice and the meter is responding to hearing another session in progress in this case the beginning ruds must be out your pc is not in session with you if he reads on word mentioned by someone else in the vicinity to handle it you have to get the pc in session this is best done by ending that session taking short break and restarting making sure you get the ruds in poor insessionness used to show up as superlight overts gotten off on sec checks like i thought of stealing paper clip that is symptomatic of confidence wobbly model session and ruds not gotten in but session started over outruds you have to learn to be so smooth and so predictable that the pc would never think of doing anything else but respond to you and read on your meter when you call pcs attention to physical origination by asking whats happening and the pc says oh nothing you should just acknowledge and go on then the next time you have him in prepcheck session you get off suppression you can remedy this situation the pc is giving you social response he may feel that you are critical and so is making nothing of his reaction one approach is to vary the question eg one could ask how are you doing instead compulsive outflow in itself is not dangerous unless it runs the pcs havingness way down you want to use tr4 since not all his answer is relevant you have probably slipped up earlier by not acknowledging when he did answer in the early part of the outflow you now have to use tr4 get in understand acknowledge and return him to the session good method of handling that is to say when did that occur to you in this session he answers you acknowledge and you go back to the process when pc is properly acknowledged he has found out that he has reached you and he will stop talking so if you pick his hand up and put it on your shoulder as he runs on he will shut up he has reached you you are not trying to reach the pc you are trying to convince the pc that he has reached you you could probably stop war if you could convince the enemy that he has reached you war is saying you cant reach us but we are gonna reach you all war propaganda says this which only tends to just keep things going if the pc answers the auditing question and you acknowledge and the pc goes further than that you should consider that the pc has originated if the pc is originating he has an anxiety about reaching you so all you have to do is to cure the anxiety and there you are 275 there is havingness process based on this principle that you can use with cchs it is quite simple repetitive touch my noncharged body part every now and then the auditor will get love turning on in the pc you have to run this out since you want to get rid of its misemotional connotations you would run this early in auditing and once per session it is good way to handle malefemale anxiety you could use this process for when cchs go roughly some auditors have pcs going out of session when running cchs this is mark of rough auditing nice easy cch run wouldnt need any rudiments but if rudiments do go out in cchs you are up creek because ruds violate the physicalprocess idea of cchs so this cchhavingness process would be way of handling this situation it would supplant all the anxiety about doing model session while doing cchs it is way of getting the pc to find the auditor this is an arc havingness process any other havingness would be risky it might not be the pcs havingness process dont waste time in auditing there is particular amount of courtesy in the reactive mind when i do auditing i do the essentials and not more than the essentials i get the job done you do want the pc in state where he will read on the meter my pcs dont have time to have ruds go out the time to put in midruds is when the goals stop reading at all on nulling say you call them each three times and nothing reads that is when to rut in midruds if you make the pc wrong for talking by putting midruds in you are misusing midruds and driving him out of session you are making him lose interest and arc breaking him then the meter wont read well the current test of completeness of list in listing goals is ta action on listing the tone arm has certain tendency to drift if the pc were to sit there with his hands on the cans and nothing else going on in an hour the ta would drift say from 275 to 30 lots of ta motion is 75 divisions in 20 minutes little ta motion is 25 divisions in 20 minutes none normal drift if nothing were happening l ron hubbard type 3 idate10762 volnum1 issue168 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec168 repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking part i 6207c10 shspec168 repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking part i see hcob 2jul62 repetitive rudiments and hcob 3ju162 repetitive prepchecking relating to this tape and the next we are back to basics today in auditing the forerunners of practically everything done today can be found in dmsmh and dianetics the original thesis see p 270 above suddenly also we are back to repetitive processes which auditors have always had success with except for the question of whether the process is flat in the 17th acc lrh had just lectured on comm lags the next day he asked how you could tell whether the process was flat one could answer the difficulty is solved with this method of using repetitive questions they are flat at precise point ones troubles can come only from not reading the meter or not believing it either will bring about an upset pc model session repetitive per hcob 4jul62 bulletin changes significant change is havingness or the room rudiment being dropped from beginning rudiments although retained in end ruds see also hcob 23jun62 model session revised has all ruds 276 except havingness as auditing questions to be handled repetitively you would think that slugging the pc with this many processes in one session would be catastrophic it is if done poorly if you overrun by one question the pc is in the soup likewise if you ask one question too few you get missed withholds so either never ask for ow or do it right you cant avoid the fact of missing withholds matter what you try you can miss withhold just by walking in the room so you cant just not ask questions and if you ask question you must ask exactly the right number of questions some cases one in twelve even think you should know everything they are thinking in these cases any question you ask shows that you didnt know so you miss the withhold see hcob 12jul62 motivatorish cases this is the theetieweetie case the way someone got in that state was too much pretended knowingness on the part of others plus overts against questions if this type of person exists or if many people get into this state and they do and if man keeps being active while being secretive which he will then it is inevitable that you will miss withholds an people so you must learn to run ow and repetitive processes perfectly not just fairly well it is rather easy to do repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking perfectly the only problem is that with some cases you have to add to another to the done question otherwise the pc will give motivatorish answers which spins him in and the question will never clear auditing is as successful as it is predictable to the pc auditors get spoiled by howling success following an unusual solution this includes lrh such success can hang an auditor up and get him stuck in the win the more we learn about the mind the fewer unusual solutions we need and the more textbook the solutions become this is measure of an auditors understanding of what he is doing if he wins with an unusual solution it wont give consistent wins as time goes by he may get so many loses that he ultimately stops auditing the closer we get to clearing the fewer unusual solutions we look for to clear everybody you have to know how everybodys mind works weve got that at this point we only need to modify the tech to make the result easier for all auditors to get two things monitor our tech 1 the results 2 the ease with which auditors can be trained up to where they can obtain the results the ease of application of the processes the problems are these pc is built like universe there is pride postulate on top of which mass accumulated human being is determined to be such merely by having human body doll has the same kind of bank as human the pcs bank is not native to the corporeal self he is packing around as an identification card incidentally doll bodies rot drunk by inhaling alcohol vapors actually drinking would wreck the machinery we dramatize this nowadays with the brandy snifter any mass accumulated to the pc accumulates on his prime postulate the prime postulate is the basic purpose or goal of person there can be secondary prime postulate in any lifetime it is the alteration of the prime postulate that occurs in the course of trying to put it into effect that causes mass to accumulate from 277 the shift of attention and direction that inhibits the persons ability to asis change of attention is change and energy is change there is lot to be understood about how mass evolves out of alterisness if something goes from point to point b with change point must be point b by introducing space you introduce via space is via that causes and necessitates change in or of anything occurring within it that is one of the first things that happens in the course of building universe once you have time shift of attention causes motionlessness in time accumulation dissipation interchanges of masses dislocations in space etc after awhile we get an individual who obsessively changes there are two things wrong with human personality 1 too much constancy 2 too much inconstancy auditors do these two things they resist change even when it is sensible and they obsessively introduce change when it is not required constancy without understanding without reason is simply characteristic of mest so is change one should understand why one is being constant before being constant one should also understand what he is undertaking before he introduces alteration unlike life oddly enough auditing does not necessarily bring about its own track and its own mass because it is short track and it is singularly deprived of duress it is not something to worry about unless done in knuckleheaded fashion which puts person beyond help that would be crime you could audit someone badly enough it would probably take auditing him on the wrong goal to kill him perhaps but it would take some doing in prepchecking we had problem there is problem of alteration and problem of too great constancy one of the problems is that an inconstancy of approach by the auditor causes more trouble than an unusual solution heals buttons can be wonderful in the right circumstances but if the auditor is inventing them intuiting what is needed they can improve the pcs case but they lower his confidence because he cant predict what the auditor will say next the pc keeps coming out of session with his attention on the auditor this violates the definition of insessionness if you have constancy that works the four midruds that takes lot of edge off the case there could be more but what you are trying to do with model session is to make the pc auditable and to cause him to continue to be auditable the virtue of model session lies not in its processing value but in its predictability value and in the fact that it takes the edge off the things most likely to distract the pc hidden in any case is basic purpose prime postulate and earlier prime postulates it is amazing that we even have processes like model session and prepchecking that do something for the case over the top of those goals it is incredible that these processes make the pc feel better all the auditor wants them to do is to smooth out the needle so that he can find the pcs goal the conflict of goals is the senior aberration on the case any alteration of goal adds mass to it and the bank it is amazing that you can handle handle case phenomena with other processes assists etc but you cant solve the case permanently without recourse to goals 278 it is difficult and sometimes impossible to help someone who has overts against that which is trying to help him you have to set the pc up by getting them off dont get spoiled by having good luck with one pc most require setup the other problem is metering you can ruin an emeters effectiveness on gradient by not quite really cleaning ruds as you hit them by neglecting instant reads an inexperienced auditor who overlooks the tiny reads that occur on ruds questions can easily and shortly get the pc into barely readable meter which only reads on the greatest of greats the auditor misses withholds from there on out that is the problem ending cycle too soon on ruds because of missing reads the other problem is being too careful and cleaning ruds that are already clean model session run strictly by the book is still not muzzled session the auditor still must maintain 2wc with the pc and can make sure the pc is content the rud is clean too many auditors withdraw from the session leaving model session to do the job and the pc wondering whether we are alive at all an advantage of repetitive rudiments is that only one skill is needed for repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking one of the problems is teaching number of technologies or procedures it is better to have one done superlatively than ten done indifferently repetitive ruds and repetitive prepchecking tend to get the pc talking to you cheerfully and happily blowing things and feeling better if they dont you are probably doing something unusual with them l ron hubbard

repetitive prepchecking part ii repetitive process is one that is run over and over with the pc answering and the auditor acknowledging it is run to precise flat point when used with ruds and prepchecking you run it to clean needle and further beginning ruds would always he done repetitive early in auditing you would also do middle and end rudiments repetitively it is kind of prepcheck in disguise thereafter you would run middle and end ruds as fast ruds you would normally run the random rudiment missed withhold as fast rudiment not as repetitive rudiment you may have to fish around for it be very sure you get it answered the repetitive rud approach was first used in sec checking where it was quite successful prepchecking using the withhold system running chains was too hard to teach auditors also this system is hard to use with poorly reading arc breaky pc it is not as successful as repetitive prepchecking the average auditor gets more done with repetitive prepchecking and the pc gets into session better with this method dont use more rudiments than you find in model session though you can make them understandable eg to child if you seem to need more rudiments you still have the solution the arc breaky pc comes to pieces on ow so ow is added to model session it can be used when the pc is so involved in some upset that he cant pay any attention to the rest of the session his attention is so fixated that any change of his attention will lead to arc breaks and upsets the 279 other time ow is used is when pc is seriously ill too ill to be audited this situation is handled with general ow as the first rudiment general ow goes into model session right after start of session the commands are what have you done to another withheld from another it is not run against the meter it is run against the pc it can get his ta moving some pcs with highly automatic bank with everything grouped and all in motion will give you multiple picture reaction when you ask them one question the pc goes all over the time track this is not very common but when you run into it it is hard to control the pc and they cant run well on anything except ow the pc who complains of auditing result is likely to have an automatic bank you will find this out if you ask what is happening when you give the pc command however these pcs will respond to ow and get excellent ta so if you notice that you had gotten good ta on ow just move it into the body of the session otherwise run it until the pc feels much better and then do the ruds if you notice that you had gotten ta on ow when you never had much on anything else resume the ow you cant really run the ta out of it because of the breadth of the question if the pc comes into session arc broken all that would happen if you asked are you willing to talk to about your difficulties would be screams and snarls letting the pc commit overts against the auditor you dont ask what have you done to etc because you may be allergic on his terminal line besides this would be putting the pcs attention on the auditor but you can run general ow if the pc seems to be withholding things and having hard time you can use missed withhold as random rudiment thats what random means can be used at any time checked against the meter so you can use ow and the pc will eventually settle down and look calmer then go into your ruds if one of the questions may have read when you checked it and you are not sure dont pretend give the pc the rfactor that the read is equivocal and recheck ideally your metering should be so good that you use the ta to control the needle so that it is sitting exactly at set exactly at the end of your question not still bouncing back from somewhere else never try to read needle on fast rise always distrust fast rises goal doesnt have enough impulse to read down against fast rise it will show up as tiny slow if you see it read at all the needle that is flying around has inertia and slight read can get missed so be suspicious and dont hesitate to call read equivocal and recheck be sure it is clean before you call it clean or the pc will know that he is getting by the meter and will read less and less on the meter you will then have to go back over all your earlier zero questions and see that one gave tiny read dont miss it this time clean them all up and you will build the case back to reading well the only time in rudiments that you ask pc to amplify or reneat his answer is when you didnt understand it if you fake an understanding you are disturbing the knowingness button this button is the most serious one you can push in case dont fail to understand the pc while acting as though you do the onus of understanding and of making something understood is on the auditor tr4 is not q and you are asking for comprehension so that an asisness can take place 280 you ask rudiment question until the pc has more answers without checking the meter if you get read on checking the question you use it to guide the pc who doesnt know what it was into seeing what was still there after getting the pcs answer you then leave the meter until the pc says again because he will now give you all the locks when it is clean ask do you agree that was clean and tr4 whatever he says dont go back to the rudiment if he says he doesnt agree the exact same procedure is used for repetitive prepchecking it depends on the mechanism of cycling on the track to pick up the basic pcs will stay in session quite cheerily with this it takes longer than using the withhold system but it is much easier and more certain as long as you clean all the reads you get the pc will be cheerful and easy to audit if you miss few the pc will become nattery and hard to audit by virtue of not reading well if you make the opposite mistake of asking the question again after it was clean hell hath arc breaks like the one you have thereby set up this is because thetan is closest to nothing and you have given him nothingness withhold missed withhold of nothing that is very upsetting to thetan because 1 there is nothing there so he cant spot it or asis it 2 he is closest to nothing himself so he feels as if he himself has been missed you didnt buy nothing so nothing is unacknowledged so therefore he is unacknowledged so dont try to clean read that is not there this system of repetitive rudiments and prepchecking has liability it pulls the pc thoroughly into session and builds up fantastic arc between the auditor and the pc then if the auditor speaks his mind inopportunely or goes on automatic the arc break will be magnitudinous just because of the degree to which the pc is in session this system was invented because due to the fact that pcs were not well in session auditors were having trouble getting pcs to read on the meter auditor tr1 also contributed to the problem commonly and in social context meter is inoperative the pc has to be in session to some degree for the meter to react at all social conversation wont activate meter the better arc you have with the pc the better the meter reads meters are not like lie detectors lie detector reads because of terror an emeter reads on arc the pc knows that it doesnt matter what overt he gets off you are not going to turn him in if you miss reads they operate as missed withholds and the pc ceases to read well the repetitive system gets the pc talking about his case before you read the meter so it will work where nothing else does l ron hubbard type 3 idate12762 volnum1 issue174 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec174 meter reading 6207c12 shspec174 meter reading scientific research follows certain laws and we have been rigorous in following those laws in scientology when you can get research problem down to one variable voila you are there during the last couple of months having observed that auditors werent uniformly getting unvarying results lrh took every variable out of technology that he could stripping it down and testing it to the point where we now have model session and repetitive prepchecking the meter once developed had to be refined and it was yet pcs were still wobbly at times 281 so last night lrh watched three auditors to see what they were doing and found the one variable the meter read it works out this way all you have to do to louse up session is 1 clean one thing that is clean or 2 miss cleaning something that reacts there is little to choose as to which is the most serious person has certain knowingness matter how occluded and packed in he is the thetan always knows there is instinct as intuitiveness he knows you cant fool pc an auditor who tries is misguided pc knows when question is hot even if he doesnt know the answer he also knows when question is cold he has somethingnothing sensitivity he requires help to know what is there or to get high degree of certainty that there is nothing there his intuitive feelingness is not articulate and there is need to transfer it over into an analytical knowingness when you invalidate the knowingness of thetan you will get trouble the thetan can put up with this but he doesnt have to like it he doesnt like it even though he is used to it and has put up with got of it and been overwhelmed by it he has used it as pitch on others and to overwhelm others pcs arc breaks with his auditor are much more serious than his arc breaks with others you have heightened the pcs intuitive feelingness by putting him in session now if you tell him rud is out when it is in or in when he knows it is out he has long way to fall from his heightened insession awareness and elevated tone level it is severe shock and he gets an arc break he is now out of agreement with the auditor to the degree that he was formerly in agreement if youve got an agreement thats built as high as the empire state building the first scrap of disagreement will appear as high as that the pc will feel awful he is finally on the road to truth after all the trillenia and here is falsity it is very upsetting cleaning clean is the mistake that is most mysterious because the pc cant find what is wrong because it is nothing you can flub once on trs and still have the session going ok but if you leave one flubbed read your session will go to pot if you are accustomed to auditing with sloppy metering you have completely different idea of what auditing is like the things that are supposed to be in session arent there and auditing is basically protest not letting the auditor get too close auditing is as fast as pc is in session since the more he is in session the more easily he blows things pc is there to be audited and is very persistent as thetan thetan can he squashed and overwhelmed yet he never stops trying this is very noticeable in handling children thetan will keep reaching using disabilities to do so if all else fails if you set up perfect session and then and wild wrongness at some point you catch the pc offbalance and he goes into action reactively he is powerless to stop himself from acting it is as if you had the bank all stretched out like rubber band and someone suddenly let go of one end he is in mess he gets overwhelmed and starts dramatizing whatever is handy namely one of thousands of instances where he is still trying he will take such an incident and use it against the auditor this can get rather subtle the pc can convince the auditor that he has obtained results but then let someone else see that he hasnt made any progress he does this in such way that the auditor will find out about it 282 it is good to know that meter reading is all that is wrong auditors have learned trs model session and repetitive prepchecking fine and we have taken havingness out of beginning ruds to eliminate that source of difficulty when we found that havingness takes the pcs attention off the bank and extroverts him which isnt good for putting the pc in session it is better to use ow to get his havingness up this also puts his attention on the bank your problems with pcs are the same old things communication control keeping the pcs attention on what he is doing getting your question answered etc you have mastered these things then sometimes had them deteriorate at which point you have been persuaded into unusual solutions q and doing something else getting anxious etc the pc is out of session its baffling what happens to cause this outofsessionness you missed meter read this wrongness may be missed by all the instructors and supervisors who see all the wrongnesses that follow from it and correct them to result lots of other wrongnesses may get located but they arent really what wrecks the session the ultimate session wrecker is the misread meter this arc breaks the pc all to hell he will start reading on arc breaks not reading because of arc breaks etc and you wind up with dogs breakfast this results from the calling of reads that arent there and missing the ones that are there the missed withholds and the missed withholds of nothing if this goes on for many sessions the pc goes on selfaudit because he doesnt trust the meter the pc cant have an auditor because he cant have the meter so he audits himself he gets anxious he keeps his own rudiments in like gopher sitting at the edge of his hole ready to duck the pc is running the session on himself purely because of bad meter calls so metering above all must be perfect there is tolerance whatever in it you must not miss single read meter reading must be perfect or you become dangerous auditor dangerous auditor is one who might miss read just one in session if read is equivocal say so and check again l ron hubbard type 3 idate12762 volnum1 issue175 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec175 meter training 6207c12 shspec175 meter training auditors make mistakes reading meters while the basic reason for this is in their banks poor metering can be countered educationally the first requirement for accurate reading of meter is good eyesight the first thing we find wrong is that the auditor cant see it may he necessary for him to wear glasses unpopular though that is amongst scientologists when case assessment form on new pc we should take something with extremely small print like railway timetable or the stock market report in the newspaper and hold it as far from the pcs face as meter would be and have him read it if he can read it make note on the assessment form that his eyesight is good with glasses if that is true if he cant read it put down eyesight poor this will make ds of p and ds of t aware that his metering may be suspect when he starts to audit check eyesight again when doing practical sections on auditing courses since persons eyesight changes with auditing recheck the eyesight if as an auditor he gets crammed for gae lets assume that all auditors who goof have something wrong with metering 283 how wide is present time this is the next area to look into one could have an awareness of present time as much as ten minutes wide lrh has this at least for movie and tv plots clear can tell fifty to hundred feet before an intersection whether there is anything coming he may find himself seeing the truck coming around the corner before it does he is not looking around corners he may think that it is new linear perception but it is not its just that pt has gotten bit wider than the instant that most people perceive he has wider fringe of knowingness really sharp athlete also has wider pt for instance sam snead can look from the point of driving the ball to the point where it lands and know where it lands as he hits it great athletes control both ends of broadened pt so you get holeinone perfectly placed serve etc they are always exterior and the axioms seem very obvious to them they dont think of their present time as continued motion motion doesnt happen randomly in their pt they think of it as continued control when they are doing something they are controlling all the motion in that present time because they are in that present time and they have the width of that present time to decide it is as if at the end of two seconds they could undecide what they decided at the beginning of the two seconds so they have tremendous judgment they know which decision is right because they saw it happen they can perceive both motion and stillness as total isness then theres the guy whose pt is one thousandth of second wide he is in continuous anxiety and regret it is always all wrong that is crazy mans present time he doesnt even know if the bed will continue to sit on the floor you only get the idea of continuance by perceiving across span of time not by comparing different times the less pt person has the more trouble he has with the perception of motion and stillness so you can run look around here and tell something you are absolutely certain will be here in one second and keep increasing the timespan you could drill the persons perception into broadening of pt you could also run look around here and find something thats having an effect on an effect or look around this room and find something thats having an effect on something else the latter will occasionally turn on very widened pt such processes are really drills rather than processes an auditor needs to have broader pt than most if he is to be able to spot speeded rise for instance reading meter is spotting motion nomotion and change of rate of motion when it exists this is beyond perception it is matter of consecutive awareness there are three moments that must be perceived to find out if needle is still 1 the moment before it wasnt moving 2 the moment it is still it isnt moving 3 the moment after it will not move you need comparison you are not just looking at one moment moving needle requires only two observations two moments of awareness thus it is easier to read than still needle for instance sitting pheasant is harder to see than moving pheasant not because motion attracts the eye or some such reason but because motion requires only two observations to perceive while stillness requires three motion takes part of the responsibility for directing attention whereas stillness takes responsibility for directing attention 284 in perceiving motion all you have to do is to observe that something was in place and is now in place how narrowly can places and b be spaced and still have perceptible motion between them one tenth of the width of the tip of the needle apart the next question is what section of the present time you are in do you require to perceive an action or an inaction this opens the door to the solution of this problem broadening pt is best done by clearing but it wouldnt work to insist that auditors must be clear before they can clear someone actually clear raw meat with comprehension or reality on what has happened is enormously inferior to someone who has the data and goes clear training gives subjective reality on what it is like to wrestle with the problems of clearing someone trained individuals have capability to understand people while clear raw meat is likely to be very impatient with people raw clear will also ask the damndest questions he is very oddball and unpredictable this guy has been launched into the atmosphere and expected to fly without knowing that he is in plane it is better to go clear with the data you get more comprehending people that way because it takes more time to see stillness an individual has less tolerance for it hence person is impatient with observing stillnesses his continuance has to be too great stillnesses absorb time they give sense of foreverness something that moves does not have to have such continuance however the period of time required to perceive motion or stillness can be shortened until the person can observe in the tiniest narrowest pt three moments stillness or two moments motion of time you do this by practice and drill if persons span of pt is twentieth of second long he would need to be able to perceive an instant of time that is longer than sixtieth of second in order to be able to observe three moments in time in his pt and therefore to be able to perceive that the needle is still he must be able to perceive an isness that is only sixtieth of second long the amount of pt someone can observe can be tested with camera you could set the lens wide open and vary exposure time the less pt span they can observe the smaller the diameter of lens that they will be able to perceive at given speed suitable target would be to get to where we can perceive an isness in hundred and twentyfifth of second people can be drilled to get up to this speed without broadening their pt you could do it gradiently by flashing say slide of chair for one second over and over until the students can actually tell you all about the chair then cut it down to half second quarter of second etc until you reach hundred and twentyfifth of second the student will gradiently improve until he can get everything in the slide in hundred and twentyfifth of second the name for the viewing device is variable speed tachistoscope the navy used this system during world war ii for an aircraft identification drill it is now being used to teach reading and to improve reading speed even without these devices you can learn to read meter this is necessary and now we know that it will he done the result of the training should be an auditor who can tell that still needle is present given only twentieth to sixtieth of seconds observation time the old saw about the eye having shutter speed of about twentyfifth of second is stupid lie there is thetan in back of the eye who has width of pt and who tends to fixate on what he considers an observable moment l ron hubbard type 3 idate17762 volnum1 issue170 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec170 emeter reads and arc breaks 285 6207c17 shspec170 emeter reads and arc breaks meter reading has been exposed as the one point that must be done perfectly there is tr4 phenomenon connected with the meter the meter read wrong at all operates to throw tr4 out in the session the pc has an answer which the meter hasnt acknowledged as far as the pc can tell so he gets mad at the meter really but not knowing what to get mad at he misassigns the blame and his anger to something else the pc has had withhold missed or the auditor cleans clean he calls read where there isnt one and the meter starts reacting on the pcs arc break incidentally the wording of listing lines has been amended see p 259 for original wording on wantnot want the wording has to use the exact warding of the goal eg to catch cats not the goal to catch cats and on opposenot oppose it has to be the participial form eg catching cats precise english is very junior in importance to wording it as given by the pc in the metering errors mentioned above only one thing is occurring you are violating an old overlooked law that you mustnt acknowledge lie or accept lie as truth what is this about it is about prime postulate see the discussion of the first four postulates on pp 1415 above 3ga demonstrates the similarity of construction between reactive bank and universe universe is formed by prime postulate which then alterised makes matter energy space and time the pc has basic purpose or goal indistinguishable from prime postulate therefore prime postulate or the pcs basic goal or purpose is the basic building block of the reactive bank the primeprime postulate would be the basicbasic of the goal or purpose on which all else would be stuck cf expanded dianetics you wont get it on the first try you cant just date it on the meter and have it blow because it has occurred earlier and has gotten mingled in with later occurrences so dont worry about it just take what you get on goals list the keynote of the reactive bank with all its masses spaces and everything else in it is alteris which suppresses down into notis this forms the mest that is contained in the bank the same mechanism exactly applies to the formation of the physical universe thus the field of the mind is parallel to that of the physical universe but the mind came first and thus formed the universe it is fantastic for being to discover this because this discovery is in violation of the principle behind the formation of matter space etc this discovery reverses the downward spiral what starts the downward spiral and makes it denser is acceptance of alteris as fact this is something every thetan knows way down deep he must not do and what every thetan that ever got in trouble has done thetan gets nervous when he starts to suspect that he has been accepting alteris as fact if he accepts too many alter ises as fact he goes into an overwhelm he is overwhelmed by lies the priests of muggy muggy god made out of mud can make lots of converts using this principle if everyone protests muggy muggy the lie enough and if the priests can collect to themselves enough motivators in other words if they can can get the people to commit enough overts against muggy muggy muggy muggy overwhelms the people this is how you get zealots fanatics and atheists they all form chaotic mess resulting from fighting an alteris of the facts religious mechanisms have been the most powerful source of alterisness of mind and forms they get protested against most strongly and thetans get overwhelmed by them most easily the biggest alteris you could make is the misassignment of source of creation or alteris of thought these exist in the seventh and eighth dynamics the most fruitful source of lies and commotion is anything that has to do with creation false assignment of the source of creation produces randomity all out of proportion to the act of making the false assignment this act is in itself the father of all chaos being almost on the truth makes it very bad the most powerful protests follow the most extreme alterisnesses hence the violence of religious wars if you misassign the source of any part of cycle of action in fact you will get grossly disproportionate upset try going to museum during an exhibition of rembrandt and pointing out all the picassos people will argue with you and get very misemotional etc any chaos in the universe will be found to exist by reason of misassignment of who created it for instance george washington is thought to be one of the sources of of the us government yet the fact that he actually tore up the minutes of the constitutional convention is virtually unknown this is what is wrong with the us there is lot of missing data concerning its source we dont know what the basic purpose of the founding fathers was basic purpose alterised creates mass and degeneration of tone people who think lrh has alterised scientology and dianetics dont realize that we are operating on backwards track cutting into the most fundamental fundamental we can cut into regardless of the forward progress of time we are swimming against the timestream suddenly on isolation of importances we are back in the early fifties with basic purpose and prime postulate this is all book one stuff see p 270 above weve gone down some blind alleys like 3dxx if you do 3dxx line or prehav line you are listing wrong things which just adds more alteris to the bank 3dxx was the ridge that lrh found before prime purpose 3dxx was alterising the pcs goal we have gone forward on the time track and at the same time we have run the fundamentals back now we are at fundamental that runs out everything that we have put on the time track unless you follow some such pattern as this pattern of scientology research you cant backtrack the complexity of structure of mind or universe to simplicity sufficient to do something about it thats what we have done and we find to our great surprise that what is wrong with the pc is his prime postulate his goal thats unexpected thats weird complete whizzer george washington is not what is right with the us he is what is wrong with the us similarly pcs goal is what is wrong with the pc if the individual is longer able to adequately do something its probably his goal itll be the one thing that kinda makes you sigh and that you retreat from goal itself isnt really what is wrong with the person it is really the alteris of his goal departures from his goal line his inabilities to commit this goal to action that is what gives him his bank if he never altered his goal he would probably he all right the pcs goal was selfpostulated truth that never got acknowledged but all around him lies got acknowledged and this baffled him thats really all the thetan is protesting truth never gets 287 acknowledged and lies always get acknowledged thats the basis of thetans misemotions all thetans operate on these same buttons so when you make it clear in session that you are not acknowledging or taking up truth the pc gets upset thats cleaning clean read when you say he has something he hasnt got he gets upset he also gets upset when you say he hasnt got something that he has got cleaning clean or missing read is an alteris and an acknowledgment of lie nothing upsets pc or thetan more than this so misreading the meter is betrayal that strikes at the heart of his thetanesque soul he will try from then on to get the truth of the matter across to you you dont have pc anymore you have crusader for truth armed and mounted we mustnt have more alteris than weve already dot because that is how we got in this mess in the first place an arc break is an abandonment of truth and an acknowledgment of lies in session you are running extreme truth and the pc knows it he can feel it every time you misread meter you have entered lie into the session this is the thetans favorite bogeyman you have just hit on the issue of the whole construction and destruction of universes and of his bank and he doesnt like it being that way you have made the session agree with all the slave tricks that have ever been pulled on him when he thought you were his friend getting him untrapped so put in lie misread the meter and all hell breaks loose thats why it is essential to read meter correctly every time it is doable so dont worry about not being able to learn how l ron hubbard type 3 idate17762 volnum1 issue171 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec171 anatomy of arc breaks 6207c17 shspec171 anatomy of arc breaks tr1 is based on the desire to get response from the pc if you dont want to know tr1 will be out if you misread the meter the pc will arc break but he wont assign cause rightly he will give you some reason for the arc break which in itself might be true ie real outness but the actual cause is earlier even if he says that it is that you missed read its an earlier missed read that did the damage there is always that much alteris in the pcs protest if you touch pcs bank you put him into state of alteris because he is in state of alteris already he will frequently do something other than what you have told him to do if you let him get away with it he will become unauditable therefore never ask yes responsetype question without asking what it was this way you spot the alteris the pc thinks he is doing what you said but you mustnt acknowledge lie by letting him get away with this the degree that pcs alteris monitors the degree to which they protest alteris or acknowledgment of alteris telling someone to do something without having control of him is asking for trouble you should go into this by gradients since you are asking for trouble if you try to control him at distance before he is up to it dont acknowledge an improperly done command it is fatal to q and with the pcs alteris the pc acts as though it will please him for you to acknowledge his alteris but it doesnt 288 pc who starts giving the auditor orders has ceased to accept the auditor as the auditor because the auditor acknowledged some alteris awhile earlier note that this arc break or attempt to control the session occurs some time after the missed withhold resulting from some alteris both involuntary and meterread missed withholds result from wrong acknowledgment i would not q and with the pcs order i would ask when did you first think i didnt hear you or what happened earlier in the session the arc break could appear up to an hour and half after the missed withhold that caused it so dont expect when asking for the missed withhold that it just happened here is just what occurs arc makes up understanding if you fail to understand what the pc said arc breaks down this is bad tr4 at this point willingness to talk to the auditor drops out and so does interest in his own case because the pc feels that he doesnt understand as much about his case as he thought he did the greater ones understanding the easier it is to blow things the auditor must understand and the pc must understand for the pc to blow anything asisness depends on understandingness alteration always pursues failure to understand notisness accompanies the notion of incomprehensibility that is what happens with the insane they are notised because they are incomprehensible the deepest lie is pretending to understand the alteris all people have to do to make some advance is to come off their high horse and admit the lack of understanding and not pretend to understand when one snarls about pc just recall the first time one didnt understand the pc understanding is in the area of knowing and notknowing see pp 1415 above for discussion of the first four postulates that is vary highechelon pair of postulates they come right after native state so they are rather esoteric buttons for lot of people and can lay an egg but severed communication line with the missed withholds involved is very comprehensible hence the idea of missed withhold communicates well its mechanics are easy to handle one kind of missed withhold is communication intended and not received this is unacknowledged truth the inadvertent withhold that one makes the pc scream like banshee since it is right on the button of the creation of his mind and the universe for instance if the pc cant get its hot in here acknowledged he will try to make it stick if he possibly can even manifesting it physiologically the other kind of missed withhold is failure to find out something wrong the pc has put through lie which you have acknowledged either way the session blows up for instance the pc says i have never had anything to do with women in my whole life gin answer to question about women this is very low reality probably due to an original low affinity so you dont give an acknowledgment you dont buy that you check the question on the meter you cannot create an arc break by establishing truth only by refusing truth and accepting lies it is never wise or kind to permit someone to depart from truth in order to spare their feelings the emeter isnt liedetector it is truthverifier the auditor uses it to establish the truth if he can establish the truth of the situation and acknowledge it he will never have an arc break this requires that an auditor not be shy about establishing the truth even if the pc is protesting and blushing the only way you will come out friend of the pc 289 is by establishing truth the idea that social lies are necessary is one of the mechanisms for making more bank actually if you told only the truth for twentyfour hours you would do very well you would have real friends but it requires strong man to enter into this because there may be repercussions the first part may be rough but eventually it has its reward the way down is stepping back from the truth if an auditor goes into session with social mores and kindness in play the session will go to pot you can build whole universe out of bad auditing because of alteris that is why your metering has to be one hundred percent accurate and your tr4 has to include understanding the pc pc will forgive lot of fumbling if it is clear that the auditors intention is to establish truth it is better to be knucklehead than to know it all you can even act stupid as way of making sure you understand an auditor must establish truth l ron hubbard type 3 idate19762 volnum1 issue172 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec172 the emeter 6207c19 shspec172 the emeter the emeter was devised as an aid to help an auditor observe pc it certainly beats fingers on pulses the first mathison meter wasnt built as modified wheatstone bridge until emeters were developed people thought such galvanometers were reading sweat not thought because the earlier galvanometers were so insensitive engineers and electronics men in scientology have not always recognized the possibility of meter that directly reads electric thoughtimpulses not the physical results of these thoughtimpulses homemade emeters built by people who do know something about psychogalvanometers often have builtin lag which is meant to protect the movement the needle is damped down so reads are late you read sweat etc hence instant reads the first mathison meter wouldnt read on large percentage of people so lrh got mathison to expand it by the end of 1952 we had pretty good meter the very first meter had tiny electrodes little metal bars and didnt give mental reads lrh and jim elliot got the idea of using soup cans which did result in being able to get reads the emeter can detect whether pc is auditable it is coincidence that it just happens that when you can read pc on meter that pc is in good shape when persons needle is in constant agitated rockslam eg with real manicdepressive or schitzophrenic psychotic metered process works on them anyway cchs are all you can use fortunately they are available if you can read the meter on him he can be audited on think process eg prepchecking the meter ran us into complete culdesac we had had knowledge of the whole track before but the meter made it clear how many engrams there were this made dianetics look wrong as long as you audited only this lifetime you could make someone look very good but it was obviously impossible to run out every engram on the whole track because the number is infinite lrh in the past had refused to let pcs be subjected to experimental processes because they might get their heads blown off sometimes he used himself as guinea pig for that reason 290 the board of the first dianetic foundation started to resign when lrh started looking at whole track they discovered at that point that hubbard could get mad his attitude was that one was going to say what could or could not be researched they decided that he must not be clear at that time which was the time of early research with the emeter and history of man 1952 lrh and msh went down to the library and started looking up words they came up with scio and ology this seemed to express what we wanted moving out of the field of the mind into the field of knowing the mind is only vessel of knowledge so new approach was required exteriorization started coming up lrh and msh went to phoenix one night evans farber showed up and wouldnt go away lrh finally asked him what he wanted and found that he had discovered the process try not to be three feet back of your head as an exteriorization process that was practically the end of the emeter because you cant read thetan who is out of his head lrh tried to develop thetameter the trouble was that it detected the auditor as well as the thetan who was the pc because it didnt require one to be exterior to read on it it was very simple electronically it used magic eye type detector in about 1955 or 1956 emeters went out of use they revived after the clearing acc probably in 5802c07 19acc15 help how to get started and 5802c13 19acc19 other processes the help button other tape titles from this acc may be more relevant but i dont have them in the us when lrh assessed people with the meter don breeding joe wallace pinkham and others were working on meters and one of them designed transistorized emeter in 1957 it was found to be very useful in clearing people it was used with fiveway help bracket to clear fifteen or twenty out of seventy people as long as lrh did the assessment we know now that the people who went clear were those who had beingness goal and chose the terminal of that beingness goal to run on the fiveway help they made first dynamic keyedout clear that is you could clear anyone with help whose terminal was also his goal the trick of assessment was to find the rock which would sometimes coincide with the wording of goal this got meters back in when it became clear that you wouldnt clear anyone without meter this was horrible because lrh had never been able to teach an auditor to use one not that he had tried very hard the step six phenomenon that was run into not long afterwards was the result of running someone on button that wasnt on his goal line not from creativeness beefing up the bank per if his goal was run out or desensitized you could then run any creative process with bad effect otherwise the button of alteration of creativeness can get activated which is the bankcreator see pp 285287 above when bank starts to go solid thats fun the difficulties of auditors finding correct rock loomed enormously we now had two factors that were missing 1 we needed technology that would unwind any accidental out of this package of clearing so there would be unknown data 2 we needed to get to the point where an auditor could interpret the data we did find 291 the first british meters were copies of american meters fowler and allen built them at first with idea of what they were building one day lrh sat allen down and ran responsibility process on him on whatever he was looking at put him on the meter located his dead warcompanion that he felt he had overts on and found that he was looking at window surrounded by blackness he ran responsibility for this scene and got more and more room in the picture suddenly he got the whole sequence with full kinesthesia all sensations and more stuck picture lrh explained bits and pieces about the emeter to fowler and allen they went on to build the mark ii iii and eventually the mark iv with an improved circuit they also worked on an ot meter the job of the meter is still what it always was to detect what the pc has in the reactive bank it is incidental that the meter detects ruds problems or what the pc is thinking or doing or whatever what we need most is to know what he has in the bank so that the bank can be assessed the emeter has been designed and must be designed to detect the pcs prime postulate otherwise you wont clear anyone if meter wont detect prime postulate in an individual it is useless even if it could be used to get ruds in good meter must be very sensitive yet not pick up everything that the pc is doing physically but this has not been the main liability of meters the liability has always been auditor reading now that this has been singled out as the weakest point in auditing it can get fixed also more is known now about meter reads and auditor ability all the auditor is missing on is certainty on whether the needle read or is clean trouble with knowing when it read is solved by not looking until you say the last syllable and by drilling on when the needle is or isnt reading so all auditors must learn to read an emeter or they simply cannot audit you have to be able to detect the thing in the mind that is keeping the pc from being clear you ve got to learn to read meters good safe auditor can read meter an unsafe one cannot l ron hubbard type 3 idate26762 volnum1 issue179 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec179 prepchecking 6207c26 shspec179 prepchecking some of the data in this lecture is found also in hcob 30ju162 smooth hgc 25 hour intensive see also page 254 above for history of prepchecking ive just found way to use middle rudiments and make them double in brass and get the job done much better in prepchecking suppress suggest careful of invalidate and fail to reveal are powerful prepcheck buttons they should be used in the above order used in this order you have the midruds as complete prepcheck the middle rudiments were carefully sorted out of great number of buttons that could be used you could add another fifteen or twenty buttons the chart of attitudes see handbook for preclears has lot of them ruds are buttons that consist of just those things that can keep one of the other buttons from reading and which if present can keep goal or item from reading they are pretty powerful suppress if you got suppress off the case nearly everything would blow if suppress is alive you dont get read on the remainder of the buttons so run suppress before adding another series of anything 292 suggest this button could be and sometimes has to be translated as isness that is evaluation per the auditors code 1 it says that something is it is powerful button because you say something is it will now read even though it wasnt reading before you say something reads which doesnt and the pc can jam on it and it will now read it will at least read on disagreement suggest neednt be used in midruds since auditors dont do it much save it for prepchecks invalidate if goal or item is invalidated it will read even when it is not the goal or item get the inval off and it will longer read suppress on top of inval keeps the inval from showing up that is why suppress goes first as button fail to reveal this button is off the line it gives you the dirty needle minute rockslam careful of this is another suppress with an added characteristic after the person has been having something little offbeat done for little while he can hang up in the thing if he becomes too careful of something or other he can also make an item read by reverse suppression by carefully not suppressing it ie by making sure it reads the order of the buttons would be suppress suggest careful of invalidate fail to reveal this is an optimum arrangement that puts the most important button last as far as session foulups are concerned this also gives you two cracks at suppression if these buttons are so strong they must have some value they make great prepcheck zero questions as lrh found more or less by accident while cleaning up pc who had been feeling poorly the procedure for the problems intensive is as follows see also p 134 above and hcob 9nov61 the problems intensive use of the prior confusion as well as the current hcob of 30jul62 1 sort out the chief selfdetermined change the pc has made using assessment by elimination or greatest read for purposes of assessment each change should be expressed in few words plus date 2 get the confusion that preceded the change and date it keep the pc to the just prior confusion this should be anywhere from five minutes to two weeks earlier dont let the pc go way back on the track 3 go month earlier in case he didnt remember the overt that started the confusion 4 prepcheck since the above date when you use the above procedure pcs are very willing to tell you things they have suppressed somatics come off also dont also check midruds on the period you are prepchecking 293 you might think that you wouldnt reach basic on any chain by using the above method of prepchecking but since you are taking up the buttons in this sequence and they seem like such innocent buttons they clear away lot of track without your having to worry about fundamentals and basic omitting the withhold system left us with way to get to basic it appears that with this system you dont have to bother you could start in all over again if the pc had given it shallow pass on the first time through and pick up deeper fundamentals however the hazard in doing so is that you might be cleaning clean also be very sure not to leave question unflat that is very important since in so doing you could give him missed withholds and he could blow or create big storm and feel terrible for fiftyhour intensive you could also do prepcheck in this lifetime this system gets the pcs withholds easily and voluntarily just be sure to follow the rules and dont be an idiot make sure the pc understands the question to audit small child you might have to reword it to get it to communicate on any pc you want to be sure to communicate know what you are trying to communicate if you find the pc unable to answer or with very few answers dont blame it on the pcs caginess or unwillingness you have to more the communication so it does bite if you do that the prepcheck will unstack the bank in its natural sequence which is always desirable in sec checking and prepchecking it is very repetitive action there is another way to use repetitive prepchecking 1 sort out by assessment the persons selfdetermined decisions get the most charged oldtime problems intensive style make sure it is selfdetermined 2 date the problem 3 date the confusion prior to the decision found in 1 the pc will slide away from the prior confusion if you dont keep him looking for it dont let him find one five years before it is justprior confusion 4 date the beginning of the prior confusion and go month earlier 5 prepcheck it since date found in 4 pc tends to see himself as pawn on the board of life the liability of taking an otherdetermined chain is that you will get into chain of engrams this system doesnt handle engrams so watch it it is ok however to get sometimes coming off on dating the prior confusion if you let the date he few years earlier you will miss it the prior confusion is the period when he was creating the problem for which the decision is solution the sequence for this this mechanism is 1 the pc commits overts all over the place and has withholds missed on him like mad 2 this causes problem for him 3 he makes decision to solve the problem this is the selfdetermined change for more details sec pp 128130 above all this is part of an effort to make prepchecking beefier and more effective and farreaching you might feel shy of doing prepcheck if you werent pretty sure of getting good result somatics and conditions like postpartum depression will blow 294 without your having to run engrams and getting the pc stuck in the incident the success you will have will depend on the excellence of your meter reading how thoroughly the pc is in session and how well you clean up each question prepchecking is relatively permissive system that gradiently lets the pc get himself into confrontable soup it doesnt overwhump the pc but it must be metered right l ron hubbard type 3 idate9862 volnum1 issue182 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec182 clearing 6208c09 shspec182 clearing what are you as an auditor trying to do you are trying to clear people you should recognize that all processes are subordinate to this end to be clearable person has to be auditable if someone cant talk listen or respond he is unauditable you arent concerned with states of insanity as defined by kraepelin this is subject that is subordinate to scientology we have used the words sanity and insanity for pr purposes but actually we have nothing to do with either there is not person on earth who is sane they are all batty or they wouldnt be here someone who is sane is someone who resolves problems for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics that is sane action and definition of sanity very few people apply that rule people fall into gradient scale of auditability that is what you should study if you are concerned with states of man person who isnt clear wont resolve things for the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics even first goal clear wont ordinarily there is processing short of clearing that is worth long arduous hours now that we have 3ga so we become interested in auditability the trick at the moment is to clear someone while he is clearing someone else the struggle for lrh is not to clear people it is to get people to clear people people in the ruds and havingness group are there not because they are unauditable but because they are not able to audit well enough to receive auditing person to be unauditable has to be pretty bad off his auditability is determined by how many overts he is secretly committing while being audited the lowest level of auditability is the person who can be cleaned up who will keep his snoot clean long enough for you to clean up his needle below that level is the pc who will never tell you who wont cooperate or be frank with you at this point auditing ceases to the degree that the auditor cant get the pc to communicate it isnt that the meter wont read though that would also debar auditing almost anybody if not auditable is preparable he is still auditable on cchs and thus he can be prepared for auditing this would also apply to someone who is bleeding to death or in coma the unauditable case will get new body sooner or later so you can get him later if the technology is still there the only case that cant be reached is the one that isnt there and will never hear of scientology dont spend more time than necessary to get the goals any case that can be forced into groove can be audited the case that breaks your heart though is the one that appears auditable but is not really preparable we dont have the tools to handle such case at present the auditability of people depends in large measure on the sphere of influence of the scientologist the sphere of action that will do the world the 295 most good is that of auditable cases they may be nutty amnesic spinbin cases but if they are auditable they can be straightened out some people have nutty idea and know it is nutty others dont know the one who has some hope who knows he can get better can be audited the one who knows one can be helped and that it is all someone elses fault etc may be lot harder to audit the bugginess of their ideas makes difference persons goal could make him sound batty but they could still be audited there is nothing wrong with somebody except that he has upped and got himself basic purpose for reasons that are unknown to him then when his basic purpose is disobeyed or blocked off you get bank developed at this point lot of other purposes he doesnt want get hooked on to the first and he follows those and he doesnt know who he is and he gets body etc etc it is incredible that clearing process to unsnarl all this was developed previous efforts at clearing peeled the guy away from the gpm but it was still there so matter how good the pc felt the chance was there that it could key in again the pcs goal is random chance factor for instance in running repetitive processes eg help processes communication processes etc the goal could be never to communicate to anyone or never to help anyone the index of how much good it will do to find and clear the pcs goal is the amount of case gain you can get on person who has had wrong goal found if you sit down with him on meter and handle that goal with the to be tiger drill reference hcob 29nov62 routines 2i2 321 and 3gaxx tiger drill for nulling by midruds see fig 10 clean it until all sensation and pain have gone gone off it you will see more case gain than you have seen for some time what is happening is that finding the wrong goal did keyin of what was there anyway it could have keyed in at any time now you clean it up and it has further effect on him this could lead to wild problems intensive 1 have the pc write list of all the problems that he has had this lifetime 2 ask him what decision would have solved the first second third problem etc etc dont date them they are really goals 3 dust them off lightly with the tiger drill it is little chunk of doing goals list and the pc will get phenomenal relief not that you would necessarily do this on someone it is workable because of the value of decision the bank is basic decision or purpose which has on top of it concatenation of purposes so every time he makes decision he adds look it is simpler though to just do 3ga in the first place and this is also faster and more to the point if you can clear somebody there is reason to do anything else what this means for this planet is quite amazing threequarters of asia became civilized just because of hope that this could be done 295a figure 10 the tiger drill small tiger uses suppress big tiger uses small tiger buttons invalidated plus nearly found out suggested protest fail to reveal

result was that he was overwhelmed he got further orders to evacuate then to advance then to stay there then he caught the barrage his own artillery shelled him he decided then to evacuate but couldnt carry out the orders he is there now in highly charged agitation rockslamming rock slam is cant go cant stay cant come cant leave mustnt be it is highly charged agitation originally while addressing goals on the twentieth acc this was such strong phenomenon that ron used it in assessing to go down the chain to find the rock hence the name dirty needle is tiny persistent rock slam lrh has been spending the past week or so studying rock slams in depth he happened to get criminal on the meter one with known overts against him he saw rock slam turn on and off on this one fact this was very interesting of course the criminal was trapped too in this case however it wasnt goals phenomenon lrh found that you can clean rock slam off missed withhold on someone and end up with dirty needle this is because the pcs attention is on the large overt the rock slam not on the auditor it takes superb tr1 to get past the noread that results from the pcs elsewhereness this was the first evidence that rock slam and dirty needle are signs of overts until the overt is handled the needle wont register the mechanics of failed to reveal is the still point following confusion you should audit the confusion you could only get stuck picture to move by asking what about that picture could you take responsibility for this works because responsibility takes care of the overt stills do not exist without prior confusions except in the case of goals postulates for this reason you can also unstick stuck picture by spotting the prior confusion and the overt the person did the person usually settled the confusion with an overt culture will get stuck and fixed following good confusion too pc will get chronic somatic following an overt or more likely series of overts that involve motion these overts were way of settling confusion politics is an aberration caused by the collective overts of the citizenry you can forecast the next governmental form by looking at the overts the citizens are committing because the government will try to bake those overts legal thus lessening the overt for instance criminal has come to the conclusion that property belongs to nobody he has to come to this conclusion before the 1917 russian revolution the crime rate was very high so the russian government legalized the idea that property belongs to nobody weekness or omitted participation would be the prior overt in socialized state because in such state weakness is legal and rewarded in politics there is only opinion and aberration wisdom in research what usually happens is that lrh falls over something for awhile he bumps into it until way to use it occurs auditors have learned to go to failed to reveal when dirty needle shows up failed to reveal is subsequent to an overt there is little to gain by asking for overts though it is too strong but the failed to reveal skims the top 297 tiger drill p 295a is effective until you run into persistent rock slam or dirty needle ow has been put in to remedy this it works as long as you get your question answered when it doesnt work it is because the pc is doing something else with the answers if he is technically answering but not giving overts keep clearing the commands the pc may be trying to solve problem with the auditing question lrh found that he could turn on rock slam at will in anyone on goals chain 3ga as it exists is totally workable and will do the job the only problem is doing it faster we have already cleared firstgoal clear who had wild rock slam goals got picked off the top of the gpm to the point where the rock slam showed up this guy has gotten caught in the front lines with bunch of overts and he is sitting in ridge that has enough confusion and enough overts behind it to make him unable to move anyplace so there he is it would be faster to find the first goal if you could just bypass the first three goals of the gpm and only have four or five to deal with that is the proposed speedup we have run people to an fn on goal and found that they had rock slam underlying the fn if you overlist for fifteen or twenty minutes beyond the fn you get rock slam as the pc goes on down the goals chain the track is laid out in cycles made up of series of lives or types of lives associated and allied highly variable in their time element it is prime postulate new goal that starts cycle this is not solution but new game the pc goes along with this eventually the steam goes out of it and the thetan finds himself with interest and ability to get into trouble he goes out the bottom then perks up bit and goes off with new basic postulate any further postulate is solution to problems caused by the first one that is cycle those are pieces of gpm with an interrelationship if you can get the earliest you can find cleaned up the later ones blow easily since the thetan had less power to make them for this reason it is worthwhile to get as early goal as you can find that still reads and has some reality for the pc and which he can still run if goal will rocket read you can list it after you have tiger drilled it clean if it rocket reads you can list it through to fn then find another etc etc as you go further back it would be easy to find later goals but useful to find earlier ones thetan never gets so messed up that he fails to leave flag out on his points of aberration in early work it was noticed that the key engram of the pcs current life leaves out tag the tag is an innocentseeming and seemingly meaningless picture that the pc is frequently aware of for instance it may be picture of grandfathers rocking chair when you explore this you find the key engram similarly the key goal has rock slam left on it one way of finding out what subject it is on is by nulling several hundred goals culling the rock slams writing them down and seeing what the subject matter is test overts on and see the rock slam turn on the rock slam may wear out on some of these subjects those are the locks the real goal will have rock slam that wont weer out the charge manifested by the rock slam can be imparted to associated subjects that wont hold up and that will confuse you any branch of the tree looks like the trunk eventually you will find the trunk 298 you can use the rock slam to find the goals channel by assessing the eight dynamics to find one that has rock slam or dirty needle if there is dirty needle at first you can cause one by having the pc think of overts against each dynamic and picking out the dirtiest needle you have to be clever to ask these questions without causing missed withholds get the pc to tell you few overts on the dynamic that reads dirtiest ask him what would represent that dynamic and get list of items assess by elimination looking for rock slam or the hottest item it is ok if at this point you dont get rock slam take that item and get the pc to list what goal might you have that would be an overt against eg the government write down any pain or sensation on the list keep listing as long as there is needle action when the needle smooths out the pcs goal is on the list if you are lucky if you are unlucky you will get nothing but pain sensation and stuck needle if so start with new dynamic assessment if you are getting cognitions that is good sign on some pcs this could be the only way to run goals on most it would be shortcut l

scientology on worldwide clearing basis the activity of worldwide clearing is now understood but there will have to be an agreedupon and workable plan to deliver the goods hpahca is presently neglected sphere prepchecking is not an adequate tool to turn people loose with by itself we also have the very effective form of auditing with great therapeutic value that is goals listing not necessarily goals finding if someone is upset just get them to write goals list with some astronomical number of goals on it preserve it carefully for later use this sort of goals assistance will shortly be part of hpahca training along with prepchecking if the pc could also list items for goals he would shortly be in shape to learn to find goals alternatively st hill graduate in an organization could find the goals of everyone around once they had been set up by the hpahca item listing takes long time there could be 2500 per list so policy letter has gone out forbidding st hill graduates from doing anything except to find goals hcopl 13aug62 clearing that way the org can do clearing the staff could coaudit on getting goals and items listed and the st hill staff staff auditor could find the goals this would get staffs cleared now on to world clearing say you have fifty people paying certain amount per week they all want to be clear form them into coaudits three nights week or whatever get goals listed get items listed st hill graduates would find the goal and put the person back into coaudit within year they would all be clear second goals could be found next have them study the practical actions and get to look like auditors coauditing under good supervision the fee charged should be more than adequate to support the center or whatever what damage could this do the instructor would have to make sure that withholds got missed that could cause pcs to blow you will have to do some training at first at the same time get the goals lists made so that some progress is evident from the start you could take the persons auditing skill count for points towards their getting their goal found 299 you might think that this would cut people off from getting trained not so at all people will decide to go get trained while waiting to have their goal found at the end of the year you will have fifty firstgoal clears the only limiting factor on the expansion of clearing by this system is the number who can go through st hill and that number can be increased there are lots of oldtime scientologists around the world lrh is now getting their names so that he can write them and send them to the nearest franchise holder this will give semitrained assistants people who will join in the coaudit etc finite auditing period four to five hours of auditing and several hours of training per day are required to accomplish this program that is the basic worldclearing activity central organizations have always existed for training and dissemination of information with auditing of pcs mostly for demonstration purposes now when pcs come in they can be handled with coaudit andor preparatory actions the trouble in any central org or any coaudit will be to keep up the quality of auditing and not to let it get slipshod that is always fight because green auditors can think up more interesting ways to do things and have more problems you can find what portion of central org the public is impinging on most because that will be the most scrambled and muckedup and offline the main danger with small staff is that the public will shove the timescheduling out you have to be mean on that point because the area the public is most messed up on is time time is the single source of aberration there would be aberration were it not for time keeping time controlled for the group with regard to course hours etc will actually result in your giving wins dont let guy sneak in late greet him loudly this results in less aberration and enturbulation in the group let them know you think scheduling is important and other factors will fall into place this is method of controlling people who are otherwise unruly lrh would never let himself be pushed into auditing more than five to five and half hours per day you also have to save time by having administrative people to handle the phone mail etc the people on the coaudit will string out in time depending on how much bank is in the way of their understanding the bank is composed of time at all so they get into its timelessness and have time to do anything people have different periods of time that it takes them to register the same recognition they have different reaction times they have different rates on different subjects and on different dynamics etc these rates are determined by where the goal sits that gets in the way of your meter reading some people are aberrated on the subject of meters and cant see the read on the needle though they may read books etc well very sane person has fantastic quantities of time lrh once flabbergasted someone by outlining program for this part of the universe that extended 5000 years into the future ive seen billion years planned out down to the smallest detail if there were time there would be motion havingness matter etc the more bank person has the less time he has for the longest period rock can sit there without any recognition at all for few trillenia speed of recognition depends on how much time person has pt varies from thousandth 300 of second to more normal value of second or two expanded to ten minutes this would be frightening the number of mistakes person makes is inversely proportional to the amount of pt they have the saner and the freer person is the more pt he has the guy whose pt is thousandth of second never foresees the difficulty of doing anything and does the most impulsive and stupid things you ever heard of foresight is not really brightness but width of pt nothing beats looking your way out of things if you think being able to foretell the future thousand years ahead with accuracy would be boring how come you can only get excitement by being stupid anyway this gives you fast index on pcs coaudits etc this index is the amount of time it takes him to register to find out that something is there the length of time it takes him to absorb auditing information is the length of time it takes him to be reliable if you pair up coaudit teams on the basis of their recognition periods they will stay happy it will seem reasonable to both of them methods could easily be developed to measure recognition period how much should you teach your coauditors lrh would demand perfection in any coaudit the amount of gain is to some degree proportional to the amount of responsibility the instructor is taking for those people it is not very dependent on what process you are running you have problems of comparable magnitude ptp process responsibility processing use some processes that avoid ow your best bet though is to put them onto listing goals and items so they had better be started out on prepchecks and prepchecking if you have to keep them busy give them something to study listing for example utilize the available time in the most productive possible way it is not very tenable to singlehand project like this it is harder on you than you would think since you lack datum of comparable magnitude the communication channel falls off to the degree that an individual feels that he is outside the organization this makes the development of city offices rather than franchises good idea city office is similar to franchise but it is under the administrative direction of the central scientology organization via an hco area secretary it is set up by the hco continental sec the intention is that it will ultimately grow up into central organization see oec volume vii pp 154 158 162163 165 there is necessity to make everything neat since it will blow up anyway it might as well be done neatly so that it can be put together again after it falls apart when expansion hits when increased comm hits network of comm lines it is not surprising if the seams leak so you have to be skilled in putting the line back again not in trying to hold it any central organization putting together clearing coaudit should do it perfectly then put it all back together again when it blows up you hold the fort with time good discipline etc and you realize that world clearing is done on the basis of somehow making it not as juggernaut rolling down the highway there hasnt been road you follow policy as far as you can and then you make it work from then on just dont scant technology dont fail to deliver the goods and make clears the world will forgive you anything else if you do that 301 l ron hubbard type 3 idate21862 volnum1 issue188 rev0 rdate000 addition0 adate000 arev0 ardate000 shspec188 basics of auditing 6208c21 shspec188 basics of auditing auditors keep asking lrh for rules and more rules then they goof in session and ask for more it is strange that fundamentals usually come at high levels of training here is what an auditor should be able to do he should be able to get another being to be interested in his own case and willing to talk to him rules tricks rudiments and various other types of upsetpreventers are all contributive to getting this to occur the emeter is only contributive insofar as it applies to rudiments it is vital for assessing in rudiments you are trying to do with rules and the meter something that you cannot do yourself this wont work some auditors have only to sit down in the chair to have the pc arc break this is more true now than ever the difficulties the auditor encounters are his own difficulties and the mechanics he uses force the pc into session with an auditor who doesnt want the pc in session or who doesnt understand that the pc should be in session or why the pc should be in session the mechanics of rudiments and rules have made auditing so powerful that the pc is put into state where he is interested in his case and wants to talk to the auditor but the auditor thinks he is supposed to do something else and drives the pc out of session again so the pc arc breaks the auditor looks like an auditor and the rules trick the pc into session then the pc finds that the auditor doesnt want to hear what he is saying the auditor is auditing by some set of rules in fact there is auditor but the technology has created pc this drives the pc around the bend the pc doesnt know what is wrong but he feels that something is wrong we have been blaming meter reading missing reads this is just another technical rule someone who understood the basics of auditing and used them could miss reads and clean cleans and still have pc happily in session but someone who cleans cleans and misses reads must be auditing not by basics but by rules that force pc into session if there is auditor but only rules and meter the rules may be right and the meter wrong there is nothing else holding the pc in session so he gets upset if the auditor is not there and he misses something it is curtains so it is very necessary to know what the basics of auditing are the remedy for the above situation is that people are going to learn to prepcheck and to put ruds in without meters and to do this accurately this will make auditors they can do it because they will learn the basics of auditing why does auditing exist at all there are two articles in certainty magazine 1958 that take apart what psychoanalysis did wrong anyone that went into session in analysis did so accidentally basically the analysand never had an auditor he was also never brought back to pt at the end of session the basics of auditing include the mechanics of blowing something the reason why auditing works axiom 51 one underlying thread is the principle that after session pc should feel better even an awful goals assessment session that missed the goal should end up with the pc feeling better secondly the auditor must get off the pcs withholds 302 the earliest part of auditing is the roughest part since all the missed withholds of life are still sitting there unrelieved it takes far better auditor to handle such case than to handle someone who has come up the line ways scientologists are not really harder to audit than raw meat especially raw meat that hasnt ever reached for anything you would be surprised though at who can go into session and who can be audited once in detroit the cops seized some tapes fourteen cops listened to them and twelve resigned from the force an auditor should be able to handle the pcs problems and to get clean needle so that the pc can be assessed and made to feel better an auditor should audit to get things done in session not just to audit auditing consists of getting something done by series of little accomplishments not by going through the motions you should be able to get pc into session without meter rules or anything some people have gift for this an auditor should be able to let the pc blow something by talking to him you would be surprised how rare this is you should also be able to get done what the pc wants done without q and people have trouble differentiating between tr4 and q and an auditor must be able to make this distinction he must handle the session and do things the pc wants done without q and you have to work at it to get in trouble with this q and is simple 1 not accepting the pcs answer questioning the pcs answer auditing isnt done by rules but by understanding people who q and dont want the pc to talk to them they use remark comment or request for more information to prevent the pc from just saying something and blowing the charge or the auditor doesnt acknowledge this is defensive mechanism 2 doing something every time the pc says something an auditor who always does what the pc says will drive the pc crazy an auditor who audits strictly by rules and not by understanding will never do anything pc says matter how reasonable or sensible it is which also drives the pc crazy there are two things that pcs do 1 they ask auditors to do things such that if the auditor doesnt do them the session will go around the bend 2 they originate auditors who are having hard time with pcs never differentiate between these two situations they dont evaluate importances they try to follow all the rules instead of helping the pc you dont take up the process that the pc wants run or the goal which the pc asserts but which doesnt check out on the other hand you dont ignore it when the pc says this room is so hot that i am melting open the damn window there is substitute for understanding and feeling of humanness obnose why does auditing work it bothers someone to be the only one who knows something he feels better when someone else can see it too he doesnt like to have only his attention on something it bothers him to have to keep it from other people when he puts something out and lets someone else see it and the person says that he has seen it and nothing else happens axiom 10 hasnt fired the catastrophic effect he expected hasnt been produced 303 auditing of withholds blows the pcs certainty of consequences he gets off gross overt that he knew would kill him if anyone else ever found out about it and there is consequence the only thing that happened was ventilation having gotten off the withhold the pc finds himself with his attention freed up from that subject before it was stuck on keeping it withheld so he drops it like hot potato without going into the mechanics of asising we can say this if the horrible consequences that the pc expected on getting off withhold dont materialize his previously fixed attention is freed up auditors have interesting methods of preventing pcs from blowing things they use the meter they do something every time the pc originates if the auditor always does something or asks another question about it the pc isnt allowed to blow anything auditing works because the pc blows things if he isnt allowed to blow things he will blow up the point is to audit the pc not to go through drill auditors should be able to clean up dirty needle they should be able to prepcheck simply using pc indicators to establish cleanness of the question but dont try to assess goals without one if rules get in your way you probably dont understand the rules the reason for this emphasis is that 3ga requires superb auditor if it is to be done rapidly l ron hubbard
