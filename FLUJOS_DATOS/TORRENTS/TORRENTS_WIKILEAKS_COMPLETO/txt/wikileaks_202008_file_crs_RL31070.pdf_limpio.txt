in the remaining days of the 107th congress includes reauthorizing the export administration act extending permanent normal trade relations status to russia and efforts to reform trade remedies including section 201 trade promotion f asttrack authority one of the most significant issues facing the 107th congress was whether or not to authorize expedited enactment of trade agreements negotiated by the president trade promotion authority tpa means that under certain conditions the congress consents to address trade agreements nego tiated by the president without amendment and agrees to move the measures th rough congressional committees and both houses of congress within specific deadline background article i section 8 of the united states constitution gives the congress authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations and to collect duties however at certain times and for certain purposes the congress has authorized the president to negotiate nd proclaim reciprocal tariff reductions with us trading partners without congressiona l involvement in the trade act of 1974 pl 93618 congress continued to authoriz the president to negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions and in addition provide d specific negotiating objectives required greater consultation between the congress and the president during the negotiations process and provided certain fasttrack procedures mandatory deadlines limited debate amendments for congressional approval of nontariff concessions the trade agreements act of 1979 p l 9639 extended the authority another 8 years executive fasttrack was last authorized by the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 pl 100418 which renewed the presidents fast track authority for agreements reached th rough may 1993 the latte r two

signed declaration agreeing to consider new multilateral negotiations the administration believed that presidential tpa was all the more important in the 107th congress however trade promoti on authority or fasttrack had proven to be divisive issue some mbers favored giving the white house the authority it sought while others believed that it precludes congress from fulfilling its constitutional obligations to debate and if necessa ry to amend trade bills3 second issue concerned how labor rights and the environment should be treated in trade agreementswhether strong enforceable labor and environmental provisions should be included whether the president s hould be given discretion in enforcement of these provisions or whether labor nd environmental cons iderations should be present in trade agreements at all th ird some members of congress and industry groups had expressed concern over certain concessions made by us negotiators during the doha ministerial conference in particular the willingness to negotiate changes in wto rules that cover antidumping laws fourth issue brought up most recently by senate democrats concerned whether or not an expansion of trade adjustment assistance taa programs to aid workers hurt by trade liberalization should be packaged together with tpa legislation some nate republicans were open to compromise on taa expansion provision

2000 the agreement was presented to the 107th congress for implementation on january 6 2001 by then president clinton the free trade agreement fta with jordan provides that over 10year period the duties on almost all goods will be pha sed out leading to dutyfree trade between the united states and jordan certain c ontroversial provisions in the agreement involved nontariff issues including langua ge on labor rights and environmental protection that appear as an integral part of the fta rather than as side agreements the usjordan fta has led some member s of congress to address the issue of whether or not environmen tal and labor provisions s hould be included in this agreement or any future fta that the united states may negotiate some members of congress have argued that the envi ronmental and labor provisions in the usjordan fta should be viewed uniquely and not as model for future trade agreements other members have expressed pleasure at the inclusion of environmental and labor provisions in th usjordan fta and view them as precedent for future ftas5 the economic effects of the jordan fta on the us market are not expected to be dramatic because the level of trade imports 73 million exports 313 million is relatively small in addition many t op exports from jordan already enter dutyfree under normal tariff treatment or the generalized system of preferences

industry is the general prohibition of log exports by the canadian province of british columbia in order to ensure domestic production job creati on and economic development some have alleged that this practice amounts to an additiona l government subsidy that further reduces the price of canadian lumber to below world market prices as the us international trade administration determined in

bill that would on the one hand repeal the eti provisions while at the same time provide range of tax reductions for us firms overseas business operations39 nafta and the mexican trucking dispute on february 6 2001 an international ar bitration panel found that united states refusal to approve any applications fro m mexican carriers for new authority to provide crossborder trucking services is violation of the north american free trade agreement nafta the panel dete rmined that the inadequacies of the mexican regulatory system provide an insufficient legal basis for the united states to maintain its moratorium this decisi on and the bush administrations support for opening up the border to mexican carriers as specified in the nafta have accelerated the process leading toward the granting of expanded operating authority to these carriers several members of congress have become concerned that the safety of us highways will be compromised if the border is opened on the projected target date of january 2002 others however state that the safety risks have been over exaggerated40 background according to the nafta mexican commercial carriers are to be allowed full access to the united stat to pick up and deliver crossborder shipments and similar access is to be provided for us carriers operating in mexico at present almost all mexican carriers are restricted from going any further into the united states than the defined commercial zones which are typically located within three to twenty miles of the southern us border these zones are designated areas where mexican trucking companies are permitted to transfer their cargo to us carriers or unload their cargo which is later picked up by us carriers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31070crs25 41 the bus regulatory reform act of 1982 pl 97261 established twoyear moratorium on issuing new grants of operating authority to motor carriers domiciled in or owned and controlled by persons of contiguous foreign country the moratorium was lifted with respect to canada in september 1982 but continued with respect to mexico the moratorium was subsequently extended until 1995 when the interstate commerce commission termination act of 1995 pl 10488 further extended the moratoriumciting safety concerns the clinton administration placed hold on certain provisions of the nafta that would ve allowed mexican carriers to operate beyond the commercial zones41 on december 18 1995 mexico requested formal consultations as specified in the nafta with the united states after several attempts by both parties to resolve the i ssue mexico requested the formation of an arbitral panel which was formed on fe bruary 2 2000 the panel issued its final report on february 6 2001 the bush administration intends to llow vehicles and dr ivers of approved mexican carriers to transport goods and passengers bey ond commercial zones concerns on the part of some about th safety of mexican domiciled carriers have increased considerably as result of this decision recent developments on november 28 sena tor patty murray announced housesenate compromise with the wh ite house on the mexican crossborder trucking issue president bush had threatened veto of hr 2299 the department of transportation appr opriations bill if certain safety provisions the white house considered discriminatory were included in the conference report the report including the compromise provisions was approved by the house on november 30 and the senate on december 4 the agreement 1 requires comprehensive safety examination of each
