from michael mann mannvirginiaedu to keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk subject re belated thanks for review and questions date fri 02 may 2003 184641 0400 hi keith problem i know how hectic the past couple months have been for you so apologizes necessary whatsoever call old fashioned but i still tend to prefer the blind reviewer convention so id prefer to remain anonymous unless you think that revealing my identity would be help in any particular way i agree w your take on thisa journal like grl is probably more appropriate or even climatic change because number of similar papers have been published there in the past by folks like nychka bloomfield and others im not sure if steve schneider is sick and tired of those papers though please dont hesitate to let know if i can be of any additional help w this looking forward to seeing you one of these days mike at 0236 pm 522003 0100 you wrote mike in hassling another reviewer i realised that i did not thank you properly for the review you did of the manuscript by gilalana fractionally integrated techniques used to show increased persistence in global temperature record in 20th century so this is by way of thanks and to ask whether you wish to reveal your name to the reviewer considering you make some very helpful suggestions for further analysis i would otherwise assume as it happens i can not get response from the other reviewer but rather than prolong the wait for the submitter i am tempted on the basis of my reading also to just send your comments and reject the manuscript as it is i suppose they could resubmit major rework following your suggestions but i tend to the opinion that it would be better suited to another journal anyway grl comes to mind what do you think cheers keith professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 1httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa ______________________________________________________________ professor michael mann department of environmental sciences clark hall university of virginia charlottesville va 22903 _______________________________________________________________________ email mannvirginiaedu phone 434 9247770 fax 434 9822137 2httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml references 1 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa 2 httpwwwevscvirginiaedufacultypeoplemannshtml
