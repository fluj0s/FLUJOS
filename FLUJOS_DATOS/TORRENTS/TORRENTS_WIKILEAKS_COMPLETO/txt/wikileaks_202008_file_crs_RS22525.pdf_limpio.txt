electronic banking the postcheck 21 payments system walter w eubanks specialist in economic policy government and finance division summary the check clearing for the 21st century act check 21 was enacted in 2003 to encourage replacing paper check clearing with electronic check clearing because of the cost savings and efficiencies electronic clearing offers coincidentally in the 2001 2003 period consumers increased use of ectronic payment methods such as credit debit cards and automated clearinghouse ach payments exceeded the number of paper check payments for the first time in us history1 consumers growing use of cards and other fully electronic payment met hods appears to be diminishing growth of check 21 use and is leapfrogging the systems past the paperelectronic way station check 21 was to provide this report is brief assessment of the role of check 21 in payments system that is increasingly dominated by electronic payments this assessment indicates that if banks continue to adopt check 21 the paym ents system will capture significant cost savings and efficiencies in the near future despite the declining use of paper checks paper checks remain the most popular sing noncash payment method and the largest noncash payment type in terms of value most large payments are still being made with paper checks some banks may never dopt check 21 preferring to forgo its implementation in favor of waiting for fully electronic processes that may be more rapidly approaching than earlier expected the payments system and check 21 the payments system consists of the various means buyers and sellers use to transfer monetary value among themselves cash nd paper checks have been the most popular instruments in the retail payments system electronic banking has played critical role on the wholesale side of the payments system for decades tr illions of dollars per day have been transferred routin ely and securely through the wholesale payments systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22525crs2 between parties such as the federal reserv the department of the treasury other government agencies financial institutions and corporations for the last two

that 348 billion checks were used 7 billion fewer than in 2000 the check clearing for the 21st century act pl 108100 became effective on october 28 2004 the acts purpose was to ma ke the payments system more efficient and less costly by facilitating wider use of electronic check processing without demanding that any bank change its current check collecting practices it accomplishes this by authorizing the use of substitute check wh ich is negotiable pa per reproduction of an original check that contains an image of the front and the back of the original check and is suitable for automated processing it contains magnetic ink character recognition line micrencoded in the same manner as the original check any bank that transfers presents or returns substitute check warrants or confirms that 1 the substitute check contains an accurate image of the front and the back of the original check and legend stating that it is the legal equivalent of th original check and 2 that depositary bank drawee drawer or indorser2 will be asked to pay check that is already paid substitute check for which bank has made these warrantie s is the legal equivalent of the original check for all purposes and all persons most of the savings from clearing checks electronically come from eliminating some or all of the handling sorting and physical transporting of checks to the paying bank under the law before check 21 bank that pr esented check for payment had to present the original check the paying banks could get around this law according to the uniform commercial code ucc sections 3501b2 and 4 100 by negotiating processing agreements that made it unnecessary to physically present the paper check but since the benefits of electronic check clearing are not uniformly dispersed among the participants banks have found it difficult to obtain these ag reements thus constr aining the widespread adoption of various forms of electronic check clearing3 the most efficient form of electronic check clearing is one in which there is paperwork in the process this is called straightthrough processing stp th recipient of check is paid electronically by debiting the payers bank account as soon as the check is presented the check 21 provisions fall short of stp c onsequently the cost savings ar not as great as some other alternative electronic clearing processes such as automate d clearinghouse or debit and credit card payments one of the few accounts of the feds experience with check 21 was given by the federal reserve boards vice chairman donald l kohn at the western payments alliance 2006 payment symposium he said the following not only are more payments being made electronically but more check payments are also being processed electronically in part because of the check clearing for the 21st century act or check 21 clearly check 21 has begun to diminish the importance of geography and physical transportation in check processing and banks have startedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22525crs4 4 donald l kohn vice chairman of the federa l reserve board of governors of the federal reserve system evolution of the retail payments and the role of the

chairman kohn went on to recognize th rapid widespread growth of electronic payments since check 21 took effect and not ed that privatesect or service providers offering check 21 services are also experienci ng rapid growth in volume however he confirmed that in july 2006 only about 4 of the reserve banks daily volume or about 15 million checks was presented to paying banks in electronic check 21 files4 the already declining use of checks the decline in consumer check writing and the growing use of check image replacement documents irds has led to the closing of papercheckclearing offices including those at the fed the fed closed 13 of its 45 checkclearing centers in 20035 and announced plans to shut down nine more in 2005 and 20066 the fed projects that in 2008 it will have only eighteen ch eckprocessing centers nationwide7 s consequence of the expected decline in the use of checks the fed has increased its fees for processing checks by almost 8 to cover the increased cost per check cleared8 the decline in the number of checks being proce ssed is not entirely due to the implemented check 21 but is due more to the growin g popularity of alterna tive payment methods including ach payments in addition because of the rapid consolidation taking place in the banking industry more checks are being cleared inside the megabanks as internal settlements automatic clearinghouse payments are electr onic systems that are run by the fed and private banking organizations they ar mainly large volume electronic payments systems that enable corporations and consum ers to make electronic payments payroll recurring bill payments and social security benefits are examples of typical ach payments normally achs send or re ceive payments from payment centers9 today

paper check processing10 table 2 shows 77 growth in ach payments between 2000 nd 2004 but other electronically based payments have grown as well debit car d transactions grew 137 and credit card payments grew 21 in the same period banks adaptation to check 21 in 2006 the feds experiences suggest that check 21 is not being adopted rapidly enough to significantly accelerate the decline in the number of checks being processed in back offices the major banks such as citibank bank of america and wells fargo have increased their use of electronic check clearing among themselves their rapid adoption of the technology to make image replacement documents has led to patent infringement cases that are being settled by many big banks11 large banks are better able to afford and reap the benefits from the initia l cost of the devices used in producing the substitute checks image replacement documents experts expected that most smaller banks would not have the necessary technology installed to generate substitute checks and the cost of acquiring the technology w ould stop them from participating in the check 21 process at first in 2003 an ird cost bout 510 cents per item making the substitute check more costly to clear than paper check12 without more recent cost data available one expects the costs have been declinin g because of growing competition among the venders of the hardware and software for check conversion and outsourcing electronic checkprocessing t echnology is being developed that excludes the check 21 process the electronic payments association nacha has changed its rule to allow banks and retailers to convert checks to ach debits in their back offices while this process is consistent with check 21 in rms of clearing checks electronically it does not use the substitute checks instead with this process banks can create an ach debit from paper check at the retailer or in the back office13 another alternative to the substitute check is envelopefree atms customers are now able to deposit checks into their bank accounts by scanning them at these atms the deposited checks are then cleared electronically this technology is being intr oduced by large banks such as wells fargo and bank of america but smaller banks checks are also being cleared through this process14 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22525crs6 15 see bank administration institute bai check 21 industry readiness october survey results oct 20 2004 p 6 at httpwwwbaior gcheck21survey resultsindexasp 16 check truncation occurs when the check is stopped before it reaches the paying bank and the checkclearing process is completed electronica lly in some check truncation processes the paperwork is not eliminated following the elec tronic payment the check is sent to the paying bank if paperwork is required to complete the process there will be less cost savings many depository institutions have b een slow in agreeing to accept check presentments electronically because of the complexity of integrating the various forms of presentments paper electronic nd ird in backoffice processing15 for banks receiving the substitute check s backoffice paperwork opera tions including the sorting and handling are not eliminated banks will still need their backoffice operations and they may have to make additional investme nts to accommodate efficient management of the substitute checks along with the original checks some bankers believe that they should wait until straightthrough processing stp becomes more popular stp is an entirely electronic clearing environment that combines checks into the same stream as debit and credit cards as does the envelopefree atm mentioned above on the other hand specific benefits under check 21 include offering customers new and better services for example some ba nks may offer their business customers the ability to truncate16 checks and deposit them electronically banks are now able to set laterintheday cutoff hour for check depo sits because they can transmit checks electronically from their branches to their central processing facilities for collection these efficiencies if banks are willing could be passed on to customers as improved funds availability conclusion the payments system is rapidly becoming more efficient because of the growing popularity of methods which clear and settle payments electronically automatic clearinghouse and debit and credit card methods of payment have grown on average over 40 per year since 2000 the check 21 act establishes an electronic checkclearing mechanism in which banks may voluntarily generate image replacement documents in place of checks however banks faced w ith expensive technology adoption costs especially smaller banks have been reluctant to embrace check 21 moreover customers declining use of checks could make the investment even less attractive to banks large banks with millions of checking accounts are expected to be the greatest beneficiaries of check 21 fewe r small banks are expected to adopt it because they would have to increase their technology spending far beyond their expenditures now even with the expectation of capturing fewer benefits as the use of checks declines in sum check 21 places the checkclearing process in what might be called way station between paper check clearing and the adoption of fully electronic processing fully electronic clearing is favored by banks and recipients of funds because it is faster nd less prone to error however because paper checks remain the most popular noncash method of payment in transactions volume and value banks and customers could still find check 21 beneficial in the interim
