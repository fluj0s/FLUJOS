problemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs208741 some shocked at tax bills on options by carrie johnson washington post march 16 2001 p e1 2 another issue that had been raised about statutory stock options is whether the irs would require employers to withhold income and social security taxes on exercise or disposition the social security tax issue was less important when there was ceiling on medicare taxes and when options tended to be confined largely to high er income individuals this issue was settled temporarily when the irs issued ruling 200114 on february 5 2001 indicating that withholding would be imposed before 2003 on june 25 2002 the ir s indicated that it decided to abandon proposals to withhold these taxes congressional research service the library of congresscrs report for congress received through the crs weborder code rs20874 updated january 30 2003 taxes and incentive stock options jane g gravelle senior specialist in economic policy government and finance division summary cases of individuals who have incurred large tax liabilities from the exercise of stock options and who because of falling stock prices had earnings have caused some concern this effect arises from the impact of the alternative minimum tax amt there are variety of potential legislative remedies that could be considered to rectify this problem this report will be updated to refl ect legislative developments during the 107th congress the issue arose of individuals with stock options who have incurred significant tax liability from exercising their stock options but who have not sold their stocks and might recognize relatively small returns from selling an article in the washington post highlighted number of cases of individuals who owed large tax liabilities on stock that had not earned them any return1 this outcome may arise from lack of taxpayer awareness of the treatment of certain class of options statutory options under the alternative minimum tax amt whic h in combination with other rules can cause large tax liability that cannot be offset with an offsetting loss when the stock price falls2 stock option confers future right to pur chase stock at stated price stock option has value even if the right to purchase it is set at the current price because purchase can be delayed and the stock may rise in value st ock options can result in tax consequences that depend on the type of stock options qualified statutory and non qualified httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20874crs2 3 for example the plan must be approved by stockholders and the employee who receives the options cannot own more than 10 of vo ting stock options cannot be traded nonqualified options nqsos there are three stages to stock option when the option is granted or given to the employee when the option is exercised w hen the employee purchases the stock and when the stock is sold by the employee fo r example consider stock that is currently worth 50 the firm can grant the individual th option to purchase stoc k at that price any time in the future the option has some va lue because the individual can wait to see if the stock price rises before purchasing suppose the stock rises to 100 and the employee exercises his option he can buy stock wo rth 100 for 50 if the stock price fell he would obviously not exercise the option fina lly he can sell the stock at that point or in the future perhaps when the stock has risen further nonqualified options can in theory result in taxation when granted but in practice most stock options are not traded in market where value can be established otherwise the value of the stock option the market valu minus purchase price is taxed as ordinary income in the year the exercise takes place and the firm deducts the cost at the same time for example if the option price is 50 and the market value is 100 50 100 minus 50 is subject to tax the firm however also deducts the 50 so that the consequence for tax revenues is the same as that which would occur if the firm simply paid wages and the employee used the wages to purchase stock any future appreciation in value is taxed at the lower capital gains rate if held for at least year for example if the stock price rises to 150 after year and the employee sells he will have 50 long term gain 150 minus 100 taxed at max imum rate of 20 wh ich would be below ordinary rates but he could have obtained the same tax effect by selling and repurchasing the stock on the same day as the exercise essentially the only potential tax advantage associated with nonqualified st ock is that the value of the option is not usually taxed when the option is granted and taxes are delayed qualified statutory options and incentive stock options isos qualified stock options receive more favor able treatment for the individual but not for the firm and are attractive to new firms in part for that reason there are two forms of qualified stock options st ock purchase plans that allow all qualified employees to purchase stock at discount and incentive stoc k options which specify certain individuals as eligible the latter is often used as method of attracting tale nted individuals and giving them performance incentive the issues discussed here relate largely to incentive stock options incentive stock options are subject to variety of rules and restrictions3 among them the requirement that options be granted at fair market value qualified options are not subject to tax when exercised and qualify for lower capital gains tax rates if held for year since the option is granted at the current fair market value any difference between purchase price and sales price when sold is taxed at lower capital gains tax rates forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20874crs3 4 this sale could cause him to forgo capital gain s treatment if he had the stock for year since exercise but less than 2 years since the grant 5 without this rule income would be reco gnized on the difference between 100 and 50 and capital loss for the difference between 100 and 60 would occur at the time of sale capital losses are subject to limits only 3000 per year can offset ordinary incomeindividuals in the 28 bracket and higher ga ins are taxed at 20 rate while ordinary tax rates can be as high as 396 the fi rm however cannot deduc t these costs for startup firms that expect to have long lay before taxes are due this disallowance of the deduction may be unimportant qualified stock options to retain their benefits cannot be sold within 2 years of granting and one year of exercise if they are sold prematurely ordinary tax rates apply thus in general the best approach is to hold on to stocks at least long enough to qualify for capital gains rates if the price starts to fall and an individual decides to sell his stoc k before the required holding periods expire this sale triggers ordi nary tax treatment in the year of the sale4 however there is tax rule that allows the gain to be based on the lower of fair market value at sale or value at time of exercise thus if the value of the stock fell from 100 to 60 the individual who exercised options at 50 would pay tax at ordinary rates on the difference between 60 and 50 if he sold th stock at 60 even though the difference at the time of exercise was th difference between 100 and 505 this rule means that the income will always reflect the difference between option price and actual sales price matter when the stock is sold isos and the amt qualified stock options are included in the alternative minimum tax if an individual has very large earnings from the exercise of stock options this treatment can push him into the minimum tax and large liability can accrue under the minimum tax the year the option is exercised since the minimum tax has an exemption of 45000 for joint returns and 33750 for singles income in general and income due to stock options in particular must be relatively high to trigger serious amt consequence however there is also rule that allows valuation at the lower of market value at exercise or market value at sale but in this case the rule applies only if the sale and exercise occur in the same tax year thus it is possible to have liability for an alternative minimum tax in one year to have the stock fall and have assets to pay the liability in our previous example if the sale did not fall into these rules the stock would be subject to alternative minimum tax in the year exercised on the difference between 100 and 50 but loss would be recognized for the difference between 100 and 60 loss that could potentially be limited to 3000 the maximum amount that capital losses can offset ordinary income in year in the extreme case consider the stock falling to zero but valued at 100 when exercised the indi vidual will incur liability under the amt on the gain of 50 per share after taking in to account exemptions but have way of raising any funds to pay the tax the em ployer would not have under current rules withheld taxes on these amounts httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20874crs4 there is credit for prior year minimum taxes in excess of regular taxes that accrues when the taxpayer returns to the regular tax system such credit is necessary to prevent double taxation of items such as stock options that reflect timing the credit however is not refundable thus an individual who has very high income from options relative to his ordinary income may not have enough current tax liab ility to absorb most of the credit hence he could still be left with very large current tax liability that can only be slowly recovered through minimum tax credits part of the problem that has arisen w ith incentive stock options and the amt may be that individuals were not aware of the amt consequences and did not prepare for their tax liability by selling enough shar to be sure of being able to pay the tax and doing so within the same taxable year so as to qualify for the current fair market value rule this lack of awareness may be the reason that similar issues do not ar ise with nonqualified stock options which automatically generate tax liability when exercised it would be possible to accrue such liability and then ve your stock fall in value generating capital loss that is limited to offsetting 3000 of ordinary taxable income incentive stock options have however become very popular with new startup hightech firms with employees who may be less aware of tax issues possible legislative options there are several possible remedies to address this problem should congress wish to do so more publicity about the issue may help address future problems there are also legislative changes that could be considered one is simply to eliminate statutory stock options from the amt tax base anot her would be to provide an alternative valuation date for the amt that could go beyond the tax year in which the option was exercised as is provided in the case of non statutory stock options that would enable individuals who were not aware of the amt to sell and use lower price for purposes of the amt so that he or she would not be faced with large tax bill with means of paying it the amt credit could also be ma refundable although this change would be serious departure from ordinary tax pr actice or employers could be required to withhold taxes on statutory options
