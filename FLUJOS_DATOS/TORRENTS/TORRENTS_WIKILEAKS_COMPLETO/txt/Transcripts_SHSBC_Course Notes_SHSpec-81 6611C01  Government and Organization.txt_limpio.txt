6611c01 shspec81 government and organization good government is in the realm of invention at this point man is so afraid of bad turn in benign monarchy that he cant have one he is afraid of an sp getting into power also benign monarch cant wear all of his hats what makes government bad is that it gets an sp into it one sp breeds others as an sp wants other sps around him generals that advocate wars of attrition are sps they are just trying to knock off as many troops as possible the best military training is to do the most in the least time at the least expense and to keep your own people from being banged up the objective is to win that is the proper conduct of war you also want to inflict the least possible damage to the enemy because you will have to put the enemy back together again if you win this is proper war but the last four wars were wars of attrition all governments consist of body of beings against the individual the better government is the less against the individual and the more for the individual it is total suppression exists where the government is everything and the individual is nothing the opposite extreme can be equally suppressive anarchy where the individual is everything and the government is nothing in an anarchy any bum or suppressive is totally at liberty to knock anyone on the head there is perfect government the individual is as close as you will get to perfect entity why do you need government because any organization can win over individuals we thetans got to where we are today because we didnt organize as body of thetans instead we let the bad guys organize into body to get us this is the only big omission on the track ots didnt handle it on their own feet any group of organized humanoids can defeat any ot however this requires that one know something about the laws of organization without an organization the individual would have to maintain constant vigilance because he only has to lose one battle to lose everything you want an org that is minimally restrictive and maximally effective in benign monarchy the individual doesnt have to have much say because everything is taken care of when you turn over the government to group however confidence in the government is shaken and the individual must have say of course you dont let individuals make all the decisions this would lead to clown government individuals can all know enough to be meaningfully involved in every little thing there never has been democracy the greeks never had democracy just fifty landowners formed senate the senators didnt even represent anyone therefore it was not even republic republicanism is mean between the extremes if you make proper qualifications necessary for the holding of office eg that person not be below grade iv that person and other similar ones forming senate being specialists in the issues at stake could be sufficiently informed and have enough time to think about it to actually govern so if scientology took over you would have republican government after you have chosen the governor he is free to govern without any yak yak unless some weighty issue comes up for referendum eg change in the status quo or in the form of government englands failure to allow the american colonies representation in parliament was an error in tech that caused rift when group feels that it cant be heard it arc breaks this is the sort of arc break that always precedes war hitler said something that wasnt acknowledged and vice versa so thirty million men were killed in emergency situations benign monarch is the best system there is time to consult anyone anyway but in time benign monarch gets tired and overworked and he cant acknowledge everybody who speaks so unless he gets backed up by representative body you get dissolution of the organization the nominal head of the organization should be out of the way except in an emergency while the country is run by representative body corporate such body has great liabilities there is lack of total responsibility to the constituents so individuals in the group dont think fast enough therefore it is best not to have generalized body corporate running the government it must be specific in its representation unlike the pattern of board of directors each member of board of directors nebulously represents the stockholders however here there is crossrepresentation this generality goes into suppression if the people are represented then they could logically only be represented by one person that is why benign monarchy works there is crossrepresentation but as soon as the monarch gets body of advisors that doesnt represent the people more than one representative would have to represent exact segments of the population when too many people are represented by one person the distance becomes too great and the people feel unrepresented but if they can communicate with their representative and get action they feel that their governmental hat is well taken care of so they can relax the us has two senators per state this violates the above principle of representation electoral districts however do have direct representation there is further representation in state government which can receive certain orders from the federal government the us government however has representative in colorado it only has covert agencies there the colorado state assembly cannot address the us government there is direct line from the state assembly to the us assembly or the senate before you can have governmental system that is any good you have to have the tech of scientology to detect and improve abilities in people and ethics tech to detect suppressives you also need the communication formula arc triangle arc break tech etc if the people have senator why have representative the outcome is that the individual states and the us government are in violent conflict hence the civil war when these comm lines dont exist an individual goes into apathy you get dictatorship of the people vs the individual or you get situation where every man is the dictator representation can be pretty big because not everyone appeals at once but if everyone does appeal at once then the representative had better do something fast war is caused by incompetent government which causes breakdown in the comm line between constituent group and the society that surrounds it the society that surrounds it may be so incompetently governed that the inner group has to be nearly perfect to work its way forward scientology has this quality we also keep trying to be better at least whenever there is down statistic in scientology there are lots of builtin safeguards in the system so there is immediate need for elective representation in the future elections will be required when scientology gets bigger then exact representation will occur junior governing body may be given orders by any senior governing body in which it is not represented conversely very senior governing bodies should not give orders to junior governing bodies from which they do not have representative that ensures twoway communication situation the advisory council the international advisory council would be made up of representatives of continental parts of the world and executives who represent types of divisions of orgs it would have about fifteen members rule one may initiate motion unless that motion has been formed into an issuable directive if person wants policy letter framed he must write it up rule the chairman is given the power of absolute veto unless three quarters of those present vote to continue discussion or voting this will prevent endless hobbyhorsing proposal could be referred for special study elsewhere to be brought up later this way point of origin of policy letters is stated since that person wrote up the policy letter before it was passed members of the international advisory council represent the continental advisory councils but they also represent all orgs on that continent therefore someone from part of that continental area who feels that he is being done in or something could write to his representative in the international body as the system expands out the individual would find out that he had representative in his local continental body member of the ad council on majority signatures can get an urgent directive out on short notice provided b of i is convened later to determine if it was the right action unless policy change occurs an ad council directive is only in effect for year unless policy letter is issued the purpose of this rule is to prevent arbitrary laws from being arbitrarily introduced needlessly the advisory council has representatives from five continental areas plus one from st hill and divisional organizer for each division he represents every divisional secretary of that division in the whole world his job is to compile all the materials and specifications it is too much work for such person to do this and hold another hat at the same time so if person cant get books for instance he would write the div 2 divisional organizer if the stat of the divisional organizer is down he would get into being an authority he can get militant in the ad council the ad council can then issue what the divisional organizer has already written up in advance it is issued on the flash color of that division and it applies only to that division the divisional organizer is not operating those orgs so he does not act as bypass of the oes of those orgs conversely we will have the st hill or ww representative in continental ad councils lrh comm can also serve this purpose he has authority but he can be talked to and he can explain what ww is doing every divisional secretary in orgs becomes member of the ad council for that org the lrh comm is also on that orgs ad council to represent hco thus we get an eightman ad council sooner or later we will need representative of the ad council in each of the divisions of the org with continental org that has three other orgs plus itself you get four ad councils composed of secretaries and exec secs thus you get tenman ad council composed of the seven divisional heads plus the lrh comm plus the oes plus the has each junior org would have to have representative in the senior org we are dealing with basic ethics and organizational tech it really helps to have all beings in the org crosspoliced by stats stats dont ever happen they are always made and you have got to find out what is making them in downstat situation the errors are always gross the greatest source of downstats is personnel on thepost at all if you get stuck flow going on for too long with return flow you get an apathy on the other end cf the so 1 line people want to talk to lrh to find out if he is there it is to get the backflow going the main problem is in the relationship between the individual and the corporate body corporate body that cant act swiftly will cause lot of upset situation where any citizen can clobber the corporate body is equally suppressive because that person will also clobber other individuals the problem is to set up something that resolves the relationship between the corporate body and the individual 1 the individual must be able to get justice from the corporate body 2 he is entitled to bright management 3 the corporate body can expect contribution and compliance from the individual all it takes to make an organization is to avoid violating these when you get the consent of the people and respect for the government the thing will go on and on on other planets empire selection of governors was based on state of case when you put in government put in review of that government this happened to some extent in the us with amendments to the constitution but one reported back to the original body that created the government governed people who do not understand the theories or postulates of the government or the laws can be pretty dismayed and confused they are afraid that the relationship between the government and the individual will not be safeguarded they may even be represented and dont know it
