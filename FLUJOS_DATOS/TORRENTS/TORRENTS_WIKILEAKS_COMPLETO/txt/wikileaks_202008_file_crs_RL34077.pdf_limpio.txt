mandatory spending by 750 million over the period covering fy2007 through fy2012 as required these committees reported reconciliation recommendations producing the required savings to their parent chamber prior to september 10 2007 each of the aforementioned authorizing committees marked up bill in june of 2007 with reconciliation recommendations that generate the required savings in mandatory spending each chamber also considered broad set of higher education act hea amendments in conjunction with the reconciliation proposals under each bill the required savings are achieved through cuts in payments to federal family education loan ffel program lenders and guaranty agencies both bills generate substantially higher levels of savings in mandatory spending than required by the reconciliation directive and the additional savings offset costs associated with broad array of new or enhanced student aid benefits on june 25 2007 the house committee on education and labor reported

the house and senate approved the conference report hrept 110153 on sconres 21 the concurrent resolution on the fy2008 budget on may 17 2007 the annual concurrent resolution sets forth the congressional budget when the federal deficit is expected to be large budget resolutions often require reductions in mandatory spending in such instances the budget resolution issues reconciliation instructions that require authorizing committees to report changes to legislation to reduce spending on mandatory programs under their jurisdiction the fy2008 budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions that direct authorizing committees to report legislation to reduce mandatory spending for the period fy2007fy2012 subsequently these proposals were required to be reported by each committee to its parent chamber under the reconciliation instructions the house committee on education and labor and the senate committee on health education labor and pensions were responsible for reduction of 750 million for fy2007fy2012 the federal family education loan ffel program and the william d ford direct loan dl program are two of the major mandatory programs under each committees jurisdiction each committee has looked to reduce mandatory spending on these federal student loan programs to meet the requirements of recent budget reconciliations to meet the requirements of the fy2008 reconciliation instructions changes to the ffel program were made to achieve reductions in mandatory spending these reductions in mandatory spending are sufficiently large that they offset broad array of new and enhanced student aid benefits g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g21g157g158g141g142g151g157g561g14g152g138g151g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 the federal government operates two major studen t loan programs the federal family education loan program authorized by part b of title iv of the higher education act hea and the william d ford direct loan program authorized by part d of title iv of the hea these programs make available loans to undergraduate and graduate students and the parents of undergraduate students to help them finance the costs of postsecondary education under the ffel program loan capital is provided by private lenders and the federal government guarantees lenders against loss through borrower default death permanent disability or in limited instances bankruptcy under the dl program operated through the us department of education ed the federal government provides the loans to students and their families using federal capital ie funds from the us treasury the two programs rely on different sources of capital and different administrative structures but essentially disburse the same set of loans 1 the dl program established in 1993 was intended to streamline the student loan delivery system and achieve cost savings while the dl program was originally introduced to gradually expand and replace the longstanding ffel program

currently both programs are authorized and the two programs compet for student loan business in fy2007 these programs provided 639 billion in new loans to students and their parents in that year the ffel program provided 11359000 new loans averaging approximately 4494 each and the dl program provided 2791000 new loans averaging approximately 4603 each

provided for these programs on permanent indefinite basis not subject to appropriations the fiscal year cost estimates for both programs under terms of the credit reform act of 1990 are calculated by determining the net present value of the costs to the government over the lifetime of new loans disbursed in the given fiscal year under credit reform an effort is made to capture in the year in which credit is provided the multiyear net cash flows associated with new cohort of direct or guaranteed loans this calculation establishes subsidy cost which is the estimated longterm cost to the government of direct or guaranteed loan in calculating the subsidy costs for the two progra ms the main cost components are the interest benefits to students in the subsidized stafford loan program the special allowance payments to lenders 2 and defaults subsidy cost calculations are highly dependent on interest rate forecasts over the life of the loans and therefore can vary significantly depending on these forecasts in order to achieve savings in mandatory spending on the loan programs congress has often cut loan subsidies or introduced fees to generate funds that offset mandatory spending each year the congressional budget office cbo issues baseline budget forecasting estimated spending over 10year period under current law assuming policy changes are enacted over that time period the cbo baseline serves as benchmark for budgetary analyses when legislation that would affect mandatory spending is introduced its budgetary impact is measured against the cbo baseline the current cbo baseline projects that over the 20082012 period the federal student loan programs would guarantee or disburse about 406 billion in new loans costing about 212 billion 3

the fy2008 budget reconciliation instructions for the house committee on education and labor and the senate committee on health education labor and pensions and enacted in pl 11084 are achieved through changes to the ffel program in addition the savings achieved through these changes are sufficiently large to offset number of new or enhanced student financial aid benefits 2 the special allowance payment sap amount is determined on quarterly basis by statutory formula that is tied to financial index and ensures lenders receive at minimum specified level of interest income on loans the special allowance is designed to compensate lenders for the differen ce between the statutorily established interest rate charged to borrowers and marketindexed interest rate that is intended as fair market compensation on the loan asset 3 us congressional budget office memorandum cbo march 2007 baseline projections for the student loan and grant programs march 2 2007 tables 1 and 2 at

reconciliation bills student loan provisions produce total of 204 billion in savings in mandatory spending over the 20082012 period and 411 billion over the 20082017 period the 750 million in required savings over the 20072012 period is met and the net savings is roughly 28 billion over the 20082012 period nd 35 billion over the 20082017 period in this instance net savings refers to savings not being used to support specified mandatory spending however it was only necessary to generate 750 million in required savings over the 20072012 period to meet the requirements of the reconciliation directives much of the additional savings roughly 176 billion over the 20082012 period and 376 billion over the 20082017 period would be used to support series of new or enhanced student aid benefits included in hr 2669 4 the principal savings provisions included in the house reconciliation bill would effective october 1 2007 change the formulas used to calculate lender yields on student loans
