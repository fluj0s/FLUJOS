important milestone in its development this year marks its tenth anniversary this book is therefore an important contribution to the strategic debate looking ahead to where esdp could and should be ten years from now it covers the range of key issues that we need to consider in taking esdp forward into its second decade policy analysis of challenges strategy partnerships structures and capabilities the eu today plays crucial role in bringing stability to different parts of the world over the past ten years esdp has contributed to this through 22 sions in four of the worlds continents the eu has proved the credibility of its military capability on the ground in africa in congo and chad it has proved its unique civilmilitary capability in the balkans and it further demonstrated its relevance as well as the eus capacity for immediate action when the political will is there when we deployed over 200 unarmed monitors to georgia as part of the eubrokered peace agreement following the war between russia and georgia last year development of esdps crisis management capacity is crucial to the objective of strengthening the eu as global actor and contributing effectively to international peace and security therefore esdp has an important role in the management of global challenges that the world looks to us for this is evidenced by the fact that we are increasingly in demand the strength of esdp derives from its consensual basis which lends it moral and legal legitimacy missions undertaken in the framework of esdp are not based on single states interests but on collective and consensual ethos motivated by concern for the common good whether this be for example improv ing the situation in congo for victims of sexual violence or bringing stability to the people of somalia and ensuring they can better manage their territorial wa ters and exclusive economic zone eez the logic underpinning esdp its unique and distinctive civilmilitary approach to crisis management was ahead of its time when conceived that logic has proved its validity and has been adopted widely by others it provides sound basis on which to approach the coming ten years lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 we must strengthen our comprehensive nature and cohesion beyond the level of rhetoric and ensure that our esdp actions are ﬁrmly anchored in political strate gies our member states each have different history and geography we must improve our ability to channel the richness of this diversity in support of our political engagement in other parts of the world the strengths of one member state must become source of strength for the others and for eu action member states our strategic partners and partner organisations acknowledge the value of having strong eu able to engage in crisis management and contribute to the promotion of security and stability in the world civmil synergies must be further developed as must our civciv synergies as these are part of the add ed value of the eu our institutions decisionmaking processes and command structures must be ﬂexible able to respond quickly and ﬁt for the purpose of our future challenges and our comprehensive method of engagement the lisbon treaty will give us new momentum in this direction and the potential to do more and to act more cohesively and with greater ﬂexibility but this will not come eas ily how it unfolds in terms of implementation will depend on the political will of member states and solidarity between them the will of the larger member states to remain committed in way that is commensurate with their size and the will of the smaller member states to continue to contribute to the diversity and global perspective of the eu the european security strategy ess will provide our strategic framework well into the next decade the world as envisaged in the ess necessitates that we are much better able to anticipate events and adopt more sophisticated approach to conﬂict prevention in due course our analysis and developments will enable us to see with more clarity what is required of us in meeting the challenges foreseen the future is already upon us we are already familiar with issues of ecological protection and ﬂow security described in this book eg in relation to the pi racy activities off the coast of somalia which originate from somali ﬁshermen protecting their ﬁshing stocks the eu launched its counterpiracy operation eu navfor atalanta last year to tackle the immediate effects of this and we are also looking at what it can do to address the root causes we must have the personnel and capabilities both civilian and military to back up these political ambitions the current gap between ambitions and reality must be addressed for our future credibility in world where we must be ready to engage in more complex and risky endeavours it is imperative that we become more efﬁcient at procuring and deploying equipment and personnel striving for greater european defence integration and cooperation is corollary of this memegzvxz ber states should continue to support the european defence agency eda in its efforts to lead this process i am convinced that in an uncertain world of fast changing dynamics and threats the more we do together the more efﬁcient we are and the stronger and safer europe will be the eu has several strategic partnerships to foster and balance esdp is an im portant element of this canada norway russia turkey and the us are all tributors to our missions this has the value of broadening the consensus for our action furthermore our interaction with partner organisations the nato the osce and the au is vitally important we must ﬁnd ways to strengthen these relationships to ensure that interaction in esdp is as efﬁcient as it needs to be the eitheror eunato debate is outdated the eu is not military alli ance and the added value of the broader euesdp approach to security has been amply demonstrated the key issue now is to develop more ﬂexible framework for working together the world will remain constantly in ﬂux we must therefore remain adaptable in terms of our engagement what is now possible between the eu and us was not possible until recently but we must also remain consistent in terms of the pursuit and application of our principles liberty democracy respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law these core values will re main as fundamental in 2020 as they are today we have come long way in developing esdp as tool enabling europe to project itself through action in response to crises esdp is longer an aspiration it is reality the process of moving forward of evolving and growing stronger has not been as fast as some would have hoped but it is nevertheless an everadvancing process this book makes signiﬁcant contribution to the debate on the future of esdp and the implications of what the lisbon treaty could and should bring to it identifying the obstacles to progress and solutions for addressing them i am grateful to the euiss for this important initiative and to the contributors for their valuable input vkzghdavcv 7gjhhzahjczcigdyjxidcä

follow in june as some ﬁfteen hundred mainly french soldiers led by general bruno neveux were dispatched in record time to the democratic republic of the congo to break the siege laid to the city of bunia esdp was thus adding ﬂesh to the bones of the policy laid out some ten years ago at the 45 june 1999 european council meeting in cologne bringing esdp into existence was meant by european leaders to convey message of never again and to mark departure from past dramatic failures to check even the ugliest manifestations of resurgent extreme nationalism epitomised by the inability to stop genocide in srebrenica in 1995 it was the bosnia trauma and its bitter lessons that led france and britain to join forces and sign the st malo declaration towards the end of 1998 resolving to put aside their differences and set european defence in motion in move designed to give the eu au tonomy and credibility and to add muscle to european military cooperation the fact that esdp did indeed see the light of day signiﬁes that europeans were ﬁnally ready to overcome the taboo surrounding defence that had existed since the failure in 1954 of the european defence community the aim of the present volume is to examine what europes own ambition in security and defence matters could be in the next ten years or more appropriately perhaps to seek to deﬁne what that ambition should be and how it should translate into politics and poli cies we go to press however without foreknowledge of whether the lisbon treaty will ever come into being without full appreciation of how defence options and budgets will be affected by the world economic crisis whether this is in full swing or already re ceding and more importantly without knowing how global and indeed european power sharing will be reshaped as result more than we can foretell whether paris and london will ever be able to ﬁnd in tandem the inspiration and commonality of vision lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 that would give second life to the spirit of st malo just as decisive for the future of the eu as world player the success or failure of the obama experiment in the united states is equally unpredictable will the multilateral vision be turned into political real ity will it be up to the task of multilateralising multipolarity and thus bringing about world governed by norms and rules somewhere in the future creating the most favour able perhaps the only environment allowing for the european model to entirely fulﬁl its promise or are we moving anticlockwise slipping back in spite of our best joint efforts into truly multipolar world shaped by the strains and inherent dangers of big power competition there can of course be deﬁnite answers to questions whose outcomes lie in the future even if they are being determined in the present and yet these are the relatively simple ones in that we know already that they need to be formulated and require some form of answer in order to tackle the issues addressed in the following pages there are the more complex ones arising from sheer unknowns the entirely unforeseeable develop ments that may yet come to shape the international system perhaps even more decisively and the eu and its future with it and we do not know exactly what might be the trigger of such unknowns because the present complexities and intricacies of international rela tions or rather their determining factors are difﬁcult to grasp and there is high level of unpredictability what will their implications be for the greatpower dreams including those still enter tained by certain eu member states not only are such ambitions contrary to the essence of commitment to the eu ideal but they are also totally unrealistic since in world of great powers come true the most powerful european states without the backing of the union would at best count as mediumsized players1 nicolas sarkozy was made acutely aware of this during his term at the helm of the eu presidency when the prominence of france on the world stage notably during the war in georgia was contingent on the abil ity to mobilise the eus soft power bringing the weight of economic relations to bear on russia and ﬁelding an esdp monitoring mission to georgia at the height of the crisis 6cdwazvbwidc we have neither the wish nor the power to predict the future looking into the future is ﬁrst and foremost almost without exception an exercise reﬂecting what one would like to happen based on what we know now we set out to outline what should be realistic ambition for meaningful eu defence cooperation that is to say for esdp claudefrance 1 see álvaro vasconcelos lunion européenne parmi grandes puissances commentaire 104 hiver 20089ûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh arnould reminds us of montesquieus words when properly directed noble ambition is sentiment useful to society in the case of the eu noble ambition constitutes the essence of the european process itself when after the dreams of political union and european defence were shattered in 1954 jean monnet and robert schuman proceeded with small steps along path of gradualism the ambition was the same and just as enor mous to bring peace to europe to do away with the then established belief that war was natural and legitimate continuation of politics by other means ambition in fact farreaching noble ambition was from the beginning an essential ingredient of the eu ropean project and concomitantly its driving force the european union is not however about the past it is clearly construction against the past looking to the future and in perpetual devenir that is why the ultimate goal the socalled ﬁnalité tied to its intrinsic openendedness is left undeﬁned in attempting to set forth what should be the ambition of europeans in the ﬁeld of security and defence we have asked leading experts and practitioners of esdp some serving in the council the commission and parliament as well as number of academics and politicians to address set of ten speciﬁc questions the topics include the nature of esdp missions and their geographical scope intraeuropean solidarity and relations with nato esdp goals and capacities the creation of european defence market the question of from where esdp derives its legitimacy the issues of values and autonomy coherence and ﬂexibility the limits of the exercise are those of the european union itself and of its international identity knowing what the eu is not is just as essential as knowing what it is where it is headed and what it might become this is the reason why we should brieﬂy ponder before surveying the different chapters in this volume and the conclusions to be drawn from the different perspectives they present on the likely and hopefully positive evo lution of european power in the years to come and on the challenges of the emerging mulitpolar order cdcdgbvikzedlzglidjiègzvaedlzgé the european unions international identity will reﬂect its internal identity more and less and this duality will shape both the european vision for the international system the grand strategy and its foreign policy orientations and of course also esdp the present and future ability of the eu to project military force cannot be analysed or designed and shaped as if the european union was exactly the same as the united states or china for that matter as jolyon howorth suggests the distinctiveness of the eu lies in normsbased effective multilateralism and the promotion of world in which hulvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 man rights human security international institutions and international law will replace the law of the jungle the eu is already demonstrating empirically that it can conduct international relations differently this has led some to deﬁne the european union as an international public good2 it also explains why expectations placed in the eu by close and not so close neighbours remain high the obama revolution notwithstanding they will only tend to increase in the years ahead especially if the lisbon treaty ﬁnally sees the light of day the union must develop clear and common understanding of the present interna tional system and of the security challenges that it entails the european security strat egy of 2003 and the implementation report of 2008 are good basis for this as in both documents effective multilateralism is deﬁned as the linking thread of eu external ac tion but the eu needs to deﬁne larger strategic concept able to bring together all the dimensions of its external action and to ﬁnd the right balance between security and other global governance issues one of the characteristics of todays world is the improbability of military confrontation among the major global players this is an enormous op portunity to foster an international agenda not dominated by security concerns but by human development ones including the protection of the individual against violence of any kind this is very favourable climate for the eu to exercise its soft power to maintain its soft power to protect its power of attraction from inevitable erosion oth erwise the eu will need to avoid any form of securitisation of its policies in discourse as well as in real terms looking to 2020 however some will be tempted to say that since challenges are arguably shifting away as tomas ries points out in his chapter from the comparatively clear conﬁnes of state security into predominantly economic social and ecological spheres this should then imply that security options and concerns be equally as expansively deﬁned broadening the scope for justiﬁed legitimate use of eu military instruments as consequence let it be stressed again that the distinctiveness of the eu ropean union greatly depends on its sustained preference for soft power instruments for persuasion rather than force deviation from this rule in particular when confronting nonmilitary nonsecurity challenges of societal nature be they social economic ergy or environmentrelated would kill european distinctiveness altogether reliance on hard power to meet soft challenges rough equivalent of disproportionate response would not only be inconsistent with the lessons learnt from the european experience but sure recipe for alienating partners and pushing the goal of global governance well out of reach 2 celso lafer the european union an international public good issues euiss newsletter 24 november 2007ûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh the refusal to pursue security ﬁrstdriven international policy does not mean that the normative power of the eu in other words achieving its noble ambition does not crucially depend on its status as an international actor however nontraditional in possession of full range of policy instruments including signiﬁcant measure of hard power the need for balanced combination of both soft and hard power was an impor tant conclusion of the debates held around the convention on the future of europe that ultimately deﬁned the union as being based on the equilibrium between diversity and unity the balance on the other hand is to be struck by subsidiarity which can sim ply be described as doing together what is best done together and leaving to the capitals what they do best on their own the european union is community of states that have come together to shape and share common destiny it is based on deep association among individual states that have raised commonality and interdependence to stage where fragmentation or conﬂict become unthinkable nothing in the past or the current debate on the future of europe points to the union becoming over the next decade some superstate or superpower with an army modelled on the united states of america versely there is indication that its ambition goes further than just being giant tightly regulated marketplace though shrinking in relative terms the global trader only design if it ever really existed was swept away by the postcold war debate the war in the balkans and the drive to move forward to political union of national states there is another reason why europes ambition is different from that of most or even all current great powers the primary raison dêtre of the european project that of building space where peace and democracy reign supreme the defeat of extreme nationalism which led to the brutality and horror of world war ii has delegitimised nationalism as raymond aron noted many years ago and as consequence adherence to the european ideal means renouncing power politics but consistency demands that once power poli tics are abandoned domestically they be abandoned for good this obviously has enor mous consequences for the european defence endeavour building european army to pursue european interests by other means is not on the cards the european union will remain civilian power but hopefully one with commen surate military capability an easy prediction is that esdp will not transform itself into some kind of new nato military alliance predicated on collective defence at least as long as the united states will remain committed to the existential defence of european states there is reason to think it likely that the us commitment will vanish in the next decade it is true that strong expression of eu solidarity clearly alluding to fence is to be found in the lisbon treaty where article 427 states that should one of its member countries be the victim of armed aggression on its territory the other member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 power this is in sense an overstatement of basic principle of eu integration or as alexander stubb emphasises this conﬁrms the obvious for it is inconceivable that in the improbable event of an armed attack against any eu member state the others would remain passive and fail in their duty to extend solidarity but it does not mean that esdp is going to turn into military alliance since it is in way implied that assistance must be restricted solely to military means and military assistance in such remotely probable event would hardly need esdp to materialise membership of the european union col lective or joint military capabilities notwithstanding is in sense an existential deter rent of greater magnitude than esdp could ever be expected to provide the reality is that the european union is building esdp into security tool indispen sable to the conduct of foreign policy an instrument designed to promote eu interna tional standards that adds vital element to its ability to promote peace democracy and also it should be noted development in the years to come esdp will be expanding its missions to include disarmament and postconﬂict stabilisation the eus ability to play major role in crisismanagement is indeed instrumental in achieving many of its major goals esdp has been the recognised foreign policy deﬁcit notwithstanding an instrument of the broader strategic objectives of the union these are unlikely to change dramatically in the years ahead and may be outlined as follows first to bolster european integration itself as it widens and simultaneously deepens which means today in keeping with the decisions taken by the european council ex panding the union into the balkans and turkey setting the balkans on the road to europe and consolidating democratisation there would not have been possible without the stabilisation and ruleoflaw missions of esdp and this is certainly today the case for kosovo and bosnia turkey needs to become strongly involved in esdp and in european agencies like the eda second to bring about peace and support democraticallyminded political reform in its neighbourhood this obviously extends to the middle east and requires the ability to stop crises from degenerating into grave humanitarian disasters the union is already strongly engaged in africa in the framework of peace missions and in cooperation with the african union africa will certainly remain at the centrestage of the eus tribution to international peace in the years to come will eu ambitions remain predominantly regional and focused in particular on africa perceived as an extended southern neighbourhood or is the eu on the course to becoming global international and therefore security actor able to act wherever chalûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh lenges to international peace increasingly coincidental with internal peace will arise the answer remains unclear some will contend that the most important contribution to international peace consists of continentalwide integration and that if in the coming decade the union is able to extend peace and democracy by inclusion to its neighbour ing areas this would count as formidable achievement but others will argue as does general henri bentégeat that there is inevitably global dimension to the challenges the union must face and that it is unimaginable to reduce the diplomatic action which it is gradually reinventing by speaking with single voice on countless issues and by acting on behalf of 27 member states in more than 130 countries around the world to purely regional aspirations perhaps stronger reason that makes it inevitable for the union to take on global outreach is consequence of the ties with the vast euromediterranean space in its im mediate vicinity and more broadly the stakes in the global governance agenda sufﬁce to mention that the countries of the middle east including iran are among the eus neighbours that turkey is membership candidate and cyprus full member and there is little need for further proof that the challenges the eu faces are indeed global challeng that have bearing on the world order the union needs the full engagement of the united states and other major powers to satisfactorily deal with its international agenda and if the union wants to inﬂuence the world order then it also needs to strengthen ties with other global players this in turn requires global role that must necessarily include that of security provider this is crucial to relationship of equals with the united states who in particular expects europe to play major part in rebuilding afghanistan and indeed it is just as crucial for strategic partnershipbuilding with current and as piring world powers if the union remains excessively regionfocused when it comes to international security it will hardly be able to persuade others to live up to the interna tional responsibilities worldpower status implies in other words truly global status will inevitably require commensurate global security dimension in all probability the european union will remain faithful to its security doctrine which is generally considered to place human security at its heart since it is predicated on pro tecting civilians and on the responsibility to protect like all members of the internation community who in president obamas words must always be mindful that they share common humanity it must be ready to do all in its power to prevent crimes against humanity from being committed and to use force to stop mass atrocities as is stressed by richard wright and juha auvinen in their contribution one of the implications of this is the deployment of esdp operations in areas riskprone to mass atrocity crimes it is interesting to note in this regard that the council joint action on eulex kosovo is the ﬁrst example of such direct reference to the responsibility to protectlvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 the implication of this is that esdp is not just focused on peacekeeping operations but also increasingly on making peace in looking into the future and planning for it we should be aware that such deﬁnition of esdp does not mean risks will diminish or indeed that only lowintensity conﬂicts will need to be resolved nor does it provide an indication as to the number of troops that might be needed more than as to the scale and duration of military operations that the future may hold in store bosnia rwanda darfur congo or afghanistan all ﬁt into the parameters of implementing human curity concept and rising up to the responsibility to protect bosnia in the 1990s provides an illustration of the kinds of challenges that result from the eu taking up fully albeit belatedly the responsibility to protect as part of its international duties both keeping and making peace requires on the other hand strong civilian component this is an aspect of esdp that has grown signiﬁcantly in the past ten years bjaiavizgvahcbjaiedavgin the world is unquestionably multipolar although in an unprecedented way enormous interdependence creates common interest in regulated sound multilateral governance but at the same time gives rise to tension and possibly conﬂict energy interdependence between russia and the eu is good illustration of this the only way to avoid great world power game where the eu would soon be irrelevant is to build system of uni versally accepted rules and norms forming the basis for common efforts and sharing the burden of resolving global and regional issues this is what can be termed multilateralis ing multipolarity ie engaging global and major regional players in strategic coopera tion frameworks in order to act together3 there is other option for the eu to fulﬁl its ambition of playing major role in international politics to bring about peace and security the alliance with the us is as indispensable as it is insufﬁcient to deal with the most pressing issues for the eu if there is one predominant idea in all the essays in this volume it is that the world has changed dramatically and will change even more in the next ten years as result the west needs the rest foregone conclusion that already constituted one of the drivers of the 2003 european security strategy nato will not be the only option or even decisive one when it comes to dealing with international security issues the eus main partner outside nato may sometimes be the us but at other times it may be india or china the african union or latin america or even large coalition of states legitimised by the in the years to come the eu will need to learn how to develop esdp missions with the cooperation of other international actors this is already the case to certain extent with russia canada the united states norway 3 see álvaro vasconcelos multilateralising multipolarity in giovanni grevi and álvaro vasconcelos eds part nerships for effective multilateralism chaillot paper 109 paris euiss may 2008ûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh and turkey in all circumstances the ability of the union to speak with single voice in all international institutions will be precondition of its ability to come to terms with the extraordinary changes that multipolarity entails the advent of the obama era in the united states has opened window of opportunity for the european vision of effective multilateralism to come true the ﬁrst four years of the next decade will in this sense have decisive impact on the shape of the international order by 2020 common understanding with the united states on how to deal with to days multipolarity so as to avert concertofpower trends and check emerging balance ofpower impulses is doubtless ﬁrst priority this obviously implies that nato must never become or indeed be seen as an alliance of the west against the rest there is major inconsistency in demanding that china and russia take on their international responsibilities and proposing in the same stroke global nato that looks suspicious ly like military alliance of democracies against authoritarian states the revision of natos strategic concept in 2010 will be an opportunity to deﬁne natos role and to take stock of the speciﬁc civilianmilitary role of esdp the united sates is moving to wards strategic concept much closer to that of the european union where preemptive wars will disappear and resorting to military force will increasingly be envisaged in terms of lastresort necessity this is bound to have major implications for natos strategy europe needs to agree on common understanding regarding natos strategic concept the full integration of france into natos military command structure should not mean that esdp is made irrelevant but that complementarities and division of labour between the two can now be deﬁned in more consensual way technical relations between esdp and nato should be enhanced but it should be borne in mind that the eus primary strategic partner will remain the united states with whom we have bilateral agenda that is much broader than nato or even security issues nato should remain military alliance and not crisismanagement organisation the eu with its unique civilian com ponent will need to build strategic partnership with the united states that goes well beyond nato its content and the scope for cooperation is bound to have strong crisis management dimension with the us comeback as soft power provider the eu would be illadvised to think that it can continue to claim uniqueness in this ﬁeld signiﬁcant upgrade of euus security relations is made easier by the recognition by the us that strong upandrunning esdp is in americas interest and that the eu will increasingly act autonomously from nato for that as almost all the authors in this book point out the eu will need to establish fullyﬂedged european command to plan and conduct military operations there are many indications that the us understands this today as f stephen larrabee points out frances return to the military wing of nato should reduce the sense of suspicion and mistrust on both sides and make the establishment of lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 an eu planning capacity less contentious and easier to manage this in way implies that natoesdp cooperation should suffer as result in ten years time we will know if europe and indeed also the united sates will have proved able to overcome the old transatlantic paradigm and build comprehensive stra tegic partnership capable of fostering effective multilateralism or if old habits will have triumphed habits that have caused as nicole gnesotto points out the eunato re lationship to be major factor in the esdps stagnation and ultimately pretext for collective paralysis both in the union and in nato cdxgzywainlidjiazibvxnvcyzzxikzczhh the main conclusion from the following chapters is that the eu must address three basic deﬁcits as matter of priority and remain vigilant so as not to create fourth in order to realise its noble ambition in way that will be beneﬁcial to its own member states and to international society 1 the cfsp deﬁcit esdp is display of the eus foreign policy strengths as well as par adoxically of its weakness the fact is that it has proven easier for the european union to deploy troops and ﬁeld policemen than to deﬁne common positions and act on them as exempliﬁed in kosovo nicole gnesotto points out that the yawning gap between dps progress and the status quo in common foreign policy constitutes major handicap progress on defence has been much faster and higherproﬁle than progress on foreign policy this is amply demonstrated by for example the eu intervention in kosovo 2 the coherence and common knowledge deﬁcit if the strongest point of the union is the ability to combine wide variety of instruments there is recognised deﬁcit on the implementation side either between different eu institutions or also at times between eudeﬁned and member states policies nuno severiano teixeira points out the twin lack of common knowledge about security affairs and integrated strategies to frame the foreign action of the european union this can be addressed at two levels ﬁrst by promoting shared and integrated knowledge about security and by working jointly on developmentrelated issues and second by establishing multidisciplinary teams which pool expertise on inter alia defence foreign affairs development justice and home af fairs 3 the joint capabilities deﬁcit the lack of joint capabilities in direct contradiction of the esdp mission statement has negative impact on both the eus credibility and esdp effectiveness the 60000strong force intended to be readily deployable in 60 ûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh days under the terms of the headline goal adopted by the european council in helsinki in december 1999 which was to be operational by 2003 failed to fully materialise and the need for it has only recently been restated by the french eu presidency as noted by alexander weis equipment shortfalls identiﬁed from the outset remain critical in some areas there are 1700 helicopters in military inventories for instance yet many of these are not available for crisismanagement operations either due to lack of train ing or because technical requirements are not met this goes to show that what europe needs most is not to spend more on defence but rather to spend better and in more coordinated manner legitimacy at the heart of esdp legitimacy is central where defence is concerned this not an issue for esdp at present but one must remain mindful that it does not arise in the future today esdp enjoys high levels of support and is strongly backed by all national parliaments and by 76 percent of european public opinion with majority support in all 27 member states4 moreover it is based on sound multilateral legitimacy including increasingly stronger cooperation with the future developments may af fect the legitimacy equation indeed one of the most interesting developments for esdp envisaged in the lisbon treaty is the permanent structured cooperation open to lim ited number of able and willing member states as stefano silvestri argues while the intergovernmental nature of the decision making would not change esdp will become permanent feature of the eu political and institutional landscape whereas today the model is inclusive and open to all member states and this is crucial to ensuring euro pean legitimacy particularly important element in former african coloniesthe chad mission under irish command is good example of the critical importance of system that is inclusive to match eu soft power with hard power what joseph nye has called smart power5 the european construction project is difﬁcult compromise between gitimacy and efﬁciency sometimes apparently at least to the detriment of the latter it is very difﬁcult to think that this will not be the case in developing eu defence policy in the years to come the european parliament will be called upon to play more im portant role working in tandem with the national parliaments and it will be critical to ﬁnd the right interaction between both as jacek saryuszwolski says strengthening parliaments power in esdp would contribute to the stronger legitimacy of petersberg missions both at the european and national levels but this will not be enough we will still need to ﬁnd way fostering stronger european commitment in the national parlia 4 see eurobarometer standard the european union today and

review in democracy journal of ideas issue 2 fall 2006mentary defence committees which play major role in deﬁning the defence policies of their countries and in giving national legitimacy to the esdp missions crucial aspect due to the intergovernmental nature of european defence the future will look brighter perhaps if the lisbon treaty comes into in force and more favourable and balanced institutional environment is set in place much will continue to depend however on the ability of the eu its multifaceted mechanisms and ﬁrst and foremost its capitals to act consistently and coherently with the founding principles and universallyheld values that oblige the european union to act differently and persuade others ideally all others to act just as differently in the conduct of international rela tions ideally esdp should be in lesser demand in 2020 than it is today there could be better measure of its successevgi mezgihéezghezxikzhizczzydgvbdgzhigvizxj cxdazczhdiid ten years after its inception the european security and defence policy has delivered very mixed results while the success of this new union policy is unquestionable its omissions and failures are equally evident since 2003 which saw the ﬁrst union opera tion in bosnia and herzegovina the union has conducted 22 external military andor civilian operations in four of the ﬁve continents mobilising total of 10000 european troops and 4000 european police ofﬁcers at the same time the union continues to be perceived as marginal littleknown security player most often absent when it comes to settling the major strategic issues of the planet the progress that has been made is source of undeniable satisfaction but there is nonetheless keen frustration at the overall performance achieved on the basis of what past record and with view to what new ambitions can future for the union as major international security player rea sonably be built 7gzdkzgkzldizòghiyzxvyzdh9e ambitions for the future of the esdp can be identiﬁed without ﬁrst taking stock of its strengths and weaknesses over the past ten years the esdps added value lies ﬁrstly in the political legitimacy of operations undertaken by europe when the union acts on the world stage it does so by consensus its action is therefore indirectly sanctioned by nearly 500 million people single member state can lay claim to such legitimacy the fact that the union acts always under the aegis of the united nations also makes what it does more acceptable to the people of region in crisis than action undertaken in other frameworks individual nations ad hoc coalitions the atlantic alliance in the middle east and when it comes to stabilising crises in africa such added value is siderable as for european public opinion other union policies enjoy such massive and constant support on average 70 of europes citizens are in favour of the union playing greater role on the international stage this includes the countries whose governments are least enthusiastic about the esdp such as the united kingdom and poland the second advantage is the comprehensive nature of the unions competences for it is far more than just an alliance of military resources operations within the union framelvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 work come with the assurance of the availability of all possible nonmilitary crisis man agement resources reconstruction aid humanitarian aid development aid legal advice on reform of local governance etc in parallel with the purely military phase the union is in fact the worlds largest donor of development aid other organisation start ing with nato can offer such range of supplementary resources as for the member states none has the means to mobilise such extensive ﬁnancial resources within purely national framework so the complexity of modernday crises the fact that military inter vention is less and less effective in resolving conﬂicts and the importance of the phases of stabilisation and reconstruction of regions or entire countries make the european union key player ever more in demand to help preserve international stability on the other hand the sense of frustration regarding european defence stems from three handicaps that are less evident than its strengths firstly there is an increasing ly untenable mismatch between increasing demand from outside and the stagnation even shrinkage of the resources which member states make available to the union while the the african union the osce and nato are constantly calling on the unions crisis management capabilities the esdp has not even managed in ten years to establish any permanent pool of military or civilian forces worthy of the name the aim of 60000 strong force proclaimed back in 2001 had fallen into oblivion to such an extent that under the french presidency it had to be dusted off and presented as ma jor innovation it sometimes takes months of domestic negotiations before country agrees to make available police ofﬁcer or two for an esdp operation and this short age of resources is compounded by member states inability to agree on minimum of permanence the esdp remains in many ways virtual policy very few structures are permanent visible or embodied in building or lasting institution there is still european command joint manoeuvres on the ground standing units and the european college is nomadic institution with budget or statutes of its own the yawning gap between the esdps progress and the status quo in common foreign policy is second handicap and it is big one progress on defence has been much faster and higherproﬁle than progress on foreign policy the esdp has even acquired kind of autonomy as if it were some kind of european mininato unrelated to the unions common policies that explains why there is sometimes feeling that the esdp is just marking time what is the point of deploying forces outside the union if it does not give the union greater political inﬂuence in resolving crises does the union have common foreign policy on afghanistan did the missions to rafah and palestine allow the union any inﬂuence over the peace process with the notable exception of the conﬂict in geor gia in the summer of 2008 the esdp has all too often been used not as the instrument of common european policy objective but as substitute for policy itselfcxdazczhdiid thirdly an overwhelming sense of going nowhere and of déjà vu persists the united kingdom for all that it instigated the saint malo agreement ten years ago has cham pioned the esdp status quo in europe refusing to increase the budgets of the european defence agency to establish european command for the conduct of operations or to accept anything that might allow the esdp to emerge from its virtual world with remarkable consistency it has upheld an almost ideological opposition to any quantita tive or qualitative development of the esdp that might begin to tread however lightly on natos toes or inject even hint of strategic autonomy into the european union it does not matter whether the world changes from one day to the next whether america opts for one strategic direction or another whether globalisation profoundly alters the conditions of european security the same political or ideological constraints will keep on hampering the esdps development the eunato relationship has thus become major factor in the esdps stagnation and ultimately pretext for collective paralysis both in the union and in nato lnvgzhvbwidc4 it is comfortable paralysis of course and doubt not all member states will nec essarily feel need to relaunch european defence personal conviction aside on what grounds can the need for new phase in the unions quest for strategic identity be justiﬁed is there internationally or within the union itself groundswell for such fresh ambition at ﬁrst sight the reply must be less than positive of all the arguments in favour of the status quo or even of the gradual breaking up of the esdp there are two that hon esty demands be addressed the ﬁrst argument is major one for it relates to the new obama presidencys change of direction in us foreign and defence policy after decade of decline into unilateralism and militarism combined with authoritarian handling of relations with allies and disastrous track record in terms of the perception and reality of us power in the world barak obama is without doubt good news for the whole world against background of transatlantic reconciliation and of rapprochement of the strategic outlooks of the united states and europe the whole process consecrated by frances return to natos integrated military structure does common sense not dictate that our prime concern should henceforth be for the efﬁciency and vitality of this atlantic framework why duplicate in the union something that already exists and works in nato if our security is indivisible if france is once again on the same wavelength as the united states within what the french president has begun to call the western family why persist in trying to give the union the means to exert its strategic autonomy many would claim to have neither the means nor above all the need to do lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 so frances return to the nato fold does not therefore augur well for the mainte nance of europes defence ambitions and it is hard to see how more natominded france could induce the united kingdom to be more european bilateral partnership could of course be developed between the united states and the union for all the non military aspects of management of international security but in terms of defence and military intervention as such the temptation to leave it all to nato could well be overwhelming all the more so since obamas victory ushers in the possibility of new american leadership that is intelligent likeable even admirable making it even more difﬁcult for the european union to sustain its own strategic ambitions european fence could certainly progress but in an atlantic framework as the european pillar of nato not necessarily as an instrument essential to the political strengthening of the union itself the second argument in favour of the status quo lies in the severity of the economic crisis and recession that has befallen the entire world developed or not at time of belt tightening when the eus basic premise shared prosperity is being shattered more urgency must be attached to restoring the unions internal cohesion and power than to stepping up external action and creating european strategic power we cannot of course remain totally indifferent to the insecurity of others if only in the unions im mediate vicinity minimum of external operations and stabilisation of crises on the pe riphery will continue to be necessary and the esdp will still have its merits but there is compelling need to move on to new phase because resolving the crisis inside must take precedence over managing crises outside and it would make sound economic sense for the union to delegate even more responsibility for managing international security to nato public opinion would not understand it if the union were to waste its available resources on trying to secure an external power that now looks like luxury paradoxi cally then the scale of the economic crisis combined with the clear signs of reconcilia tion in the atlantic alliance could revive the cold war division of tasks with the union taking care of prosperity and nato of security this dual trend is undeniable and must be factored into any consideration of the future of the esdp policy which appears neither irreversible nor automatically des tined for glorious future however the prevailing gloom and doom does not nullify certain trends which conversely favour the emergence of new strategic ambition for the union the first relates to changes affecting security in globalised world the nonmilitary aspects of crises in terms of both the form they take and the way they are resolved have gained considerable importance over the past two decades is there still anyone who believes that the conflict in lebanon or the iranian issue will be resolved by military confrontation where afghanistan is concerned how can cxdazczhdiid anyone fail to recognise the inadequacy of strategies based solely on calculating the size of the opposing forces compounded by the emergence of global threats cli mate health crime terrorist networks etc the inadequacy and relative impact of the military option in crisis management have made the strategic modernity of the european framework clear to see with its various institutions the union has at its disposal all the resources required for overall management of crisis and for post conflict reconstruction the esdp being one link in this chain of resources natos added value in terms of the military aspects of security is of course incomparable but it has reconstruction budget civilian resources and commercial or legal competences visàvis third countries it is in the union that these components vital to the success of operations are to be found whether they like it or not europeans are more and more in demand for crisis management whether they perform it in the framework of the atlantic alliance on behalf of an euus partnership or under their own foreign policy will be the subject of major political debate but whatever the outcome europe will need genuine professional civilmilitary capability this is all more the case given that nothing in the current stateofplay in international affairs suggests that any improvement can be expected in the eus security environ ment over the next ten years the second trend conducive to renewal of the unions strategic ambitions is to be found in america whatever the merits of barak obama the strategic crisis in which the united states ﬁnds itself is profound and is doubtless destined to continue for long time for many reasons from its heavy level of indebtedness which will inevitably put strain on defence budgets to its priorities in iraq and afghanistan which will mobilise the bulk of its troops and resources the united states will longer be able to take responsibility for every regional crisis any more than it can on its own instil consensual dynamism into the international system this relativity of american power will mean that europeans will increasingly be required to manage crises for which the united states cannot or will not take responsibility to support and supplement us external action and to take re sponsibility for whole sections of the civilianmilitary management of this or that region in crisis the atlantic alliance for its part has found afghanistan its absolute priority as well perhaps as the limits of what can be done by an organisation that has changed hardly at all since the end of the cold war the priority nato gives to afghanistan leaves little room or resources for intervening elsewhere indeed nato has more and more need of the global power of the union to carry out its missions successfully for how long will europeans be able to avoid having to take greater responsibility for the management of external criseslvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 igzzegzgzfjhizhdghigzcizccizjcdcéhhigvizxvxidc in theory these various developments could give rise to two types of scenario for the fu ture of the esdp the lowproﬁle scenario would see the esdp gradually lose its military component to nato which would become the sole military intervention body with the possibility of development of european defence pillar being integrated within it in the union the esdp would continue to develop solely in the civilian sphere occasionally it would intervene in support of nato military interventions in the framework of an eu nato partnership in the highproﬁle scenario the union would continue to develop its military and civilian crisis management resources in the light of its own foreign policy objectives there could be technical cooperation with nato in the light of the require ments of any given crisis but the overall political and strategic partnership would be between the united states and the union it is of course the second hypothesis that this writer prefers it is doubt the most ex acting and hence the most improbable scenario but it is certainly not beyond reach if europeans still have minimum of ambition to succeed in the european enterprise ﬁrst undertaken 60 years ago three conditions must be fulﬁlled if europes role as security player is to be enhanced restoration of the esdp to its proper place ie as an instrument at the service of the s unions international role the esdp is not separate fourth pillar nor is it neutral military instrument some kind of toolbox for the use of either the union or nato it is not either the only criterion for measuring the unions international political role for the esdp is just part of what the union does as global security player it is therefore the unions political role on the international stage which must remain the aim and the priority the esdp is just one possible road to go down certainly not the primary or only one developments in international security make nonmilitary crisis management resources increasingly important and the union is the only organisa tion to possess the entire range of resources required economic legal humanitarian financial civil and military this throws its strategic modernity and hence its added value as global security institution into sharp relief definition of the unions role and ambition in the international system born of s globalisation if defence is an element of foreign policy the aims and collective aspirations of that policy must be clear apart from stabilisation of specific crises apart from the processes of enlargement and stabilisation of its periphery what else characterises the kind of international order the union wants what system of secucxdazczhdiid rity best serves europeans values and interests should defence and consolidation of the interests and leadership of the democratic west be the prime aim should europes strategic interests be modelled on those of america throwing european specificity to the winds or conversely should we accept that the tide of history has turned with the result that the power of the west is longer what it was and strive for global governance with the different hubs of power including our own coming together within set of collective rules and institutions in other words should the aim of european foreign policies be to shore up an ailing western supremacy and hance europes position within this system or on the contrary to share the elements of economic and political power with others until such time as the union clari fies its global strategic objectives until it sets itself priorities and stops responding piecemeal to requests from outside the esdp will almost certainly remain motley collection of military and civilian operations with real influence on the outcome of crises definition of the terms of new partnership between the united states and the s european union is the third priority neither the esdp nor nato is an autono mous political player the esdp must be first and foremost the civilmilitary in strument of the unions foreign policy and nato must remain the instrument of military solidarity between the united states and europe distinction therefore has to be made between on the one hand tactical and technical natoeu part nership necessary for certain crises but always ad hoc and temporary and on the other strategic partnership between the united states and the union built on more permanent political basis on range of subjects of common interest including military operations requiring nato involvement in other words if crisis requires military intervention and the united states decides to take part in the operation nato is the legitimate arm of intervention while union resources may be used to supplement the nato mission in the framework of an ad hoc natounion partnership and on the basis of joint euus strategy in all other cases ie where the military element is marginal or inoperative terrorism iran the israelipalestinian peace process for example or where the crisis is military but the united states decides not to intervene crises in africa in particular nato has role to play here responsibility lies either with strategic partnership to be estab lished between the us and the union or with the union alone in the framework of its security policylvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 izgilvndglvgy based on these political prerequisites the way forward could be as follows commit fully to consistency in the unions external action in the short term this would pre suppose that the lisbon treaty cfsp acquis be saved the provisions on the role and competences of the high representative the post of president of the european council and the creation of an integrated diplomatic service must without fail be implemented if the treaty is not ratiﬁed the european council should decide to act as matter of ur gency on the best legal means of implementing these three acquis looking ahead to 2020 however pure logic would demand that to ensure an efﬁcient and consistent integrated foreign and security policy the posts of president of the commission and president of the european council be merged switch from the virtual to the permanent from cooperation to integration discontinuity is not the right recipe for ensuring that the union is efﬁcient and professional in security matters twenty years after its inception the esdp must have foundation of permanent struc tures formal council of defence ministers chaired by the new high representative european defence college with its own premises and budget to train all personnel in common strategic culture of the union european command to plan and conduct the unions military operations alongside civilian command and an integrated civil military command capability joint manoeuvres on the ground for european forces number of permanent units should be set up sort of european armed rapidreaction miniforce one or more battlegroups the european corps civilian intervention force for natural crises and disasters european humanitarian intervention corps pool of civilian esdp ofﬁcers european logistical stocks particularly medical equipment last ly the speed of union action will also depend on having substantial european budget for esdp operations for use by the high representative acquire the means to have certain strategic autonomy if the union wants to be able to prevent crises to make difference in given operation to have credibility visàvis its american partner it must have the means to carry out its own threat analysis the esdp must therefore have military monitoring capabilities in space and be equipped with more pow erful forecasting and strategic analysis resources situation centre forecasting directorate with budget comparable to that of an american centre rationalisation of the gathering and processing of information from eu diplomatic posts worldwide in this respect the creation of common european diplomatic service is an absolute necessity herecxdazczhdiid legitimise europe as protector in every eu country the bulk of the population is increas ingly concerned about internal security issues protecting the environment and combat ing terrorism and organised crime in particular but the unions effectiveness as regards internal security suffers from compartmentalisation of the eus institutional pillars and tight political constraints failing to meet the expectations of european citizens ie be ing able to help if natural disaster occurs in baku but not if it happens in the hague or rome is an aberration it must be possible to use esdp military and civil resources in response to terrorism or natural disasters in the union whatever the future of the lis bon treaty the clause on solidarity in the event of terrorism or natural disaster must be implemented avoid getting sidetracked by the wrong issues there are two developments that appear politi cally impossible over the next ten years and hence should be ruled out the ﬁrst would be for the esdp to take charge of the unions collective territorial defence that in the view of the vast majority of europeans is and must remain the prime function of nato so long as the us continues to play the role of existential protector of the countries of europe the debate on the unions responsibility for its own defence is not worth start ing and there is little prospect of the us reneging on that basic tenet of nato by 2020 were it to happen however were doubt to creep in and cracks appear in europes security as result of developments in americas policy and in particular its attitude to nato the union would then have choice but to take full responsibility for its defence the second fallacious idea relates to ﬂexibility in the esdp it could admittedly be useful in an ever more diverse union to create coalitions of states more ready than others to carry out particular consensual mission or take the initiative for some type of advance in terms of armaments and military capabilities but the unions force lies in its collec tive decisionmaking and the solidarity of all once commitments are given this principle of collective responsibility is vital to the use of community resources and is at the root of the unions added value in crisis management to violate that principle for the sake of european minidefence which by deﬁnition would be nonconsensual would be to condemn it to real powerlessness8dcxajhdc with the continuous acceleration of history

unilateralist folly the excesses of ﬁnancial capitalism the extraordinary rise of the asian countries large scale enlargement but creeping crisis in the european institutions the resurgence of russian nationalism etc there is reason to believe that the next decade will be any less productive of strategic revolutions and surprises staying alert to international velopments is of course must for any political player deciding to play an active role and to shape rather than submit to globalisation trends is quite different undertaking if the european union refuses to confront this challenge if it abandons any attempt at collective inﬂuence on the course of events inter alia via an effective esdp questions will inevitably be asked about what purpose it actually servesbeazbzcicvègvcyhigvizné dandcdldgi since the end of the cold war academics and policy analysts have incessantly debated the issue of what sort of new world order is emerging the unipolar thesis according to which the us still reigns supreme in world affairs and will continue to do so for the fore seeable future has been most persuasively defended by dartmouth political scientists stephen brooks and william wohlforth1 the january 2009 issue of the journal world politics features lively debate about the characteristics and implications of unipolarity one conclusion is that the enduring unipole the us far from being status quo power as dominant powers in most world systems have tended to be is more likely to emerge as revisionist power we had foretaste of this under george w bush for those who believe that the system dictates policy more revisionism is likely to come matter who is us president the bipolar option has been expounded by the leading international economist c fred bergsten who argued in 2008 that the us should give true priority to china as its main partner in managing the world economy even if this means displacing europe2 the nonpolarity thesis has been put forward by the president of the us coun cil on foreign relations richard haass who foresees growing international chaos as us preponderance is replaced by an unstructured congeries of inﬂuences exerted by fusion of players states regional regimes ngos multinational corporations mncs institutions militias individuals large cities media outlets criminal gangs to name but few such an order he argues will have mostly negative consequences for the us and for much of the rest of the world as well3 so far from european perspective the pic ture looks bleak if we turn to those who detect multipolarity as the system of the future things do not get much better neorealists have always argued that unbalanced multipolarity is the most dangerous and warprone international system4 robert kagan in the return of his tory

powers all vying for status and inﬂuence rivalry overlaid by new forms of the old competi tion between liberalism and autocracy and by an even older struggle between radical islam and modern secularism all ushering in an age of divergence5 another vision of the multipolar world is provided by the quinquennial survey of the us national intel ligence council6 which predicts world of major

diminished7 the only relatively bright spot on the horizon in this brainstorming around the nature of the global system in the twentyﬁrst century comes from giovanni grevi who has coined the notion of interpolarity as the synthesis of multipolarity and interdependence he argues that every existing and rising power not to mention the rest of the world will be mightily constrained in the coming decades by the interconnectedness of all main policy areas the economy energy security environment and that the existential inter dependence of all these issues argues inexorably in favour of

and rule with barack obama the us and the eu can make warm declarations about shared values and can assert that together they can help solve most global problems but as obama made clear in strasbourg on 3 april 2009 this can only happen if the eu emerges as serious strategic partner for the us10 the us has many strategic partnerships to foster around the world and the prospect of uschina condominium is not entirely fanciful it is by means certain that president obama sees the eu relationship as the main priority for the us what he does want is an eu which can collectively bring something signiﬁcantly useful to the table that something need not necessarily be channelled via nato in deed it is more likely to be channelled via esdp these two entities arose and evolved in quite different ways in response to quite different historical stimuli their two stories often conﬂated by politicians or analysts keen to subordinate the latter to the former are both distinct and sui generis it is relatively clear in 2009 what type of actor esdp is likely to become see below natos precise future postafghanistan is more difﬁcult to predict but the eu member states collectively will increasingly need to coordinate their views on the future proﬁle of nato as the alliance strives to agree new strategic concept the european input to the debate could prove decisive in order to coordinate that input an eu caucus inside nato is to be encouraged 8hevcyh9ekvajzhazibvxnvcycójzcxz there are those who still argue that the eus normative power or civilian power around the world is the surest guarantee of its global inﬂuence and the true underpin ning of its international legitimacy11 this is not how the issue is perceived by the other global players given the history of european colonialism and imperialism most other parts of the world do not instinctively perceive the eu as font of altruism or selﬂess ness despite its relatively positive track record in providing overseas development aid the eus persistent refusal to phase out the common agricultural policy and open up its agricultural markets effectively negates much of the beneﬁt of that assistance to the global south the eu does increasingly enjoy legitimacy as an international actor but this does not stem from its normative power it derives from the unions ability 10 so ive come to europe this week

become increasingly complex that we must be ready to shape events by becoming more strategic in our thinking and that this will involve being more effective and visible around the world20 the ﬁrst major issue is threat assessment the eus geostrategic reach should cover all those parts of the globe where its interests might come under physical threat it goes without saying that multilateral bargaining within institutional frameworks over trade environmental or climate policy agriculture or intellectual property rights will not require any form of muscular role from the eu but threats to the eus commercial sealanes acts of piracy on the high seas civil conﬂict and violent destabilisation of areas affecting the union in terms of migratory or refugee ﬂows disruption of resource supply lines or the encouragement of terrorism the proliferation of weapons of mass destruc tion and other physical threats will require an ongoing and ever more professional eu military response capacity this does not suggest that the eu should be preparing for major expeditionary or interstate warfare such an eventuality remains highly unlikely prospect in the twentyﬁrst century none of the major global powers including russia has anything to gain from traditional great power war with the eu or indeed with any other global power the structural interdependence of an increasingly globalised world together with the lethal destructive power of modern arsenals suggests that traditional scenarios of major interstate conﬂict are seriously on the decline21 on the other hand the world of the future will be awash with what mary kaldor calls new wars asymmet ric warfare and smallscale regional conﬂict of variety of types insurgency civil war banditry piracy criminality and terrorism22 it is the response to such conﬂicts which has driven the development of esdp from the outset but it is the proactive anticipation of such events together with an increasingly sophisticated approach to conﬂict prevention which must drive esdp over the coming decades the second issue is range the key theatres for such an eu involvement are relative ly clearcut the main priority has to be the eus own

in the lisbon treaty under article 28b do refer explicitly to tasks of combat forces undertaken for crisis management including peacemaking eurospeak for separation by force27 the eu should therefore set itself for 2020 strategic target of having at the ready very size able force of the order of 60000 troops ie 180000 allowing for rotation in order to face up to the full range of operational challenges likely to present themselves in an increasingly complex world this will require major changes in training funding and procurement over the next decade the treaty of lisbon already contains many security commitments solidarity clause mutual assistance clause as well as the expanded petersberg tasks which cannot be met without robust and ever more integrated eu military capacity one aspect of this will be permanent structured cooperation whose dynamic must be as inclusive as pos sible28 the objective is to mobilise the maximum capacity of which the eu is capable drawing on whatever instruments are available from whatever source esdp cannot and will not work if it relies massively on few contributors with the others as bystand ers or paymasters eventually the logic of the strategic context in which the eu will ﬁnd itself operating will require it to integrate into the objectives of esdp an explicit collective defence article similar to article 5 of the weu or nato treaties moreover as esdp missions grow in size and signiﬁcance the need for an eu operational plan ning headquarters will become irresistible most eu member states have already rec ognised this requirement as have the united states themselves29 whatever the future arrangements for synergies between esdp and nato eventual eu autonomy in intel ligence and operational planning is implicit in the entire thrust of european security and defence policy since st malo the eu as an international actor cannot subcontract to another organisation still less manage without such key enabler in

2009dandcdldgi french presidency of the eu in the second semester of 200830 this process is bound to accelerate and intensify but over and beyond military capacity the eu will need to make much more concerted effort in the ﬁeld of civilian capacity it is far more difﬁcult to deploy overseas policemen judges tax lawyers auditors customs ofﬁcers and the like all of whom are invariably vol unteers the key reason why the eu has had such difﬁculty meeting its own very mod est targets for police trainers in afghanistan is that there is little incentive for european police ofﬁcers to spend perilous year in kabul it is even more difﬁcult to persuade judges to go they have their careers and are understandably unwilling to go overseas for long periods thus being taken out of their national systems out of the promotion circuit and yet as the council fully recognises there is continuous need to develop body of crisis management capabilities and to ensure that the eu uses all available means to respond coherently to the whole spectrum of crisis management tasks including in substitution scenario31 the civilian headline goal 2010 has set itself ambitious objec tives in terms of improving quality enhancing availability developing instruments and achieving synergies with other actors military pillar 3 ngos etc and this will take time it will be necessary to draw up strategic inventory of available personnel possibly concentrating on recent retirees from the civilian sector who can rapidly be retrained in the appropriate nationbuilding skills the pentagon is proceeding with such scheme in the us the eu cannot afford not to replicate that effort general david leakey the director general of the eu military staff has noted that as commander of the eufor althea mission in bosnia in 2005 200 auditors were of more use to him in stemming state corruption than 2000 soldiers but again if these objectives are to be optimised some serious consideration will have to be given to introducing stra tegic framework fortunately the work on this has already begun within the european union military staff considerable thought has been devoted to the vexed and to date seemingly intractable problem of planning the coordination of the civilian and the mili tary aspects of eu missions pathbreaking paper was prepared for the european coun cil meeting in december 2008 there are several innovative strands to this work notably concerning the development of crisis management concept for each given operation the formulation of strategic options military civilian and police and the emergence of clearly focused concept of operations conops and an operations plan therein lies the embryo of strategic approach to planning and capacity generation 30 jolyon howorth quelles

that it has not done it terribly well ever since the korean war let alone vietnam it has demonstrated that grand strategy focused overwhelmingly on the application of military force has very serious

continue to do international relations differently but only on condition that it adopts comprehensive strategic approach eurosceptics as well as eu rorealists will reject this approach as cloud cuckoo land but then nobody foresaw the end of the cold war or the collapse of the soviet union nobody believed as recently as 1998 that the eu would ever become serious security actor only eight years ago

whatsoever history is not just knocking on the door it is in the process of knocking the door down if the eu does not maximise its assets europeans may well ﬁnd themselves in the twentysecond century

considerable ambivalence the united states has had difﬁculty deciding whether esdp is natos companion or competitor1 in principle the united states wants and needs strong european partner to help manage the new security threats most of which ema nate from beyond europes borders however washington has not wanted to see esdp evolve in way that would undermine nato and has reacted strongly to any attempt by the eu to develop an autonomous capability not closely linked to nato these concerns were reﬂected in the us reaction to the francobritish summit at st malo in december l998 while the clinton administration generally supported the develop ment of strong and cohesive european partner many american ofﬁcials worried that the summit represented an attempt to develop an autonomous european military capa bility outside of nato these concerns were temporarily defused at the eu summit in helsinki year later at the summit the eu announced that it would only act when nato as whole is not involved this statement seemed to indicate that nato would be given priority in any crisis and that the eu would only act if nato decided it did not want to get involved it thus diminished but did not entirely eliminate the us fear that esdp might develop as rival to nato us concerns resurfaced with great intensity over the proposal by france germany bel gium and luxembourg at the socalled chocolate minisummit in april 2003 that the eu should set up separate operational planning cell at tervuren the proposal set off alarm bells in washington as it seemed to signal move away from the berlin plus for mula whereby the eu could draw on nato assets to manage crisis if nato did not want to become involved in the eyes of many us ofﬁcials it appeared to be the ﬁrst step 1 see robert hunter the european security and defense policy natos companion or competitor santa monica ca rand corporation 2002 lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 down the slippery slope towards the creation of european military capability outside of nato and thus threat to natos primacy as the key forum for transatlantic security cooperation the strong us reaction to the proposal to establish planning cell at tervuren also re ﬂected broader concern that some members of the eu especially france were seek ing to establish the eu as counterweight to nato these fears were reinforced by president chiracs emphasis on multipolarity codeword for balancing or containing us power and by francogerman opposition to the us invasion of iraq in the eyes of some us ofﬁcials france appeared to have moved from being cantankerous ally to an outright opponent of us policy izlcyhdxvcz however in the last several years us attitudes towards esdp have begun to shift in more positive direction the difﬁculties with which the united states has been fronted in iraq have made it clear that washington cannot manage the current security challenges on its own and that it needs allies the us military intervention in iraq has also underscored that simply toppling repugnant regime is not enough the united states also needs to be able to carry out stabilisation and reconstruction measures after the major combat phase has been concluded this requires civilian skills and capabilities after years of denigrating esdp us ofﬁcials have begun to recognise that the eu with its emphasis on civilian capabilities has something to offer even if it cannot contribute much to dealing with conﬂicts at the highend of the conﬂict spectrum this has important implications for the future in the coming decade many if not most of the conﬂicts the united states andor nato are likely to confront will be insurgencies and unconventional conﬂicts at the low end of the conﬂict spectrum2 these operations require different capabilities than the combat phase police election monitoring civil affairs units etc nato is not well equipped to handle these tasks whereas the eu is the united states has also begun to recognise that the threat to nato posed by esdp is nowhere near as strong as many us critics tended to think while esdp enjoys strong support among european public opinion there are number of important obstacles to the emergence of an esdp that could pose serious challenge to natos primacy the ﬁrst and most important is british policy in the last few years it has become increasingly 2 for detailed discussion see f stephen larrabee john gordon iv and peter wilson the right stuff defense plan ning challenges for new century the national interest 77 fall 2004 pp 5058hizezcavggvwzz clear that strong esdp cannot be built without britain and that london is not willing to sacriﬁce its special relationship with washington on the altar of esdp indeed britain today is bigger obstacle to the advancement of esdp than the united states british prime minister gordon brown is much less of europhile than his pred ecessor tony blair moreover his political position is very weak faced with strong op position at home and within his own party the last thing he wants is new push for eu ropean defence thus initial french hopes for new st malo francobritish summit to relaunch esdp are not likely to be realised in the near future this is even more true if the conservatives come to power in the next election which given browns domestic problems and declining public support looks increasingly likely the conservative party has moved in an increasingly eurosceptical direction lately and its leadership has little enthusiasm for esdp and without strong british support rein vigorating esdp will be difﬁcult nor can france expect strong support from germany for an ambitious new effort to re launch esdp francogerman cooperation has lost the warmth and centrality it enjoyed under chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder on the surface an attempt is made to give the relationship an air of amity but behind the smiles the relationship is marred by suspicion and scarcely concealed rivalry for leadership of europe this ri valry is reinforced by different political styles sarkozys hyperactivity and tendency to launch initiatives without prior coordination with his eu partners especially berlin has irritated chancellor angela merkel who favours more methodical and consulta tive style of diplomacy in addition paris and berlin are at odds over number of sub stantive issues including nuclear power energy and climate change and the role of the european central bank in the defence area germany continues to punch well below its weight defence spend ing remains at only about 127 of gdp considerably below that of france and britain this limits germanys ability to play leadership role both within nato and on mat ters related to european defence in addition there is growing concern in the bundestag about committing german troops to peace operations abroad as highlighted by berlins unwillingness to participate in the frenchled mission in chad hence germany can not be counted on to pick up the slack created by blairs departure and browns more reserved approach to european defence at the same time the addition of ten new members from eastern europe has shifted the political balance within the eu and strengthened the inﬂuence of the atlanticists lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 within the organisation while the new east european members support esdp they do not want to see strengthening of esdp lead to weakening of nato the same is true of the atlanticist west european members of nato portugal denmark the nether lands and italy taken together the atlanticists can be counted on to block any effort to orient esdp in an antiamerican direction the shift in the us attitude toward esdp has been part of broader shift in us thinking about the eu more generally for much of the l990s the united states either ignored the eu or tended to regard it as potential rival to nato the latter fears were particularly prevalent in the early bush years abandoning the principled support the clinton ad ministration had given the eu the bush administration adopted much more sceptical approach to european integration fearing that stronger eu would be less compliant partner and undermine nato in its ﬁrst term the bush administration was wary of efforts designed to strengthen european cohesion especially in the security and defence ﬁeld however the administration began to adopt much more positive approach toward the eu in its second term during his trip to europe in february 2005 president bush not only paid visit to nato headquarters but also visited the eu the ﬁrst visit ever by an american president in his speech in brussels bush explicitly stressed that the united states supported strong cohesive europe3 bushs speech reﬂected an important shift away from the administrations early ambiva lence toward european integration this shift was prompted by the changed strategic realities of the postcold war world especially since 911 the greater need for allies in order to address new security challenges the eus effort to develop stronger security and defence dimension and natos own limitations in meeting some of the new chal lenges these developments contributed to growing recognition that stronger more cohesive european partner is in the us interest position that has been embraced even more strongly by the obama administration this does not mean the united states and eu leaders will always see eye to eye regarding the future evolution of esdp and nato while the united states is likely to be more relaxed about the development of esdp in the coming decade washington will continue to regard nato as the primary forum for the discussion of european security issues in addition several issues are likely to remain contentious and subject to dispute 3 for the text of bushs speech see httpwwwwhitehousegovnewsreleases20050220050221htmlhizezcavggvwzz dezgvidcvaeavccc operational planning has been and remains one of the chief us concerns some eu members particularly france argue that the eu needs its own capacity to conduct op erational planning for contingencies where the united states does not want to get in volved the united states has traditionally opposed such an arrangement fearing that it would complicate planning and result in unnecessary duplication this was one of the prime reasons washington reacted so strongly to the proposal to set up an eu planning cell at tervuren however the row over tervuren arose in the context of growing usfrench differences over iraq and perception in washington that president chirac was trying to establish esdp as rival or counterweight to nato today however the context for the devel opment of esdp is quite different usfrench relations are much more cordial unlike chirac president sarkozy sees nato and esdp as complementary not rivals frances return to the military wing of nato moreover should reduce the sense of suspicion and mistrust on both sides and make the establishment of an eu planning capacity less contentious and easier to manage the united states needs strong and militarily capable european partner that can help address new threats and challenges if the eu is going to play an effective role in help ing to manage crises it needs to be able to act independently of nato in some limited instances especially during crises such as those in chad or the democratic republic of congo in which the united states does not want to get involved however these instanc are likely to be relatively limited in number and scope if serious crisis were to arise that threatened western interests the united states would almost certainly get involved though it might not take the lead 8ghhbvcvzbzci the united states has traditionally regarded nato as the organisation of choice for cri sis management and has in effect demanded an informal right of ﬁrst refusal france and number of other eu members have opposed this claim on the grounds that it im plicitly subordinates the eu to nato status they ﬁrmly reject the helsinki summit in december 1999 seemed to resolve this dispute by establishing the principle that the eu would get involved in managing crises when nato as whole was not involved this was widely interpreted as meaning that the eu would only take the lead in managing crisis when nato did not want to get involvedlvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 however france and several other eu members never felt comfortable with this inter pretation because it constricted the eus freedom of action and implied that the eu was subordinate to nato france pushed hard for the eu to get involved in the congo crisis in june 2003 the ﬁrst eu deployment outside of europe and provided the bulk of troops for the operation operation artemis the congo operation was conducted with out recourse to nato assets and without consultation with nato while it is unlikely that the united states would have wanted to involve nato in the crisis the lack of sultation annoyed some us and nato ofﬁcials and set bad precedent since then efforts have been made to ensure greater consultation and complementarity however this cooperation leaves much to be desired as the crisis in darfur west dan demonstrated the crisis initially led to an unseemly beauty contest between the two organisations the united states saw the crisis as an opportunity for nato to dem onstrate its continued relevance and more global orientation while france argued that the eu not nato should take the lead in managing the crisis in the end two airlifts were conducted one by nato and one by the eu the differences over darfur underscore the limitations of relying on ad hoc arrange ments if future problems are to be avoided mechanisms agreed upon in advance includ ing joint planning and force generation will need to be set up without such arrange ments nato and the eu may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to agree on how to cooperate as was initially the case in darfur at the same time there is need to rethink the modalities of natoeu cooperation in the past the dialogue between nato and the eu focused largely on how nato could help the eu conduct military operations however as james dobbins has pointed out of the two organisations it is nato that needs eu assistance to successfully execute many of the tasks that it is called upon to perform today not the reverse4 as he notes it is quite possible to envisage an euled operation being completed without the involvement of nato however it is nearly impossible to imagine nationbuilding operation being completed by nato without the involvement of the eu the eu has number of civilian capabilities that nato lacks and which are needed in the sta bilisation and reconstruction phases of peace operations it makes little political or ﬁnancial sense to try to duplicate these capabilities within nato rather in some cases nato should have the ability to draw on eu assets thus in the future closer cooperation and coordination between nato and the eu will be increasingly important for effective crisis management 4 see james dobbins friends again in marcin zaborowski ed friends again euus relations after the crisis paris eu ropean institute for security studies 2006 p 26hizezcavggvwzz frances return to the alliances military command should make this cooperation eas ier reducing the sense of competition and rivalry between nato and the eu that has hindered cooperation in crisis management in the past however currently the main obstacle blocking closer natoeu cooperation is turkey ankara has prevented closer nato cooperation in an attempt to bring pressure on the eu to make concessions on cyprus and its eu membership bid tactic which has antagonised both eu and nato ofﬁcials given the importance of closer eunato cooperation for enhancing crisis management greater effort needs to be made to overcome turkish objections however this issue can not be resolved at the bureaucratic level it will require highlevel political intervention especially from the american president in addition it will require european leaders to show greater ﬂexibility in addressing turkeys concerns and to put greater institutional pressure on the greek cypriots to make progress in resolving the cyprus issue 6jgdezvcxvjxjh us ofﬁcials also worry that stronger esdp could lead to the formation of european caucus within nato that is that noneu members of nato could be faced with uniﬁed front on the part of eu members in discussions within nato such caucus has been strongly opposed by successive us administrations because it could signiﬁcantly complicate alliance decisionmaking european allies who are members of the eu might be unwilling to compromise on hardwon positions within the eu in addition euro pean caucus could slow the process of alliance decisionmaking if the alliance had to wait until the eu had ﬁrst come to position before it could act the formation of european caucus could have particularly disruptive impact on re lations with the united states it might provoke strong backlash in the congress and result in reduced support for both nato and the eu eu enlargement however is likely to diminish the prospect of such caucus emerging the proatlanticist countries in the eu especially britain spain and the new invitees from central and eastern europe are not likely to agree to any position on defence or security matters that would be openly opposed by the united states 8daazxikzyzzcxz collective defence has been core mission of nato since its founding however some eu politicians and analysts have suggested that the eu should provide security guaran tee to its members there are several problems however with this idealvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 first the eu currently does not have the military capacity to provide for the collective defence of its members some european members argue that there is danger in mak ing such commitment because there is imminent danger of attack however it is extremely dangerous to make military commitments that cannot be carried out even if the probability that they will have to be implemented is low second such commitment overlaps with article 5 of the washington treaty nato without adding any signiﬁcant capability for european defence moreover some ameri cans fear that such commitment risks opening up the problem of backdoor commit ments that is if an eu member who is not member of nato were the victim of an at tack the united states could be dragged into the conﬂict through the backdoor these concerns have been particularly strong within the us congress jgdezvcyzzcxzcizgvidc europe has nearly 17 million men under arms however only about 10 percent of these are deployable while efforts have been made to address this problem in the last several years important deﬁciencies remain particularly in the areas of strategic transport stra tegic intelligence and command and control given the current economic and political climate in europe there is little chance that defence spending in europe will rise in the near future raising taxes or cutting social ex penditures in order to increase defence outlays would not ﬁnd support among european publics the only way to ﬁnd the necessary resources for defence improvements many europeans argue is for the european members not to organise their defence nationally but to strive to create more efﬁcient european defence5 european defence integration will help europe rationalise its defence procurement poli cies and overcome it inefﬁcient defence spending greater capabilities cannot be created only through nato they must also come through greater defence cooperation within the eu thus if the united states really wants increased european defence capabilities it will need to accept greater degree of european defence integration this may be the only way to free up the investment funds needed for transformation at the same time it will be important to ensure that european force development priori ties are closely harmonised with those of nato and the united states this will require close coordination between the force development process under the edas capability 5 see rob wijk european military reform for global partnership the washington quarterly vol 22 1 winter 2004 pp 197210hizezcavggvwzz plans and efforts within nato undertaken by allied command tranformation act as well as the us joint forces command jfc c6idéhzdgvexhxdez one of the most contentious issues is likely to be natos geographic role and scope the united states favours broad security role for nato however many europeans oppose such role they believe that the eu not nato should play global role and that natos geographic role should be essentially limited to europe many europeans reacted sceptically for instance to us efforts to build global partnerships with coun tries such as australia japan and south korea fearing that this would dilute natos european focus and overstretch the alliances capabilities in principle the eu is not limited geographically its mandate allows it to act anywhere in the world however the eus ambitions continue to exceed its capabilities the 1999 helsinki goal the creation of 60000 man intervention force has still yet to be met in practice the eu is currently conducting twelve esdp missions two of which are mili tary however the key question as daniel keohane has noted is not the number of sions but their size intensity and robustness6 the battle groups are designed to provide capability to intervene far from europes shores but only in small and limited crises such as the congo and even in such instances there has been clearly visible reluctance on the part of some eu members such as germany to contribute forces to such peace operations building more robust intervention capability will not be easy especially given the im pact of the global economic crisis the crisis is likely to heighten the tension between domestic demands to preserve the main provisions of the welfare state built up in eu rope after world war ii and pressures for greater defence spending given the lack of an overriding uniﬁed threat most european states will be reluctant to increase defence budgets izlvnvzvy esdp has made considerable progress in the last decade and enjoys strong public sup port as esdp proceeds the united states and europe need to ensure that it strengthens rather than weakens transatlantic relations several steps are necessary to ensure that this occurs 6 daniel keohane 10 years after st malo issues 27 paris eu institute for security studies october 2008 p6 first the united states should accept that europe needs to have some autonomous op erational planning capacity outside of nato given us preoccupation with iraq and the war on terrorism the european concern that the united states will not want to be involved in some contingencies is justiﬁed thus for those few instances when the united states does not want nato to be involved in managing crisis the europeans need the capacity to act on their own the key task is to ensure that esdp develops in an open and transparent manner and in way which strengthens the capacity of the united states and europe to effectively address future security challenges second us and european defence transformation processes and priorities need to be closely harmonised the united states and europe need to develop common threat per ceptions and common or at least compatible military doctrines the new eu security strategy paper is step in the right direction it represents the beginnings of what paul cornish and geoffrey edwards have called european strategic culture7 moreover many of the threats identiﬁed in the paper are very similar to the ones identiﬁed in the us national security strategy published in september 2002 third nato and the eu need to develop mechanisms that will allow for rapid co ordinated response in times of crisis this should involve developing mechanisms for planning and force generation as well as enhanced political consultation unless such advanced planning is undertaken nato and the eu are likely to ﬁnd it difﬁcult to coop erate in the future and many of the problems that occurred during the darfur operation are likely to be repeated fourth the united states needs to recognise that the eu is becoming an increasingly important political and security actor in the future european defence policies and cisions will be increasingly made within european framework this will require the united states to develop stronger security relationship with the eu 7 see paul cornish and geoffrey edwards beyond the eunato dichotomy the beginnings of european strategic culture international affairs vol 77 3 2001 pp 587603 for more sceptical view see sten rynning the european union towards strategic culture security dialogue vol 34 no4 2003 pp 47996izadwvahchzxjginzckgdcbzci vcyizj idbvhgzh the eu is democratic process not ﬁnished political actor any signiﬁcant decisions depend upon the agreement of its key member states as these retain diverging agendas particularly in security the results where security and grand politics are concerned are ei ther joint eu policy at all russia china energy or else watered down compromise the european security strategy or belated postfacto response to external events when they become so imperative or challenging that the key members see clear and present need to react enlargement the european security and defence policy while eu consolidation is gradually deepening the process is slow and cumbersome and this inherent weakness is likely to persist until 2020 even if the lisbon treaty is ratiﬁed thus it is unrealistic to expect that the eu proactively develops coherent global strat egy and the instruments to support it this does not preclude signiﬁcant developments but these are most likely to be the result of belated responses to external challenges the focus of this chapter is thus to see what challenges are likely to emerge in the coming ten years and what military capability the eu will need to meet them first however it is useful to clarify what the esdp actually is and what we are trying to achieve with it in other words what is the military and what is security lvihizbaivgn4 as andré beaufre noted war is the dialectic of opposing wills using force to resolve their dispute1 the military in the generic sense of the word is the main instrument for ap plying such violent force this can either be wielded apolitically as sort of blunt bull dozing where the opposition is physically removed or politically applying violent force or its threat as means to inﬂuence anothers will finally the military can be used for things for which it is neither designed for nor should be but which governments may impose on it when they have alternative these three functions are outlined below 1 andré beaufre introduction to strategy london faber and faber 1965 p 20lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 hhzcxzäizzmezgiveeaxvidcdenhxvakdazcxz the unique core capability of the military is the expert application of physical violence this is its specialty and other agency wields this capability to inﬂict severe destruction other instruments for more indirect forms of violence and coercion exist technologi cal economic psychological but they are indirect and do not yet generate as immediate and imminent threat as direct kinetic violence it is however worth noting that this is currently changing as our dependency on information systems increases and our vul nerability to technological attack grows in coming decades it will be possible to inﬂict catastrophic damage on postindustrial societies by striking at their cyberinfrastructure so the ﬁrst point is that by 2020 the ability to manage cyberwarfare will be vital for our security however this task will probably not be assigned to the military or the esdp although it is closely linked to the military instrument while there are sharp dividing lines the application of brute force can be divided into two broad categories firstly unleashed kinetic violence here direct destruction is used to physically remove an opposing will eg the war against hitler or shooting down hijacked airliner to prevent 911 scenario such high intensity combat can be placed on scale between two poles at the one end is big violence consisting of largescale destruction operations from power projection the 2003 war against saddam hussein to defence the national defence which finlands armed forces still have as their major priority and which many eastern eu members see as real necessity at the other end is surgical violence consisting of focused destruction for specialised tasks requiring high level of expertise such as theatre ballistic missile defence intercepting and shooting down hijacked airliner or hunting capturing or destroying terrorists although the eu lacks the big capability the full spectrum of high intensity combat will remain necessary at least until 2020 the second major application of violence is leashed kinetic violence this is the active use of violence but in this case as means to inﬂuence the opposing will rather than removing it this is clausewitzian war as the extension of politics in which the violence is ide ally strictly tailored to the psychological objective during the industrial age the peer states and their leaders constituted the psychological centre of gravity in this clausewit zian game today this is changing as result of four trends firstly because the worlds elite states are increasingly integrated in peaceful and wealthy community where the beneﬁts of cooperation and integration vastly outweigh those of violent conﬂict this is however entirely dependent upon the global economy functioning if it crashes it would probably also erode the benign political order within the elite as outlined above sec ondly new nonstate actors are becoming increasingly powerful and signiﬁcant thirdly idbvhgzh the key political fault lines generating violent conﬂict have shifted from within the elite peer community to the tensions between unequal global socioeconomic classes of soci ety the drivers of intersocietal violence have shifted from the westphalian horizontal peer competition towards the vertical asymmetric tensions of the globalised world vil lage finally because the conventional military supremacy of todays global elite states or rather that of its champion the us is so overwhelming that it would be suicidal for any of the worlds weaker states to challenge them with conventional military means in traditional game between nations eg serbia 1999 iraq 2003 instead clausewitzian violence is shifting to two new arenas and it is here that we are currently learning how to apply leashed violence firstly boots on the ground bog operations providing security for conﬂict resolution or state building from consensual peacekeeping to enforcement such peace support operations differ from the direct leashed use of violence since they are in essence subordinate part of broader social engineering campaign here military force may be essential but nevertheless is strictly subordinated to the overall societal construction effort and its psychological demands this is the predominant focus of todays military agenda and the esdp and eu battle groups are typical products of this requirement our main challenge however is to learn the psychological rules of this game which vastly differ from those of the westphalian interstate environment the second form of leashed form of violence is very different and consists of regional and global policing using the military for law enforcement barrier operations and rescue and evacuation typical examples are enforcing ecological norms ﬁsheries protection barrier operations against smuggling and illegal migration the rio grande or mediter ranean efforts and rescue and evacuation of eu citizens abroad west africa lebanon all three are increasingly important for the eu from the barents ﬁsheries to the medi terranean migration to the waters off somalia piracy by 2020 their importance and particularly that of the ecological protection missions will have grown considerably whether this is the task of military paramilitary or civilian organisations is moot point the demands of these robust policing tasks remain the same however since their glo bal range will increase the military will probably become their main executor hecdizvwainidcójzcxz the ability of the military to inﬂict unpleasant violence in turn provides key spinoff effect which traditionally gave the military tool its main daytoday utility this is its abil ity to support diplomacy again through the ability to inﬂuence another will but now as part of foreign policy directed towards clear opposing will the distinction between lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 military foreign policy support operations and bog operations is that the ﬁrst target centralised hierarchical actor whereas the latter strive to inﬂuence and enlist the sup port of an amorphous society and spectrum of often nebulous and shifting actors it is the transformation in general sir rupert smiths words from interstate industrial war between states towards wars among the people2 this political use of the military to inﬂuence clearly distinguishable opponent is more costeffective than the blunt effort to physically remove him however it demands psy chological skill and is easily derailed by the emotional tensions inherent in conﬂict and or the technical and tactical demands of winning violent conﬂict today however the number of states towards which this form of westphalian military inﬂuence has been directed is shrinking and only handful currently constitute direct challenge north korea or potential challenge perhaps russia iran this could however change if the global economy crashes and leads to historical regression the application of military inﬂuence for foreign policy support also takes two distinct forms the ﬁrst is the most obvious using the stick of potential or actual violence to frighten another will into complying with ones wishes ether through deterrence or co ercion north korea is case in point but the same deterrence and coercion principles can apply to all alienated regimes if conditions deteriorate the second is less obvious but very common and consists of using the carrot of military services as means to at tract interest and inﬂuence in this case military assets are used as enticements attracting favourable attention and increasing inﬂuence among partners examples include offer ing troops for international operations technological knowhow military assistance and expertise exercise areas and so forth they offer seat and voice at the round tables in brussels nato and the eu andor access to the imperial throne the white house this is also major driving force behind the esdp today and of course to natoled operations 9zvjaiäizbegdkhzyveeaxvidcdbaivgnvhhzih vjizyzbzjm the third main use of the military is to do things for which it was never designed and should not do but which society requires of it when it has other resources to do the job most of these tasks fall under the heading of societal support during and after func tional disasters examples include providing logistical services when normal peacetime infrastructures break down reinforcing civilian authorities and police under times of heightened terrorist alert enforcing law and security in the aftermath of major disasters 2 general sir rupert smith the utility of force the art of war in the modern world london penguin books 2006 p 428idbvhgzh replacing civilian services when they go on strike eg rubbish collectors in naples ﬁre men in liverpool or airtrafﬁc controllers in the us cleaning up beaches after oil spills and so forth these are all things that the military is not designed to do and should not do but for which society often has alternative when major disaster strikes most of these scenarios would be best dealt with by civilian organisations however they are lacking and efforts to create them are slow in their absence the military will need to retain readiness for improvised societal support missions with the increasing urbani sation of society and its growing vulnerability and dependence on central authorities this need will increase in the coming decade lvihhzxjgin4 the second basic question is what are we actually striving for in other words what is curity at its core security means functioning vital life systems for human society these can be divided into two major types the deepest vital life system is harmony of spirit or the ability to ﬁnd psychological harmony with ones surroundings and ones life this is fundamental but is not dealt with here as it is far removed from the preoccupations involving the esdp the second category of vital life systems is material and consists of three systems firstly the social dimension where security means harmony between sentient beings or socie ties or freedom from fear secondly the functional dimension where security means having sustainable livelihood or freedom from want this includes two main subsys tems functioning economy putting food on the table and functioning technologi cal base providing roof over peoples heads and ploughs in the soil the third security dimension is ecological and consists of ﬁnding comfortable habitat and access to natural resources and adapting ones life to allow both to continue in sustainable fashion these three dimensions are central to our security since existential threats can now emerge in all three thus for instance the danger from the y2k syndrome technologi cal challenge to the functioning of our technological infrastructure the danger from deadly pandemic an ecological challenge to society and the global economy or the current dangers of the global economic crisis for the entire emerging postwestphalian world order are far deeper and more catastrophic than that currently presented by any traditional state actors or the new nonstate actors such as transnational terrorism our primary analytic task today is thus to become discriminatingly holistic broadening our threat perspective from the purely political to cover all three dimensions but at the same lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 time focussing on those challenges that present real systemic threat and are not merely shock and awe full of sound and fury signifying nothing at the same time however the three dimensions interact intimately pandemic would impact directly on societies ﬁrst through the dead and dying then erode our technologi cal infrastructure if the experts needed to run it were sick or dead then choke the global economic ﬂows by restricting the free movement of goods and people which would in turn ricochet back and hit society through greater scarcity and poverty which in the worst case scenario would affect global politics this in turn means that we need dy namic multidimensional and synergistic perspective that can anticipate how crisis will cascade and mutate as it hits our vital life systems and this is just one type of crisis several crises emerging at once can interact generating megacrisis far greater than the sum of its parts for instance if pandemic or success ful terrorist attack targeted against our global technological infrastructure ﬂows were to combine with the current economic crisis we can perhaps just manage the economic crisis on its own terms but if it were to be compounded by other crises then the complex ity could become unmanageable finally each dimension operates according to partly different logic the social dimen sion is driven by political logic which is psychological quest for inﬂuence the func tional dimension is driven by engineering logic which is more mechanically causal quest to construct the ecological dimension is driven by complex systems of systems beyond human control and where major human intervention causes more damage than good this last presents new challenge this is the need to limit our own appetite and voluntarily subordinate our desires to the needs of our environment ﬁnding symbiosis between our livelihood and the demands of the ecosystem finally the diversiﬁcation of our security challenges and their complex interaction means that the world is becoming far more volatile and unpredictable the need for holistic and synergistic perspective means that we can longer rely exclusively on yesterdays narrow reductionist and linear causal analysis while this narrow specialised expertise remains essential it must now be complemented with broader consilient perspective rather than attempting to impose an artiﬁcial and misleading clarity on our security vironment we will have to accept fuzzier and foggier perspective it will be less clear but it will also avoid the delusion that we can see what is coming the implication for policy is that we must complement our efforts to prepare for speciﬁc crises with an ability to react to the unexpected this means shift from rigid planning and barriers towards agile improvised response and ﬂexible resilience for society at large as well as for the idbvhgzh slowmoving government bureaucracies this is large step that despite several warning signals still seems beyond our reach the security of the eu and indeed of human society as whole rests on these three vital life systems the task of security policy is ﬁrstly to ensure that all three vital life systems function harmoniously and secondly to tailor societys behaviour so that it does not conﬂict with the functioning of the life systems it is on this level that the spiritual dimension is paramount and where the materialism of late modern industrial society is most damaging the revival of more stringent ethical norms is however almost cer tain as the constraints of shrinking world become more apparent particularly in the ecological sphere the task of the military in the coming decades will increasingly focus on supporting the functioning of all three vital life systems the forms this will take is outlined below izhzxjginzckgdcbzcic if we examine current trends we can identify three major changes in our vital life systems in the social dimension deep transformation of the global political order is under way in the functional dimension our economic and technological power is increasing though this now depends on the outcome of the global economic crisis but is also cre ating correspondingly more vulnerable and technologically dependent societies in the ecological dimension we are entering deepening global crisis these trends are outlined below they will all affect the type of military strategy the eu will need in the coming ten years the above extrapolates current linear trends in addition unexpected black swans will almost certainly emerge certain developments may also reach culminating tipping points resulting in regional or global systemic collapse one such is the current eco nomic crisis others can be found in the ecological dimension it is possible to speculate on others but this lies beyond the scope of this chapter it should also be borne in mind that consequences of major systemic collapse would be so great that the relevance or existence of the esdp itself or even the eu would then be in doubt hdxva the social dimension is in the midst of transformation away from the westphalian age the deﬁning political fault lines generating major violent confrontations are shifting away from yesterdays horizontal peer competition between elite states and towards the vertical tensions between different global socioeconomic strata technology is shrinking lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 the world into global village but it is village on the verge of revolution while we have an increasingly integrated elite community we also face increasingly explosive tensions from the poorer strata below elaborating on robert cooper and thomas friedman3 and simplifying greatly the glo bal political map can today be divided into hierarchical class society consisting of six layers globalisers example share of world pop transnational corporations tnc fortune global 1000 01 the postmodern community pmc oecd 15 rapid transition societies rts china india brazil 5 localisers struggling modern states sms much of the arab world 10 alienated modern states ams north korea burma russia 5 premodern societies pms the bottom billion 65 for the eu as part of the dominant postmodern community each of these presents different challenge with the tnc we need to ﬁnd symbiotic relationship the tnc wield ever more economic and technological power from which other forms of power eventually ﬂow however they need the state and the state needs them within the pmc we need partly to ensure that our dominant global system does not collapse cf the cur rent economic crisis and partly to unite and develop joint strategy for dealing with our shared global challenges the rts are rapidly joining the pmc economic sphere and gradually following politically the task here is to facilitate their integration the regimes of the sms are trying to follow the rts but with varying degrees of success the task here is to assist them both economically and with security it is also among these frustrated societies that much of transnational terror and organised crime is emerging the ams are actively alienated from the pmc and see our globalising system as threat the task here is to convert them if possible and failing this to manage their challenges to the globalising world this will require capability for hard power politics finally the pms bottom tier generate host of transnational problems the task here is state building we thus face several simultaneous political agendas the esdp is playing part in some of them the softer end of peace support operations and is sorely lacking in others 3 see robert cooper the breaking of nations order and chaos in the twentyfirst century london atlantic books 2003 p 180 thomas friedman the lexus and the olive tree understanding globalization new york anchor books 2000 p 490idbvhgzh hard power politics by 2020 we can expect the esdp to need to perform several tasks to wards the tnc high technology enticement towards the sms military assistance from security sector reform ssr to crisis resolution and peace support operations towards the ams capability to support hard power politics both for clausewitzian inﬂuence and possible direct military confrontation towards the pms support for state building finally towards the less developed parts of the world generally capability to contain the transnational problems this includes barrier operations against migration and smug gling and evacuation of eu citizens from crisis areas these do not remove the root causes of the problem but will be increasingly necessary as long as they are not solved the strategic task of the pmc in the coming decades will be partly to ensure the stable development of globalisation but also to act as midwife for the new political system that is emerging with the rise of new actors and power relationships if we do it right the eu can emerge as major partner in new globalised political and economic system if we do it wrong we risk collapsing into an impoverished and violently multipolar world of conﬂicting societies if we do it halfway right we may avoid system collapse but the eu could be left as very subordinate player quaint tourist resort for the global power brokers surviving on charm but with little inﬂuence jcxidcva the deep trend in the functional dimension assuming we weather the current econom ic crisis is towards more economic and technological power but increasingly vulnerable urbanised societies the key challenges here are ﬁrstly to manage the global economic technological and human ﬂows on which the globalising system depends secondly to assist urbanised postindustrial society recover from eventual catastrophes in the westphalian age security largely depended upon defending state borders and pro tecting the political and economic systems within these today our security is increas ingly dependent upon global transnational functional ﬂows protecting these ﬂows and their critical nodes will be the main security concern of the globalisation stakeholders tnc pmc and rts by 2020 for the very practical reason that if these ﬂows fail then everything else will collapse challenges include friction piracy crime corruption shocks regional instability terrorist strikes against critical ﬂows or nodes operations by alienated regimes earthquakes strangling pandemics corrosion poor design or maintenance and so forth protecting ﬂows will require global military policing capabili ties protecting sea lanes and critical nodes etc and some power projection preventing choke operations managing regional instability it will also call for complex crossgov ernment cooperation and very close cooperation between the private and public sectorslvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 for societal support technological advances will probably lead to more resilient societies in the long run but by 2020 pmc societies will remain urbanised and vulnerable mili tary tasks here will largely be of the default category assisting civil society to contain or recover from major disasters as societal vulnerability increases this support task of the military or ideally parallel civilian disaster management organisations will become more important xdadxva finally the deep ecological trend is towards rising global crisis this is more than cli mate change it includes depletion of nonrenewable resources oil minerals degrada tion of regional biotopes providing renewable resources water ﬁsh arable land and disruption of the global ecosystem which is generating climate change our primary strategic task here is to limit and reduce the ecological crisis if possible this includes several strands strengthening our scientiﬁc understanding of the prob lem reducing our ecological impact through more environmentallyfriendly technologi cal solutions reducing our ecological impact by cutting back on our own behaviour and appetite by setting ecological norms the multilateral agenda and ﬁnally policing and enforcement agenda to ensure that ecological norms are followed it is in this last area ecological policing and enforcement that the esdp is likely to become increasingly important as the global ecological crisis deepens its consequences for societies in the eu and across the world will become more and more unpleasant under these conditions the pressure to protect ecological norms can reach the level of grand politics militarily this will include variety of tasks basically under the policing category this includes ecological policing controlling and enforcing ecological standards at home eg ﬁsheries protection however by 2020 it may also if the ecological crisis becomes re ally severe include more robust power projection requirements to protect remote rain forests ﬁsh breeding areas or other critical global ecological assets that are deemed so essential for the global ecological system as whole that they become universal treas ure beyond the sovereign jurisdiction of any single state this will obviously be source of major contention comparable to but exceeding that of universal human rights today however unlike human rights the ecological consequences of not enforcing standards may become so tangible and disastrous that universal enforcement will be seen as over riding sovereign considerations if human security is high on the agenda today ecologi cal security is likely to become vastly more important by 2020 this will obviously make idbvhgzh the scientiﬁc body on whose judgement the norms are based of major global political signiﬁcance second major military task will be managing the consequences of the ecological crisis for our own societies these belong to the category of default tasks and can range from sudden refugee and migration ﬂows within the eu or around the eu to disaster manage ment emergency assistance to society against ﬁres ﬂooding storms and so forth baivgnwjaycwadxhc forecast of esdp 2020 would be complete unless we include the transformation of the building blocks of which the military instrument consists these are threefold i the will of the leadership soldiers and society ii the skill with which they can apply that will and iii the tools they have with which to implement their decisions two of these factors are currently undergoing deep change and this will affect the shape which the esdp will have in 2020 firstly the will of signiﬁcant portion of eu leaders and some of eu society is declining the eu has become in robert ingleharts terms soft postmodern society4 as chris topher coker has emphasised5 such societies are averse to suffering and sacriﬁce both averse to experiencing it themselves but also towards inﬂicting it on others if this trend continues it is questionable whether the eu will retain the will to maintain and use high intensity military violence by 2020 and without that the military will not mean very much proviso here is that will is contextual perception of an acute threat among eu leaders and societies can resuscitate stronger will to act this would however only arise after the problem has emerged which is not the most healthy strategy the second major change is technology in the coming decades three breakthrough tech nologies are likely to transform both our environment and our military tools advanc in nanotechnology data processing and sensor systems and especially their fusion will have at least two major consequences firstly vastly increased sensor grid the world around us and we ourselves will increasingly become seeded with vast amounts of diffuse and networked miniature sensors we will live in sea of sensors and it will be increasingly difﬁcult for individuals to unplug themselves from this information grid initially in the most advanced societies but gradually spreading across the world in ad dition we will have the capability to seed uncovered parts of the world with sensors at 4 robert inglehart modernization and postmodernization cultural economic and political change in 43 societies princeton nj princeton university press 1997 p 453 5 christopher coker humane warfare london and new york routledge 2001 p 170lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 short notice under these conditions the sphere of privacy will shrink enormously this raises enormous ethical and political issues but in this world decisive power will rest with those who control the sensor grid and the resulting datamaps the second major consequence of the nanodatasensor fusion is that the tools of mili tary force will be transformed becoming smaller more autonomous more intelligent and very closely integrated todays individual big centralised manned weapons systems are likely to be increasingly replaced by dispersed miniaturised swarms of robots clus ters of minute subcomponents each with different speciﬁc qualities sensors commu nications damaging agents and integrated into networks will become capable of acting coherently and of morphing in various conﬁgurations to perform wide variety of tasks this lies beyond 2020 but the trend will be there with more and more unmanned vehi cles robotics and miniaturisation it may also offer us technological means to compen sate for declining will the consequences of these two trends are ﬁrstly that the focus of physical power is shift ing towards the cybersphere secondly that kinetic destruction will increasingly be re placed by what we may call corrosive destruction capable of inﬂicting far more severe but also more controlled and precise damage than kinetic destruction 8dcxajhdc by 2020 our security challenges will be more diverse and more severe they will require mili tary instruments capable of supporting six critical tasks these are in order of importance flow security protecting global technological and economic ﬂows this will become our number one priority since it is both vital for the survival of our societies and the global political order at the same time our vulnerability to ruptures in these ﬂows will increase even though new design concepts and technologies will introduce greater resilience this will require very close interaction between the business government and scientiﬁc com munities and wide range of military capabilities from regional power protection to keeping sea lanes open to highly technical intervention capabilities ecological protection the global policing and enforcement of ecological norms as the global ecological crisis grows its impact will become ever more acute raising ecological security to the top of our political agenda this will multiply the intensity and scale of our efforts to protect the environment both at home but especially globally this will re quire host of global policing and enforcement capabilities including in the worst case scenario robust power projectionidbvhgzh barrier operations shielding the global rich from the tensions and problems of the poor as the ratio of the world population living in misery and frustration will remain massive the tensions and spillover between their world and that of the rich will continue to grow as we are unlikely to have solved this problem at its root by 2020 ie by curing dysfunctional societies we will need to strengthen our barriers it is morally distaste ful losing strategy but will be unavoidable if we cannot solve the problems at their root it could be further reinforced if we reduce our global engagement to solve the problems at source see next point below social engineering stabilisation for conﬂict resolution and state building operations this addresses the core of the global social problem but the lessons of our last decades efforts indicate that the difﬁculty vastly exceeds our capabilities both the millen nium goals and our statebuilding efforts are ﬂoundering at the same time as our will is slackening and resources are becoming overstretched hence the priority of this mission may well have been downgraded by 2020 hard power politics clausewitzian inﬂuence over alienated state regimes some alien ated regimes will still exist in 2020 the key uncertainty here being the kremlin if so we will need to retain capability to meet their deliberate challenges to our vision of the world this will require hard military power but also an increased focus on asymmetrical forms of destruction notably in the cybersphere this is of major concern to the east ern members of the eu and if the esdp is unable to provide this then they will turn to nato or directly to the us societal support default operations to assist society manage disasters as postindus trial society becomes more dependent upon complex functional base and as urban society becomes less selfreliant the potential for societal disasters will increase until we shift our functional and social base to become more resilient we will be vulner able to major disasters for which the military often will have only emergency response available this is wide range of missions and capabilities but it reﬂects the wide range of security challenges in 2020 it implies not only new orientation organisation and capabilities but also growing need to interact with an increasingly diverse spectrum of nonmilitary actors these include ﬁrstly other government agencies secondly the transnational busi ness community and thirdly ngos and civil society it will also be impossible for any single state to manage the spectrum of challenges unilaterally or fund such an effort requiring ever deeper multinational cooperationthe historical record indicates that the evolution of the eus military capability to 2020 will be slow cumbersome and reactive the one exception could be science where break through technologies nanosensordata may lead to revolution in our capability to control our social and technological environment however this lies beyond our current conceptions of the military and the esdp and the technologies will only become opera tional after 2020 izgvyjvaeviidvjgdezvcyzzcxz yzciin hizvcdhakzhig it is rather difﬁcult to predict how esdp will evolve given its present intergovernmen tal nature not only can individual governments change their minds at will but they can choose one model as the best suited for given contingency and then discard it tirely when confronting different situation because intergovernmental cooperation is à carte predictions regarding esdp are very uncertain certainly the treaties say that eventually the esdp should evolve into common policy fullyﬂedged european fence the ambition is there and the lisbon treaty indicates two possible ways forward the introduction of permanent structured cooperation psc among able and willing member countries and the establishment already done in 2004 of the european fence agency eda while the intergovernmental nature of the decision making would not change esdp will become permanent feature of the eu political and institutional landscape the eu the question is whether this will result in effective policies as things stand today esdp is evolving in rather erratic manner fulﬁlling some re quirements and ﬁlling some gaps but without clear overarching strategy or plan and this applies to its capabilities as well notwithstanding all the deﬁned helsinki goals this will remain the case unless more thought is given to the strategic ambitions of the eu as an international security player lvivbwidch4 what ambitions should we have regarding esdp if our objective remains to accelerate as much as possible its evolution from its present status to fully ﬂedged european defence we should be capable of deﬁning what exactly european defence should mean relatively generic documents like the european security strategy 2003 are of limited utility sometime they can even increase confusion the report on the implementation of the european security strategy approved by the european council in 2008 for inlvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 stance says among other things that preventing threats from becoming sources of ﬂict early on must be at the heart of our approach1 what does this mean how can an existing threat be prevented from becoming source of conﬂict and early on moreover is the document referring only to potential threats which do not yet exist while fd roosevelt thought that the big five of the security council should act as the police men of the world such an interpretation seems to suggest that the eu could become its big brother should the eu attempt to translate this policy into an operational military strategy it would be obliged to continuously interfere and intervene preemptively in situations of potential threat thereby running the risk of transforming them into ac tual conﬂicts if on the contrary this statement only points to economic and diplomatic initiatives it implies permanent willingness to be involved in all areas and situations of potential crisis with the inevitable consequences in terms of mission creep whenever the attempted prevention fails more seriously esdp should be considered as the operational arm of the common for eign and security policy cfsp of the eu neither can be effective without the other this implies however that the cfsp should also be shaped in way that takes account of the evolution of esdp and not just the contrary there is strict linkage between any esdp mission and foreign policy for instance the eulex mission in kosovo can not succeed if clear strategy for dealing with the situation on the ground has not been thought out in the framework of cfsp what would be the consequences of failure of this mission for kosovo and for the other regional actors is there price to be paid by them in case of failure is the eu prepared to increase as much as needed the leverage necessary to make the mission succeed this is normally called credibility and is an sential feature of any defence policy of course the work of both the european military staff ems and of the eda is already increasing the awareness of what the existing european capabilities may allow us to do of what could be done and of which improvements are urgently required also their work could heighten european consciousness of the structural absurdities military weakness and economic wastefulness of the present european defence system fragmented and dis persed as it is among the various member states yet an explicit europeanwide political debate on the global role of the eu is lacking traditionally states defence policy starts by identifying the need to defend the national territory and vital interests from all military threats european defence should include solidarity clause along the lines of article v of the brussels treaty weu however 1 report on the implementation of the european security strategy providing security in changing world s40708 brussels 11 december 2008hizvcdhakzhig while the lisbon treaty strengthens and enlarges solidarity among its members it stops short of any automatic defence commitment in practice it seems rather unlikely that military attack against one member state or its vital interests could be ignored by the rest of the eu and not acted upon yet the absence of an automatic solidarity clause makes it harder to prepare the required military forces in advance to plan for contingen cies to establish common command and control structures and to build credible deter rence as things stand currently collective defence remains national responsibility to be carried out inside nato for those that are part of it and kind of european ghost mission which may or may not be carried out should the need and the will arise there are compelling reasons to maintain such divide on the contrary effectiveness and rationalisation of defence policies require an integrated european approach one that is coherent with the continuation of the transatlantic alliance the present situation increases costs and weakens the perception of credible allied common front to face ex ternal threats the difﬁcult and somewhat grotesque parleys conducted between nato and the eu to shape their eventual cooperation conﬁrm this point izjvcyc6id one of the reasons why this unconstructive divide has not been overcomeis probably to be found in the absence of clear and present threat of continental dimensions re quiring big standing army present contingencies only mobilise limited amount of military resources frequently projected overseas or dedicated to specialised tasks such as surveillance intelligence antiterrorism police etc european and american armed forces are not designed speciﬁcally to carry out these new tasks in the european case in particular the majority of the existing forces are armed and trained to perform combat operations conceived during the cold war unadapted to the new missions since the 1990s the european union countries have deployed an increasing number of soldiers abroad on speciﬁc crisis management missions up to 80000 excluding major wars and permanent troop presences in an increasing number of countries up to 38 yet while this represents less than 4 of the total available armed forces our countries are not re ally capable of signiﬁcantly increasing this contingent of projectable forces nato the eu and the member states face the same problem how to modernise their forces in period of strong ﬁnancial constraints so that they can better carry out the new missions while maintaining sufﬁcient capability to confront major continental contingency that could suddenly arise in fact each single european state today lacks the necessary resources even if some like france and britain are marginally better off than others nato has resources of its own and must confront the additional burden of adapting its forces to the new missions while maintaining as its main priority the capalvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 bility to deal with major continental war because that remains its raison dêtre the eu can mobilise some additional resources has strategic constraints and has the additional beneﬁt of being able to mobilise economic and civilian resources as well as military ones however the eu lacks clear political and military chain of command sufﬁcient autonomous planning and control capacities coherent strategic concept and possibly also enough strength and clarity of purpose to deter escalation in volatile situ ation yet alternatives are lacking nato is making the biggest effort to update and modernise european military forces but it is unlikely to succeed the required national investments are not forthcoming natos standing capabilities such as the nato response force nrf are reduced in terms of numbers and capabilities while the allied operations in af ghanistan are in deep trouble new comprehensive concept is being drafted to adapt natos capabilities and strategies to the complex requirements of the new tasks of crisis management antiterrorism statebuilding and peacekeeping however it is almost im possible to conceive coherent operations involving at the same time very different and distinct actors largely independent of each other with separate and diverse objectives while good comprehensive concept may enhance the effectiveness of military opera tions diminishing the probability of blunders due to ignorance or excessive rigidity it is not possible to imagine that all the organisations present and active in the theatre of operations public and private religious and lay nonproﬁt and proﬁtoriented tran snational international and national armed and disarmed etc will follow the orders coming from the military chain of command notwithstanding its eventual comprehen siveness all the more so when other legitimate powers exercise their role independently local authorities the representatives of other international organisations etc there is the risk of establishing theoretical command chain with real control over the activities going on in the theatre of operations thus increasing instead of diminish ing the uncertainty the multiplicity of crises their differences the presence of diverse and sometime ﬂicting objectives and the ad hoc approach chosen in the context of each intervention are some of the reasons why the attempt to establish clearcut and allinclusive new military doctrine to be applied everywhere seems an illusion more likely each crisis demands its own approach and its speciﬁc strategy to be continuously monitored veri ﬁed and changed according to circumstances it is question of governance that largely exceeds the competences and powers of any military headquarters it requires political decisionmaking body to be continuously and effectively in charge such an evolution could more easily occur in the eu than in nato provided that clear chain of politihizvcdhakzhig cal and military command is established and that an explicit delegation of powers takes place from the national to the european level the countries of the european union currently spend slightly more than half of the us budget on their defence however given the fact that the us armed forces are 30 percent smaller than the total of the european ones and that european expenditures are ineffectively divided among separate national budgets european investment ex penditures are just 27 percent of american expenditures and those for rd about 10 however considering these expenditures per and comparing them to those of the other major global actors excluding the us the european defence budget remains by far the second largest and could probably be amply sufﬁcient to carry out all the necessary modernisations provided that it is spent in more rational and co ordinated way crisis management peaceenforcing statebuilding and other similar operations can go on for years consuming increasing amounts of funds and materials and employing ex tensive manpower the last point can become crucial as of today europe and nato have demonstrated their capacity of deploying overseas at any given time 50000 to 80000 men the have effectively deployed over 90000 more men while the us alone can probably maintain an average of 150000 soldiers deployed continuously these numbers are important but not very impressive if compared with the amount of soldiers serving in the armies of the contributing countries the comparison changes however when budgets and materials are taken into account it is extremely difﬁcult for budgets that are relatively tight and inﬂexible to accommodate the considerable and increasing expenditure required at the same time the forces employed have rarely been trained speciﬁcally to perform the necessary tasks on the positive side the eu and nato are striving to increase the expeditionary capability of their forces and their stay ing capacity over longer periods but other efforts are needed to train and equip greater number of specialised forces the european defence agency eda and strengthened planning cell are tasked with assessing the experience to date and the changes necessary but clear european commitment has yet been given the decision to form the eu battle groups eu bg was aimed at increasing the eu ex peditionary capacity in reality however eu bg has ever been employed even when it would have been technically possible similar doubts arise when considering the nrf the expeditionary force of the atlantic alliance in contrast to the eubg the nrf or ele ments of it has been deployed four times in protection services at the olympic games in athens to support the presidential elections in afghanistan in carrying out disaslvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 ter relief after hurricane katrina in the us and for the same purpose after the 2005 earthquake in pakistan considering that the nrf had the ambitious aim of becoming natos most modern and effective ﬁghting force to be the ﬁrst in ﬁrst out entry force in highintensity combat scenarios its actual interventions have been somewhat more modest and hence there is certain sense of anticlimax political factors have hampered the development of these forces and the decision to ploy them it is easy to imagine how difﬁcult is for the eu to deploy anything identiﬁed from the beginning with the word battle technical reasons have also been quoted the eu bg are probably too specialised and relatively small while the nrf after the with drawal of part of the american contingent has been somewhat downgraded and is now in state of graduated readiness ie not ready waiting for the end of the ongoing nato operations to recover some of its capabilities in contrast the european civilian response capability has been employed extensively mobilising its ﬁve priority areas i police 5000 personnel available when needed up to 1400 in less than 30 days ii rule of law about 600 judges prosecutors and prison ofﬁcers iii civilian administration pool of about 550 experts deployable at short notice iv civil protection about 600 experts plus staff of about 4500 deployable in two intervention teams within timeframe of several hours to one week v monitor ing about 500 people the reality is of course more modest than these numbers would suggest simply because it is very difﬁcult to project these civilian capabilities at short notice and with the necessary security guarantees and to maintain them in place for long time moreover for civilian operations to produce the best results it is essential to be able to build up viable relationship with the people concerned unfortunately the rapid turnover of the civilian personnel has very negative consequences in terms of per sonal relationships knowledge of the local situation and culture and the ability to win the cooperation and the conﬁdence of the local population an integrated and effective strategy could use the civilian capabilities to greatly reduce the risk of new golden hour failures provided that it could apply an integrated mili tarycivilian strategy well suited to peacemaking statebuilding and other complex cri sis management operations artiﬁcial division between military and civilian crisis management phase should be attempted however as proposed by those that think that nato or other ad hoc coalitions could take charge of the military warlike part and the eu the civilian reconstruction and governance part first there is clear tempo ral or territorial division between these two phases they generally proceed in parallel division between two separate commands and political responsibilities would simply in crease confusion and inefﬁciency second it is clear that military decisions will condition hizvcdhakzhig civilian actions and vice versa and that only single strategic plan can avoid multiplying negative interferences also some ambiguities need to be dispelled there is the tendency today to emphasise the importance of human security as guiding principle of esdp the reality appears more complex while human security is certainly an important criterion it should not be the only one it is important to avoid limiting the possible scope of european actions unnaturally positioning the eu outside the military dimension of security would greatly diminish its freedom of action and its global role also the european priority cannot simply be one of doing good but of securing its vital interests which could require the use of force cdi_jhivxkavcwjivhzxjginvxidg usually the eu is deﬁned mainly as an international civilian actor the esdp aims at transforming the eu into security actor more in line with the reality of the european engagements and actions on the ﬁeld however it should be made clear that the eu is capable and ready to use its hard power commencing with the military when needed and in order to do so esdp should dispose of all the necessary ways and means from the command and control structures to the requisite military forces of course as the ess says none of the new threats is purely military nor can any be tackled by purely military means2 the stress placed on multidimensional approaches reinforces the util ity of mobilising the full spectrum of the civilian as well as military capabilities of the eu but should not be seen as constraint tending to preclude the use of military force useful european military capacity can be developed or employed without an effective command and control system proper headquarters fully interfaced and in continuous communication with the projected headquarters of the various missions the nondu plication principle should be applied more equitably to nato the eu and the member states with the relevant capacities complete reassessment of all the existing command structures in europe could easily identify number of national and allied structures that could be modiﬁed completed and europeanised it is important that the european com mand structure becomes permanently operational rather than being on call and fully activated only when it is deemed necessary intelligence is growing priority but the existing eu structures from the satellite cen tre to the joint situation centre the policy planning and early warning unit etc can not satisfy the demand one problem is that intelligence remains basically in the hands 2 the european security strategy secure europe in better world p 7 brussels 12 december 2003lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 of national agencies that prefer to keep it outside the common framework or to trade it bilaterally second problem is that crisis intelligence is different from the traditional military intelligence much more fragmented and at the same time much less exclusive in many cases open sources have been more rapid and effective than sophisticated tech nical intelligence or the ofﬁcial human intelligence capacities the new dimensions of organised crime and of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction may be better served by developing new kind of international security intelligence these aspects could open window of opportunity for the development of new eu intel ligence capabilities which could be gathered directly through european agency and then work in cooperation with the national agencies on more equal footing gzhdjgxzhvcyzmezcyijgzhhjzh because cfsp and esdp are largely intergovernmental still the bulk of the expenditure falls on the shoulders of those countries that are sending the forces thus those coun tries take both greater risks and greater ﬁnancial burdens is this way to show european solidarity there have been some attempts to modify this situation as in the case of operation althea more should be done going beyond the current althea mechanism common budget should be established to pay for the common structures and to ﬁnance signiﬁcant part if not all of the mission other schemes for common ﬁnancing should be studied with view to the funding of the required force modiﬁcations and improvements possibly leading to common eu ropean capacities especially for speciﬁc sectors like strategic and theatre transporta tion space communications and intelligence etc logistics could also be modiﬁed to make them less burdensome today europe just as nato does mobilises practically as many logistical chains as the number of national forces that are projected this is partly consequence of the low level of standardisation and interoperability problem that is already being studied by the eda however the eda at the present time have very lim ited means to correct this the principle of common logistical chain for expeditionary forces should be agreed upon to reinforce the aim of effective standardisation as well the question of additional resources for defence has not been solved the eu member states spend about 180 billion euro on defence each year however out of this respectable sum only about 22 percent is earmarked forinvestment and acquisitions the amount needed for the necessary modernisation and reinforcements and to attain the helsinki goals is greater the investment budget should reach about 30 of the total expenditure ie about 15 bil lion euro more each year it is impossible to increase the various national defence budgets to cover this gap thus different strategy is required one which diminishes duplication hizvcdhakzhig and increases the effectiveness of expenditures the more logical solution would be to in crease commonalities and integrate large part of the acquisitions at the european level should permanent structured cooperation psc be established among few able and willing eu members the prospect of common defence expenditure standards will arise and of ﬁxing targets and conditions similar to what has been done for the core euro zone states in the monetary ﬁeld all the relevant decisions would have to be taken by the states participating in psc and the protocol 4 on psc established by art 27 of the treaty already ﬁxes number of objectives such as stronger development of fence capabilities harmonisation of armaments programmes the ﬁelding of new forces attaining agreedupon budgetary objectives identifying military requirements in com mon etc thus it would be useful if the eu institutions prepared common position on these matters indicating the best criteria and objectives to ensure higher degree of understanding and solidarity among those inside and those outside the esdp core all this is inextricably linked with industrial and market policies the eda and the eu ropean commission have proposed some initial positive measures code of conduct directive on public procurement etc but single european defence market remains very distant objective it is not simply question of market liberalisation but of public policies defence industrial and research policies are closely interconnected the eda has neither the power nor the funds to replace the existing national agencies this means however that the european defence policy and market remain an uncomfortable patch work of the national markets and policies the development of stronger european common defence policy or the establishment of psc would require strong industrial and market chapter 8dcxajhdch all that falls well short of the establishment of single european army or of the clos ing down of the various national defence authorities yet it is also incompatible with the present complete exercise of national sovereignty over defence matters process of progressive shifting of sovereignty from the national to the european level should be endorsed applying the principles of subsidiarity to the defence and security ﬁeld we can imagine the possibility of partial or total reversibility of the committed assets to national control should any imperative need arise something like the falklands war for example however it will be increasingly difﬁcult to imagine major national contingen cies that will not receive full european support especially if and when important mili tary assets and foreign policy commitments will be managed in commonthese developments are real possibility there is of course guarantee that they will take place there is formal european commitment or obligation to develop the present cfsp and esdp on the contrary criticism of the policies abounds just as mem ber states are reluctant to relinquish national powers and prerogatives all decisions have been formally maintained inside the framework of intergovernmental cooperation to ensure their full reversibility yet progress is forthcoming and incremental steps are be ing taken that are increasing european competencies and establishing precedents one thought that the eu could efﬁciently manage naval operation in the indian ocean but the atalanta mission has been clear success to this end the eu has utilised exist ing national competencies europeanising them as much as needed practical develop ments are preceding institutional and doctrinal developments justifying their necessity resistance to change remains but it is getting weakerevgi egvxiidczghéezghezxikzh6cdwazvbwidc 8avjyzgvcxz6gcdjay there is always an element of ambivalence in talk about the ambitions of the european security and defence policy espd evoking in the minds of some rather pointless quest for selfassertion and in the minds of others montesquieus dictum that noble ambition when properly directed is sentiment useful to society the ambition of the espd certainly has the potential to be useful to society european and international alike the key parameters for 10year forecast go beyond the esdp question itself but will determine the answer where will the eu be in decades time how will it be functioning institutionally will the lisbon treaty have been ratiﬁed if it has not but perhaps even if it has will another treaty have been negotiated in the meantime there were three treaties one after the other between 1990 and 2000 will provisions have been implemented without any need for treaty as in the case of the european defence agency regardless of where we are in the ratiﬁcation process much will depend on the will of the council the european council and the decisionmakers in brussels and the capitals who will the member states be how many enlargements will there have been and will these have been accompanied by institutional reform with or without closer cooperation within or outside the treaties what will the international context be in terms of strategic positions the economy ac cess to natural resources and climate and what tensions will it have produced the long list of questions illustrates the uncertainties security and defence policy is highly sensitive to the state of the institutions and to events on the perimeter of the european union defence and security policy can develop only in the context of func tioning institutions with clearly deﬁned levels of responsibility and decisionmaking co herent policies and solidarity between member states without prejudice to instances of closer cooperation lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 i will not dwell here on the analysis expounded by general bentégeat in separate chap ter in this volume with which i am in broad agreement but rather focus on number of challenges which i believe have to be met to give esdp perhaps who knows tomor rows security and defence policy the chance of fulﬁlling the expectations created by it and of responding to the needs which it is best placed to satisfy izxvaazczhidwzbzi esdp has ten years of success behind it fact that is as undeniable as it is little known that success is amply illustrated in this publication by the euiss in deﬁance of all the shortcomings commonly attributed to it the eu has succeeded in taking the initiative by promoting the conduct of military and civilian operations based on conceptual and institutional architecture ie by acting on the ground rather than by ﬁnetuning struc tures stemming from consensus on the need for the union to assume its responsibili ties in the balkans including through the deployment of force the eu has since adapted to changing needs and circumstances whether it be by deploying military operations in africa or civilian missions in other highly demanding theatres including most recently georgia and kosovo the latest projects entrusted to the european defence agency and the research and technology and equipment programmes also illustrate the eminently practical nature of esdp work in the ﬁeld of capabilities the challenges are formidable nonetheless the most important or at least the most pressing is clearly to avoid gap developing between what is expected of the esdp and the means at its disposal in fact the gap is in danger of widening as result of the combined effect of the current ﬁnancial crisis and eu ropes increasing engagement within the atlantic alliance in afghanistan demand for european union intervention in crisis situations is growing exponentially particularly in the civilian ﬁeld with its ability to deploy wide range of instruments the european union is in position to address that need and is expected to provide interven tion capabilities such as police ofﬁcers judges observers etc on large scale however the duties of police ofﬁcers and judges unlike those of the military are priori primarily domestic in nature and under growing budgetary constraints priority is bound to be given to domestic needs in the military ﬁeld too shrinking defence budgets and the op erational needs in afghanistan the effects of which will continue to be felt for the next few years at least will increasingly impinge on the ability to contribute to eu operations that is even truer of certain critical capabilities the desperate search for helicopters and aircraft being well known problem in all operations at nato united nations and eu levels8avjyzgvcxz6gcdjay the paradox of diminishing engagement by the larger member states and increasing engagement by the other member states including in particular the new member states is becoming more glaring with each operation the trend may be surprising and might not have been foreseeable for example when the clause on permanent structured coop eration psc was drafted as part of the lisbon treaty why the lack of interest because the case for the legitimacy of an operation is not sufﬁciently convincing or because the operation does not seem to warrant review of priorities why by contrast the increas ing involvement of the smaller member states in some cases because as nonmembers of nato they are not as strictly bound by the demands of the operation in afghanistan and in all cases because the desire to play an exemplary role as members of the european union and to consolidate their support for the united nations overcomes the natural reluctance to engage in theatres which are at times foreign in all respects question troubling the minds of many in brussels despite explicit conﬁrmation of french commitment to esdp is whether in the years to come france will continue to be the main contributor to eu operations given its new position within nato and in the light of the reorganisation of its defence system but is there an alternative whatever the value of the battle groups as rapidresponse capabilities bringing together in certain cases such as the nordic battlegroup highly trained forces from number of medium sized and small member states they cannot respond on their own to crises where there is risk of escalation altering the extent and duration of the operation although the mobilisation of small and mediumsized member states and the participa tion of third countries are major assets to the union the esdp cannot develop or be pur sued even without the engagement of those member states with the strongest defence capabilities in particular are those member states with the greatest capabilities going to turn into reality the possibility of group of member states being entrusted with the implementation of mission as provided for under the lisbon treaty there will likewise soon be new slant to the question of capabilities themselves com mitments under joint programmes are in danger of being affected by budgetary restric tions for offtheshelf purchases expectations in terms of price competition and indus trial and social returns will be greater expectations which are partly in conﬂict with each other even if here too the phenomenon is not going to have any particular effect on the eu it will be increasingly difﬁcult to demonstrate to our american partners in particular the value of esdp as generator of increased capabilitieslvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 the trend towards growing scarcity of esdp resources can be counterbalanced only by an enhanced perception of the need for esdp itself not only because esdp is ﬁne idea politically but also because it responds effectively to the most urgent security needs to be addressed by member states as things stand the esdp is essentially an effort made by the union in response to painful humanitarian situations an embodiment of the eus political commitment the esdp is suspected now and again of inventing operations or missions to justify its existence curiously that suspicion is reserved for it alone the humanitarian objective for all its importance and show of diplomatic commit ment cannot be the sole drivers of the european security and defence policy if the mem ber states are to engage in context which will be marked in the coming years by short age of resources the member states have vital defence interests which these days most of them protect through nato but they also have wider security interests including internal security particularly in terms of the ﬁght against organised crime and terror ism security of supplies neighbourhood stability and protection of citizens disasters evacuations hostagetaking piracy etc at the same time as it fulﬁls its humanitarian and diplomatic objectives the esdp must play role in satisfying those wider security demands and do so visibly furthermore the esdp will not acquire full legitimacy unless it is accompanied by genuine solidarity both ﬁnancial and political financially because military esdp is at present the only policy area of the union almost entirely lacking in solidarity admit tedly under the treaty where policy has military implications the ﬁnancing for it must come from national contributions as opposed to the community budget but nowhere is it stated that national contributions necessarily have to be shared according to the system of each contributor pays its own costs the arrangement which has been in place since the esdp began with very low proportion of common expenses but the esdp must also manifest political solidarity and meet the expectations of all member states obviously insofar as the strategic situation enables those expectations to be deﬁned by the eu rather than conveying the impression that its focus is on traditional areas of in terest to certain member states the member states of the eu must also be able to allocate efforts rationally between the various multilateral frameworks and the national level the most appropriate framework can be determined by answering the following question who do we want to act with and who could we act with to best possible effect is it partners from both sides of the at lantic in the framework of nato or speciﬁc coalitions is it europeans including pos sibly russia or other neighbouring states for example in the mediterranean region that have expressed desire to act in conjunction with the eu or is it the entire international 8avjyzgvcxz6gcdjay community under the framework notwithstanding the possibility of an eu force capable of rapid deployment facilitating subsequent more international engagement of the or supporting the in difﬁcult situation as we did in the democratic re public of the congo drc and chad the crisisspeciﬁc circumstances are what should determine the preference and the eu should be able to discuss openly the best option with its partners in particular the united states member states also have to make clear choice between national action and eu action including in matters relating to assistance for countries exposed to external or internal crises each of the two levels can usefully reinforce the other but only if they are effectively coordinated izvhhzih conceptually the development of the esdp is as sensitive and as potentially conﬂictive ques tion as that of the single currency or foreign policy indeed it is more explosive still since it strikes at the heart of national sovereignty and defence relations with the united states this is why the esdp has been developed with such caution through compromises peppered with ambiguities and limitations making the task of the players involved complex and at times frustrating but the pragmatic approach has nonetheless proved invaluable to the esdp and is likely to prevail increasingly in the future indeed pragmatism leads directly to the conclu sion that responding to crises and guaranteeing security demand joint approach and this at time when the case for brussels deciding on matters affecting the daily lives of citizens is being subjected to increasing scrutiny on grounds of subsidiarity leaving aside dogmas and hyperbole about european army this is undoubtedly the reason why polls show consensus on unionlevel approach to crisis and security matters even in member states where euro scepticism is prevalent we frequently hear talk of the need for europe that protects it is in the area of security that this protective function is expected most and contested least member state has the budgetary or human resources to be an isolated player in crisis situations particularly in view of population trends furthermore doubts about the politi cal legitimacy of unilateral action are growing the point of the exercise is longer to in tervene in the name of more or less spurious national interests as european states with the means to do so did throughout history until comparatively recently but rather to intervene in the name of common values and objectives validated by the united nations the euro pean dimension reinforces that legitimacy and avoids historically sensitive confrontations the disadvantage being new constraints to which one must grow accustomed esdp which is an integral part of the cfsp has also profoundly transformed the latter by enabling it to gradually overcome the shortcomings of political cooperation when the aim is not only to agree on declarations but also to act on them the signiﬁcance of the aclvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 tion required and the extent of the ensuing responsibilities change the way in which the 27 work as the georgian crisis last summer clearly illustrated initially member states were divided in their opinions however the decision to immediately send mission of observers compelled states to agree on the arrangements for that action the initial fusion was followed by concerted effort the value of esdp lies not only in the fact that it clearly complements cfsp the security and defence policy must converge with all the policies of the union whatever the crisis or threat the solution can only lie in placing the appropriate instru ments economic aid trade measures visas development humanitarian aid civilian and military crisismanagement operations measures to combat illegal trafﬁcking police co operation etc at the service of policy to be deﬁned any response must therefore rest on the three pillars of the eu as well as on the policies and capabilities of the member states the instruments could be merged under the existing treaties but not to perfec tion and subject to all actors concerned showing signiﬁcant determination to which the current structures are not conducive the lisbon treaty improves matters substantially although it does not place all the instruments in the same set of hands except at euro pean council level the high representative does have the means of ensuring and the duty to ensure consistency esdp is therefore part of general synergy not only in the area of external action but in other areas too the eu must take care not to overly autonomise external action from its other policies it must be possible to forge link between esdp and the entire group of security policies including internal security it is only matter of time before the capabilities developed under esdp are made avail able to requesting member state hit by disaster exceeding its national response capa bilities in such an event the chain of command civilian in most cases in place would doubtless be observed the solidarity clause of the lisbon treaty speciﬁcally mentions the use of military resources and the coordination in the council of assistance provided by the member states aided by the political and security committee psc with support from the structures developed in the context of the common security and defence policy and by the competent committee for internal security matters concrete demonstration of solidarity in the form of effective support to victim coun try using all resources available for such purposes in the eu including military resourc would certainly bring the european union closer to its citizens this is true not only of disasters but also of for example sea and space surveillance8avjyzgvcxz6gcdjay dlidbzziizxvaazczhvcyzmeadiizvhhzihdh9e the ﬁrst condition is to ensure that consistency between union instruments becomes reality the scope for this is greater if the lisbon treaty enters into force however it is nei ther foregone conclusion even with the treaty nor impossible without the treaty given the probable budgetary pressures and the stakes in terms of international security stabil ity nonproliferation energy and supply security an agreement to devote 8000 million euro per year to the external action of the community is inconceivable in the absence of assurances that the policies on which the money is spent will effectively serve the essential values and interests of the member states we must therefore ensure that all our actions in the context of the european union are part of strategy and are genuinely coordinated in concrete terms how can this be achieved if the lisbon treaty structures and procedures are put in place with the emphasis on effectiveness and genuine desire for cooperation big step in the right direction will have been taken but those improvements will only facili tate coherent implementation of the means of action there are three keys to success the ﬁrst is that the council and for decisions at its level the european council must play its coherenceensuring role to the full for which the general affairs and external relations council gaerc and the european council must be working together in tandem because it is the council that directs not only the cfsp and esdp players but also the commission in the implementation of community policies the work of ministers must therefore be pre pared accordingly both in brussels where the high representative can provide considerable assistance and in the capitals with the required level of interministerial cooperation secondly the commission must have more control over the operational impact of its programmes and ﬁnancial instruments however unlike the esdp players the com mission does not act directly nor does it draw directly on the capabilities of member states for perfectly legitimate reasons to do with accounting security and equity be tween member states constraints imposed mainly by the council and the european par liament themselves the commission is required to follow public tendering procedures and as result frequently ends up ﬁnancing agencies ngos and consultancy ﬁrms instead of calling on the more directly operational expertise available in the member states it is difﬁcult to imagine that in ten years time the communitys external action policies will not be guided by greater insistence on measurable and visible effectiveness or that they will not be more closely linked to the cfspesdp and to the capabilities of member states an additional factor here being the symbiosis facilitated by the external action service visibility is admittedly not an end in itself but nor is it an attack on the sovereignty of beneﬁciary states or on their appropriation or ownership and it is nec essary for the political effectiveness of the action if state renounces the visibility of lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 its assistance actions why should the eu the last point closely linked to the previous one is the need to merge not only the ﬁrst second and third pillars but also to improve synergies with bilateral action by member states be they actions of bilateral assistance or positions adopted in multilateral fora other than the eu including in particular the united nations and international ﬁnancial institutions the second condition for success is knowing how to operate together and being capable of doing so for which there are number of requirements including not least interoper ability of equipment and personnel this is not about creating european army is that concept still relevant anyway but about europeans whenever they decide to do so being able to deploy their military forces and means of civilian action as efﬁciently as possible with interoperable materials and common action ideas tried and tested during exercises on the ground and joint training operations as well as common tested and approved ca pabilities common training at all levels from cadets to senior ofﬁcers in the latter stages of their career will certainly become much more widespread particularly in the case of civilian and military personnel involved in european crisis management tasks the differ ent types of reinforced cooperation including permanent structured cooperation could in the event of persistent blockage permit signiﬁcant progress by those member states willing to go further in all the above areas lastly the eu must equip itself with the best planning and conduct resources so that it can converge its political strategy military and civilian capabilities and all other resources including those of the community into an overall approach and offer the best guarantee of professionalism and effectiveness these structures must be kept light they must make it possible to react swiftly and sustain an effort for as long as circumstances require and they must provide the maximum expertise and experience based on lessons learned from past operations and on training in working together the chain of operations command needs to be strengthened the lisbon treaty offers the prospect of this happening particularly by virtue of two important provisions the role of the high representative in implementing the esdp and the possibility men tioned earlier of entrusting mission to group of member states success will depend on coherency of action but it will also depend on the ability of the eu to manage esdp information more effectively information which must be gathered and information which must be disseminated in order to know and make known perhaps this is the area in which the eu has to progress most in the next ten years the ﬁrst requirement is to have all the necessary information to guide action at union level the eu needs to signiﬁcantly improve its intelligence resources the achievements so far have been spectacular considering the difﬁculty of the subject 8avjyzgvcxz6gcdjay matter the situation centre has developed rapidly and pooled intelligence provided by internal and external services of the member states in addition to these capabilities and those of the eu military staff the union has an intelligence capacity the single intel ligence analysis capacity or siac for its operations the torrejón satellite centre is also providing increasingly operational support in terms of satellite imagery particularly now that government imagery resources have been added to its capacities furthermore cooperation between the commission and the general secretariat of the council should enable the council to take full stock of internal and external security needs in the imple mentation of the global monitoring for environment and security gmes programme and the future space debris monitoring programmes ssa the union should also be equipped with information technologies and secure networks of its own in order to share relevant information based on arrangements adapted to its interinstitutional operating environment and those of the member states but the union should also be capable of informing its citizens their elected representa tives and its partners about what it does relations with members of parliament in the area of defence and security are necessarily at two levels concerning as they do both the european parliament and national parliaments which have the power to adopt national defence budgets and in the case of many member states decide on troop engagement the union must also act to prevent loss of the investment in espd made by the parlia mentary assembly of the weu once the situation of the latter has been clariﬁed relations with the people and their representatives will undoubtedly be one of the main re sponsibilities of the high representative as well as of the president of the european coun cil they will need the support of adequate communications structures however brussels will not be able to publicise what the union is doing in the area of security and defence unless member states relay the same message if in the next few years we fail to rid ourselves of the seemingly irresistible temptation to present successes as national triumphs and dif ﬁculties as failures in brussels the enthusiasm among citizens for european construction whether in defence and security or any other ﬁeld will continue to waver one might wager bet that in the next ten years unless the applecart is upset by major event external or internal to european construction common security policy based on the coherence of the instruments of the union will be in place even though com mon defence policy implemented within the framework of the union may still be some way off the mutual defence clause notwithstanding the bet might be bit daring or it might not be daring enough but it reﬂects natural development following ten initial years of success and realistic ambition that can be fulﬁlled lvivhegvidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxz4 zcg7zcizvi predictions about the future often sound conceited but it is difﬁcult to dispense with them for the simple reason that at least in part todays decisions forge tomorrows re alities to make progress in an orderly and consistent way we must deﬁne strategy we need to have an objective for the future and to make the appropriate choices to attain it so it is not altogether unjustiﬁed to try today to predict how the esdp will have evolved or should evolve by the end of the next decade mapping out the objective and the main paths which might lead to it will at least give us the ability to take clearsighted deci sions lvivhegvidchhdjaylzvkzdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 before replying with all necessary caution let us accept the premise that europe really does have aspirations for its defence in 2020 since we will only make progress on this issue through shared political will similarly what follows is largely based on the as sumption that at some point the treaty of lisbon will be ratiﬁed or failing that that there will be consensus on the implementation of its main provisions concerning the common foreign and defence policy the failure of the constitutional project in 2005 has taught us that without the strong political drive that comes with ratiﬁcation of treaty the european defence policy might indeed grow gradually stronger as each presidency contributes its own worthwhile and productive initiatives but it would never gain the momentum of an irresistible force the only thing that can give cohesion to the project as whole there are those who query the legitimacy of european defence policy which is inde pendent of any other security organisation it is true that we would be able to conduct crisis management operations and civilian reconstruction missions under the aegis of the or nato to which we mostly entrust our collective defence at present however if we want to put deﬁnitive end to our internal divisions we have an absolute need of something which only the union can provide the sharing of common destiny com mon destiny means common responsibilities for defence and security lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 6edaxn does the position of the esdp in the european union ediﬁce have to change should we try to give it higher proﬁle within the common foreign and security policy the answer to this question must ﬁrst and foremost be based on experience and pragmatism in reality it is the signiﬁcance of security issues in the unions relationship with states or regions around the world which determines the importance of the esdp there never theless in future where the common foreign and security policy would apparently be more closely linked to the commissions activities it is clear that as provided for in the treaty of lisbon esdp must be more present in areas relating to both precrisis manage ment prevention and postcrisis management stabilisation and reconstruction the impetus for the esdp lies with the member states it is they who take the decision to launch mission or operation it is they who provide the capabilities which will make it possible to achieve the objectives which they themselves have approved the ﬁrst ten years of esdp activity have demonstrated both the difﬁculty which the member states have in agreeing on how to implement an operation and the extraordinary speed at which they are able to react when an urgent crisis so demands it took several months to set up the operation in chad and the central african republic but fewer than thirty days to deploy observers in georgia the process for 27 member states to take decision is thus not always cumbersome and it is very likely that the tools of permanent structured coopera tion and enhanced cooperation proposed in the treaty of lisbon will add ﬂexibility they should provide smooth and controlled acceleration so that political obstacles can be surmounted or so that few countries can quickly bring about signiﬁcant alignment of our defence equipment in the broadest sense in particular the possibility afforded by the new treaty of establishing enhanced coop eration in the ﬁeld of the common foreign and security policy opens up great potential for eu operations just one third of the member states will be needed to take decision in the council to launch an operation if it can be shown that the operation will further the objectives of the union and protect its interests and if it cannot be launched by all 27 member states within reasonable period moreover if the union agrees to make its structures available for the planning and conduct of the operation ohq the full ben eﬁt of this approach will be demonstrated it makes it possible to take decisions and act quickly with the necessary capabilities for the intervention subsequently being supple mented through contributions from other member states of course from the start this would require strong political determination and solidarity on the part of the initiating member stateszcg7zcizvi 8azvgbhhdch in order to improve our ability to react should we think about european army in the medium term this would only make sense once the european union had decided that it wanted single defence structure which would also mean single political authority since at best it will take several generations to achieve this objective europe should be allowed whatever time it needs to follow such historymaking course in particular it would most likely be towards the very end of that process that any missions would be car ried out under the lisbon treatys mutual assistance clause article v of the washington treaty which binds us strongly together across the atlantic gives us the time if we want it to plan such mutual assistance with all the realism such step requires we must be very clear on this declaring the political will to take on this new responsibility between the member states of the union would be ridiculous without concrete commitment to providing ourselves with the necessary means to assume it who can predict today what level of resources europeans will be devoting to their defence in ten years time the po tential effects of the economic crisis are still too difﬁcult to decipher in the coming decade the focus of missions under the esdp will therefore remain the management of crises outside the union from their hot phase to their stabilisation bearing this in mind we should continue to develop the best possible interoperability between our armed forces since our common interests and shared values will inevitably lead us to participate together in the same military operations we have put in place the tools and procedures to do this let us not doubt that at the end of the next decade we will be able to enjoy the fruits of those efforts we should urgently take time to consider the implementation of the solidarity clause in particular what is original about this clause is its area of application within the borders of the european union evidently the use of military means on the territory of the member states does require certain amount of attention the solidarity clause has two elements the ﬁrst of which concerns the prevention of the terrorist threat it is likely that the effectiveness of its implementation will depend on very close coordi nation between national counterterrorism bodies whether they come under intelli gencegathering and processing or under the police or justice systems military assets are regularly deployed to carry out prevention tasks but this is generally in purely national framework the second element is more interesting since it envisages the use of military means on the territory of member state at the request of its political au thorities and to provide assistance following terrorist attack or natural disaster giv the sensitive nature of the deployment even within the union of an armed forces unit in territory other than its own prior agreement between the 27 member states lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 is indispensable on set of rules of conduct and on any rules of engagement for such assistance missions 6yveizyxvevwaizh however it is likely that the major tasks ahead for us will concern the reality of the eu ropean unions added value in crisis management in other words our ability to use the entire panoply our civilian and military instruments simultaneously in single cri sis our experience in this area remains weak however we are well aware that this need exists and that it is not about to disappear to deal with this we must be even better organised the creation of the crisis management and planning directorate cmpd contains the seeds of more thorough reorganisation at the general secretariat in brussels under pinned by political will this could be the forerunner of the construction of complete crisis management structure bringing together civilian and military staff and binding the second pillar and the commission together in more solid and permanent fashion alongside the crisis management and planning directorate this structure would incor porate the civilian planning and conduct capability cpcc and similar capacity for the planning and conduct of military operations the mpcc military planning and conduct capability crosscutting areas such as intelligence the management of infor mation and communications systems logistics and management and the administra tion of resources human ﬁnancial athena or material would be integrated wholly or partly into this structure we would thus have coherent whole allowing seamless planning of our commitments at the levels of strategy and policy cmpd s military strategy mpcc and civilian strategy cpcc freedom from any detrimental geographical overextension of our military chains of s command the benefits of single location for the strategic command of all our commitments s whether civilian or military and of their proximity to the centre of political decision making sounder planning at political and military or civilian strategic level thanks to the s pooling of expertise within the second pillar and at the commissionzcg7zcizvi this organisation would alter the current structure of the european union military staff insofar as its current directorates would be divided between the large planning and conduct entities or devoted to crosscutting functions logistics resources management intelligence etc should we worry or be pleased about unique opportunity to provide physical structure for the comprehensive handling of crises on which the success of the esdp has been founded for the last ten years given that the immutable principle of an exclusively military chain of command would not be infringed within the mpcc there is reason to fear that this structure would lead to either confusion or disorder given the prospect of the provisions of the treaty of lisbon being implemented some of the current tasks of the military staff such as drafting military opinions and provid ing regular support to the military committee could usefully be taken on by more substantial private ofﬁce of the chairman of the military committee which would able him to act effectively as the sole military adviser to the high representative and the president of the european union as well as merely seeking consistency in the functioning of the operational bodies of the esdp there is also an institutional logic to this sort of crisis management structure under the treaty of lisbon the future high representative for foreign affairs and security pol icy vicepresident of the commission will have large european external action service at his disposal for his diplomatic activities for that high representative the whole crisis management system described above would be guarantee of the ability to take concrete action on the ground which would be fully consistent with the approach taken and the ef forts made diplomatically and in terms of crisis prevention by the members of that service in the same spirit of synergy we should reﬂect on the possibility of including some military staff among the members of this future large diplomatic service at the very least it would seem sensible to assign one or more military advisers to work with the special representa tives or heads of delegation in post in regions where crises are most likely to occur it is easy to see how organising our institutions in brussels in this way would beneﬁt the unions staff both civilian and military deployed on the ground in crisis the com mander of the military force the heads of civilian missions and where relevant the head of the unions delegation would then be certain of receiving orders and instructions which were perfectly in line with the overall political management of the crisis and thus able to take action which was mutually effective however local coordination of such action would remain necessary this task which is usually performed by the special rep resentative where one exists deserves particular attention if only because of the generally very different timescales within which action by the commission civilian missions and military operations takes place lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 6gzvhlzgzegdgzhhxdjaywzbvyz in the context of strengthening international security and as background for crisis management operations we could develop two areas the ﬁrst concerns what we might call the diplomacy of defence that is to say all military advice and assistance missions in this area we are already conducting missions to reform the security sector which consist of helping the armed forces police and justice system of country to reorganise themselves to achieve optimum effectiveness at the most rea sonable cost where necessary such missions may be preceded by demobilisation disar mament and reintegration ddr missions such as the one conducted by the union in partnership with asean in the indonesian province of aceh this type of commitment may however be supplemented or supported by longerterm assistance missions for example many member states second military experts for sev eral years to the armed forces of third countries as part of bilateral cooperation these efforts could be rationalised by pooling such cooperation arrangements at european level one model for this has been created with the transfer to the european union of the french programme to reinforce african peacekeeping capabilities recamp similar approach could be followed by creating for example within the future european exter nal action service pool of european training experts who would be able to involve the union in assistance missions to the armed forces of countries requesting such help this type of mission helps to increase security and thus prevent crises the second area on which we need to reﬂect is that of action at sea beyond current events which have led to the launch of the ﬁrst european union naval operation to combat piracy in the indian ocean in the years to come we should be able to control our seas and to ensure the security of the maritime routes which are essential for our trade and for our interests in the broadest sense to do so we must align the work of the commission with work conducted under the esdp and in particular with the work of the european defence agency in the area of maritime surveillance to combat trafﬁcking at sea whether of drugs arms or materials connected with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the most basic condition for effective action is to anticipate and be aware of what is happening in our maritime areas just and humane management of ﬂows of migrants to the union also requires the collection and appropriate sharing of information our naval aviation forces must be able to operate near the coasts as well as on the high seas in perfect synergy with the european agencies cerned with safety and security at sea the exchange of liaison ofﬁcers between those agencies and the crisis management structures would surely facilitate this common effortzcg7zcizvi of course for this european union maritime initiative and for many others the use of space resources will have key role to play by 2020 in fact large part of our knowledge and ability to anticipate relies on satellite systems whether they are used for surveillance early warning or communications the programmes which the union is developing with the support of the european space agency such as galileo or kopernikus as well as those covered by multilateral agreements between member states such as musis are fundamental to the future credibility of the european unions action whether in the political ﬁeld or in the more restricted ﬁeld of security and defence given the amounts of money involved and the complexity of space technology we should be able to entrust the european defence agency with the task of harmonising the identiﬁed spacerelated needs of the member states as much as possible with those of the union and to explore the possibilities of bilateral or multilateral agreements with third parties so as to beneﬁt from the best possible costeffectiveness ratio dezgvidcvaxgzywain there is point in putting organisations in place which will inevitably be complex when 27 parties are involved or in developing comprehensive capabilities for action if one of our ambitions is not to acquire sufﬁcient operational credibility so that in 2020 the union is unambiguously recognised as reliable and effective actor on the international stage the ﬁrst element in the credibility of our operations lies in the legitimacy to which they lay claim in addition to the framework of security council resolution which is an indispensable precondition for any commitment the support of public opinion is key factor whether it is expressed nationally in the form of an agreement to make troops and capabilities available or by any other european parliamentary resolution or declara tion it is and will remain essential throughout any operation the second element is the unreserved recognition that intervention by the european union to resolve crisis is justiﬁed such recognition will depend on combination of the argu ment of geographical proximity as is the case with the balkans or africa on knowhow the beneﬁt of the comprehensive approach and on political arguments as may be the case in the middle east or when the union intervenes on the ground to protect its own interests finally the third element in our credibility is effectiveness this third criterion is the fruit of our interoperability our knowhow our past experience and the lessons we have learned from it it is also the fruit of appropriate consistent and sufﬁcient force genera tionlvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 it is ﬁrst and foremost this operational credibility which will enable the esdp to be an active security policy in other words policy which does not just react when crisis emerges but policy which anticipates prevents and ﬁnds lasting solution to crises in this respect the occasional tendency to promote an esdp which is mainly based around the somewhat hazy notion of human security focusing on the security of indi viduals rather than that of states and on using armed force for protection rather than for combat tasks requires careful consideration the range of missions presented in the treaty on european union whether or not amended by the treaty of lisbon prioritises missions which are covered by the concept of human security disarmament missions lisbon humanitarian missions military advice and assistance missions lisbon ﬂict prevention missions lisbon and peacekeeping missions however in the treaty of nice as in the treaty of lisbon missions by combat forces to manage crises including peacemaking missions feature prominently the esdp cannot afford to do without an active military component which is sufﬁciently well trained and equipped to carry out combat missions if it limits itself to the protection side of the spectrum as regards crisis management missions it may longer be able to fulﬁl its role of defending the strate gic interests of the union identiﬁed as such by the european council in its deﬁnition of the strategy and guidelines for the common foreign and security policy implement ing comprehensive approach in the unions commitments evidently serves the concept of human security in ﬂexible manner but to make it guiding concept for the esdp would entail the risk of leading to great confusion 6xidcdcvcvbwidjhhxvaz the esdp must primarily be the instrument for protecting the european unions inter ests not only are those interests not limited to the neighbourhood of the unions terri tory they are also varied and their defence requires an extensive range of capabilities to reduce the union to regional organisation which was only concerned with the stability of its immediate surroundings would run counter to the aspirations set out in the euro pean security strategy given the challenges facing the world now and in the future single entity can go it alone in dealing with security issues this applies particularly to political organisation which comprises ﬁve hundred million citizens and quarter of the worlds wealth and which has ambitions to be key player in the service of effective world governance based on multilateralism the union is declaring its willingness to assume its strategic ambitions ever more clearly in many areas such as the environment energy supply the protection of its citizens wherever they may be and above all in diplomatic action which it is gradually reinventing by speaking with single voice on countless is sues and by acting on behalf of 27 member states in more than 130 countries around zcg7zcizvi the world could we imagine all that being reduced to purely regional aspirations if in the decade to come the union were to renounce the global dimension of its role in pro viding security it is very likely that it would not count for much in the twentyﬁrst cen tury world order it would be respectable and respected regional economic player but it would be absent when solutions to the worlds major problems were being planned 6jaaevgiczg to put these aspirations on sound footing the unions relationship with the leading power the united states must continue to evolve currently as seen from the other side of the atlantic there is not one europe on fundamental issues for our future such as energy supply or the rationalisation of the defence industry our internal divergences are still too great and yet the context of the ﬁnancial crisis should make it evident to all that the critical dimension to face such challenges really is the european dimension not just the national dimension we therefore have to make progress to present more united and politically more dynamic image otherwise it is very likely that the lure of the rapid growth in asia and the paciﬁc will induce the united states to review the balance of its partnerships to the detriment of the european union in the speciﬁc area of defence everything in the short analysis above shows the distance we still need to go to ensure the balance of strong transatlantic link based on closer cooperation the european unions relationship with nato should help us to make progress on this front on two conditions the ﬁrst is that the union resolve the cyprus question as quickly as possible this is an urgent political responsibility the second is that the necessary decisionmaking autonomy of the two organisations be understood and respected both by our transatlantic partners and by those member states which are also signatories to the washington treaty there too the unity of the european union will help as long as we remain unable to ensure the development of our own capabilities because of our internal divisions as long as our political vision is not unanimous we will be like player who holds all the cards but is unable to play them the future of the union is in its own hands the decade to come will be the one in which choices have to be made either the union will be hampered by its internal barriers and will remain an economic area with international ambition other than its trade or it will address its problems at the highest political level and acquire the capacity to gain stature as an effective global player and respected partner of the leading powers it is certain that the successful ratiﬁcation of the treaty of lisbon is the ﬁrst bridge to cross let us not lose time our world is already tomorrows worldbegdkcxvevwaizhdgh9eéh jijgzczzyh 6azmvcyzglzh looking at the 2020 horizon and beyond is already established practice in the european defence agency eda in its early days the agency proposed an assessment of the long term military capability needs for esdp operations why because the timeframe of the existing headline goal 2010 is problematic decisions to invest in the development and procurement of equipment entering the inventories of the armed forces today and in 2010 were taken ﬁve years ago and often even longer with the timelines for research and tech nology being longer again as it takes ﬁve to ten years before new technologies deliver concrete products to the users to guide capability development longterm vision for european defence capability and capacity needs focussing on the 20202025 timeframe was elaborated by the eda and endorsed by its ministerial steering board in october 20061 8vevwain9zkzadebzcieavc the next phase was the elaboration of capability development plan cdp based on close cooperation between the agency and the eu military committee eumc and car ried out with full involvement of the member states four work strands were initiated the eumc had the lead for strand the results from the headline goal 2010 in sence this input into the cdp is about the eus collective shortterm capability needs and shortfalls strand b led by the eda built on the long term vision it elaborated in more detail future capability needs and technological developments strand c also led by eda consisted of the construction of an electronic collaborative database in which the member states would list their mediumtolong term plans in order to seek early op portunities for collaboration with other european partners finally strand d focused on lessons learned from recent or current crisis management operations kind of re ality check this strand was led by the eumc all the work was conducted in about 18 months inputs were brought together in one document and in july 2008 the steering board in capabilities formation endorsed the cdp 1 european defence agency an intitial longterm vision for european defence capability and capacity needs brussels 3 october 2006 available at httpwwwedaeuropaeugenericitemaspxid146lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 the cdp is not plan in the traditional sense it does not deﬁne the number of units or the number of tanks ships and aircraft needed for esdp operations that would be cold war planning rather the cdp pictures the future challenges from tomorrow until 2025 and on that basis identiﬁes capability needs capability trends and short falls it assists the member states in developing their national capability plans in line with these needs trends and shortfalls also its purpose is to drive research tech nology armaments cooperation and industry after all the eda is capabilitydriven agency so what are the principal conclusions emerging from the cdp analysis the main points may be outlined as follows the increasing importance of knowledge for operations in complex environments s clearly this underlines the need for broad array of informationgathering analytical and distribution capacities the comprehensive approach to eu crisis management operations which sets requires ments for civilmilitary structures but also for seeking synergies between civil and military capability development the need for evergreater flexibility agility and responsiveness in order to be able to s deliver the precise effects at the right time and the right place setting requirements for example for command control systems and precision munitions and the human factor the most critical requirement to recruit train and retain motis vated military personnel to meet the most demanding challenges based on the cdp conclusions the steering board selected an initial tranche of twelve prioritised actions listed in alphabetical order i chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn defence ii comprehensive approach military implications iii computer network operations cno iv counterimprovised explosive devices cied v counterman portable air defence systems cmanpads vi increased availability of helicopters vii intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr architecture viii medical support6azmvcyzglzh ix military human intelligence and culturallanguage training x mine countermeasures in littoral sea areas xi network enable capability xii third party logistic support most of these priorities are not surprising as they are related to existing shortfalls such as with regard to the availability of helicopters cied network enabled capability and logistics others result from longterm analysis for example the threat of man pads is likely to increase and it might become one of the next weapons in the hands of rogue elements in the future the list of twelve selected actions established in close consultation with the member states thus forms an excellent basis for prioritising capability improvement but naturally it can only be the start list further actions will have to be selected when the time has come based on proper analysis in the context of the cdp three of the initially selected actions are taken forward by the eu military committee supported by the eu military staff cno comprehensive approach and military hu man intelligence all the others are pursued by the eda projects already launched before the cdp was endorsed will continue in fact cdp conclusions also provide capabilitydriven basis for these activities such as maritime surveillance various spacerelated activities unmanned air vehicles uavs and non lethal capabilities dizghigvizzh the cdp is the overall strategic tool but there are three other longterm strategies in place reﬂecting the other functions of the agency the s european defence research technology edrt strategy to enhance more effective rt in support of military capabilities the edrt strategy defines the ends in which key technologies to invest the means how to do this and the ways to im plement the ends and means through roadmaps and action plans thes european armaments cooperation eac strategy to promote and enhance more ef fective european armaments cooperation in support of esdp capability needs the eac strategy defines how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of european armaments programmes by series of actions applying lessons learned from past experiences through guide to armaments cooperation best practicelvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 thes european defence technological and industrial base edtib strategy which describes the future european defence industrial landscape based on the three cs capability driven competent and competitive the future edtib has to be more integrated less duplicative and more interdependent with increased specialisation for example by establishing industrial centres of excellence it refers to action fields for which gov ernments will be responsible such as consolidating demand and investment logi cally the strategy links the work on realising the future edtib to the agencys ac tivities on the european defence equipment market special attention is paid to the importance of small and mediumsized enterprises with their typical flexibility and capacity to innovate together with the cdp these strategies provide the eda with the objectives to be realised and with the way to proceed but the strategies do not produce capabilities by them selves these have to be generated through concrete projects and activities 8dcxgzizldg it would be impossible to list all projects and initiatives just to list the most important ones helicopterss there are approximately 1700 helicopters in the military inventories in europe but many of these are not available for crisis management operations because some crews are not trained to fly in more demanding environments for example over deserts or in mountainous terrain or because some helicopters are technically not equipped for such environments the eda is addressing both elements with an ini tial focus on training which can quickly deliver additional capacities some initial training capacity has already been arranged in 2009 for urgent needs in 2010 more structural solution will be launched the helicopter tactics training programme under this programme helicopter crews will be trained at the european level to fly in chal lenging environments concerning upgrading helicopters the agency is closely working with european helicopter industries the initial focus is on the mitransport helicop ters which feature prominently in the inventories of many central and east european member states coordination work by the eda will help those nations to streamline upgrading programmes and to increase delivery schedules and it might reduce costs finally there is the longterm track in may 2009 france and germany brought their bilateral initiative for future transport helicopter 2020 to the eda thus opening up the project to other interested member states there is also scope here for trans atlantic cooperation as the market for this type of helicopter is too small in europe alone6azmvcyzglzh air transports defence ministers of 12 european countries signed declaration of in tent on 10 november 2008 to launch eda work on establishing european air trans port fleet eatf the eatf aims at reducing shortfalls in european air transport by pooling aircraft such as the a400m and c130 hercules different forms of pool ing will be considered making existing or ordered aircraft available to other users flight hours to be offered or to be requested combining training logistics and main tenance the signature of letter of intent is planned for later in 2009 after busi ness model has been developed on the same occasion 10 november 2008 defence ministers of belgium germany france and luxembourg also signed declaration of intent regarding the establishment of multinational a400m unit this unit will be part of the eatf maritimes this is an example of an earlier eda work strand now supported by the cdp conclusions these conclusions point to increasing future risks and challenges at sea in particular in littoral waters ten member states plus norway have launched project under the auspices of the eda for the replacement of the existing generation of maritime mine countermeasures starting in the 20182020 timeframe another group of seven member states have begun to prepare for the development of future unmanned aerial system able to take off and land on ships deck to increase the capability of wide area surveillance this project is related to the edas work on mari time surveillance spacebased earth surveillances again the cdp points to the importance of this capabil ity spacebased observation satellites are indispensable for informationgathering six european countries belgium germany greece france italy and spain have formed group for the multinational spacebased imaging system musis which aims at continuity of spacebased earth surveillance services from 2015 onwards in early 2009 the musis partners brought the project to the eda opening it up for other member states participation the edas specific role will also be to liaise with the european commission to seek synergies with civilian users driven technology investment and with projects such as the global monitoring for environment and security gmes unmanned air vehicless as there are already so many different uavs the agencys focus is not on another platform but on an important enabler namely to realise the insertion of uavs into normal airspace as uavs are getting bigger and wider they increasingly will have to fly by themselves to operational areas this is currently only possible once specific slots have been granted by the european air traffic control authorities in some cases this can take weeks not quite in line with the needs of crisis management the ambitious challenge eda has set itself is to have uavs flying in normal airspace lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 by 2015 this will require coordinated efforts of many actors including the commis sion and specialised air traffic and air safety organisations to change existing rules and regulations but it also requires new technologies eg socalled sense and avoid technologies which enable uav to look around and spot other aircraft rather than only looking down and spotting what is going on on the ground

under the uk presidency this meeting was mainly dedicated to pushing forward the 2000 lisbon agenda for improving europes economic performance including through research development at the meeting the head of the agency high representativesecretary general javier solana introduced the theme of investing more together in defence re search and technology rt in december 2005 solana sent more detailed report to the european council with this highlevel political wind in its sails the agency launched series of rt ac tivities the most important one was to prepare the ﬁrst defence rt joint investment programme jip new formula was developed breaking with the past format of multi national defence rt collaborations what are the major differences firstly as the title indicated jip is an investment s programme for bigger number of member states rather than collaboration of few countries the latter called category b projects continues to exist in the eda focusing on research into specific technologies the jips called cat programmes are themedriven and therefore more suited for larger number of contributors individual projects are defined and selected later on the advantage of programme with projects is also that the legal basis for contracting can be based on one single programme arrangement while for catb projects this has to be settled for each project over and over again secondly investment under the jipformula is truly s joint once the subject has been defined all eda member states are invited to join and to indicate their financial contributions rules on financial ceilings and on minimum contributions prevent domination by bigger contributors and allow for smaller but still significant contri6azmvcyzglzh butions the contributing member states form the management committee which decides on project definitions and awards of contracts thirdly projects are awarded to bidders universities rt institutes laboratories s companies etc on the basis of competition rather than on the principle of juste retour the old principle whereby funds are channelled to national rt providers in the exact proportion to the national amount of money subscribed to the multinational project bidders have to form consortium with at least one other bidder in another contributing member state and this has to include small and mediumsized enter prise this rule stimulates crossborder rt networking in europe two jips are up and running the jip on force protection jipfp was launched in vember 2006 and good year later the ﬁrst contract was signed this is timerecord compared to the average duration for catb projects namely 23 years between launching and signature nineteen member states plus norway participate in the jipfp capability planners and technology experts worked very closely together in selecting and connect ing capability areas with technology goals eighteen speciﬁc rt goals were selected grouped under ﬁve capability areas collective survivability through enhancing detect and identify and response performances individual protection data analysis secured tactical wireless communication systems in an urban environment and mission planningtrain ing in an asymmetric environment the investment by nineteen member states plus norway through the jipfp is approximately 55 million euro industry is supplying ad ditional funds for the contracts the second jip dedicated to innovative concepts and emerging technologies was launched in may 2008 the jipicet looks into technologies such as nanomaterials and structures remote detection and health monitoring ten member states plus norway contribute just under 16 million euro to the jipicet for selecting future jip subjects the cdp will play an important role as the driver an exercise is underway to look at connectivity between the twelve cdp priorities and edrt strategy key tech nologies starting with four cbrn countermanpads counteried cbrn and mmcm izyzzcxzbvgzi finally the agency has important agendas related to the european defence equipment market edem as recognised in the edtib strategy european defence industries will need to be competitive that means competitive on global scale but also in europe itself however traditionally the defence market in europe has been characterised by lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 lack of transparency and lack of competition as member states in general have relied on the national security clause in article 296 of the treaty establishing the european community in essence article 296 has allowed member states to make the bulk of their defence purchases on national basis to create openness on defence contract opportunities and to allow for crossborder bid ding the eda launched the intergovernmental regime to increase competition in the european defence equipment in november 2005 the ministerial steering board agreed the code of conduct on defence procurement though voluntary and politically bind ing 25 member states plus norway have subscribed to the code covering the territory where the overwhelming majority of european defence industries are located the code covers defence equipment purchases with value over 1 million euro where the pro visions of article 296 of the ec treaty are applicable the contracts are placed on the agencys electronic bulletin board ebb2 implementation of the code started on 1 july 2006 as of march 2009 over 400 contracts with an estimated value of approximately 10 billion euro have been placed on the ebb and around 180 of them have been awarded representing 27 billion euro concerning crossborder awards an encouraging increase has taken place between 2007 and 2008 from 20 to 33 percent the future will tell if this percentage will further increase it is yet too early to conclude in any case the code of conduct on defence procurement is breakthrough it has opened up hidden segment of the market as defence procurement legally is the last bastion of protectionism in may 2006 code of best practice in the supply chain cobpsc was approved this code extends the beneﬁts of greater competition through the supply chain in particu lar to lower tier companies and small mediumsized enterprises the cobpsc is sup ported by an electronic bulletin board for industrytoindustry contracts this tool was launched on 27 march 2007 providing an electronic platform for advertising subcon tract opportunities by prime contractors and commercial buyers lastly the steering board agreed code of conduct on offsets in october 2008 this newest code will apply to all compensation practices required as condition of pur chase or resulting from purchase of defence goods or defence services offsets can be regarded as distorting the market but probably they will remain fact of life as long as the european defence equipment market itself is far from perfect the new code will not stop the use of offsets however it will make the use of offsets transparent and it will limit their use to not exceed the value of the procurement contract the 100 percent limit the code on offsets will take effect as of 1 july 2009 2 accessible to any visitor at the edas website wwwedaeuropaeu6azmvcyzglzh 8kabaivgnhnczgzh the edas raison dêtre is to improve european military capabilities for esdp however the classical distinction between defence and wider security is fading away firstly mili tary and civil means are used both in crisis management operations far away as well as in europe for the security of its citizens secondly capabilities overlap in particular in the areas of communications command control and information gathering thirdly technology research and development is increasingly based on dualuse customers both civilian and military the european unions three pillar structure clashes with this logic of civilmilitary inter action but this does not mean that even in the existing constellation efforts across the three pillars cannot be harmonised this is exactly what the eda is doing for example by seeking civilmilitary synergies with research investment of the commission under the 7th framework programme and with the european space agency in the same text the eda is developing military requirements which can be taken on board for pro grammes which so far are only focussing on civilian users the global monitoring for environment and security gmes programme is good example gmes services using imagery from satellites and from other assets can also be of use for crisis management operations this has nothing to do with militarising civilian projects it has everything to do with making optimum use of available assets and services by different customers and by doing so preventing that the money has to be spent twice 8dcxajhdc the european defence agency is wellaware that defence budgets of its member states will most likely remain constrained in particular under the impact of the ﬁnancialeco nomic crisis at the same time the costs of equipment rise annually between ﬁve and ten percent logically the ministries of defence room for investment will decrease there fore the european countries will have other choice but to invest more together and to seek civilmilitary synergies working together in europe will reduce costs and that is of paramount importance the eda is wellplaced in the family of european institutions to coordinate and stimulate this developmentthe authors wish to thank kristin peyron for her contribution but claim sole responsibility for any errors the views expressed are those of the authors alone and do not represent those of the european commissionlvivbwidchdgizxkavch9e4 gxvgylgivcyjv6jkczc this chapter focuses on civilian aspects of the european security and defence policy esdp in particular from the point of view of the european commission first the state of play in civilian esdp is examined with an analysis of the greatest chal lenges and the proposal of some solutions while the ultimate challenge is political and related to member states preparedness to hand over sovereignty on securityrelated matters many other challenges are operational and can be addressed in the short to medium term well before 2020 the commission has an important role to play it man ages the common foreign and security policy cfsp budget which ﬁnances all civilian esdp operations it contributes to more effective esdp through training of staff by establishing framework contracts to procure essential equipment and services and man ages preparatory measures to launch esdp missions the commission also ﬁnances number of operations in the broad ﬁeld of conﬂict prevention and crisis management some of which are directly supporting the objectives of esdp missions second civilian esdp is looked at in the overall eu context an important reason for the relative success of civilian esdp derives from the eus legitimacy its capacity to use soft power by engaging number of instruments and the general perception of the eu as civilian power the december 2008 review of the european security strategy under lines that the security threats confronting the eu have expanded to include issues such as energy and climate change the review also emphasises the securitydevelopment nexus which is fully justiﬁed by empirical evidence of intrastate conﬂicts in the past 30 years1in order to be most effective the eu has to deploy the right mix of instruments ranging from targeted military to civilian crisis management operations to conﬂict pre vention peace consolidation mediation humanitarian measures support to building of sustainable institutions and poverty alleviation the eu is in unique position to fulﬁl globally important role it would be mistake to focus solely on the military 1

beyond we conclude by cautioning that the current legitimacy enjoyed by the civilian esdp will be challenged by the eus engagement in more dangerous missions involving executive mandates in precarious security environments to fulﬁl its ambitions in the civilian esdp the eu needs clear strategy to make civilian esdp more effective with adequate budgets strengthened planning capacity and continued reliance on the broad security concept and soft power hivizdeavnvcyxjggzcixvaazczhcxkavch9e if we start with the track record of civilian esdp the most visible successes have been achieved by monitoring missions the aceh monitoring mission amm and the eu monitoring mission eumm in georgia in both cases rapid reaction was necessary in order to maintain or restore stable conditions the amm 199596 succeeded in moni toring the ceaseﬁre agreement between the indonesian government and the gam rebel movement negotiated by president ahtisaari the mission withdrew after the holding of elections which were broadly considered free and fair the eumm was launched in september 2008 to provide an eu monitoring presence on the ground in georgia the dispatching of 340 staff including over 200 eu monitors from 22 countries in just three weeks by deadline of 1 october was precondition for the withdrawal of russian forces from georgia excluding south ossetia and abkhazia and major achievement by the eu it should be noted however that in many ways these were atypical civilian esdp missions being reliant on rapid mobilisation of personnel equipment and resources by eu member states rather than steady buildup of capacity and equipment as per most missions in the longerterm postconﬂict context experience has shown that operations support ing the police and the rule of law can also be effective monitoring mentoring and advice to local police and administration have been the key concepts in these types of missions while the record is more mixed than with monitoring missions these missions can be politically important in bringing visibility to the eu in certain country or region the challenge is to devise appropriate exit strategies ensuring appropriate followup through institutionbuilding measures supported by community programmes if we look at the necessary capacities of civilian esdp one of the greatest problems is the lack of joint recruitment system for civilian operations the missions are essentially based on seconded staff being made available but this is proving to be increasingly difgxvgylgivcyjv6jkczc ﬁcult in particular for missions that take place in challenging security environments there should be an eulevel roster of staff with precise job descriptions member states also need to fulﬁl their commitment made in the european council of december 2008 to adopt national strategies for the recruitment of personnel to civilian esdp missions serving in missions should also advance careers in national administrations civilian esdp missions need specialists such as policemen judges and ruleoflaw ex perts the commission has ﬁnanced the training of member state staff belonging to the civilian response teams crts and of 600 police experts on civilian crisis management through the french centre national formation gendarmerie in saintastier to be followed by the caribinieri in vicenza according to training standards so that the robustness the ﬂexibility and the interoperability of the eu police elements is improved when deployed either by the eu or by the and osce the commission is willing to develop training activities to meet operational requirements in eu crisis management qualiﬁed staff are also needed in administration procurement and ﬁnance which are the least exciting area of crisis management but the one which can determine whether mission functions effectively or not the commission has provided training for esdp mission staff on procurement and ﬁnancial administration to ensure speedy delivery of quality goods and services it is also hiring procurement experts for immediate deploy ment to missions to further facilitate mission startup further the commission plans to progressively subdelegate responsibility for procurement and ﬁnancial matters to heads of mission moving from the present system of exante to expost control of expenditure what we also need is stock of basic equipment and services to be deployed when new opera tion is set up this can be virtual stock framework contracts or once critical mass has been reached warehouse the commission has established framework contracts for ar moured and 4wd vehicles and intends to expand the number of preapproved suppli ers in other ﬁelds such as telecommunicationsit equipment and high risk insurance structures and mechanisms for the preparation of esdp missions will need to be strength ened the commission will further develop the concept of preparatory measures which allow mission startup before political decisions are ﬁnalised for the georgia monitoring mission these measures contributed to timely deployment of the full esdp mission operational capability also depends on structures at the moment operational admin istrative and ﬁnancial support functions are dispersed between civilian missions them selves the cpcc and the commission centralising all of them to one agency for crisis management could bring synergies and increased efﬁciency in the long term this agency lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 could manage contracting procurement assets logistics human resources and recruit ment for all civilian missions the agency which could also manage crisis response meas ures ﬁnanced by the instrument for stability under the ﬁrst pillar would require close political oversight by the relevant eu institutions and the eventual joint external action service izjgdezvcjcdcvhvxkavcedlzg 8vgvxizghixhdxkavcdezgvidch why are eu missions considered legitimate from the point of view of host states why are the host states ready to accept eu missions part of the explanation is to be found in the characteristics of these operations themselves first eu member states broadly participate in operations civilian operations clearly have an eu label attached esdp operations are carried out under the leadership of head of mission appointed by the council the head of mission works under the au thority of the high representative for the cfsp to whom he or she2 reports thus sions are seen as representing the eu which gives them visibility and political weight3 furthermore most staff are seconded by the eu member states member states readiness to send seconded staff to missions varies from state to state the decision to second staff depends on the resources available to member states cooperation of key ministries such as interior and justice ministries and interest in particular po litical issue or geographic region despite the varying interests and resources of member states the missions have been identiﬁed as european union missions and not missions by particular eu member states this has made them more acceptable to host states second legitimacy results from actions ie when we do our job correctly effectively and impartially while the council has never commissioned independent experts to evalu ate how well the missions have attained the stated objectives council bodies conduct lessonslearned exercises which do not avoid critical analysis in the coming years the commission will conduct evaluations of the civilian missions in accordance with the ec financial regulation with focus on economy efﬁciency and effectiveness even in the absence of any rigorous independent evaluation it is difﬁcult to label any of the opera 2 thus far the only female heads of mission of civilian esdp operations are sylvie pantz eujust themis in georgia and maryse daviet eumm in the western balkans 3 liisa laakso capabilityimplementation gap in the making multilevel governance and european crisis manage ment in g walzenbach ed european governance policy making between politicisation and control aldershot ashgate 2005 pp 190221gxvgylgivcyjv6jkczc tions as failure the two monitoring missions in aceh and georgia and the military mission in chad and the central african republic can be classiﬁed as clear successes third when judging the success of the operations one must take into account that until recently none of the esdp civilian missions has had executive powers therefore ﬂicts between mission staff and the local population have been extremely rare seri ous incidents have been reported the risk of conﬂict would be greater if the missions had executive or correctional powers which substituted for local authorities in law forcement eulex kosovo which declared full operational capability on 6 april 2009 is the ﬁrst civilian esdp mission with executive powers azkzgvzdizjcdc the characteristics of esdp missions are not the only explanatory factor for the eus acceptability as partner in crisis management the overall leverage of the union is also an important factor from host state perspective other international organisations that are active in crisis management such as the organisation for the security and coopera tion in europe osce lack this leverage the notion of mentoring monitoring and inspection has been the dominant approach in all police and ruleoflaw missions in particular mentoring responsibilities largely entail response to longterm structural needs thus they come close to the institution building approach advocated in european commission programmes ec programmes however lack the same visibility that esdp operations receive they are implemented through third parties such as organisations independent consultants or nongov ernmental organisations for host states identiﬁcation with the european union in ec programmes is less evident than with civilian esdp operations however the volume of commission assistance is superior to that provided by any other international organisa tion it negotiates trade agreements on behalf of the eu the union as whole is the largest donor of development aid in the world and the largest trading partner for many less developed countries in short the union has many instruments at its disposal which increases its leverage in the international ﬁeld trade economic cooperation and development cooperation are all sources of soft power for the eu other sources of power include the external aspects of the eus internal policies energy transport transeuropean networks the power of the internal market including the strong euro functioning schengen area and the eus ability to provide coordinated response to the threats posed by pandemics climate change and competition for scarce resourceslvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 8dbbjcinchigjbzcih community instruments have for number of years been providing the commissions contribution to the unions overall crisis responses be it in response to natural disasters or to political crises in third countries in the latter case often alongside cfsp operations the launch of the instrument for stability ifs in 2007 considerably enhanced the com missions crisis response capacity4 compared to the earlier rapid reaction mechanism the crisis response component of the ifs represents considerable increase in ﬁnancial allocations approximately 130 million euro in 2009 and in duration of programmes 18 months with the possibility of extension or of followon interim response measures crisis response measures under the ifs address

conﬂict resolution the urgent need to secure the conditions for the delivery of ec assistance or alongside cfspesdp missions in order to facilitate achievement of their political goals approval procedures are designed to ensure rapid adoption of programmes two years after its inception the ifs crisis response component is now well established as highly complementary eu crisis management tool

24 million euro and georgia 17 mil lion euro one of the priorities of the ifs is to provide effective ﬂanking measures alongside esdp missions securing the political objectives of the missions the eu has made progress in 4 regulation ec 17172006 of the european parliament and of the council of 15 november 2006 establishing an instrument for stability official journal of the european communities l 327 p 111 in particular article 12 paragraph thereof the instrument also includes provisions for crisis preparedness and capacity building to address specific global and transregional threats article 12 paragraph bgxvgylgivcyjv6jkczc pursuing such comprehensive approaches in crisis management eg in kosovo drc chad afghanistan and georgia in georgia for example the postconﬂict support from the ifs was 15 million euro in 2008 with focus on the needs of new idps clearance of unexploded ordnance uxo support to idps displaced before the current conﬂict and peace and conﬁdence building measures this has been identiﬁed as the most pressing need in terms of stability in the country and has been developed in close cooperation and full complementarity with the deployment of the eu monitoring mission in georgia the ifs was mobilised early on in the days after the conﬂict when additional funding enabled the eus joint research centre in close collaboration with the eu satcen in torrejon to produce detailed damage assessment based on highresolution satellite imagery in particular on areas in and around south ossetia and abkhazia which were not accessible this assessment was carried out in late august in the context of the com mission factﬁnding mission and is contribution to the world bankled joint needs assessment and provided the basis for the donor conference in october in kosovo the ifs supports the costs of the international civilian ofﬁce whose head pieter feith is the eusr at the same time the vetting of new judges and prosecutors and the phasing out of unmiks pillar iv in afghanistan the commission mobilised the ifs to develop programme to enable the afghan government to reform its civil justice sector alongside and in parallel to the launch of eupol afghanistan this represents another good example of how the ﬁrst and second pillars can be effectively mobilised towards supporting comprehensive statebuilding approach another example is chad and the central african republic where alongside and in sup port of the eufor mission the ifs is delivering 15 million euro for the minurcat police programme protecting refugee camps and the election census in chad as well as 65 million euro for security system reform in the central african republic the stated objectives of the cfsp are related to security whether inside the eu or internationally5 while the main purpose of the instrument of stability is to provide as 5 article 11 of the treaty on european union teu specifies five objectives for the cfsp namely to safeguard the com mon values fundamental interests independence and integrity of the union in conformity with the principles of the united nations charter to strengthen the union in all ways to preserve peace and strengthen international security in accord ance with the principles of the united nations charter as well as the principles of the helsinki final act and the objectives of the paris charter including those on external borders to promote international cooperation to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedomslvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 sistance to help reestablish conditions for longterm development in practice the scope of the two instruments is similar and the challenge is to use them in complementary and mutually reinforcing way with view to consolidating comprehensive eu approach assistance measures under the instrument for stability combined with the more ventional development cooperation measures addressing poverty alleviation and institu tionbuilding can act effectively in conﬂict prevention by transforming the conﬂict set ting6 and eliminating sources of relative economic and political deprivation in societies the commission has also made an effort to mainstream the search for the root causes of conﬂict within the programme planning of its development cooperation measures it is important to recognise that not only the major actions in civilian crisis management are political development cooperation is also political and rarely seen as neutral within the host countries even the most politicallymotivated interventions can have beneﬁcial outcomes for people in target states nevertheless the eu would not be as acceptable partner in crisis management if it was perceived to be striving just for its own political and economic goals in such circumstances even its leverage would not be sufﬁcient to bring acceptability jbvchzxjginvcygzhedchwainidegdizxi neither the treaty on european union teu nor the treaty establishing the european community tec deﬁne in direct terms the common values of the ec or the eu how ever the founding principles for the union are set out in article 6 of the teu liberty democracy respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law these building blocks of the european union which probably do in fact encapsulate its core values will remain as fundamental in 2020 as they are today the promotion of these values will continue to be pursued in the eus external action whether on its own or in partnership with others notably the united nations concretely this can take place through human security approach focusing on the protection and empowerment of populations especially of those groups with the least access to security to justice and to the means of earning sustainable livelihood in the shaping of mandates for esdp missions this could mean greater focus on the protec tion of individuals threatened by violence and insecurity for instance the protection of refugee camps or training of local forces by the gendarmerie and police on the effects of 6 see raimo väyrynen to settle or to transform perspectives on the resolution of national and

on individuals possibilities to survive and develop and on em powering people to better fend for their own security rather than the more traditional focus on the development of capacities of national authorities7 the responsibility to protect populations against genocide war crimes ethnic cleans ing and crimes against humanity which was endorsed by the membership in 2005 at the world summit is more narrow and targeted concept than human security focusing on the prevention of mass atrocities the concept relies on the primary respon sibility of states to protect their own populations together with the responsibility of the international community to help states build their own capacity to shoulder this sovereign responsibility it does however also entail responsibility for the international community to act if states are unwilling to protect or incapable of protecting their popu lations both the preventive and capacitybuilding action in partnership with states to strengthen them in their own responsibility to protect and any potential action by the international community in cases of dire crisis comes in many shapes and forms the eu is particularly wellplaced to contribute through its broad range of policies and instruments including through both civilian and military esdp building in preventive elements into mandates of esdp operations in areas riskprone to mass atrocity crimes or having experienced mass atrocities in the past is also possibility the council joint action on eulex kosovo is the ﬁrst example of such direct reference to the responsi bility to protect8 an esdp mission can act through consent from the government for instance through support to mediation and preventive diplomacy or to help the gov ernment protect its population against armed groups but also in more challenging situations of nonconsent should the eu decide on the basis of security council mandate to deploy military force to physically protect populations from acute risks of mass atrocities for military esdp operations the eu legally requires mandate of the security council while we have much greater leeway for the civilian action we are in reality likely to tinue to develop our partnership with the as well as with other international and for that matter regional organisations in the area of peace and security in the years ahead this is inevitable needs are huge and the means available to all actors are limited and sometimes engaged in many arenas at the same time the and the eu are cur 7 as in for instance support to security system reform ssr where admittedly elements of for instance disarmament demobilisation and reintegration ddr can also be seen as having clear human security implications and the indirect effects on the population of ssr in the long run can contribute to increased human security 8 council joint action 2008124cfsp of 4 february 2008 on the european union rule of law mission in kosovo oj l 4292 1622008 p 1 par 3 there is

instruments at all stages of the conﬂict cycle and to build bridges with longerterm stabilisation and development efforts in the longer term however regional and subregional organisa tions should take greater responsibility in preventing conﬂict building up capacities in these organisations such as the african union is prerequisite for them to take on these tasks within the eu common security is one of the issues most positively assessed in opinion polls conducted in eu member states part of the value in common security is that we work together as the eu and are perceived as collective entity from the outside it is dif ﬁcult to see how an effective esdp could be achieved through géométrie variable outside the eu the eus image as civilian power working in the context of multi lateralism and reﬂecting positive experience of integration rule of law and 50 years of peace within its borders9 is source of legitimacy this image of the eu combined with the characteristics of esdp civilian operations and the unions overall leverage due to its economic strength and variety of instruments at its disposal places it in unique posi tion to work towards peace and security in the world 8dcxajhdc the eu has demonstrated its capability to play stabilising role in conﬂicts and their aftermath and it follows that eu assistance will be more and more solicited the eu will be called upon to act in more difﬁcult situations the emphasis of esdp has been on the promotion of security and stability in the world10 the union acts because it expects positive effects and positive spillover on security in europe however this begs funda mental questions concerning the level of ambition in the eu should the eu be global actor or concentrate more of its efforts on its immediate neighbourhood clearly the eu should not overstretch its capacities it should certainly concentrate on its immediate neighbourhood and at the same time continue to play key role in africa due to tradi tional ties and intertwined history but should we refuse challenges in other parts of the world if we consider that our important security and political interests are at stake and if we are best placed to help populations on the ground does the eu want to play the role of the global policeman as stated one of the characteristics of eu civilian missions is that until recently they have not had executive or correctional powers the union has been global trainer of police 9 françois duchêne europes role in world peace in richard mayne ed europe tomorrow london fontana 1972 10 in other words the last three objectives in article 11 teugxvgylgivcyjv6jkczc men rather than global policeman however the risk of conﬂicts is becoming more real eulex kosovos executive powers include elements such as riot control and witness protection missions are entering more risky and perilous environments the eu police mission in afghanistan is deployed in number of dangerous locations throughout the country the mission is required to implement considerable security measures to protect its staff the eus reputation as partner for host states will be tested much more seriously in the future than in the past as the union takes on more responsibility for crisis management it is bound to be confronted with challenging issues with local populations this might be described as the curse of the global policeman the reality is that those who have the capacity and legitimacy are being called to act in riskier environments with concomi tant increase in the difﬁculties in achieving success if the eu wants to play global role what is needed first the eu needs sufﬁcient funds to carry out its missions this is on track in the past four years cfsp has been the quickestgrowing external relations policy area in terms of budget funding has not been an obstacle to the achievement of political ambitions in cfsp the european parlia ment the second arm of the budget authority has been supportive of increased resources for cfsp adequate resources need to be ensured also in the future ﬁnancial framework 20142020 secondly member states need to back up ambition with human resources committed to civilian esdp current arrangements of providing staff are not robust enough leading to shortfalls in key missions and successive calls for contributions to act quickly staff rosters in member states need to be drawn upon so that missions can get up and running quickly the rapid deployment of eumm in georgia in september 2008 demonstrated what can be achieved when the political will is there thirdly strategic planning functions for esdp civilian and military missions need to be strengthened this work is underway in the council secretariat fourth to enhance efﬁciency the eu needs to concentrate all support functions for civil ian operations in one single body which we have above labelled agency for crisis man agement the feasibility of such an agency should be studied in the near future possibili ties of combining support to military operations could be explored at later stage fifth and most importantly what the eu needs is clear strategy based on commonly agreed goals and policies the european security strategy11 has to be implemented it is not difﬁcult to predict that the ess will be increasingly based on broad security cept recognising the need for comprehensive approach this calls for more effective and coordinated use of all eu instruments this will be easier to achieve in the frame work of the joint external action service if the lisbon treaty is adopted 11 council of the european union the european security strategy secure europe in better world brussels 12 december 2003 revised in december 2008evgi edaixvchéezghezxikzhchzvgxdhbvgiedlzg 6azmvcyzghijww december 2008 saw the tenth anniversary of the st malo summit between the french president jacques chirac and the british prime minister tony blair the event is often re garded as the historic moment that paved the way for the development of the european union as security actor and more speciﬁcally esdp soon after that in helsinki dur ing the finnish eu presidency in 1999 the framework for the esdp was set up the developments since st malo have been remarkable the eu has progressively put together the institutional framework required to mount operations and missions both military and civilian eu member states have jointly agreed that they should be able to deploy 60000 troops within 60 days the decisionmaking structures are well estab lished and the structures to undertake operations continue to evolve since the ﬁrst esdp operations were launched in 2003 the eu has launched more than 20 crisis management operations civilian and military ranging from small advisory missions to military operations with thousands of soldiers deployed few of us could have expected that at the time when esdp was established and yet there is degree of scepticism as the eu and its member states struggle to ﬁnd the resources to match the ambition of strengthening the global role of the union last years review of the european security strategy ess acknowledged what has been achieved but also underlined that the eu has to do more the next few years will test the eus resolve to proceed in conformity with the strategic vision it has made its own 6hvzgldgayvcyvbdgzhzxjgzjgdez izjéhzmizgcvavxidcvcchigzci the global scene is rapidly changing and so is the eu itself the eu is both product and driver of globalisation an example of what annemarie slaughter the current direclvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 tor of policy planning at the us department of state has called networked power1 postsovereign polity which depends on institutions and norms it sets in interaction with other actors at the same time we are facing challenge we may be moving to more multipolar world where the emerging powers the socalled brics are gaining in importance and seeking more inﬂuential role we need to ask ourselves whether the eu is ready for the changing international order is the eu sufﬁciently equipped to be able to play key role and to promote its interests the nature of the challenges is also changing our interests are becoming increasingly global and less tied to certain territory and the distinction between external and in ternal security is becoming increasingly blurred whether it is tsunami ﬁnancial crisis failed states or more conventional conﬂicts or new challenges like climate change or pandemics we are affected and cannot stand idle the union must be able to act in coherent manner and to speak with one voice all too often the council meetings in brussels lapse into traditional multilateral gatherings where the main interest lies in presenting national positions and scoring points instead of tradeoffs between national and european considerations we should ﬁnd ways that would beneﬁt both we need to resist the alternative which would mean more national positions and more fragmented union izjéhfjzhidgxdbbdchzxjgin but the question is not just about stronger foreign policy for the union the eu also plays key role when it comes to the security and stability of europe both within the ion as well as in the neighbourhood as result the prospect of common defence has been part of esdp from the beginning deepening integration common currency the eus enlargement and neighbourhood policies the development of the unions area of freedom security and justice as well as evolving partnerships all these are contributing to our common security therefore esdp is not simply matter of external relations it has direct impact on the security of our own region we should bear in mind that the esdp began with actions in the balkans the transformation of which is now being driven by the perspective of eu mem bership 1 anne marie slaughter new world order princeton and oxford princeton university press 20046azmvcyzghijww this dual objective to be stronger in foreign policy on the one hand and the develop ment of the unions security and defence dimension on the other has been at the core of the esdps development all along bdkcvzvy much now depends on the lisbon treaty the new treaty introduces measures which would make the union stronger in foreign policy and provide better tools for effective action the new european external action service eeas the doublehatted high rep resentative who will be both vicepresident of the commission charged with external re lations and president of the foreign affairs council responsible for the common foreign and security policy the new position of the president of the european council all these are welcome steps moreover the entry into force of the lisbon treaty would bring new momentum also to the development of the esdp it includes number of important innovations the mutu assistance clause in case of armed attack the solidarity clause in the event of disaster permanent structured cooperation for those member states which wish to go further in the ﬁeld of defence as well as the application of the socalled enhanced cooperation in the context of the enlarged petersberg tasks the mutual assistance obligation in the lisbon treaty reinforces solidarity among the member states the member states will now commit themselves to assisting each other by all available means in the event of armed aggression this is an important step equally binding on all member states taking stock of these developments the recent government report on finnish security and defence policy2 underlines the role of the eu as finlands fundamental security pol icy choice the white paper looks forward to further strengthening the esdp and ﬁrms our intention to participate in the permanent structured cooperation assuming that the lisbon treaty will ﬁnally be ratiﬁed it promises advances in pooling and sharing military capabilities and advances the cause of european defence material cooperation that contributes to our own security but is important also in view of the development of the eu and its role in the world from the beginning of finlands eu membership it has been clear to us that the eu also includes security dimension there continues to be solid support for this role in 2 finnish security and defence policy 2009 government report prime ministers office publications 132009 helsinki 2009 available at

been strong proponent of esdp we have actively participated in esdp including both civilian and military crisis management operations and will continue to do so h9eidyvnazhhdchazvgczy 6xicibz while the eu has demonstrated its ability to launch an operation extremely rapidly as was the case recently with the eu monitoring mission in georgia getting operations ful ly up and running continues to be difﬁcult and laborious process the same challenges were present earlier when the eu started its monitoring mission in aceh indonesia in 20056 improvements need to be introduced in the whole sequence of crisis management from early warning and conﬂict prevention advance planning and preparedness to deploy ment and execution of operations to this end decisionmaking structures in brussels need to be streamlined strategic and operational planning situational awareness as well as support services for the operations must all be strengthened the planning phase and launch of an operation remain particularly challenging also the current headquarters system for conducting military crisis management operations needs to be examined more closely it would be much better and simpler if the eu had permanent operational headquarters of its own the current alternatives national head quarters or nato headquarters could still be used for eu operations of some type or of particularly demanding nature for instance national headquarters could be used for naval operations such as the current operation atalanta off the coast of somalia much has been done to create rapid response instruments both on the military as well as the civilian side the eu has set up system of battle groups two of which are always on standby fin land has participated in them twice and is preparing for two battle group turns in 2011 it is paradox that while the eu faces difﬁculties in force generation in the so called normal military crisis management operations there are two battle groups on stand by at the same time waiting to be activated for rapid response purposes we need to ﬁnd ways to make better use of this capability ideas such as modular use or their use to support an ongoing military crisis management operation should be looked at in more 6azmvcyzghijww detail funding arrangements should be expanded as well to share the ﬁnancial burden of battle group operations further work is also needed to improve the rapid response capability for civilian crisis management the civilian response teams could be further improved so that they could be used as an effective instrument as kind of civilian crisis management package for various kinds and phases of civilian crisis management missions further work is also needed to ensure that the eu has the right equipment available for rapid deployment when required 8vevwaizhvgzzn we all know the saying its all about capabilities and i believe that this is understood by us all but still matching capabilities to political ambitions remains challenge given the total military spending by eu member states the union should be able to do more to tackle critical shortfalls such as airlift another important issue is the ﬁnancing of crisis management the athena mechanism which covers some costs of eu operations should be expanded for example good step forward would be to cover strategic trans port as common costs many experts argue that europe is spending too much on items that are not really need ed and that given the size of its total military budget europe should be able to do more in crisis management the eu member states have jointly agreed that they should be able to deploy 60000 troops within 60 days still force generation for even much smaller operations tends to be painful just look at the experience from the latest operations in africa one in the democratic republic of congo drc and the other in chad and the central african republic meanwhile efforts are being made for instance through the pooling of resources and intensiﬁed industrial cooperation there are high expectations of the european defence agency with regard to capability development much depends on how the member states are ready to support the work of the agency sometimes it appears as if there was rivalry between the requirements of crisis man agement and those of national defence this is of course false proposition as these are really two sides of the same coin the improvement of capabilities and interoper ability are important from the perspective of both crisis management and national defencelvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 the same challenge continues to exist in civilian crisis management the eu has great number of missions doing excellent work at the same time there is constant strug gle to ensure that the missions have the required personnel at their disposal the re cruitment process as whole should be improved in particular efforts are needed in meeting the demand for adequately trained personnel following the same operational procedures in time this may entail new institutional arrangements on the european level to support the rapidly expanding civilian dimension of crisis management and to guarantee uniform approach higzcizcizxdbegzzchkzveegdvx one key lesson perhaps the key lesson from recent crisis management operations is that more comprehensive approach is needed nowhere is this more striking than in afghanistan the challenge extends from address ing the insurgency to building the state structures supporting social and economic velopment countering the drug business strengthening the rule of law and respect for human rights and supporting the buildup of afghanistans own security structures longterm engagement of the international community is necessity at the same time there are number of international actors participating in these efforts organisations nato the eu even the osce individual countries nongovern mental organisations how can we ensure that different actors international as well as local are pulling in the same direction how can coherence and efﬁciency be increased if there is consistent plan what is it these are questions each member state is fre quently facing in domestic debates comprehensive approach requires toolkit having all the necessary tools at our dis posal in order to achieve the desired outcomes there must be continuum of actions at the various stages of crisis management and postconﬂict peacebuilding it is important that military and civilian crisis management as well as development efforts and humani tarian cooperation are coordinated so that international efforts are more effective and more coherent the role of local actors cannot be overemphasised building up state institutions in cluding security structures based on the rule of law and operating under democratic trol is of key importance in developing comprehensive approach local ownership is crucial chances of success in crisis management will be low if our plans are seen as for eign imports lacking legitimacy in the eyes of the local population 6azmvcyzghijww therefore debate about security sector reform ssr activities has become extremely important it is the key to success and part of building an exit strategy for internation crisis management presence support for training the army and the police as well as forthe judicial system are areas where the international community and the eu in partic ular needs to do more for instance we could improve our ability to send small advisory teams or mobile training teams to support security sectorrelated work part of the challenge of the comprehensive approach may be in the mindset various ac tors military civilian development people should learn to work better together and perhaps to understand each other better than is the case today in this respect training efforts are crucial as is the promotion of career paths combining civilian and military expertise the advantage of the eu is that it has the wide toolbox that comprehensive approach requires for the eu the challenge is more about ﬁnetuning and using the tools more effectively in particular the current effort of unifying strategic planning under the new crisis man agement and planning directorate cmpd serves the goal of comprehensive approach that will help to build one comprehensive plan that makes use of both military and civil ian crisis management instruments building civilianmilitary headquarters would be logical next step further work on the comprehensive approach should be pursued on issues such as situational awareness intelligence logistics and procurement 8ddezgvizlidizgvxidgh finally one of the particularly appealing characteristics of the esdp is its openness even today large number of personnel from third countries the united states turkey and norway among others are serving in the eu civilian crisis management missions long list of countries including russia have participated in the eus military operations the eu has also drawn lessons from its cooperation with the united nations we should not forget the key role of the in the maintenance of international peace and security it is by far the biggest organisation doing crisis management and crucially with very few exceptions it has mandated all crisis management operations that the eu nato or other organisations have undertaken the security council is clearly the best way of lending international legitimacy to crisis management eu cooperation with the extends to the practical level the latest example being the handover of military crisis management from the eu to the in chad and the central african republiclvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 besides the another key partner for the eu is nato in the area of defence planning and capability development the relationship is and should be close whether deployed in an eu operation or nato operation the pool of forces from which europeans will draw their troops for deployment will largely be the same therefore it is important to develop capabilities in mutually coherent manner as to crisis management operations we have currently several models for organising co operation between the eu and nato in bosnia the eu has implemented military op eration under the socalled berlin plus agreement that gives the eu access to nato assets in crisis management in kosovo and afghanistan the eu is implementing its own civil ian crisis management missions alongside nato military operations and cooperation takes place at practical level on the ground off the coast of somalia both are involved through military crisis management in wider international efforts to combat piracy in my view this sort of ﬂexible approach for cooperation is welcome at the same time more could be done to strengthen strategic dialogue between the eu and nato but the challenge of effective cooperation with various actors involved in crisis management re mains the eu is working with large number of other actors which may include other interna tional organisations nongovernmental organisations national governments and devel opment agencies it is acting through its own arms the european commission the eu crisis management instruments and alongside member states the union has devel oped the system of special representatives who are well placed to coordinate overall eu efforts in particular conﬂict area the forthcoming european external action service eeas will hopefully reduce intraeu competition not only between the commission and the council but also between the eu institutions and the member states but there will be more scope for concertation the issue is particularly pressing in the case of stabilisation and reconstruction where the eu loses inﬂuence by having too many actors and cacophony of voices both on the ground and in the capitals h9ecvhigdczghzxjginvcyyzzcxzybzchdc the eu is an excellent example of networked power it has wide range of instruments at its disposal political tools development neighbourhood policies crisis management on many fronts it is showing by example and leading in norm setting it is leading actor on climate change issues it plays key role in supporting human rights and the rule of law and through its activities it has been developing human security approach of its own 6azmvcyzghijww hence the union is well equipped to be active in more globalised world it has security strategy which is reviewed and updated from time to time the european defence agency has drawn up longterm vision which will be of great help in further capability develop ment at some point the eu should also draw up security and defence white paper for itself the real test is how much the eu can deliver in terms of action and inﬂuence gdbhbvgiedlzg the center for strategic and international studies csis commission on smart power cochaired by richard armitage and joseph nye argued in its 2007 report that the unit ed states had recently overrelied on hard power and proposed smart power strategy the eu in contrast could be criticised of doing the opposite it has the soft tools it is the frontrunner in developing civilian crisis management the union is doing tremen dous job in the ﬁeld of development and reconstruction its weakness relates rather to its tools of hard power as armitage and nye have underlined smart power is neither hard nor soft it is the skilful combination of both3 over the past few years we have witnessed esdp making steady progress that can be expected to continue by 2020 the eu will be more effective and more united in pursuing its foreign policy idvgyedlzg consequently the eu is likely to have much stronger security and defence dimension in 2020 than it has now much depends on the political will of the member states and on their readiness to make available the necessary capabilities and resources to develop the esdp we have jointly set the level of ambition but clearly there continues to be different views among the member states on how to proceed this will ensure that internal discussion within the union will be more or less constant and hopefully that will result in steady progress should the eu declare itself as military alliance by 2020 the answer is the eu is much more than traditional military alliance the member states are deeply bound together the union is built on solidarity among member states and the development of the eus security and defence dimension will take place in that context 3 richard armitage and joseph s nye cochairs csis commission on smart power smarter more secure america washington dc center for strategic and international studies 2007 p 7lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 the mutual assistance obligation of the lisbon treaty will undoubtedly play role in future discussions on the defence dimension of the union occasionally one hears ques tions about whether this is taking the eu onto collision course with nato in my view the lisbon treaty makes it clear that this will not be the case the eu commitments are consistent with nato commitments it is not an eitheror situation both the eu and nato are needed and continue to play role in the future defence integration in europe bjaihezzycizgvidc4 the eu member states are increasingly pooling sharing and synchronising their military assets not simply out of political will but also out of necessity it is the only costeffective way most member states have already participated in the development of multinational forces such as the eurocorps and that will continue there is much talk about multispeed integration or differentiated integration elements of that can be identiﬁed already in todays esdp cooperation the lisbon treaty would give more room for this sort of development also in the ﬁeld of security and defence for instance through enhanced cooperation and permanent structured cooperation this may be useful in view of the unions further development at the same time it is important to ensure that the system is inclusive rather than exclu sive and that those willing and capable can participate somewhere along the road there is prospect of common solidarity force it could have as the european parliaments outgoing president hansgert pöttering has suggest ed standard doctrine and common rules of engagement it could be used for both eu and nato operations or to assist operations building on the experience gathered on the multinational forces such as eurocorps as well as the eu bgs ckzhicevgiczgheh our security depends on the global and regional security architecture russian president medvedev has called for revision of european security architecture we already have functioning structures in place the eu nato the osce the council of europe and overhaul is needed we also have the common principles and values it is more about making better use of what we already have but dialogue about our common security interests as such is welcome and through this dialogue we could also enhance coopera tion with russia 6azmvcyzghijww in view of global developments we should deepen our relationship with the the larg est provider of global security in 2020 our engagement with the will be even closer than today there is question that peacekeeping operations are today very much in demand with over 90000 men and women deployed around the world and this will still be the case in 2020 in africa the african union au is likely to strengthen its role also in the area of crisis management investing in cooperation is in our interest the eus relationship with nato has been overly complicated but we all hope that by 2020 nato and the eu will be working handinhand by then the eu troops may have been deployed in nato missions perhaps the eu battle group concept and nato re sponse force function could in time evolve into one integrated system the tandem of the eu and nato has not resulted in duplication both are needed and can contribute to common strategic objectives the importance of close transatlantic cooperation will grow as the buildup of the esdp continues we should have an effective triangle of cooperation between the eu nato and the us president obama has brought new dynamism to international cooperation and expectations are high that this will open new prospects in transatlantic relations 8vcchxzcz as we look towards 2020 we need to keep in mind lessons from the past decade the pace of change is rapid we may be going through paradigm change towards truly glo balised order towards more multipolar order but also unexpected events have shaped and most likely will continue to shape our environment we need to prepare for the future with the right mix of ﬂexibility and determination europe needs its own version of smart powerjgdezvcyzzcxzvjijgzxvaazcz cjcdhzkzgvcdizmzgv this year it is the tenth anniversary of the approval of the european security and defence policy esdp by the european council of cologne propelled into action by the franco british bilateral summit at st malo in june 1999 the then 15 member states of the european union eu decided to take on the taboo subject of the military dimension of european integration topic that had been beyond the pale ever since the failure of the european defence community in 1952 and to establish the conditions for the eu to play its full role on the international stage and to give the european union the neces sary means and capabilities to assume its responsibilities regarding common european policy on security and defence1 this intention was formally consecrated with the nice treaty in 2000 historical step in the process of european integration since then esdp has been one of the most dynamic areas of european integration re gardless of the advances and retreats with the various treaties of the union european integration has advanced on the basis of two key methods on the one hand through the dominant process over the last few years namely with the preparation of the constitutional treaty of the european union which encapsulates the attempt to ﬁnd broad political vision and corresponding institutional architecture for the eu which by deﬁnition will always be imperfect and incomplete on the other hand there is the method that prevailed from the time that robert schuman inaugurated the european project in 1950 which seeks to unite the european ideal with demonstrable european capacity to solve the daytoday problems of its citizens we cannot deny the evidence of past experience namely the failure of the european defence community at the start of the process of european integration and of the stitutional treaty in 2005 which tells us that attempts to move ahead too swiftly can result in serious setbacks from which it is not always easy to recover by contrast the path of taking small steps may be more labourintensive and require greater patience but it has also proved to be successful esdp illustrates the success of the second method 1 appendix iii declaration of the european council on the reinforcement of the common european security and fence policy conclusions of the presidency european council of cologne 34 june 1999 available at httpueeuint uedocscms_datadocspressdatapteckolnpthtm lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 based on the shared principles and values that lie at the heart of the union democracy respect for basic rights and freedoms esdp has evolved since 1999 through prudent and concrete steps in the institutional operational and doctrinal domains and even gone beyond the literal terms of the treaty that frames it institutionally the eu now has the structures enabling it to respond to decisions with military implications at the helsinki european council of december 1999 the mem ber states agreed to establish the political and security committee psc the military committee and the eu chief of staff thus creating the necessary framing and decision making mechanisms to address military matters in terms of capabilities the headline goal 2010 was approved in 20042 following meth odology similar to that established at helsinki albeit with renewed goals this guiding document provided for the creation of european rapid response capabilities to engage in military peacekeeping and peaceimposition missions and to help manage crises it mandated the formation of battle groups which were declared fully operational in janu ary 2007 this was followed by the publication of the progress catalogue during the second half of 2007 under the portuguese presidency of the council of the eu this document described the state of europes military capabilities and identiﬁed the main priorities and strategic gaps the operational impact of which has to be addressed before 2010 three areas stand out in particular military force protection the ability to deploy mili tary forces strategic transport in particular and intelligence in order to acquire infor mation superiority operationally the eu has been carrying out missions on the ground uninterruptedly be it in coordination with nato within the framework of the berlin plus agreements or autonomously in order to respond to demands for regional security and stability the eu has promoted more than two dozen esdp missions around the world both civilian and military and there are currently twelve missions underway deploying more than 6600 men and women on the ground in only few years the eu also proved to be capable of responding promptly to crisis situations as shown by the response to the conﬂict in georgia in the summer of 2008 and of setting up missions in speciﬁc locations in timely fashion as evidenced by the eufor chadcar mission an operation that establishes bridge with the united na tions mission on the ground 2headline goal 2010 was approved by the general affairs and foreign relations council on 17 may 2004 and signed by the european council on 1718 june of that year the document is available at httpconsiliumeuropaeuuedocs cmsupload201020headline20 goalpdfcjcdhzkzgvcdizmzgv lastly in doctrinal terms the european security strategy document was presented in 20033 and identiﬁed the main threats to common security this document was ground breaking as it was the ﬁrst in the history of european integration to deﬁne joint stra tegic vision guiding european foreign actions in december 2008 ﬁve years after its ap proval the secretary general of the council and high representative for foreign policy javier solana presented document to the european council assessing the implementa tion of the strategy4 in the light of the current international context and the new chal lenges facing the union and proposing new policies to render european foreign policy more effective and to ensure that it delivers by living up to eu goals and ambitions for the coming decade regarding the achievements of the esdp thus far there are opposing views rooted in the historical cleavage between two different strategic visions of european security the tinental and the atlantic thus there are those who defend the european army model and feel that we are far from achieving our goals and there are those who think that eu ropean security is about the defence of the atlantic and who therefore feel that we have gone much too far but this dichotomy makes sense now if we are to face the threats and dangers of today and tomorrow we must set aside the prejudices of the past and ad dress both european and transatlantic security and defence needs jgdezvcyzzcxzlvixvaazczh4 in order to ensure that european defence can deal with the strategic and security chal lenges of the coming decade we must ﬁrst ascertain how ambitious security and defence policy the eu wishes to have as deﬁned in the treaty of lisbon signed on 13 december 2007 by the heads of the 27 eu member states and second we must establish which insti tutional operational and conceptual adaptations are necessary to turn aims into reality as regards the dispositions of the lisbon treaty5 and keeping in mind that esdp is framed by the common foreign and security policy cfsp it is important to highlight three basic innovations first there is the introduction of two key solidarity clauses cerning security and defence matters mutual defence clause article 42 7 accord ing to which if member state is the victim of armed aggression on its territory the other 3 the european security strategy document secure europe in better world was approved by the european council on 12 december 2003 the document is available at httpwwwconsiliumeuropaeuuedocscmsupload031208essiippdf 4 the european council of december 2007 invited the secretary general of the council and high representative for for eign policy javier solana to analyse the implementation of the strategy together with the commission and the member states and to propose new elements enabling the strategy to be better executed the final report presented to the council of the eu is available at httpregisterconsiliumeuropaeupdfen08st17st17104en08pdf 5 the consolidated version of the treaty of the european union is available at httpwwwconsiliumeuropaeushow pageaspxid1296langenlvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power and solidarity clause article 222 which comes into play when natural or manmade disasters or terrorist attacks occur according to these clauses member states commit themselves to mutually assisting their peers in speciﬁc situations thus promoting the eu founding principle of solidarity among member states second the treaty of lisbon has broadened the scope of missions originally known as the petersberg missions in which the eu can use civilian and military means article 43 and has for the ﬁrst time speciﬁed the kinds of missions that ﬁt into this category6 third and ﬁnally two important mechanisms for security and defence cooperation have been introduced to the lisbon treaty the reinforced cooperation mechanism7 and the permanent structured cooperation mechanism8 concerning reinforced cooperation this was mechanism established by the amsterdam and nice treaties that now covers foreign and common security policy in situations where the union as whole cannot achieve the cooperation goals within reasonable time frame and whenever at least nine member states participate in the proposed action the permanent structured coopera tion mechanism by contrast provides for closer cooperation between the member states that show capacity and the willingness to make greater efforts in the security domain the goal of this mechanism is clear to promote the establishment of an effective politi cal framework and instrument to develop european military capabilities according to criteria agreed to by the member states more speciﬁcally the goal is to encourage states to channel the resources they already spend on defence to focus on collective interests particularly when it comes to the deployment and maintenance of military forces and the promotion of defence research and development rd the development of this cooperation mechanism can be seen from two different angles crit ics consider that it merely creates the opportunity for the main european powers to deepen cooperation sidelining all the other member states but others feel that this may promote the development of the defence capabilities of all the member states large and small alike which show willingness to contribute to common defence and security goals namely by enabling them to participate in international military missions it is the member states of the eu that must choose which of these interpretations they ﬁnd most persuasive 6 this includes joint disarmament actions humanitarian and evacuation missions military advisory and assistance sions conflictprevention and peacekeeping missions missions by combat forces to manage crises including missions to reestablish peace and stabilization missions at the end of conflicts 7 see title iv of the treaty on the working of the european union 8 articles 42 and 46 of the teu and the protocol on permanent structured cooperation established by article 42 of the teucjcdhzkzgvcdizmzgv the essential goal of these newly created instruments is to give the eu broad and co herent vision that allows it to become global player with decisive role to play in the promotion of safer and more stable world for this to happen it is essential to consider european defence priority it is therefore necessary to strengthen esdp in order to achieve this and taking into account the challenges that the eu faces in the international arena it is crucial to promote series of changes in the institutional ceptual and operational in terms of capabilities domains first as regards the institutional domain in addition to deﬁning threats already out lined in the european security strategy document we must examine how these threats relate to one another and how the union can address them effectively clearly it is im portant to promote coordinated interpillar action so that the strategy is mirrored in the policies and mechanisms that are adopted to promote global and integrated action although complementary the security and development domains are divided between two pillars of european integration the community pillar which is managed by the commission and the foreign security policy and cfsp pillar which is under the aegis of the council and the member states thus emphasis should be placed on eu internal co ordination both coordination among those institutions with security and developmen tal competences the council and the commission and coordination between member state national policies further it is indispensable not only to ensure that the general public political parties and civil society as whole support esdp goals but also to improve democratic control of the military instruments at the disposal of the eu this is one of the functions of the parliamentary assembly of the western european union weu after the approval of the treaty of lisbon and notwithstanding the competences of the european parliament this will also be reinforced responsibility of national parliaments the european public needs to be made aware of the importance of security and defence issues not just at the international level but also for the process of european integration itself second conceptual change is needed more speciﬁcally we need to update of the eu ropean security strategy the union must recognise and face new challenges and risks and keep in mind not just the prevailing international context but also the need to af ﬁrm the eu as global player that is willing to share the burden of international security responsibilities as regards challenges the eu cannot ignore the importance of relations with russia and with new emerging powers such as india china and brazil it must also address issues related to globalisation and the increasing rapidity of ﬂows be they ﬁnan cial informational or other as regards the risks in addition to those already identiﬁed lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 by the security strategy we must consider concepts like energy security maritime food and internet security as well as the dangers posed by climate change including natural disasters and pandemics it is also necessary to deﬁne the rules on and framework for military intervention namely in highlevel risk environments we cannot pretend that the international system is free of uncertainty or ignore growing calls for eu civilian andor military intervention and we must also consider that intervention scenarios may increase with the introduction to the treaty of lisbon of the mutual defence and solidarity clauses among member states furthermore the eu must take on increasing security and defence duties not just with in its own borders on european territory but also to promote stability within its near neighbourhood particularly in africa and the mediterranean for this reason it can not depend exclusively on the military capabilities of the atlantic alliance which would anyway constitute negation of its own defence responsibilities we should state things clearly in this regard the goal is not to establish rivalry with the atlantic alliance but on the contrary to ensure that capabilities are complementary and autonomous so that europe becomes useful and credible ally in the task of bringing peace and stability to the international system third we need to change capabilities to speak about european defence is to speak about the development of autonomous credible and adapted military capabilities which take the new international strategic environment into account given the challenges that the eu faces it will be necessary to deepen europes rapid response capabilities to address crisis situations in three major ways forming land air and naval battle groups reinforcing the capacity for autonomous planning and opera tions and creating european defence technological and industrial base to that end we need an intergovernmental mechanism to promote the harmonisation of military needs establishing the kinds of economies of scale that can sustain shared defence industry among the eu member states this should be the central role of the european defence agency eda as regards the development of european capabilities three broad guidelines should be followed ﬁrst developing capabilities that include european rapid response mech anisms second developing capabilities that permit more demanding operations and third promoting projects within the framework of the eda the ultimate goal of this effort one that should be shared by all the member states is the creation of competi tive and efﬁcient european defence market cjcdhzkzgvcdizmzgv finally as regards the operational dimension the eu has played an increasing role in conﬂictprevention conﬂictmanagement and conﬂictresolution missions particularly on the african continent these missions have civilian as well as military component and they involve various state institutions military and police forces judiciaries and instruments development assistance in other words the goal is to promote integrated security statebuilding and development capacities this can happen at two levels ﬁrst by promoting shared and integrated knowledge about security and by working jointly on development issues and second by establishing multidisciplinary teams which in clude representatives from the areas of defence foreign affairs development justice and home affairs among others to promote the adoption of integrated strategies to frame the foreign action of the european union on the other hand we must try to improve the operational results of european military forces more speciﬁcally it is essential to increase the percentage of deployable visàvis effective forces and to develop the capacity to sustain them abroad establishing smaller more expeditionary groups based on combined or joint forces this is the path followed by various european countries in the modernisation of their armed forces finally we must rethink and adapt esdp ﬁnancing mechanisms to suit the needs gener ated by international crises particularly those requiring rapid response member states must take on the civilian and military costs of esdp missions just as they have accepted the duties associated with the creation of international security conditions on the other hand it is also important to consider innovative ﬁnancing formulas both at the nation and community level which may facilitate the availability and use of military forces within the framework of the eu jgdezvcvcyigvchviavcixyzzcxzlvijijgz4 the atlantic alliance and the eu are two fundamental pillars of multilateral security and fence insofar as this is the case any esdp developments will be coordinated with and com plement the central role that nato plays in western european defence we must ﬁnd the institutional means permanently to articulate their respective priorities coordinate their sions and maximise their security and defence capacities and means the goal is not to create rivalry between the two but rather to establish useful and credible alliance between them european defence should not rival the international security system or nato it should without shadow of doubt play complementary role this is the spirit of the berlin plus agreements which are the foundation of the strategic partnership between the eu and nato and should be the spirit guiding the member states and the atlantic alliance we must deﬁne clearly and reinforce the strategic framework of relations between the atlantic alliance and the european union in the areas of security defence and crisis man agement it is true that there is already concrete cooperation between the two institutions but what we need most is shared strategic vision without which defence and security complementarities between the atlantic alliance and the european union cannot evolve stably and permanently this must be the goal we strive to achieve in the context of the transatlantic relationship to fully restore trust between the two pillars of the alliance the european and the north american and the time to do this is now today the united states recognises the need for strong and cohesive europe and for the reinforcement of autonomous european defence capabilities with framework that allows the eu and the atlantic alliance to share responsibility for the collective defence of european citizens it is also necessary for the member states of the eu to conﬁrm their determination to reject strategies that stand in the way of rather than consolidate the internal cohesion of the union as well as the cohesion of the transatlantic relationship we need this kind of commitment so that the atlantic alliance can address its growing international security duties and for the european union to take on its european fence and near neighbourhood security responsibilities the eu must accept its responsibilities if europe is to have future as an international player it will remain an economic power and it will still be civil power but it must also have military dimension there is doubt that this is europes destiny and it is one to which portugal subscribes thirty years ago the idea that the european community might become an international player was nothing short of utopian today that is indispensible for european security and global stability the goal of making the eu global player with broad capabilities should guide our efforts to consolidate europes security and defence policyhzxjginvcyyzzcxzcizzcavgzy jgdez vxzhvgnjholdah the process of postwar european integration was driven by the idea of the creation of peaceful community of nations in europe hence while the eu was committed to build ing peace among its members the notion of military power was to some degree deleted from the dictionary of european integration even the pleven plan to create suprana tional european army had to large extent been political response to the controversy re lated to the reconstruction of the german bundeswehr rather than to the challenge posed by the growing power of the ussr in this way the real burden of defending europe was placed for the entire cold war period upon the us acting through nato it was against this background that françois duchêne wrote in the early 1970s that the one thing europe cannot be is major military power even if federated he argued with nuclear deterrent controlled by european president the psychological and physical vulnerability of cramped urbanised societies to threats of nuclear attack and the inner diversity of what would still be politically loose agglomeration of power would make it inconceivable for european deterrent to be anything but selfprotective1 although this observation still has its merit the present security context in the world leaves europe choice but to attempt to contradict it in postpostcold war era characterised by the emergence of new power centres in the world and the mixture of both old and new types of security threats europe needs some military power not only to be viewed as genuine actor in international affairs but also to provide for the defence of its citizens but apart from the new security context two other factors have been instrumental in the emergence of european defence policy first the maastricht treaty 1992 launched the process leading to the common foreign and security policy cfsp encompassing all questions related to the security of the union including the eventual framing of common defence policy which might in time lead to common defence2 second if maastricht provided an institutional framework for the subsequent development 1 françois duchêne europes role in world peace in richard mayne ed europe tomorrow sixteen europeans look ahead royal institute for international affairs london fontana 1972 pp 378 2 title v article j4 of the treaty on european union february 1992lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 of european security and defence policy from st malo until lisbon it was the two rounds of eu enlargement of 1997 and 2004 that gave european defence solid geo graphical basis and new geopolitical context the accession of new member states clearly enriched the unions strategic outlook by adding different foreign and security policy perspectives that had never been present before in the european security dis course as result the eus potential to intervene mediate and help in different parts of the world was greatly enhanced on the other hand however enlargement made the interpretation of security and defence in europe more ambitious task than ever it requires fresh and an unbiased approach to the interests and political sensitivities of all eu members c6idjcyhezchvwazevgiczgh strong and vibrant euroatlantic partnership is the best guarantor of security and sta bility across europe esdp and nato can therefore ﬂourish if and when both organisa tions view one another as indispensable partners and enjoy the conﬁdence of their mem bers this somewhat trivial reﬂection has tended however not to always be remembered the year 2009 seems to be harbinger of new transatlantic debate in which institution rivalries may be superseded by common perspectives the obama administrations approach to europe and the french decision to enhance its role within nato offer fresh departure point for the natoeu relationship for europeans do not really care whether it is the eu or nato that provides security and defence for them as long as they feel safe and secure effectiveness is hence the most important criterion for natoeu cooperation and effectiveness depends on political leadership an efﬁcient and ﬂexible decisionmaking process and resources that can be mobilised for the sake of common actions therefore whenever we debate the eunato relationship we should accept the premise that europe and indeed the whole transatlantic area needs both organisations for the entire postcold war period there was an ongoing debate about whether di vision of roles between the eu and nato is necessary tacit assumption was made that the eu should remain civilian player with small military component whereas nato would remain responsible for demanding military missions but the vision of nato cooking dinner and europe washing the dishes has always been caricature it stemmed from an old fashioned cold wartype approach to security in which the so called hard military dimension was viewed as priority and was strictly separated from the political aspects of security the debate was hence largely inconclusive and reﬂected certain national preferences rather than european consensus we should therefore vote more time to continuing this discussion the initial transatlantic competition between the soft and hard concepts of power is gone today civilian operations and vxzhvgnjholdah commitment to longterm stability and reconstruction are less demanding that pre cisely guided air strikes afghanistan and iraq are illustrative cases for the only division between nato and esdp comes from the uneven amount of money spent on defence in europe and the us the eu and nato should therefore strengthen each other by avoiding competition and developing greater cooperation in crisismanagement operations based on practical di vision of labour both nato and the european union need enhanced focus on strength ening their basic capabilities improvement of interoperability and coordination of doc trines planning technologies equipment and training methods decision on which organisation should deploy forces should be based on the political will expressed by both organisations on operational needs and political legitimacy on the ground and last but not least on their ability to deliver peace and stability in given conﬂict situation attain ment of this objective requires cooperation between the north atlantic council nac and the political and security committee psc in elaborating the new nato strategic concept and future revisions of the european security strategy ess the security strat egies of the eu and nato should be not only complementary but also convergent each giving due weight to the potential of the other the berlin plus arrangements which allow the eu to have recourse to nato assets and capabilities need to be improved in order to allow the two organisations to intervene and effectively deliver relief in crises especially where multitask civilianmilitary response is needed for that purpose it is of vital importance to improve the pooling of intelli gence among nato allies and eu partners lessons learned from deployments under esdp have shown that permanent planning and command capability for eu operations would deﬁnitely increase the effectiveness and credibility of such operations the proposed eu operational headquarters provides the solution to this problem given the civilianmilitary focus of the eu such structure would not duplicate anything that exists elsewhere an eu operational headquarters should be viewed as complementing the current nato command structures and not undermining natos transatlantic integrity hxdezvcyivhh european defence is process that has limits it depends solely on europes strate gic needs and military capabilities that eu members are willing and able to provide for european defence esdp will thus become what we can make of it pragmatic and projectoriented approach is essential to keep the policy high on the european agenda lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 this means that we need not dwell on what kind of missions esdp should or should not perform the changing context of european security sets limits for the type of sions the eu needs to be prepared to mount in the future the lessons learned in the last two decades have forcefully illustrated that it is not up to us to deﬁne which threats are more likely and which should accordingly be given priority nor can european security and defence be framed within pre or postmodern paradigm since the terrorist attacks in madrid and london we have been confronted with cyberwar in estonia classical interstate conﬂict the august 2008 war between russia and georgia and new wave of piracy on the seas regional instability in africa semifrozen conﬂicts in the caucasus and fragile stability in the balkans will pose challenges for europes security in the fore seeable future the heterogeneous and diversiﬁed security context in which esdp oper ates is the best proof that the demand for missions and tasks will never be exhausted and that they cannot be formulated in advance we need more earlywarning and prevention but ultimately it takes more partners than just the eu to prevent crisis situations the european security strategy should therefore remain document that sharply deﬁnes the nature of the threats as they are and then identiﬁes general guidelines for action along with relevant countermeasures the challenge of transformation and adaptation to the new security context demands intellectual creativity and institutional ﬂexibility therefore we need solutions embedded in the lisbon treaty the enhanced role of high representative as the chairman of the foreign affairs committee and vicepresident of the commission supported by uni ﬁed european external action service at the same time we should avoid delusions that new institutional changes alone will boost esdp ten years after cologne and helsinki esdp is losing ground in the european public debate in january report the parlia ments committee for foreign affairs expressed its regret that despite extensive prepara tion but in consequence of loss of momentum caused by the impasse over the lisbon treaty the revision of the ess has resulted not in new strategic orientation but merely in report expressing daytoday policy concerns situation in which there was only limited parliamentary debate and public debate before the adoption of the report pro posing the revision of the ess will have negative longterm implications for european defence without lively political debate the union will never make progress in deﬁning what are common european security interests or on deﬁning criteria for the launching of esdp missions nor will it elaborate proposals for new eunato partnership and tackle the issue of national caveats both declared and undeclared the european parliament has an important role to play in this regard it oversees the esdp budget for civilian operations has its own expertise on security and defence issues and facilitates dialogue with national assemblies it is meticulous reviewer of esdp vxzhvgnjholdah operations and the guarantor of common european approach to security and defence issues it is hence venue for wide european debate on security issues strengthening parliaments power in esdp would therefore contribute to the stronger legitimacy of petersberg missions both at the european and national levels 8vevwaizh the fact that european security and defence depends on trends and events we rarely have control over constitutes challenge for esdp capabilities it is easier to have holistic approach to european security and missions than to have necessary robust civilian and military capabilities that match eu strategic objectives the helsinki european headline goal and the subsequent european headline goal ehg 2010 were adopted as vehi cles for enhancing member states military capabilities essentially the european armed forces were to become professional in every respect ie more mobile selfsustainable in actions equipped with hightech system c4sir and integrated on both the national and the european level however the progress thus far has been rather disappointing as the former chief executive of the european defence agency argued eu members have done too little to modernise their militaries for the purposes of esdp nearly two dec ades after the end of the cold war most european armies are still geared towards allout warfare on the innergerman border rather than keeping the peace in chad or support ing security and development in afghanistan3 eu members together spend more than 200 billion euro per year on defence which is more than half the defence expenditure of the united states yet the lack of efﬁciency and coordination in the utilisation of those funds leads to unnecessary duplication be tween europeans specialisation pooling and sharing of existing capabilities and joint development of new ones is the only rational way for addressing the capabilities deﬁcit the european defence agency eda plays leading role in that respect but without the serious and longterm ﬁnancial and political commitment of national governments the eda will not be able to fulﬁl its mission we need therefore stronger and more visible role of defence ministers in the eu it is the gap between declared ambitions and the dire state of capabilities for petersberg op erations that undermines any future prospect for esdp it leads to operational inaction and also increases tensions between members seriously approaching the capabilities gap and those who tend to freeride even in the time of the ﬁnancial and economic crisis implemen tation of european headline goals both military and civilian has to be continued 3 nick witney reenergising europes security and defence policy european council on foreign relations ecfr february 2008 p 1lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 esdp also needs further development of cooperation between national armed forces so that they become increasingly synchronised the parliament proposed therefore that this process and the armed forces be given the name safe synchronised armed forces eu rope this term offers less confusing description of what esdp really needs the eu is not on the road to building european army the eu does not expect member states to abandon sovereignty over their armed forces and the lives of soldiercitizens safe is an optin model for military cooperation based on more intensive voluntary synchronisa tion the parliament also approved the idea of european statute for soldiers within the framework of safe governing training standards operational doctrine and freedom of operational action issues relating to duties and rights as well as the level of equipment quality medical care and social security arrangements in the event of death injury or incapacity the civilian leg of esdp civilian crisis management ccm capabilities limps as well the trouble is not the lack of sophisticated and expensive hardware but of sufﬁcient number of experienced educated and committed staff prepared to take the personal risk to go on missions abroad the fact that ccm requires the kind of personnel that is highly regarded and sought after by national institutions eg the police courts causes additional problems it takes therefore long and concerted efforts of the council and the commission to create framework for recruiting civilian personnel for esdp opera tions but as with the military capabilities the main responsibility lays with the national governments if member states do not provide sufﬁcient incentives for national civilian experts and do not overwhelm domestic institutional bottlenecks the eu role in bring ing postconﬂict stability and reconstruction will be seriously limited and esdp cred ibility severely damaged this problem will also impinge upon europes relation with the united states europe that appears unable to deliver civilian assets for reconstruction on eg afghanistan cannot expect to be viewed in washington as reliable partner 9zzcxzxavjhz the issue of whether eu members should be bound by defence clause in case of an external military aggression had been on the european agenda since the rejection by the french national assembly of the european defence community plan in the 1950s article v of the modiﬁed brussels treaty reads that in case of an armed attack in europe against one of the treatys signatories the other contracting parties will afford the party so attacked all the military and other aid and assistance in their power the wording of the clause predates defence commitment as set out in nato article v and in theory offers more solid security guarantee than the washington treaty however during the cold war the brussels treaty remained in the shadows it was nato and the us nuclear vxzhvgnjholdah umbrella that provided security in and for europe after the cold war in turn the eu ropean defence clause was interpreted by some as perilous idea that would undermine nato security guarantees and as such was rejected by subsequent intergovernmental conferences igcs from maastricht to lisbon all eu treaties envisage hence that the common security and defence policy shall include the progressive framing of common union defence policy that will lead to common defence when the european council acting unanimously so decides4 it was the constitutional treaty that went step further adding an obligation that member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power 5 the lisbon treaty upholds this commit ment is european defence today therefore an issue of treaty implementation or will the above commitment remain inactive like the brussels article v but does the eu truly need mutual defence clause the answer to the last question is an unequivocal yes although europe currently enjoys an unprecedented era of peace and stability european defence should be more than the petersberg tasks we must not run the risk of an overoptimistic assessment of security dynamics in europes neighbourhood two waves of enlargement have stretched the ions territorial range to the baltic states eastern europe and the balkans the eu now borders regions and areas where european interests and values are not widely shared and often has to compete with other actors security perspectives if the postcold war nato decided to maintain its commitment to defence of its members and now even seeks ways to strengthen it in new security context there is therefore reason why the european union should not follow suit as long as we keep nato and future eu defence planning under one roof there is need for concern when nato goes global europe must develop regional approach to defence perhaps we should consider in the future kind of an article v berlin plus that would enable the eu to act in its defence when the us cannot be with us we should view this process as supplementing not supplanting the transatlantic security bonds fullyﬂedged european defence necessitates not only relevant legal and institutional adaptation but ﬁrst and foremost political one european defence will never be worthy of the name as long as the union will not become an alliance and to be an alliance the eu needs far more than esdp its institutions and capabilities it needs political soli darity and common foreign policy that speaks with one voice with regard to problems of strategic importance as long as the eu is divided andor lets othersdrive wedge be tween its members on issues like energy security missile defence or questions of war and 4 section 2 article 42 par 2 consolidated versions of the treaty on european union and the treaty on the functioning of the european union brussels 30 april 2008 5 ibid par 7peace esdp will not stand for genuine european defence from the above it follows that esdp is only the ﬁrst step towards making the eu genuine alliance the second would be to view esdp as nucleus of security system in europe that links internal politicoeconomic integration with strategic approach to the external world at the munich security conference this year president sarkozy argued that europe has to decide whether it wants to live in peace or be left in peace this phrase aptly corresponds with the main problem of european security and defence which is the deeplyrooted viction of some that history has ended in europe with the fall of the berlin wall and the collapse of communism there is hence need to increase defence expenditures or deploy troops to engage in real ﬁghting the 2008 august war and ongoing instability on europes southern and eastern strategic ﬂank leaves doubts however that history deﬁnitely has future and so does european defence if the eu is determined to give it chance 8dcxajhdchä izcegdgizhdgizczmiizcnzvgh ûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh number of conclusions are quite obviously shared by all practitioners and analysts who contributed to this volume this last chapter is an attempt to summarise the main points raised and to lay out roadmap for the eus common security and defence pol icy behind the tenpoint roadmap to 2020 lies the equally shared assumption that the european union needs to build twin robust civilian and military capacity over the next ten years for its foreign security and defence policy this should build on what has already been achieved while decisively addressing recognised deﬁcit in policy co herence and consistency and equally decisively ﬁlling the capability gap this derives less from shortage of capacities than from an inability to pool join and coordinate existing resources and capabilities it is virtually impossible to predict with any degree of certainty what the speciﬁc needs of the eu in the security ﬁeld will be in ten years time but here the eu ﬁnds itself in the same predicament indeed as any other world power in outlining the european ambition for 2020 we need ﬁrst to ensure that present goals and commitments are met as claudefrance arnould rightly points out the eu must be mindful of the gap between what is expected of esdp and the means at its disposal and prevent that gap from widening as result of the combined effect of the ﬁnancial crisis and europes increasing engagement within the atlantic alliance in afghanistan the second unanimously shared assumption is that the european union needs to be prepared to act both autonomously and jointly in most situations as more and more defence and securityrelated decisions are likely to be taken in an eu framework this is why the fo cus needs to be on strategic ambition there is reason to believe that the coming years will be any less productive of surprising developments and strategic revolutions esdp needs will thus be determined by the ambition the european union deﬁnes for itself as we move into the next decade and beyond as result the third assumption made here is that eu member states will remain aware that the eus unique and distinctive civil military proﬁle is ideally suited to meet the challenges of the twentyﬁrst century and will therefore adopt the normative power without real power scenario outlined in the introductory chapter this will then require developing both military and civilian crisismanagement resources that match the eus independentlyframed foreign policy lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 goals consequently improved technical cooperation between esdp and nato not withstanding it must be ﬁrmly borne in mind that the primary political and strategic euroatlantic partnership is between the united states and the european union also if shaping multilateral system in multipolar world is to remain at the heart of the conduct of eu foreign policy if the eu wishes to be an enabler for the solution of re gional crises and the pursuit of peace and human dignity then security must not be left out of eu strategic partnerships with current and aspiring global and regional players the following ten points are based on the additional assumption that the main provi sions of the lisbon treaty on cfsp and esdp can and should be applied irrespective of whether the treaty comes into force or not any time soon contributors will recognise their views occasionally expressed in their own words in the esdp roadmap to 2020 outlined below 8ghhbvcvzbzciidyvnäxdbbdcyzzcxzwzndcy esdp is predicated on the assumption that the collective defence of eu member states falls outside its remit expanded petersberg tasks can thus simply be deﬁned as any thing but collective defence that european solidarity predicated on common european destiny will evolve over time so as to include assisting any eu member state that is victim of armed aggression on its territory cannot be ruled out establishing collective defence mechanism is necessary today nato is the military expression of transatlantic solidarity and as such the guarantor of european security the prospect of common solidarity force with standard doctrine and common rules of engagement would constitute step towards fullyﬂedged european defence which is not on the cards today and seems very unlikely prospect in 2020 this does not mean however that esdp can afford to do without an active military com ponent which is sufﬁciently well trained and equipped to carry out combat missions the range of esdp military missions is quite broad ranging from disarmament to humani tarian operations military advice and assistance to conﬂict prevention and peacekeeping missions the treaty of nice already envisages as does the treaty of lisbon using com bat forces in broader range of missions where peacemaking features prominently the eu should continue to do what it already does and should concentrate on doing it better managing conﬂicts of variety of types in most cases internal wars in noneuro pean states as well as combating banditry piracy transnational criminality including ûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh terrorism and cyberterrorism broad as it already is it is unlikely that the geographic scope for esdp missions will become much wider the eu acts independently of nato in the framework of the and has deployed missions not only in europe but also in the mediterranean africa and other regions of the world afghanistan must be seen as an exceptional case of eu states involvement in nato expeditionary mission rather than the rule conversely europeanising eu member states contributions to sions lebanon being case in point would not necessarily mean any signiﬁcant degree of perimeter expansion 6jbvchzxjginydxigczbvngzfjgzizjhzddgxz the founding principles of the union are enshrined in the treaty on european union liberty democracy respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law these core values will remain as fundamental in 2020 as they are today the wide spread promotion of these values will continue to be pursued as the main goal of eu for eign policy and security and defence should not allow for any infringement respect for human rights and international justice at all levels of military operations is an essential component of its legitimacy and effectiveness furthermore the notion of socalled col lateral damage is against the eus security doctrine and is therefore unacceptable there is contradiction between adherence to the notion of human security and under taking the full range of military operations including peace enforcement on the trary this implies that if prevention fails the need to use military force to stop crimes against humanity being perpetrated must be explicitly acknowledged 8kavcvcybaivgnèdgxzzczgvidcédvahbjhiwzbzi given its unlikelihood moving towards common forces and collective defence is not scenario on which we should focus in the years to come rather we should concentrate our resources on developing robust and effective military and civilian eu peace corps for crisis management this requires that commitments made under both the military and the civilian headline goals are kept national military and civilian commitments should be adequately publicised in order s to increase transparency and an improved monitoring system of fixed benchmarks set in place to facilitate scrutiny special meetings of the council of ministers in fence foreign and home affairs formation adding the latter to what is currently done already should be regularly convened to oversee implementation and possibly to adapt commitments in accordance with commonly agreed goals future civillvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 military command should assist the council in this task on the military side three areas are recognised as critical force protection in warlike scenarios deployment strategic transport being priority and intelligence gathering the edas longterm vision 20202025 can usefully be invoked to pinpoint shortcomings and propose ad equate pooling and sharing solutions to fill in the gaps it should be borne in mind that in building esdps military component member states should concomitantly be contributing to deep euwide national military reform on the civilian side readi ness and adaptation to both civilian and civilianmilitary missions as detailed below is of the essence the eu is seeking to develop adequate capabilities to set up number of civilianmils itary missions simultaneously part of which will need strong military component two major stabilisation and reconstruction operations two rapidresponse operations of limited duration an emergency operation for the evacuation of european nation als maritime or air surveillanceinterdiction mission civilianmilitary humanitar ian assistance operation lasting up to ninety days and about dozen esdp civilian missions of varying formats including major mission that could last several years the eu should therefore set itself strategic target for 2020 of having at the ready very sizeable force with the adequate equipment particularly in transport and logis tics the target of 60000 troops ie 180000 allowing for rotation should be met as soon as possible but the eus ambition should be to double it by 2020 the development of eu capabilities should build on europeanising existing nation capabilities the ability to pool such capabilities will depend on some form and manner of harmonising modernisation requirements so that europeanisation can proceed at faster pace given the residual place of territorial defence in national doctrines and even nato the natural trend of modernisation of national armed forces is for their being increasingly wellsuited to both national and esdp opera tions and missions common budget should be established to pay for the common structures and to s finance significant part of esdp military missions namely providing logistic sup port in particular transport this would notably require suitable funding arrange ments for battlegroups to be devised so as to share the burden of battlegroup readi ness and operations fairly and squarely attheready capabilities for civilian crisis management must be improved standing s civilian teams at the national level could be developed into kind of eu crisisman agement package suited to different types and different stages of civilian and civilianûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh military missions military training support as well as policetraining support and assistance are im portant target areas for civilian crisis management small advisory teams and mo bile training teams to support security sector reform should form part of the civilian crisismanagement package the possibility of being able to launch missions before all final political decisions s have been taken needs to be considered so as to minimise critical procedural delays mechanisms will need to be set up to ensure mission preparedness in which the commission should play an important role izxvhzdgvhcazjgdezvcyzzcxzbvgzivcy_dci egdxjgzbzci the success of the eu single market has yet to be extended to defence in europe the defence market is still characterised by fragmentation lack of transparency and lack of competition member states continue to resort to the national security clause shrined in article 296 of the treaty establishing the european community and thus make the bulk of their defence purchases on national basis over time the recent defence package of eu legislation initiated by the european com mission and agreed to by the governments and the european parliament should greatly reduce the need for governments to invoke article 296 thereby creating more open fence market across europe which is gradually being subjected to single market rules the creation of competitive and efﬁcient european defence market is precondition to achieving better military capabilities across the eu through pooling and sharing which requires joint programming to assure gaps are adequately addressed the eda was set up to achieve this goal one that all profess to share europeanising procurement is the ﬁrst crucial step in this direction critical factor to bear in mind will be the centrality of securityrelated research and the increasing importance of knowledgebase for opera tions in widely varied and often complex environments the weapons of the future require major investment in new technologies by virtue of which the tools of military force will be transformed becoming smaller more autono mous more intelligent and very closely integrated the combined defence budgets of the 27 eu governments amount to the second largest in the world after the united states that collective amount of defence spending over 200 billion euro should be sufﬁcient lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 to carry out all the necessary modernisation provided that it is spent in more rational and coordinated way growing ﬁnancial difﬁculties can partly be overcome by seeking civilmilitary synergies combining eda with securityrelated research investment in the commission is case in point the lisbon strategy for development and innovation provides the framework for synergising including with noneu countries in particular the us knowledgebased global society can illafford to ignore the ﬁndings of advanced research wherever it is be ing developed egdgihcizjgdezvcbaivgnvcyxkavcxdbbvcy there is broad consensus among the authors that eu autonomy is implicit in the entire thrust of european security and defence policy since st malo this should imply in the years to come number of permanent structures formal council of defence ministers chaired by the eu foreign minister european security and defence college with its own premises and budget to train all personnel in common strategic culture of the union european command to plan and conduct the unions military operations alongside civilian command and an integrated civilmilitary command capability joint manoeuvres on the ground for european forces the eda and other relevant eu agencies should also be equipped with means commensurate with the eus international ambitions setting up the civilmilitary autonomous command for eu missions is the most urgent task this should be followed by intelligence to be gathered directly through european agency however one should bear in mind that intelligence of the kind needed for crisis management operations is different from traditional military intelligence open sources are normally more effective and quicker to access 9zkzadecvjgdezvcezghezxikzdcizgdazdc6id the distinctive identities of nato military alliance and european defence security and crisis management component of the union should make the question of the role of each in international security quite easy moreover this should be the point of departure for the deﬁnition of an eu perspective on nato the idea of division of labour reﬂecting wider separation of roles between soft powered eu and hardpowered us whereby esdp gradually cedes its military com ponent to nato which would become the sole military intervention body possibly in tegrating european defence pillar is strongly rejected there are three basic priorities ûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh for the europeans to guarantee that nato continues to play an essential role in the collective defence of its members and is guarantor of peace and security in the entire continent the european member states need to define common position on the future of s nato namely on its strategic concept and the necessary decisionmaking autono my of the two organisations needs to be understood and respected by all this critical debate on natos strategic concept leading to its adoption in 2010 can shape the strategic outlook of the whole decade ahead stronger euus strategic relationship must be built and for this the united states s needs to clearly recognise as there is every indication it is already doing that euro pean defence policydecisions including those affecting the atlantic alliance will be increasingly made within european framework in this stronger security relation ship with the eu nato is just one of the elements and may not be the dominant element the esdpnato relationship must not be allowed to be pretext for collective pas ralysis both inside the eu and in nato on the contrary increasing overlap between the european memberships in both structures should allow for more effective and dynamic cooperation there is need to rethink the modalities of this cooperation which implies swift resolution of the cyprus question putting more emphasis on successfully executing the tasks both organisations are called upon to perform today especially when engaged in the same theatre 8gzvicvjgdezvcevgavbzcivgn8djcxadghzxjginvcy 9zzcxz democratic control of esdp is becoming an issue as european public opinion is manding greater accountability and transparency with regard to the full spectrum of eu decisions this requires the engagement of national parliaments and of the european parliament more extensive parliamentary debate on esdp will lead to increased public scrutiny and awareness of esdp missions thus enhancing their legitimacy both at the european and national levels the europeanisation of the national parliamentary defence committees is thus condi tion for the success of esdp this should be achieved by greater interaction between the european parliament subcommittee on security and defence and equivalent commit tees from the eus national parliaments european parliamentary council for security lvivbwidchdgjgdezvcyzzcxzc4 and defence should speedily replace the existing weu assembly 7jaycvcèdezcéh9e the european union needs to take into account all the relevant implications for esdp of four concomitant strategic conclusions the international system has changed fundamentally and in future the success of s most eu security and defence objectives will depend not only on cooperation with the united sates within or in most cases outside nato but on its ability to engage with other states and also regional organisations the union shares with many countries of the world common interest in keeping s the flux of globalisation open in way that allows for the development of effective multilateral cooperation the current involvement of large number of states from several continents in antipiracy operations off the horn of africa is good example of shared global security interests eu missions will normally be developed in the framework of the which implies s substantial legitimacy and convergence with other member states eu involvement in crisis management operations is welcomed by manys there is reason for the european union not to open esdp to strategic partners and develop with them common training and interoperability necessary to the effectiveness of the missions this is already happening in number of ad hoc cases but should become the rule number of other states from africa and latin america have already shown an interest in developing farreaching cooperation with the eu deeper cooperation should be sought ﬁrst and foremost with candidate countries and neighbouring countries turkey in particular should be fully associated with the esdp and all eu agencies the eu should have esdp representatives in the eu missions to the the united states brazil china india and russia in order to promote security cooperation coherence and cohesiveness is precondition to assure that the european union acting as hub for broad multilateral coalition will simultaneously reinforce its effectiveness and its distinctive international identityûakvgdyzkvhxdcxzadh dkzgxdbcizedaixvayzòxiejiicxdzgzcxzòghi without clearcut strategy for international action the ability of the european union to make full use of its multiple strengths ie consistently bringing all eu foreign policy instruments into play is severely curtailed civilian power that has delegitimised power politics the eu has unique ability to develop comprehensive concept of international action including in the ﬁeld of security and defence esdp is just part of what the eu does as global security player the eus global political role on the international stage must remain the overriding concern politically esdp has been restored to its proper place as tool of the unions foreign policy it is not separate fourth pillar but both foreign policy and security and defence policy must converge with all the policies of the union esdp is one among an array of other tools possessed by the european union whose success depends on its ability to integrate the military component in common political strategy this is not weak ness of the union since developments in international security make nonmilitary crisis management resources increasingly important and the union is the only organisation to possess the entire range of resources required economic legal humanitarian ﬁnan cial civil and military this throws its strategic modernity and hence its added value as global security institution into sharp relief clear priority that cannot wait for 2020 is to make the necessary reforms to ensure the coherence and the consistency of the eus international action in the event that the lis bon treaty is not ratiﬁed the european council should nominate the high representa tive for external action as vicepresident of the commission thus extending the practice of doublehatting to the external representation of the union by introducing the neces sary legal reform the role of the european commission in cfsp and esdp should be acknowledged it manages the cfsp budget which ﬁnances all civilian esdp operations and plays an important role in prevention and reconstruction cxajhkzczhhhvegzgzfjhizdgazibvxn the need to move forward with the military dimension of esdp has been articulated around the proposal of permanent structured cooperation psc to be established among few able and willing eu member states along the same lines as what has been achieved with the eurozone states in the monetary ﬁeld this can increase efﬁciency with out compromising european legitimacy if and only if as with monetary union partici pation is open to all member states on the basis of welldeﬁned and wellpublicised vergence criteria set forth by the council it is for the council to decide at what point in time psc convergence criteria are met by member states wishing to join moreover in formulating the criteria the council needs to ensure higher degree of legitimacy for psc it is necessary to bear in mind that in the case of the european union there is clear link between its effectiveness and its european legitimacy the european dimension of given operation being an important condition for its welcome deployment one basic criterion should be willingness to participate in and to contribute to the com mon effort according to an individual states capacities and possibilities furthermore if an operation is launched on behalf of the european union by limited number of states member state wishing to usefully contribute to such an operation should be prevented from doing so the ambition of the union for 2020 should not be european minidefence project spearheaded by the most militarily capable member states but powerful foreign secu rity and defence policy able to pull together in coherent and consistent way the weight of all member states and of all the european institutions 6cczmzh 6ccmizvjidgh claudefrance arnould is minister
