abstract this report provides brief background on religions in the peoples republic of china and discusses official chinese government attitudes toward religious observance the report provides information on chinese constitutional protections of religious freedom the role of the religious affairs bureau in monitoring religious activities discussion of chinese suppression of religion and underground churches and information about the delegation of us religious leaders that visited china late in 1997 chinas treatment of religious practices summary membership data on religious organizations in china supports the proposition that the practice of religion continues to increase despite official attempts to control religious observance through state run religious affairs bureaus rabs that operate at the provincial county and local levels religious affairs bureaus are staffed by government cadres who have the authority to monitor and direct the activities of all officially recognized religious groups the rabs formal mandate is to ensure that religion serves the needs of chinas socialist society and protect the constitutional rights of religious believers since 1987 beijing has promulgated regulations tightening state control over religious activities on the grounds that such activities could serve as cover for ethnic and political activists regulations requiring the registration of religious groups with the government issued in 1994 coupled with national anticrime campaign begun in 1996 have prompted increased criticism of chinas tightened control over religious practice contents introduction 1 background on religions in the peoples republic of china 1 chinese constitutional protection of religious freedom 2 religious affairs bureau 3 increased suppression of religion and the strike hard campaign 4 us religious leaders delegation to china 6 implications for the united states 7 congressional initiatives and actions 7 chinas treatment of religious practices introduction in the past year religion has become another component of the continuing us policy debate on china at its basic level the debate focuses on beijings intolerance for any religious activity that is either uncontrolled by the state involved in political activities or intertwined with foreign religious groups many in the us human rights and religious communities center their attention on beijings efforts to close down unregistered underground churches or arrest clergy members involved in banned activity but the debate also has raised larger controversies within the united states over religious practices in china some representatives of the us religious community fear that focusing on proscribed religious activities in china ultimately will hurt the millions of chinese religious adherents operating within an officially sanctioned framework as result us policymakers are now faced with questions about what the appropriate us response should be in dealing with government whose attitude toward religious practice differs dramatically from our own this report attempts to address the context and background surrounding chinas policies toward religion and religious practices it should be said as caveat that much of the data involving chinas treatment of religion comes either from official chinese sources and news reports or from unsystematic or anecdotal reports in addition it should be noted that policy enshrined in chinas constitution or in state regulations may not be followed in practice or may be interpreted and enforced differently in different provinces and local jurisdictions background on religions in the peoples republic of china historically the chinese communist partys ccp treatment of religion has been uneven early in the 1950s the ccp appeared to espouse policy of religious tolerance this attitude changed to policy of total prohibition of religious practices during the cultural revolution of 196619761 after the death of mao zedong in 1976 the party began permitting greater expression of religious belief the new policy of greater tolerance was solidified in 1982 in document 19 the basic viewpoint and policy on the religious question during our countrys socialist period this document set forth guidelines for the opening of religious buildings and the training of patriotic clergy from policy perspective document 19 placed religion in governmental framework critical observers claim that this served two purposes to ease government control of religious activity and to improve chinas international image other observers contend that the new policy served to 1 religious services were banned clerics were imprisoned houses of worship and religious objects were destroyed and lands owned by religious groups were appropriated by the government crs2 legitimatize religious activity and was welcome change from past intolerance the policy set forth in document 19 was written into article 36 of the constitution in 1982 the language of which places few restrictions on religious freedom2 subsequent updates to document 19 have established trend of state control of religious activities that religious groups and human rights organizations see as increasingly repressive infringing on their rights of assembly and association3 chinese constitutional protection of religious freedom chinas constitution recognizes five religions buddhism catholicism daoism islam and protestantism article 36 of the constitution states citizens of the peoples republic of china enjoy freedom of religious belief state organ public organization or individual may compel citizens to believe in or not to believe in any religion nor may they discriminate against citizens who believe in or do not believe in any religion the state protects normal religious activities one may make use of religion to engage in activities that disrupt public order impair the health of citizens or interfere with the educational system of the state religious bodies and religious affairs are not subject to any foreign domination4 article 36 is codified in article 251 of the criminal law which makes it crime for government officials to illegally deprive citizens of their right to religious belief the term normal religious activities however is not defined in the constitution and is therefore left open to interpretation at the various levels of government enforcement since 1994 beijing has tightened restrictions on religious practices prompting increasing international concern over official efforts to control and contain religious freedom5 on january 21 1994 premier li peng signed decree 144 of the state council regulations governing the religious activities of foreign nationals within china it prohibits all evangelistic activities and permits foreign nationals to participate in religious activities in officially recognized venues only foreign nationals are permitted to bring religious materials into china but only for personal use second edict decree 145 regulations governing venues for religious activities describes the rationale for registration bans underground or unregistered groups and forbids religious groups from receiving funds from abroad according to this decree all religious activities must be held within an officially recognized venue on may 1 1994 the rab issued guidance document registration procedures for venues for religious activities 2 freedom of religious belief has been included in all ccp constitutions over time however the definition and state policy in enforcing the definition have changed 3 for example document 6 on some problems concerning further improving work on religion issued by the central committee in february 1991 4

in china is the religious affairs bureau which is part of the state council and reports to the communist partys united front work department its mandate includes implementing state policy on religion coordinating the relationships of religious groups and other segments of society supervising and protecting the rights of religious groups the rab is staffed by communist party cadres religious practitioners in china allege that some cadres display contempt for religious believers and work to thwart the practice of religion rather than promote or protect it others however state that some rab cadres have joined religious organizations either secretly or openly the 1994 regulations requiring all congregations to register with the rab 6 give the bureau the authority to approve or deny registrations and approve loans for and control the pace of construction of new religious structures according to some information published by protestant catholic and muslim sources the rab in the past refused to authorize construction of new houses of worship and demolished newly constructed buildings in an attempt to limit the spread of religion7 more recent report suggests that some church construction is being allowed8 under the direction of the rab eight authorized national organizations exist china buddhist association china christian council china daoist association china islamic association chinese catholic bishops college chinese patriotic catholic association national administration commission of the chinese catholic church and the threeself patriotic movement committee of the protestant churches of china9 in recent years international attention has focused particularly on the existence and treatment of socalled underground congregations and house churches groups that refuse to register with the rab for various reasons10 beijing considers these groups to be illegal and has stepped up efforts to close all nonregistered religious groups recently released us state department report focusing on worldwide religious persecution of christians noted that in 19961997 chinese 6 registration requires religious organizations to reveal the names and addresses of members

study journal vo 12 1 april 1997 9 all denominations of protestants are unified under one church as matter of government policy recently divisions within the church have led to the breaking away of denominations against the wishes of the rab 10 protestant religious groups report refusal to register because of government intervention in church affairs restrictions on where clergy can preach prohibitions on preaching the entire bible eg the second coming of christ and limitation of congregations to people over age 18 crs4 authorities instituted nationwide campaign to crack down on the activities of unregistered churches raiding and closing several hundred house church groups11 as of 1997 the chinese government disclosed that there are 4 million catholics nearly 10 million protestants and approximately 18 million muslims in china daoists and buddhists compose the remainder of the 100 million religious followers the actual number of believers places of worship and numbers of religious professionals is thought to be far greater than official estimates some non governmental groups estimate that there are approximately 10 million catholics about 50 million protestants and between 17 25 million muslims in china today12 increased suppression of religion and the strike hard campaign since the promulgation of the 1994 regulations nongovernmental groups have reported an increasing effort by the chinese government to control religious groups experts are divided about the reasons for the increased suppression some view the regulations as the partys attempt to contain new social forces associated with economic reform party leaders know the role that religion played in political changes in eastern europe and they may have drawn connection between the growth of religious groups in china and decline in party membership that was apparent in the early 1990s likewise some suggest the party is deeply concerned by possible ties among political dissidents religious groups and international organizations13 others link the suppression to lessened international criticism of chinas human rights policies report by human rights watchasia14 on the situation in tibet for instance claims that chinese repression against tibetans increased since may 1994 when the clinton administration delinked human rights issues from the annual process of renewing chinas mfn trade status15 reported repression has included renewed efforts to prohibit the possession of pictures of the dalai lama efforts to bar the construction of new monasteries and severely limit the number of monks and nuns and increases in the incidences and severity of torture of tibetans many observers suggest that chinas new restrictions on religion can be more directly attributed to beijings deep and growing concern about the connection between religious practices and ethnic separatists who are viewed as threats to 11 us state department report on united states policies in support of

concern about ethnic separatism is evident in tibet but is particularly acute with respect to the muslim areas of northwest china16 evidence suggests that muslim separatists in these areas over the past two years have become more active organized and violent and that chinese authorities have been zealous in their response since spring 1996 in particular chinese officials and press reports have referred increasingly not only to specific incidents involving muslim separatists and rebel groups but also to the dangers inherent in religious activity generally in one example in 1996 chinese delegate to the commission on human rights said one association and religion can be allowed to violate national law infringe upon the interests of the people foment splits among its nationalities and sabotage national unity17 as has been the case with monasteries in tibet chinese authorities have reportedly come to regard mosques and koranic schools in northwest china as centers for political dissent according to press reports muslim activism in china appears more aggressive than tibetan calls for greater autonomy or independence18 intensified repression of demonstrations in xinjiang and closing of mosques have been reported since 1995 amnesty international reports that an article appeared in the xinjiang daily on may 7 1996 accusing some people of inciting religious fanaticism under the cloak of religion and of using religion to interfere with administrative judicial education marriage and family planning affairs19 in january 1996 at beijing national conference on religious work chinese state councillor ismail amat delivered hardline speech calling for new restrictions on religion and religious groups in his speech he announced plan to build framework of legal supervision over religion in china over the next 15 years and called for increased research into the beliefs of people using religion to subvert the state on april 12 1996 china launched strike hard against crime campaign although the primary focus of the campaign has been to combat chinas increasing rates of violent and gangrelated crime many believe that it is also being used as cover for cracking down on ethnic separatism and religious activities especially in outlying areas human rights watchasia in its july 10 1997 report entitled china the cost of putting business first specifically noted link between the anticrime campaign and arrests of ethnic activists human rights organizations have reported higher rates of torture and execution in predominantly muslim areas and in tibet than over the rest of the country despite the emphasis on tibetans and muslims in the northwest there is evidence that other religious groups are also being targeted in chinas more restrictive environment human

china 1997 see section 2 crs6 harassment fining and prison sentences of protestants and catholics20 under the strike hard campaign the rab initiated program to register or close down all unregistered religious groups by the end of 1996 in july 1996 the rab issued new regulation calling for the yearly inspection of all places of religious activity21 any venue deemed to fail the inspection would be permitted brief period to rectify the situation if the effort was deemed to be inadequate measures could be taken against the group including the revocation of its registration some unregistered chinese catholics cite ban on papal appointment of the churchs bishops as reason for not registering beijing reserves the right to appoint church bishops refuting the authority of the pope to do so despite this tension between the rab and the holy see belief in the pope is accepted and visible in chinas catholic churches according to human rights organizations forms of police interference in religious activities generally include harassment fines confiscation of unapproved religious materials confiscation of property frequent detention and interrogation arrest beatings and torture22 sentencing to reeducation camps and execution the chinese government has stated repeatedly that it does not imprison people solely for the practice of religion those who are imprisoned are charged with committing crimes or using religion to overthrow the state chinese legal procedures allow for prolonged detentions without charges being filed in some cases political and religious figures have been held incommunicado for periods of year or more23 reeducation through labor sentences are considered an administrative punishment that can be imposed without charge or trial trials are reported to fall short of international standards for fairness despite revisions of the criminal procedure law that were enacted in march 1996 to improve due process us religious leaders delegation to china on february 8 1998 three us religious leaders began threeweek visit to china to study for themselves the religious situation there don argue president of the national association of evangelicals theodore mccarrick archbishop of the roman catholic diocese of newark new jersey and rabbi arthur schneier president of the appeal of conscience foundation were invited to visit by the 20 see for example human

communicating with the dalai lama his detention was not made public until may 24 1996 he was sentenced to six years in prison on april 21 1997 crs7 chinese government as result of discussions between presidents clinton and jiang at the october 1997 summit the clerics released their report on march 19 1998 among other things they concluded that the number of religious adherents appears to be growing rapidly in china and that china has made some progress over the past 20 years in its policies toward religion they also found that many in china still regard religion as potentially threatening to chinese social stability and that the chinese government maintains intrusive controls over most if not all religious activity among the groups recommendations were that china and the united states should continue and expand upon dialogue from midlevel to the most senior level leaders with respect to religious freedom in china that efforts should be made to attract and provide more training to greater numbers of clergy in china and that special attention should be paid to the problems of religious freedom in tibet and to promoting dialogue between china and the dalai lama implications for the united states beijings more restrictive regulation of religious practices continue to generate controversy and debate in the international community some groups such as the hong kongbased holy spirit study center may keep focusing on growth of religious practices particularly in catholicism and protestantism as positive trend in an environment that permits greater religious expression than was tolerated during the cultural revolution such groups believe that improving social conditions and the bankruptcy of communist ideology will continue to promote religious growth on the other hand many international christian groups increasingly criticize the limits placed on the practice of religion by government that professes to promote freedom of religious expression they see this as the beginning of trend backward leading to further control of religion or repression of religious followers in the future the issue of religious tolerance also will continue to put china at odds with significant segments of the american policy community social stability is seen as fragile and is paramount to chinese leaders beijing is also undoubtably mindful of chinese history in which the taiping muslim and other religious upheavals proved ruinous to chinese governance americans are unlikely to be receptive to chinas claims that strong governmental control and suppression of religious practices are two essential components of national stability many religious groups in the united states have established ties to religious groups in china providing much needed religious materials and training and it is feared that these ties will be jeopardized in the new repressive environment the issue of religious freedom in china has drawn special attention from the 105th congress which is considering legislation to require us monitoring of religious persecution around the world as well as legislation targeting china specifically for religious persecution and other human rights violations congressional initiatives and actions in 1997 members of congress have become increasingly active over questions of religious persecution several senators joined to form the
