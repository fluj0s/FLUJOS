divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33523arctic national wildlife refuge anwr controversies for the 109th congress summary one part of the energy debate is whethe r to approve energy development in the arctic national wild life refuge anwr in northeas tern alaska and if so under what conditions or whether to continue to prohibit development to protect the areas biological recreational and subsistence values anwr is rich in fauna flora and oil potential its development has been bated for over 40 years but sharp increases in energy prices from late 2000 to early 2001 terrorist attacks more price increases in 20042006 and energy infrastructure dama ge from hurricanes have intensified debate few onshore us areas stir as mu ch industry interest as anwr at the same time few areas are considered more worthy of protection in the eyes of conservation and some native groups current law prohib its oil and gas leasing in the refuge in the first session of the 109th congress development advocates added anwr development to the conference report for the defense appropria tions bill hr 2863 the house passed the conference report with the anwr provision but the anwr title was removed from the bill pl 109148 af ter failure of cloture motion in the senate in the second session on march 16 2006 th senate passed sconres 83 the fy2007 budget resolution its sole rec onciliation instruction was to the senate committee on energy and natural resources and it assumed revenues from leasing in anwr on may 25 2006 the house passed the americanmade energy and good jobs act hr 5429 which w ould open anwr to development development advocates argue that anwr oil would reduce us energy markets exposure to middle east crises lower oil prices extend the economic life of the trans alaska pipeline and create jobs in alaska and elsewhere in the united states they maintain that anwr oil could be developed with minimal environmental harm and that the footprint of development could be limited to total of 2000 acres opponents argue that intrusion on such remarkable ecosystem cannot be justified on any terms that ec onomically recoverable oil found if any would provide little energy security nd could be replaced by costeffective alternatives including conservation and that job claims are exaggerated they maintain that developments footprints would have greater impact than is implied by limit on total acreage they also argue that limits on footprints have not been worded to apply to extensive native lands in the refuge which could be developed if the refuge were opened

the house is proceeding on appropriations bills in the absence of final agreement background and analysis the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr consists of 19 million acres in northeast alaska it is administered by the fish and wildlife service fws in the department of the interior doi its 15millionacre coastal plain is viewed as one of the most promising us onshore oil and gas prospects according to the us geological survey usgs the mean estimate of technically recoverable oil on the federallyowned land in the refuge is 77 billion barrels billion bbl and there is small chance that over 118 billion bbl could be recovered on the federal lands the mean estimate of economically recoverable oil at 55bbl in 2003 dollars on the federal lands id 714 billion bbl and there is small chance that the federal lands could have over 107 billion bbl of economically recoverable oil that amount would be nearly as much as the single giant field at prudhoe bay found in 1967 on the stateowned portion of the coastal plain west of anwr now estimated to have held almost 14 billion bbl of econo mically recoverable oil moreover if congress opens federal lands in anwr to development current law would also open native lands in ddition nearby onshore development would also make state lands already legally open to development along the coast more economically attractive and as result these state lands might also become more attractive to industry while only the federal lands would produce income from bonus bids rents and royalties usgs figu res show that when state and native lands are considered the mean estimates of econo mically recoverable il rises to 97 billion bbl and there is small chance that economically recoverable oil in the threehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33523crs2 ownerships might total over 146 billion bbl see oil below for further discussion the refuge especially the nearly undist urbed coastal plain also is home to wide variety of plants and animals th presence of caribou polar bears grizzly bears wolves migratory birds and other species in this wild area has led some to call the area americas serengeti some advo cates have proposed that the refuge and two neighboring parks in cana da become an internationa l park and several species found in the area including polar bears caribou migratory birds and whales are protected by international treaties or agreements the analysis below covers first the economic and geological factors that have triggered interest in development then the philosophical biological and environmental quality fact ors that have generated opposition to it the conflict between high oil potential and nearly pristine nature in the refuge creates dilemma should congress open the area for energy development or should the areas ecosystem continue to be protected from development perhaps permanently what factors should determine whether or when to open the area if the area is opened to what extent can damages be avoided minimized or mitigated to what extent should congress legislate special management to guide the manner of development and to what ex tent should federal ag encies be allowed to manage the area under existing law basic information on the refuge can be found in crs report rl31278 arctic national wildlife refuge background and issues by m lynne corn

filed to the withdraw lands in northeastern alaska to create an arctic national wildlife range was filed on december 6 1960 after statehood the secretary of the interior issued public land order 2214

the refuge instead congress postponed decisions on the development or further protection of the coastal plain section 1002 directed study of anwrs co astal plain there fore often referred to as the 1002 area and its resources the resulting 1987 report by fws usgs and the bureau of land mana gement blm was called the 1002 report or the final legislative environmental impact statement fleis anilca

on energy and natural resources to report changes in laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to reduce outlays by 33000000 in fy2006 and 2658000000 for the period of fiscal years 2006 through 2010 this resolution assumed that the committee would report legislation to open anwr to development and that leasing would gene rate 25 billion in reve nues for the federal government over five years an am endment samdt 168 on march 16 2005 to remove these instructions was defeated yeas 49 nays 51 roll call 52 the house fy2006 budget resolution hconres 95 h rept 10917 while instructing the house resources committee to provide somewhat smaller reductions in outlays did not include assumptions about anwr revenues the conference agreement hconres 95 hrept 10962 approved by the house and senate on april 28 2005 contained reductions in spending targets of 24 billion over fy2006 to fy2010 for the h ouse resources and senate energy committees that would be difficult to achieve unless anwr development legislation were passed the inclusion of the senate target particularly set the stage for including anwr development legislation in reconciliation bill since reconciliation bills cannot be filibustered reconciliation bills require only simple majority rather than the 60 votes to stop filibuster under the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 as amended 2 usc 601688 while the targ et reductions of the budget resolutions are binding on the committees the associated assumptions are not the senate energy and natural resources committee did choose to meet its target by recommending anwr legislation and th budget committee incorporated the recommendation as title iv of s 1932 the deficit re duction act of 20053 the house resources committee included anw r legislation and other spending reductions and offsetting collections th ereby more than m eeting the committees targets these measures were incorporated by the house budget committee into an omnibus reconciliation bill however before the house bill came to the floor considerable opposition to the anwr pr ovision developed among number of republicans 24 of whom signed letter to the speaker

gelbanwr completed in 1998 by the usgs4 found an excellent chance 95 that at least 116 billion bbl of oil are present on federal lands in the 1002 area for comparison annual us oil consumption from all sources is about 75 billion bbl but the amount that would be economica lly recoverable depends on the price of oil and crude oil prices have increased substantially in the last two years bringing about 70bbl in the future s market in late june 2006 in its latest economic assessment usgs estimated that at 55bbl in 2003 dollars there is 95 chance that 39 billion bbl or more could be econo mically recovered and 5 chance of 107 billion bbl or more on the federal lands5 these estimates reflect new field development practices and cost and pr ice changes since us gss 1998 assessment moreover as noted earlie r about onethird more oil may be under adj acent state waters and native lands6 the state waters adjacent to the 1002 area are far from any support system or landbase d development and any oil under them is not presently economic if onshore developmen t were to occur allowing leases in state waters to benefit from onshore transportatio n systems airstrips haul roads pipelines etc and supply bases gravel mines wa ter treatment plants stagin g areas etc these areas might become more attractive to industry in addition lifting of the statutory prohibition on oil and gas development in the refuge would not only lift the ban on native lands but might make smaller fields on native lands more attractive if they were able to share facilities with nearby development or if they became preferred locations for support facilities due to fe wer restrictions on surface development7 the us energy information administration estimated that at relatively fast development rate production w ould peak 1520 years after the start of development with maximum daily producti on rates of roughly 0015 of the resource production at the slower rate would peak about 25 year s after the start of development at daily rate equal to about 00105 of the resource peak production associated with technically recoverable resource of 50 billion bbl at the faster development rate would be 750000 bbl per day roughly 4 of current us petroleum consumption about 205 million bbl per day for ec onomic impacts of development see crs report rs21030 anwr development economic impacts by bernard

has been ma jor goal of development improved icebased transporta tion infrastructure can serve remote areas during the exploratory drilling phase on insulated ice pads however for safety reasons use of ice roads and pads may be limited in the more hilly terrain of the 1002 area on slope gravel structures provide greater tr action than ice structures and have been permitted for exploration on state lands sout h of prudhoe bay in addition to ice technology industry has been experimen ting with essentially modified offshore platforms mounted on supporting legs to hold exploration rigs above the tundra these rigs may offer access for exploration in areas lacking sufficient water or too hilly to permit ice technology at the same time warming trends in arctic latitudes have already shortened winter access across the tundra by 50 over the last 30 years and led to changes in the standards for use of ice roads if these trends continue heavy reliance on ice technology could be infeasible and might fo rce greater reliance on gravel structures with inherently longerlasting impacts rigid adherence to i ce technology instead of gravel construction might put some marginal fields out of reach due to the high cost of exploration developm ent or operation moreover fields that begin with few roads may expand their gravel road network as the field expands because it is held as model of modern development the history of the alpine field located along the border of the national petroleum reservealaska npra west of prudhoe bay is relevant run by conocop hillips it was considered innovative because of the short road connec ting the two initial pads and the lack of road connection with the remainder of north slope development except in winter via ice road however with the approval of five additional pads the expansion of the field will add roughly 275 miles of gravel roads to the existing 3 miles of roads and create 1845 acres of disturbed soils including 316 acres of gravel mines or gravel structures8 approximately 150 miles of road s would be cons tructed if the field is fully developed if anwr development follows similar pattern it

awake from dormancy to take dvantage of this richness and leave or become dormant during the remainder of the year caribou have long been the center of the debate over the biological impacts of refuge development but other species have also been at issue among the ot her species most frequently mentioned are polar bears musk oxen and the 135 specie s of migratory birds that breed or feed there for more information on biol ogical resources of the 1002 area see crs report rl31278 an updated assessment of the array of biological resour ces in the coastal plain was published in 2002 by the biologi

significant followup memo10 on caribou by one of the assessm ents authors to the director of usgs clarified that if development were restricted to the western portion of the refuge an option that was being consider ed by the administration the porcupine caribou herd pch would not be affected during the early calving period since the herd is not normally found in the area at that time any impacts that might occur when the herd subsequently moves into the area were not discussed in the memo march 2003 report by the national acad emy of sciences nas highlighted impacts of existing development at

in decreasing or mitigating environmental impacts it also said that some social and economic impacts have not been beneficial the nas report specifically avoided determining whether any beneficial eff ects were outweighed by harmful effects fws has recently begun review to termine whether polar bears should be listed as threatened under the endangered species act 71 fed reg 6745 feb 9 2006 among the information to be consid ered are the effect s of accelerated polar climate change on polar bears and their prey primarily seals threats to denning habitat and effects of oil and gas development the lis ting of polar bears could have significant impact on energy development in anwr since the fleis stressed the unusual importance of the 1002 area as loca tion for dens of pregnant female polar bears in larger context many opponents of development see th central issue as whether the area should be maintained as an intact ecosystem off limits to development not whether development can be accomplished in an environmentally sound manner in terms that emphasize deeply held values supporters of wilderness designation argue that few places as untrammeled as the 1002 area remain on the planet and fewer s till on the same magnificent scale any but the most transitory intrusions eg visits for recreation hunting fishing subsistence use research w ould in their view damage the integrity and the sense of wonder they see in the area the mere knowledge that pristine place exists regardless of whether one ever visits it can be important to those who view the debate in this light major legislative issues in the 109th congress some of the issues that have been raised most frequently in the current anwr debate are described briefly below in addition to the issue of whether development should be permitted at all ke aspects of the current deba include restrictions that might be specified in legislation including the physical size or footprints of development the regulation of activities on native lands the disposition of revenues labor issues oil export restrictions co mpliance with the national environmental policy act and other matters references below to the secretary refer to the secretary of the interior unless stated otherwise the analysis below describes hr 5429 as passed by the house the provisions of division c of the conference report on hr 2863 the defense bill and 4001 of s 1932 the senate reconciliation bill because of the lack of tail in 4001 many aspects of anwr leasing would be left to administrative decisions with levels of public participation in some instances curtailed along with judicial review as noted below environmental direction if congress authorizes development it could address environmental matters in severa l ways congress could impose higher standard of environmental protection because the 1002 area is in national wildlife refuge or because of the frag ility of the arctic environment or it could legislate lower standard to facilitate development the choice of administering agency and the degree of discretion given to it could also affect the approaches to environmentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33523crs10 12 see crs

management would gi ve more support to protecting wildlife values it could incl ude provisions requiring use of the best available technology or the best commerc ially available technol ogy or some other general standard congress c ould also limit judicial revi ew of some or all of development program including standard s and implementation or congress could leave much of the environmental direction to the secretary hr 5429 would name blm as the lead ag ency section 7a would require the secretary to administer the leasing program so as to result in significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife their habitat and the environment and to require the application of the best comme rcially available technology section 3a2 would also require that this program be done i n manner that ensures the receipt of fair market value by the public for the mineral resources to be leased it is unclear how the two goals of environmental protection and fair market value are to relate to each other eg if environmental restrictions make some fields uneconomic subsections 6a3 and 5 would require lessees to be responsible and liable for reclamation of lands within the coastal plain unless the secretary approves other arrangements and the lands must support preleasing uses or higher use approved by the secretary there are requi rements for mitigation devel opment of regulations and other measures to protect the environm ent these include prohibitions on public access to service roads and other transpor tation restrictions other provisions might also affect environmental protection s ee judicial review below hr 2863 7 was similar to hr 5429 s 1932 4001b1b directed the secretary to establish and implement an environmen tally sound leasing system but did not provide further direction the size of footprints newer technologies per mit greater consolidation of leasing operations which tends to reduce the size and the environmental impacts of development one aspect of the debate in congress has focused on the size of the footprints in the developm ent and production phases of ergy leasing the term footprint does not have universally accepted definition and therefore the types of structures falling under footprint restric tion are arguable eg the inclusion of exploratory structures roads gravel mines port facilities etc12 in addition it is unclear whether explorator structures or structures on native lands would be included under any provision limiting footprints13 the new map accompanying s 1932 includes the native lands in its definiti on of the coastal plain leasing area but how the federal leasing program will apply to those lands is not clear see new maps below development advocates have emphasized limit on the acreage of surface disturbance while opponents have emphasized the dispersal of not only the structures themselves but also their impacts over mu ch of the 15 million acres of the 1002 areahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33523crs11 one single consolidated facility of 2000 acres 31 square mile s would not permit full development of the 1002 area instea d full development of the 1002 area would require that facilities even if limited to 2000 acres in to tal surface area be widely dispersed dispersal is necessary due to the limits of lateral or extended reach drilling the current north slope record for this technology is 4 miles if that record were matched on all si des of single pad at most about 4 of the coastal plain could be developed from the single pad even if the current world record 7 miles were matched only about 11 of the 1002 area could be accessed from single compact 2000acre facility in addition dr illing opponents argue that energy facilities have impacts on r ecreation subsistence ve getation and wildlife well beyond areas actually c overed by development hr 5429 7d9 would provide for c onsolidation of leasing operations to reduce environmental impacts of developmen t section 7a3 would further require consistent with the provisions of section 3 which include ensuring receipt of fair market value for mineral resources that the secretary administer the leasing program to ensure that the maximu m amount of surface acreage covered by production and support f acilities including airstrips nd any areas covered by gravel berms or piers for the support of pipe lines does not exceed 2000 acres on the coastal plain the terms used are not defined in the bill and therefore the range of structures covered by the restriction is arguable eg whether roads gravel mines causeways and water treatment plants would be included under this provision in addition the wording might not apply to structures built during the exploratory phase an essentially identi cal provision is in s 1932 4001 f and hr 2863 7a3 hr 2863 also called for facility consolidation 7d4 and for the secretary to develop consolidation plan 7f native lands generally the alaska natives inuit along the north slope have supported anwr development while the natives of interior alaska gwichin have opposed it though neither group is unanimous ancsa resolved aboriginal claims against the united states by among other things creating village corporations that could select surface nds and regional corporations that could select surface and subs urface rights as well kakt ovik inupiat corporation kic selected surface lands originally approximately three townships on the coastal plain of anwr but these kic lands were administratively excluded from being considered as within the administrativel defined 1002 coasta l plain fourth township was added by anilca and is w ithin the defined coastal plain the four townships totaling approximately 92000 acres are all within the refuge and subject to its regulations the arctic slope regional corporati on asrc obtained subsurface rights beneath the kic lands pursuant to 1983 land exchange agreement in addition there are currently thousands of acres of conveyed or claimed individual native allotments in the 1002 area that are not expressly subject to its regulations were oil and gas development authorized for the federal lands in the refuge development would then be allowed or become feasible on the nearly 100000 acres of native lands possibly free of any acreage limitation applying to development on the federal lands depending on how legislation is framed the extent to which the native lands could be regula ted to protect the environment is uncertain given the status of allotments and some of the language in the 1983 agreement with asrc none of the current bills address development on the native lands in anwr see also crs report rl31115 and new maps below httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33523crs12 new maps during the 109th congress both the house and senate have created new maps of the coastal plain that will be the subject of leasing see crs report rs22326 legislative maps of anwr by m lynne corn and pamela baldwin hereafter cited as crs re port rl22326 the coastal plain was defined in 1002 of anilca as the area indicated on an au gust 1980 map an administrative articulation of the boundary was authorized by 103b of anilca and has the force of law the 1980 map is now missing since the 1980 map is missing evaluating whether the administr ative description properly excluded the native lands is impossible and as noted th fourth native township selected later is not excluded from the coastal plain by that description the legal description required under anilca was completed in 1983 48 fed reg 16858 apr 19 1983 50 cfr part 37 app i but questions also surround this description see crs report rl31115 the description exclude d three native townships from the articulated coastal plain some bills in various congresses also have excluded these same native lands by referring to the 1980 map and the administrative description s 1932 4001a provided new map dated september 2005 to accompany its submission to the budget committee for reconciliation this map included all native lands in the term coastal plain to which the leasing provisions would apply see figure 1 in crs report rs22326 howeve r the bill text did not refer to the native lands and the extent of federa l control of nativ lands intended or accomplished by the map change is not clear for example the bill directed 5050 revenue split between the state of alaska and the federal government thereby possibly giving rise to native claims fo r compensation for revenues from their lands if this revenue provision wa s not intended to apply to native lands it is not clear whether other provisions also might not appl also some of the terms in the 1983 agreement call for an express congressional override to negate some of its terms and the text of the bill did not discuss the native lands or the agreement the defense bill also rested on usgs map dated sept ember 2005 24 it is not clear whether the map is the one referred to in the senate bill hr 5429 does not refer to map but inst ead defines the coastal plain as the area described in 50 cfr part 37 app i the administrative articulation of the coastal plain as discussed this regulation currently excludes three native townships but leaves the fourth within the coastal plain and arguably the leasing provisions would apply to it the house bill raises the possibility that the defined coastal plain could be expanded or reduced at some later time through rulemaking procedures revenue disposition another issue is whether congress may validly provide for disposition of revenues othe r than the essentially 90 state 10 federal split mentioned in the alas ka statehood act court in alaska v united states 35 fed cl 685 701 1996 indicated that the language in the statehood act means that alaska is to be treated like other states for federal leasing conducted under the mineral leasing act mla which contains basically 90 10 split arguably congress can establish different nonmla leasing regimen for example the separate leasing arrangements that govern the national petroleum reservealaska where the revenue sharing formula is 5050 but this issue was not before the court and hence re mains an open issue for more on this issue see crs report rl31115httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33523crs13 under 3a of hr 5429 the secretary is to establish and implement leasing program for anwr in accordance with the b ill and 9 states that notwithstanding any other provision of law revenues are to be shared 5050 between the federal government and alaska with some special provisions on the federal share it can be argued that the leasing program is not under the mla and hence the different revenuesharing provisions ar not contrary to the alas ka statehood act however if court struck down the revenuesharing provision it would then have to determine if that provision was severable whether congress would have enacted the rest of the statute without the fl awed provision hr 5429 does not have severability provision that states the intent of congress in this regard if court both struck down the revenuesharing provision and found it to be severable then alaska could receive 90 of anwr revenues similarly s 1932 also did not state that leasing would be under the mla and also set out many requirement s that differ from those of the mla notwithstanding any other provision of law it too directed that receipts from leasing and operations authorized under this section be divided equally between the state of alaska and the federal government because of th change in the senate definition of coastal plain and the accompanying map the bill mig ht have included revenues from native lands in the 5050 split the defense bill division d 1 also provided for 5050 split and contained various provisions for distribution of certain percentages of the federal share to various purposes includi ng hurricane relief in addition 14 of division c of the defense bill contained severability provision that provided explicitly that if any portion of either division c or d were held to be unconstitutional the remainder of the two divisions would not be affected it is not clear to what provisions the severability language might have applied as discussed some issues regarding the revenue split might remain but those issues might rest on contractual interpretations rather than constitutional concerns however if the 5050 revenue split were struck down alaska could receive 90 of the anwr revenues and if so fewer federal f unds would be available for programs premised on the 50 federal share project labor agreements plas recurring issue in federal and federally funded projects is whether project owners or contractor s should be required by agreement to use union workers plas establish the terms and conditions of work that will apply for the particular project and may also specify source to supply the craft workers proponents of plas including construction and other unions argue that plas ensure reliable efficient labor source help keep costs down and ensure access for union members to federal and federa lly funded projects opponents including nonunion firms and their supporters believe that plas inflate costs reduce competition and unfairly restri ct access to those projects there is little independent information to weigh the validity of the conflicting assertions hr 5429 6b would direct the secret ary to require lessees in the 1002 area to negotiate to obtain project labor agreement recognizing the governments proprietary interest in labor stability and the ability of construction labor and management to meet the particular needs and conditions of projects to be developed hr 2863 6b contai ned similar provisions but s 1932 had similar provisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33523crs14 oil export restrictions export of north slope oil in general and any anwr oil in particular has been an issue beginning at least with the authorization of the trans alaska pipeline system ta ps and continuing into the current anwr debate the trans alaska pipeline au thorization act pl 93153 43 usc1651 et seq specified that oil shipped th rough it could be exported but only under restrictive conditions when californi prices fell in the mid1990s causing complaints from california and north sl ope producers congress amended the mla to provide that oil transported throug h the pipeline may be exported unless the president finds after considering stated criteria that exports are not in the national interest pl 10458 30 usc 185s north slope exports rose to peak of 74000 bblday in 1999 or 7 of north slope production these exports ceased voluntarily in may 2000 and have since been minimal if congress wished to limit export of oil from the 1002 area by applying th restriction to oil transported through taps the restriction might not be effec tive oil shipment via tanker could become practical if current warming trends in th arctic continue and if crude oil prices provide sufficient incentive recent proposed bans on export of anwr oil have not been tied to shipment through taps hr 5429 6a8 woul d prohibit any export of oil produced in the 1002 area as condition of lease s 1932 4001g c ontained similar provision as did hr 2863 12 however inasmuch as other north slope oil is allowed to be exported it would appear that prohibiting the export of anwr oil could be moot producers aiming to tap the export market would substitute other north slope oil to meet the demand nepa compliance the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa pl 91190 43 usc 43214347 requires th preparation of an environmental impact statement eis to examine major federal actions with significant effects on the environment and to provide public i nvolvement in agency decisions the last full eis examining the effects of leasing development in anwr was completed in 1987 and some observers assert that ne w eis is needed to support development now nepa requires an eis to analyze an array of alternatives including action alternative some development supporters would like to see the process truncated in light of past analyses and to hasten production development opponents and nepa supporters argu that the 19year gap and changed circumstances since the last analysis necessitates t horough update and stress the flaws they found in the 1987 fleis section 3c of hr 5429 would deem the 1987 fleis to satisfy nepa requirements with respect to prelease activities and the development and promulgation of leasing regulations and re quire the secretary to prepare an eis of all other actions authorized by the subtitle before the first lease sale consideration of alternatives would be limited to two choices preferred leasing action and single leasing alternative compliance with the subsection would be deemed to satisfy all requirements to analyze the nvironmental effects of proposed leasing hr 2863 division c 3c was essen tially identical s 1932 4001c had similar provisions but did not expressly require an eis for leasing compatibility with refuge purposes under current law for the management of national wildlife refu ges 16 usc668dd and under 43 cfrhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33523crs15 310153 for alaskan refuges specifically an activity may be allowed in refuge only if it is compatible with the purposes of the particular refuge and with those of the refuge system as whole secti on 3c of hr 5429 3c of hr 2863 and 4001c of s 1932 state that the energy l easing program and activities in the coastal plain are deemed to be compatible with the purposes for which anwr was established and that further findings or decisions are required to implement this determination this nguage appears to liminate the usua l compatibility determination processes the extent of leasing activities that might be included as compatible is debatable nd arguably might encompa ss necessary support activities such as construction and operation of t facilities staging areas and personnel centers judicial review leasing proponents urge that any anwr leasing program be put in place promptly and argue that ex pediting curtailing or prohibiting judicial review is desirable to achieve that goal judicial review can be expedited through procedural changes such as reducing the time limits within which suits must be filed avoiding some level of review curtailing the scope of the review or increasing the burden imposed on challengers hr 5429 8 would require that any complaints seeking judicial review be filed within 90 days section 8a2 provides that suits are to be filed in the court of appeals in washington dc as did hr 2863 8a hr 5429 8a3 would also limit the scope of review by stating that review of secretarial decision includi ng environmental analyses would be limited to whether the secretary complied with the terms of the anwr subtitle that it would be based on the administrative record and that the secretarys analysis of environmental effects is presumed to be correct unle ss shown otherwise by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary this standard is unclear but in this context arguably could make overturning decision of the secretary more difficult s 1932 and hr 2863 4001c and 8a respectively were similar s 1932 omitted the presumption concerning the secretarys analysis of environmental effects special areas some have supporte d setting aside certain areas in the coastal plain for protection of their ecological or cultural values this could be done by designating the areas specifically in legisla tion or by authorizing the secretary to set aside areas to be selected after enactment the fleis identified four special areas that together total more than 52000 acres the secretary could be required to restrict or prevent development in these areas or an others that may seem significant or to select among areas if an acreage limitation on such setasides is imposed hr 5429 3e would allow the secretary to set aside up to 45000 acres and names one specific special area in wh ich leases if permitted woul d forbid surface occupancy because the four special areas are larger than this total the secretary would be required to select among these areas or any others that may seem significant section 3f also states that the cl osure authority in the anwr title is to be the secretarys sole closure authority which might limit possible secretarial actions under the endangered species act hr 2863 3e was essentially identical s 1932 had provision for special areas nondevelopment options several options are av ailable to congress that would either postpone or forbid developm ent unless congress were to change the law these options include allowing ex ploration only designating the 1002 area as wilderness and taking action some have argued that the 1002 area should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33523crs16 opened to exploration first before decision is made on whether to proceed to leasing those with this view hold that with greater certainty about any energy resources in the area better decision coul d be made about openi ng some or all of the 1002 area for leasing this idea has had little support over the years because various interests see insufficient gain from such proposal crs report rl31278 discusses the pros and c ons of this approach another option is wilderne ss designation energy velopment is not permitted in wilderness areas unless there are preexisting rights or unless congress specifically allows it or reverses the desi gnation wilderness signation would tend to preserve existing recreati onal opportunities and re lated jobs as well as the existing level of protection of subs istence resources including the porcupine caribou herd hr 567 and s 261 would designate th 1002 area as part of the national wilderness system under anilca and the 1983 agreement development of the surface and subsurface holdings of native corporations in the refuge is precluded as long as oil and gas development is not allowed on the federal lands in the refuge because current law prohibits development unle ss congress acts the action option also prevents energy development on both fe deral and native lands those supporting delay often argue that not enough is known about either the proba bility of discoveries or about the environmental imp act if development is permitte d others argue that oil deposits should be saved for an unspecified right time selected legislation in the 109th congress pl 10958 hr 6 barton an
