3ga dynamic assessment lecture given on 16 august 1962 well i had previous lecture engagement thats why im just little bit late i have to keep the children posted on the adventures of the famous sussex witch ermaltrude godhelpus and ive just been so if i happen to throw some spells out to the left or the right while giving this lecture why youll know why all right this is lecture one saint hill special briefing course and whats the date audience sixteen august sixteen aug ad 12 you said it the subject of this lecture is dynamic assessments now we have made slight improvement in processing lately i hope you wont object too much to the change i hope so because i know that you dont like change ordinarily i know this is very bad thing but im sorry that i had to introduce this change it reduced finding goal from two hundred hours to four hours or something like this so thats the maximum on the minimum see the span and so on so i hope youll find it in your heart to tolerate the change the motto of this is if you cant beat it join it see ever since weve gotten into goals we have been assaulted by dirty needles rock slams and other materials which have been very onerous and upsetting to the auditor and finally it occurred to belatedly that this phenomenon might be utilizable in another lecture i told you how it came about but theres other mechanics connected with this and decided that we had better do dynamic assessments by rock slam by doing dynamic assessment by rock slam if done properly you have possibility of finding goal in four hours and if you dontwhy youve still got possibility of finding it in eight ten fifteen you see its little bit different isnt it well that was the one point of holdup that i could see along the line of very broad clearing this all comes out of specific programif you have fifty people in group and youve got two saint hill graduates running the group or there are four or five saint hill graduates in central organization and theyre supposed to find all the goals of the people there in the group or as they walk in the front door you can readily see that arithmetically you would have to practice mitosis more than auditing and if saint hill graduate is merely going to supervise clearing and supervise listing and not do the listing themselvesthey therefore could cope with this activityproviding they could find goal in small enough period of time so that has been the target of this now the most difficult goals to find were those goals of people who constantly dirty needled and rock slammed and this becomes relatively easy nowthats one of the easier ones to spot so the hardest to find becomes more or less the easiest to find because some of these cool calm collect charactersyoure going to have an awful time trying to turn on rock slam and with the fellow whos already got one thats fairly easyyouve just got to find where its located that this sort of thing pays off as far as listing and 3ga is concerned 3ga is getting into the swingand now thatparticularly that youre getting your meter drills down and that the meter drills are being run very correctly youre making in fact the is flying off the fork in all directions and gathering in the stacks its quite remarkable proposition since monday of this week two pcs have been listed to free needles in this unit we produced secondgoal clear and we found three goals on pcs that we were about to give up on pretty good huh you can delete thatwe werent about to give up but it was about to become much rougher now three goals and secondgoal clear and two free needles thats since monday you think were moving audience yes now let point out something this is saint hill youve got all kinds of talent sitting around here all kinds of knowhow sitting around here and if it doesnt know ill jump them you know and youve got all that sort of thing well you got to be good enough to run all this on your own see now you go off someplace and do dynamic assessment and get goal in some fashion that winds up with the wrong goal i was standing the meter manufacturers hair on end today with the horrors of finding wrong goal its horrible dont ever kid yourself youre used to running somebody on the wrong process for while and it was all right man you run somebody on the wrong goaland oh brother you see all gods have two facesfor every positive theres negative and just as you can phenomenally fantastically increase somebodys iq and ability so you can pull the floor out from underneath himnot the rug the floor seein almost that exact ratio it is reparable actually it is little harder to make him worse than make him better and you can repair it but remember that it is very rough propositionvery very rough you see less of it but you see enough of it to stand your hair on end if youre keeping your eye open somebody all of suddenhis ears are about three and half inches further back than they have been normally and he looks about 29 years older than he has for long time and so forth well somebodys just found the wrong goal of it and messed it up in general and somebodys perseveringly listing him in the wrong direction and out the bottom dont you see or he had right goal they didnt check it out and now theyre trying to do something else and theyre longer listing on the right goal see and these things are quite catastrophic now the auditors skill is tremendously challenged right from the first fundamentals of auditing not from any newbrandnew skill that youll learn at saint hill but the fundamentals of auditing are what are challenged can you hold pc insession can you keep him interested in his own case and talking to the auditor see how is your tr 0 1 2 3 4 well it may have been good enough to security check somebodybut let tell you that when the traffic starts to get some load you know and theresthe lines start loading up those weak spots start blowing out we almost released an auditor here well i had quiteeverythingwas quite happy about this particular auditor and all of sudden this auditor ran into rough spot i mean the pc just started blowing out at the edgespc probably had the goal on the list and was very anxious and arc breaky and so forth and it just took that much more controlthat much more good auditing they had to look lot more like an auditor and do lot more like an auditor in that given situation than they had ever dreamed that they would have to well all these things are consequent to having cracked the riddle the riddle is the basic purpose of any given cycle and the basic purpose of man is the same more or less as the basic purpose of the universe in other words the universe has basic purpose and so does human beings reactive bank and difficulty have purpose it hits purposea basic purpose at the bottom of it which if dismayed causes all the rest of it to go to pieces all right well we have our hands on that its quite an important thing to have your hands on now that it requires you to look more like an auditor and act more like an auditor and do more and better auditing is almost incidental we can measure up to that and we can do it if we recognize the necessity of it the pcs state of mind when hes coming up toward goaltoward finding goal he wants his goalis closer to the razor edge of arc breaks than at any other time in his auditing career when he was going nuts because his grandmother was about to divorce him or something that had nothing to do with it the nervous breakdown which he went through while working for the lumbago iron works that has nothing to do with it you see he really feels in frantic state he starts moving in on his goal and he gets close to it well ill show you how far away from the goal the arc break and upstet upset commences actually when student arrives here at saint hill they start quivering in the direction toward their goal and actually the longer they spend on rudiments and havingness and prepchecking and so forth they yayayayaya i got goals see i got goal and they act more arc breaky than athan pcs would in an hgc any day of the week you know its fantastic the high mental tension well thats just occasioned by this same thing theyre approachingthey know theyre approaching solution fait accompli as far as their case is concerned and hehhehheh it givesit gives with nerves it does all right to accomplish this activity then rapidlyto find the basic purpose rapidlyallowing minimum of time in which the personduring auditing im speaking of not during trainingduring auditing toward and directly toward his goalthe individual going in the direction of his goals should go there fairly rapidly and this factor stood solidly in our roadis that the longer it took the less likely it was and you can still write that down as stable datum the less time it takes to find the goal the more certainly you will find it not thenot the reverse necessarilyif the goal is very easy to find youll find it quickly if we put that into russian translation machine it would come out that way and thats the wrong way you see itsthe fact is that the fact that its found swiftly causes it to be found positively the longer it takes to find goal the more difficult it is to locate so therefore the demand was on very sharp and certain process which would make it possible for the individual in the minimum length of time to find his goal now this doesnt overthrow 3ga and therefore you havent seen this under the heading of new thinglike 3gdn or something like that see you havent seen new designation come out on this and thats because basically youre doing all the steps of 3ga and i want to hold that to your attention it is much more difficult to find goal on somebody who hasnt listed his goals because the whole bank will be charged up on the subject of goals and youre not going to get more rock slamyoure just going to get more suppression so for my money it is highly desirable and i wouldnt want to tackle anybody who hadnt been prepchecked so they could stay insessionwho hadnt listed 850 goals or soi wouldnt want to tackle dynamic assessment on that individual now you could go to all sorts of shifts if you wanted to in the finding of somebodys goal but those fundamentals still remain we want list we want thatwe want the bank discharged on the subject of his immediate goals hes going to give you the solutions to all of his present time problems dont you seeand youll be falling all over these things and so forth so lets just carry on as ive given you 3ga and then lets turn around and not bother to null that 850 list lets cut right in through the dynamics and lets chase that rock slam right straight on down and lets pick up the first available goal that we can get on the track youll find out that the goal will ordinarily be 1 2 or 3 goals earlier and still be runnablethis is just predictionthan if you had pulled it off the first list he gave you in other words were undercutting couple of gpms thats one of the tricks here that might go unnoticed and yeah you can find as many as two goals without turning off the rock slam and actually list them out and make the pc feel bit better and everything is fine bit betterhell make him feel marvelous and they still get the goal you would have found by dynamic assessment sitting there and it could have been available and grabbed by this system the first time you assessed them thats worth observing now well know more about this in due course with more data to hand but the method used then depends on having pc who is sessionable auditable that is to say and whos got nice long goals list so that goals arent too charged up and then depends on the skill and meter reading of the auditor in doing dynamic assessments by rock slam now let point out to you that were doing this is rightall about dynamic assessments nowall right let point out to you at first crack out of the box that this is not the same dynamic assessment that we have been doingit is dynamic assessment by rock slam used to be change of characteristic well that is good enough and ordinarily would lead you into rock slam and undoubtedly would have value and youll find that many of your findings by rock slam concur with somebody elses findings by change of characteristic as matter of fact you saw this happen in the demonstration last night in spite of the fact that it had been run heaven help us now that change of characteristic there was relatively valueless because he wouldnt have found it again so frankly by rock slam is much more positive dynamic assessment now i maligned my poor pc last night when i said thatyou notice i didnt use his list well as matter of fact we probably will be using his list because im giving you new expanded dynamic scale and well take the dynamics and well expand it out and itll have maybe about twenty items on it itll have the main dynamic and some subdivisions now i learned this the hard way last night at about ten minutes of three i dont have too much time to get my various research auditing in and of course youre driving very hardyoure walking all over my heels as matter of fact and ito be very factual and to be sure of my datawhy ive got to audit pretty fast and furious to get the thing squared away and the session which i gave reg last night you heard say its not textbook session you know you did hear that didnt you male voice uhhuh well its as much of pilot session as anything else you know of course i knew exactly by theory what i was looking for but as far as what ramifications are introduced into doing this operation of dynamic you know and all written up in nice schedule and beautifully packaged and all the warning signals all lying therelittle flags pop up and hit you on the nosethese are not present in this activity see by theory its dead easy see all you do is run down the rock slam and pull the goal that discharges the rock slam and youve got the guys goal see thats all all right but how do you do it see ive got you to worry about see iits not enough that i can sit down you see and audit you see i have to think about your auditing too you know im going to get bowed down in an auditing chairbefore i amall these auditors on my back get downright roundshouldered because the truth of the matter is is i dont have toif you see it would be relatively easy if all i had to do in auditing was just understand what i was doing and resolve the pcs case see this is dead simple if you want to collide with it ive got to understand what i am doing in auditingunderstand it much better communicate it with decent degree of clarity and then correct what everybody else didnt understand see this is an entirely added activity so you dont wind up with bunch of intuitives and this is very hard on if you dontif you dont mind my saying so im not trying to act like the victim but it cuts out my intuitive auditing and you know im going to go all out of tune one of these days you know i used to audit by intuition and what not on occasion you know and say wow what do you know you know ill bet is it oh it is oh oh well hahahaw and thered go the guys case you know that kind of thing but there wasnt any explaining it see all right that is to say intuition without language meant there must be deficiency in my own understanding of it if i couldnt communicate it so everything ive been doing has to be analytically understood its all got to be up on the surface its all got to be communicable none of these factors can exist in it every one that does exist why other people get in trouble long since i rather disabused myself of suddenly stepping up and saying well thats very easyalli get it now all you do is intuitivize and the pc gets well and ive lost hopepeople dont well i dont know why this is i havent even bothered to explain it but the other is successful and so you take successful route and i will say this because i have to articulate what im doing i come to understand lot more than i ever cared to find out about it you get the idea and i have to study it and understand it and make further advance on it than id originally thought i would do you get that bonus factor which keeps adding in all the time well that of course catalyzes and drives forward the research so far from being victimized by you im of course considerably assisted by you because very often when you in the majority dont understand something well enoughwell i have to step back and say hey wait minute maybe it isnt understood you know somebody said the divine doubt was the beginning of all wisdom its very true you know kiplingkipling had that if when you can hold up your collar studs when all about you you know are losing theirs and blaming it on you whatever that was anyway well you know that there isnt anything to holding your nerve and course when everybody about you is doubting and blaming youthere isnt anything to this theres much more fantastic level of approach if you can doubt yourself too while all about you are doubting you and still carry through why you seeyoull be an auditor my and i have to decide every once in while that theres some part of this i dont know anything about and whenever i decide that why you get rather interesting advance into the situation because new piece of understanding turns up new polkadot piece of the puzzle suddenly shows up and so forth i suddenly cease to think that you are all being very very stupid you see and it suddenly dawns on that i might be either uncommunicative or kind of dull myself and at that moment of course ill start looking hard when youve had as much trouble as youve had over the last year or so with dirty needleswe didnt follow through this particular course of action on dynamic assessments of deciding that you were having an awful time and that i wasnt having this time and so forth i decided id make it easier on all of us because ive run into dirty needles too see im right in there with you ive read them with magnifying glass and at great cost of eyesight and midnight oil i have read dirty needles which finally turned out to be meter interference and you neednt feel too bad about reading meter because the manufacturer of the mark iv this afternoon had to be furnished magnifying glass and almost smash his nose on the front face of one of these things to realize that it had considerable amount of noise in it it was jittering like mad particular meter that i had up there it was just whizzing at great rate and he thought it was dead still even under magnifying glass and everythinguntil i pointed it out to him and he finally said well yes it is pumping isnt it but first he said well its just smoothly rising i said that is jittering theres noise on that and i moved it over into the set pattern over here and carefully moved it down so he could see exactly on both sides of the needle blade gave him big powerful magnifying glass and let him look at it for while it took him the longest time to see that that needle was vibrating it was very plainyou or i would have seen that it was vibrating by just glancing at the meter see nothing wrong with his recognition but it wasnt trained recognition he builds the things all right now having this much trouble with dirty needle brought about various other observations which brought about this factthat we never really had much trouble with dirty needles till we had something to do with goals hmmmm heres an interesting coordination never had any trouble with them all of sudden we start assessing for goals and we have trouble with them well i decided we might as well look in this particular direction i particularly learned what it was after all dirty needle is just small rock slam and small rock slam is what you get when you get fail to reveal and therefore if goal is fail to reveal why it must underlie big rock slam and furthermore if the goal is an overt against one or another dynamics it of course will react as big overt which is rock slam and all you have to do is find the dynamic it is an overt againstand then list the parts of the dynamic and find the rock slam on that and then list the goals and then find the goal that rockthat goes down the list and makes the rock slam cease and peter out you just list goals until you got rock slam or until the rock slam isnt riding there steadily you can assess that goals list and having assessed it you will find the persons goal on it quite interesting isnt it in other words youre tracing series of overts against dynamic and thats all youre tracing and the person has those overts against that dynamicnot because he has overts against dynamicthat isnt the genus of the goal its because accidentally what he postulated is particularly an overt against that dynamic you must learn this very well it is not an intentional fact that hes all messed up with that dynamic now listen very carefully here its not an intentional fact spiders as far as hes concerned analytically he can take them or leave them alone he doesnt want to have anything to do with spiders and yet his goal peculiarly is aimed at the heart of all spiderdom he does he hates spiders and he mopes on the subject of spiders and he gets big black eye and turns on rash around his medulla oblongata every time he sees spider you know and theres lots of physiological reaction to spiders and so forth and this is very puzzling to him because inwhen he first postulated this goal or basic purpose he didnt have spiders particularly in mind you see that but then by the structure of the dynamics he actually cant postulate in this universe goal or basic purpose without trodding upon the toes of one or part of one dynamic it is inevitable that if he acts in this universe he will act against something matter what else he benefitsno matter what else he intendshes still going to act against something now you can work this out fellow says im going to sit out here in the sun and enjoy myself now lets take as innocuous goal as that this particular area that he sits down in happens to be very attractive spot for bees to gather pollen and after few bees have crawled over him and stung him he of course goes out and gets himself can of antiinsecti and blows it about the place in all innocence direct consequence of this goal dont you see not necessarily an intended consequence but direct consequence of the goal you see so hes going to lie in the sun and enjoy himself well thats dandy so he goes down to the beachno bees down therehe goes down to the beach and the sand flies are all around the place and they dont bother him so muchhe hasnt got enough overts by this time really to be botheredbut they sure get over junior so he dusts junior off with good slug of ddt dont you see and every time he tries to lie in the sun and enjoy himself he gets all mucked up with insects he goes to picnic he lies down in the grass the next thing you know his mouth gapes open and hes chewing on ants so he bites up few ants and spits them out you see and it just seems as he goes on down the track and the trillennia accumulate that he also seems to have been accumulating some native affinity based on the agreement of mutual hate with the insect kingdom and he never intended to at all he had idea of any overt when he first formed up his basic postulate but that doesnt mean occasionally late on the track particularly when they formed up the overt they didnt have an overt ini meanwhen they formed up the basic postulatethat they didnt have an overt in mind sometimes you see matter how innocent the goal is it will result in some overtin chain of overts but the funny part of it also is is many of the goals are just basic postulates which are overts per sethey just are overts thats all i am goingwell i can think of good game to play haha ah i dont know that was good good old planet nono worries about it anymore they elected too many democratic presidents ah billiardballedthere it is oh well anotheranother cycle another postulate well lets see what the devil should i do ive been sitting here for couple hundred years and it doesnt seem to to be very productive gamei ought to be playing game of some kind what would be good game well somewhere in the universe there must be young girls im sure well lets play game of messing up young girls to mess up young girlsthat ought to be pretty productive of game the odd thing the young girls have done nothing to him and hed done nothing to young girls he isnt solving any problem theres purpose or basic reason for it it just seems to him that this would be good game and hes absolutely right so whether he intended an overt or didnt intend an overt or even if he particularly wished to avoid an overthes going to wind up with chain of overtsinevitably particularly if he wished to avoid one i can see it now you know hes been hauled off looking at this smoking ruin that was the planet you know hes been sitting on this asteroid whizzing about this system and he every once in while sees this smoking ruin down below theredebris is spread out you know and everything is sort of charred and you go near it you know and you can still hear the radioactivity fry in other words somebody held an election one way or the other and theres nothing doing back there you know theres just nothing nothing thats it and he goes whizzing around and he said that was pretty grim pretty grim to be blown up by that hes influenced to some slight degree this way although it isnt the immediate source of his postulate he makes brandnew postulate and he says never to hurt anybody again oh brother oh brother man has he had it this is the sort of life he leads he doesnt want to hurt his wife so he doesnt tell her to use listerine so he divorces her inevitable cycle you see he doesnt want to hurt anybodys feelings he doesnt want to hurt anybody or upset anybody anyway at all and he just seems to wind up clobbering them you know and he never quite understands how this is hes the most puzzled man about the whole lot nothurt he has mixed up with nocommunicate dont you see and thats where he gets messed up well were on particularly firm ground thus far but it was quite series of discoveries that led us into this very rapid dynamic assessment now the dynamic assessment of course takes advantage of the fact that matter what goal he dreamed up its going to have an overt on some channel and that you can put down as stable datum any goal will wind up eventually as an overt on some dynamic so if this is the case it can be found if an emeter would register directly overts and yes it doesan emeter can be made to register directly overts and i found out what it wasits the rock slam the dirty needle is the registry of an overt now lets take the stable datum and the confusion the prior confusion must exist to hold stable datum in placenot stable datum but to hold fixed datum to hold problem in place you must have had prior confusion you know this kind of thing similarly you have to have prior overtits the same mechanism you understand i say similarlyno its the same mechanism im just stating it in different words you got your confusion and then thats fired followed by fixed problem and decisions and so forth but youve got this mechanism working here whereby your prior confusionitll be expressed as an overt or series of overts followed by withhold and your overt is always prior to the withhold there isnt ever withhold which will register on meter that hasnt been preceded by an overt every withhold is preceded by an overt this is just the geometry of the mind this is as simple as the laws of gravityyou hold up fork you drop it it falls to the ground every time there is withhold earlier than the withhold there must have been an overt otherwise the withhold wont be withheld you get the idea i mean its just the mechanics of this thing now any time you want to prove that rock slam equals an overt ask somebody for withhold and watch the meter reaction watch very carefully take iton quite few pcs if youre having trouble and ask them for withholds withholds withholds something they failed to reveal and if your metering is even vaguely anythingyou know you know which side of the emeter to look atyoull see that little bzzbzzbzz needle back of those person after person after person see so much so that when youre doing tiger drills an experienced operator on the tiger drill sees the thing go dirty needle on him you know he sees it go bzz it wasit was going to be tiger bzz on this goal is there anything you failed to reveal see nothing elsewhy say anything else youre not going to get anything else unless you get off the fail to reveal well you could pull that but every time you see this little tiny tiny rock slamit doesnt matter how big the rock slam isyouve got fail to reveal back of it and the fail to revealof course withhold in other terminologymust have been preceded by an overt well now how is this character so hung up in dynamic consider the dynamic he is hung up with as withhold preceded by an overt and youll see exactly what that is see in other words hes hung in somethingit is actually quite heavy and massy what he gets hung in but its the same law is atis at the bottom of this that is if the individual is hung in something it must have been preceded by an overt against that thing we see this entomologist come down and inspect the house for termites and he has flat head and hes got his hair combed in certain way to look like antenna most marvelous thing you know hes got enough overts against termites that hes finally building his own body into termite body see hes hung up in that valence we call it valence all right similarly you go around to lot of undertakers and man if they dontif they dont resemble corpses inot bad looking corpses you understand theyre all well preserved corpses very well preserved and matter what their basic goal was or what they would assess out on the dynamictheyd probably assess out something elseyou can see this mechanism in the current lifetime you see you see little shadows of this mechanism now it goes from just slight thinkthink we get the guy on the meter and we say to him are you withholding anything and the needle goes bzzbzzbzzbzzbzz little tiny tiny tiny rock slam dirty needle rock slam simultaneous meaningsimilar meaning same thing so we get this little bzzbzzbzzbzzbzz now we say are you withholding anything are you not revealing something we dont care what it is see and he eventually breaks down and he tells us yes ii thought when you sat down in session that you were in need of shave and the thing clears up boom we dont notice that hes given us two in one see hes given us the overt which clears the withhold get the idea we can see that all the time thats just on little thinks and that sort of thing you know he said i had an overt thought and that is what i am withholding hell give you this all in one scrambled package you see and well see that bzzbzzbzz disappear there it is unless of course hes got some other bzzbzzbzz and he was withholding something else but there that goes dont you seebow gone isnt anything more to that all right now how about the fellow that we say this guy has reallyhas really been at it you see this guy hasevery time we get coke see and we take couple of swigs out of the coke and set it down in order to make phone call or something like that it disappears you know were just not ever able to finish coke if we ever set coke down it vanishes and this is hanging mystery with usis what happens to our cokes you see and we get this guy in session and we say to this fellow all right is there anything youve failed to reveal and it goes bzzbzzbzzbzzbzzbzzbzz and he says well i failed to reveal that you needed shave i thought that when i came into session and you say all right thank you is there anything youve failed to reveal and it goes bzzbzzbzzbzzbzzbzzbzz well what was that well actually just before the session why ii had awell iii thought maybemaybe your tr 1 wasnt so good and that disappears for moment and we say is there something you have failed to reveal and it says bzzbzzbzzbzzbzzbzzbzz and we say all right something else youve failed to reveal and he says well yesyes theres something else i failed to reveal i thought that you were pretty poor auditor in the sessions youve been running lately ive been looking at your pcs and theyre all caving inthats what i thought and that clears up and we say is there anything youve failed to reveal and it goes bzzbzzbzzbzzbzz oh nuts whats happening here whats going on this guys got godawful overt see hes got repeated overtsactual overts so of course the thing doesnt clean and the littlelittle rock slam persists and every time he even slightly withholds something or thinks something critical he keys in this big one see so its all charged up from this we finally prepcheck day in and day out week in and week out sweating it over wearing out the linoleum with cchs prepchecking sweating so and finally one fine day were particularly gifted and we happen to mention accidentally have you ever stolen anything and the thing falls off the pin goes into big slamacts up slam disappears the needle wont register on instant reads nothing this meter is sort of shorted we test the leads it still does it ever stolen anything you know and all of sudden he turns kind of beet red and he says oh i did mean to tell you the last month or so every time you had cocacola i hung aroundit was just joke you know i meani picked it up before you could finish it and it cleans up and that is the end of it and you have more bzzbzzbzz except when he has an immediate withhold then we get the bzzbzzbzz and you say is there something you failed to reveal and he says yes i wanted to move my feet and i didnt and you say thank you very much and its gone and it doesnt recur you get that as an expanded mechanism here all right now lets just expand it little further see every time we mentioned papa he said oh my father actually did in and my father has often done inas matter of fact my father was professional dome iner he lived only for that purpose and he was very gifted and we find out he embezzled the old mans bank accounts and ripped the transmission out of the old mans car and we finally trace it back to using the old mans pipe habitually for making soap bubbles and then never telling him always carefully wiping it off and putting it back on the rack see and we finally run this one out but all during that time were getting bzzzzzbluowblzzzz all we do is mention his father see bluzzzzzzbzzzz we want to turn it on all wed have to say to him is one of two things have you done anything to your father that would turn it on or just abandon doing anything to his father say get the idea of withholding something from your father see same mechanism is turned on by the two different sources if he withholds he gets it see and if he thinks of overts against him hell get it either way either way you get the same rock slam now dont get the idea that the overt is big one and the withhold is little one or anything like that theyre just blood brothers see the same manifestation of different periods on the track the overt is the commission and the withhold just parks it thats all and they register then as dirty needle tiny rock slam big rock slam huge rock slam burnedout meter the order of magnitude doesnt matter you see the mechanisms are all the same now theres anothernow lets look at that theres another wider line see lets not worry now about father lets worry about families and what do you know he hasntit isnt that he has made habit every lifetime for several lifetimes of caving in the family hethat isnt good enough see when we start bringing it over the level of families were bringing it across cycle in other words its fortunate for us that these withhold things run the little light ones are day or two or three see and then the next grade is almost an absolute its this lifetime see see its either little period or lifetime or cycle get that thats quitequite interesting you see its three grades there arent whole bunch of intermediate grades and that you can be very thankful for youll occasionally see trace of one and think youve got something but dont worry about it because these three grades are dominant as theres rock slam for the cycle or several cycles you see its cycle magnitude lifetime magnitude and very finite magnitude its days you knowdays minutes that sort of thing after three or four days the guythe thing the guy was withholding from you three or four days ago tends to key out it isnt bothering him see and what the guy had withholds in in lifetime keytends to key out at death and then weve got the big greatgrandpa of all weve got those which occur as result of having basic purpose or basic postulate or goal which directly or inadvertently tremendously affects the family lets say the most natural thetan goal in the worldto be free and then she marries this guy and then life goes on and she marries this guy and you know and sheand he marries herand she you knowthe thetan as him marries her and so on and he always wants to be free you see and of course every time he frees himself the family starves to death or something of the sort and he comes back and theyre all lying thereskeletons in the burned cabin you know this kind of thing and thisthis thing just is see basically there doesnt seem to be any connection between these two things but in all things that one is the one key line fortunately it remains constantit hasnt got lots of branches thank god thetan is specialist so seeyou see your various sizes of dynamics various sizes you get thismain postulate will be about dynamic or some major part of it see your goal see is against dynamic or some part of it it just winds up that way or was directly that way or tried not to be that way itll always wind up this way cest vie now the nextthe next size is you actually have postulates in ahead of these things by the way even on lifetime basis you see guy says in this lifetime im going to be good hasnt anything to do with his basic purpose see im going to be good his basic purpose is to be free but this lifetime he says im going to be good see louses him up you see because its not his basic purpose in life but he tries to be good during all this lifetime you can find this lifetimes leading goalto be good it wont do you bit of good if you ever try to run it it will beef up the bank bang now of these the only runnable things are the overts the longhaul runnability is all overts overts are the main runnability withholds are simply the secondary manifestations of the overts you can directly pull overts all away along the line and practically dispense with pulling withholds because of course as soon as they told you the overt it ceases to be withhold now oddly enough you can turn it around and for the purpose of rudiments you can just pull the withhold and it desensitizes the overt unless youve really put your foot in it and most of the time you can get away with just asking for the withhold you just ignore the overt are you withholding something from yes i had hostile thought that might even be good enough to clean it see it might also leave you with missed withhold occasionally but you can pull it just on withhold basis you can ask for the withhold you see and ignore this overt until it gets too chronictoo messed up and then youre in mess then youve got to ask for overts hence you have ow which is sneaky way of asking only for overts and the only reason you ask for the w at all is to keep the flow balanced so the pc wont get caved in on nothing but outflow let him taste the inflow as well as the outflow and he can run it more easily and better and longer thats really the reason why you have the w question in overtwithhold see thats what have you withheld see well thats just to reverse the flownot because you need to ask the question see in just the basic mechanics of the mind you dont have to ask the question at all but for the basic mechanics of energy and stuck flows and the pc getting gummed up you have to ask it see and the mechanics of auditing require that you ask it but as far as aberrativelyif you could just free all those without influencing flows in any wayof course you could just ask for overts dont you see so the mechanism then comes around to the fact that if you can pull the goalthe basic purpose of human beingit pulls the whole overt line on his chronic targets and thus wise go bzzzt and renders as nothing all them overts and the odd part of it is you list it by items and he doesnt even count it off as overts in many cases smooth as that now also person departing from his quote main goal line unquote is susceptible to alteris counterpostulate resistance and all the kinds of other mechanics proceed from this particular action and that hes unfaithful to himself when he disobeys that basic purpose is the main source of aberrative consequence but taking thatmoving off into the mechanics of the thing moving off into the energy phenomenon mental energy phenomenonall these various kinds of things why the one thing that holds true through all these things is an overt chain see it was never intended to be an overt chain in most cases but it became an overt chain and is therefore discoverable by the phenomena of rock slam now you see this thing all knit together neatly now you got it so all you have to do is find out which one rock slams the mostest and the most persistently to get the dynamic on which he has the most overts and trace that back and it will wind you up with very narrow perimeterin which he can write down his basic postulatesa list of any one of which might be it you assess out this hatfulvery small number you wind up with the guys goal merely because mechanically you have narrowed the field to such an extent now at the time you pick up this pc he is wandering in cloud pretty radioactive at that see hes in cloud he doesnt know whether hes coming or going you ask him for his basic purpose and he says its to shell spikes to build catfish to remove universes from my path to eat walnuts to worship god and to like myself and in some cases five thousand goals later he will be going on with that type of list in that it takes you one minute to null one goal you dont want them five thousand nor even one thousand long it takes too many hours to null them so all this other work is very rapidly done and you come into the small perimeter where you maybe have hundred or two goals something on that order at guess that you null by the tiger drill the guys goal falls out of the hat the banks all discharged it lists like breeze now the heavy work the long work becomes listing and accurate listing and keeping the goal cleaned up and so forth and youre sailing right straight toward clear so with this mechanism and with having worked out this paththis tightrope walkwhy weve got high road to clear what we need is an auditor sufficiently skilled to do dynamic assessment very exactly very accuratelyknow rock slam when hes looking at one but theres one thing that stays very greatly in our stead you might not be able to read an instant read of one tick but i defy you not to read halfadial rock slam thank you
