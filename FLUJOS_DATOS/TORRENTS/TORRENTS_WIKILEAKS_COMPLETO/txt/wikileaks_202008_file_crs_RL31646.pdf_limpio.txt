the exportimport bank reauthorization act of 2002 this act ma number of changes to the banks charter including changes in the way the bank conducts its economic impact analysis congress has balanced its directive to the bank to aid in financing us exports with offsetting concerns over the potential adverse economic impact the banks programs may have on us domes tic employment c ongress altered the banks authorizing statutes relative to the way it provides its services to firms that export equipment that foreign firms will us to boost their production of articles that have been determined to be imported into the united states under certain unfair trade practices these changes stemmed primarily from congressional objections to the banks approval in december 2000 of loan guarantee for pr oject that resulted in increased steelmaking capacity in china at the same time the bush administration was considering measures to protect th us steel industry from steel products imported from abroad changes to the banks statute require it to automatically deny its services to firms for exports of capital equipment or other goods that foreign producers will use to increase their production of items that are the same as or subs tantially the same as those that are subject to an antidumping countervailin g duty or section 201 order the bank is also required to devel op set of policies to address the conditions under which it must deny its services to firms that export equipment or other items that could be used by foreign producers to increase their production of goods that are subject to preliminary rather than final injury determination in an antidumping or countervailing duty inves tigation or in section 201 injury determination these changes to the banks statute mean that potentially larger number of us firms and their products could be in eligible for eximbanks services but this conclusion is only tentative congress has granted the bank broad discretionary powers that allow it to provide its services to firms even if they have been subject to final duty order if the bank determines th at the overall damage to the us economy and workers outweigh the benefits that w ould accrue to smaller group of workers and firms it is even possible that the bank could deny its services to firms that ultimately are not subject to any final duty or der or injury deter

as result of these changes the bank issued draft of its revised econo mic impact procedures on september 6 2002 and is soliciting public comments befo re it finalizes those procedures background the exportimport bank eximbank is an independent us government agency that is charged with financing and promotin g exports of us goods and services to accomplish these goals eximbank uses its authority and resources to assume commercial and political risks that exporters or private financial institutions are unwilling or unable to undertake alone overcome maturity nd other limitations in private sector export financing assist u s exporters to meet foreign officially sponsored export credit competition nd provide guidance and advice to us exporters and commercial banks and foreign borrowers the bank operates under renewable charter the exportimport bank act of 1945 as amended and has been authorized through september 30 2006 congress has directed the bank through its authorizing legislation to balance number of potentially competing directives in conducting its loan and guarantee activities in particular congress has voiced concerns on number of occasions over the potential adverse repercussions the banks activities could have on us firms or industries as result c ongress has balanced its directive to the bank to aid in financing us exports with offsetting concerns over the potential adverse economic impact the banks programs may have on us domestic employ ment particularly if the banks programs assist foreign firms or industries that c ould become rivals to us

states industry the availability of materials which are in short supply in the united states and employment in the united states and shall give particular emphasis to the objective of strengthening the competitive position of united states exporters and thereby of expanding total united states exports1 in the 1980s congress further stressed this point by specifically directing the bank to consider the economic impact of its activities especially if those activities caused substantial injury to us produ cers congress also directed the bank to deny its services to activities that estab lished or expanded fore ign production of any commodity for export if the bank determined that i the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting commodity will first be sold or ii the resulting production capacity is expected to compete with united states production of the same simila r or competing commodity and b the bank determines that the extension of such credit or guarantee will cause substantial injury to united states producers of the same similar or competing commodity2 congress also directed the bank to consider the financial viability of project as factor in determining whether to exte nd its programs to project by expecting the project to offer reasonable assurance of repayment3 furthermore congress limited the ability of the bank to deny certain types of applications by directing the bank not to deny applications for nonfin ancial or noncommerc ial considerations except in specific cases where the president in consultation with congress determines that such denial would be in the us national in terest by advancing us policy in such areas as international terrorism nuclear proliferation environmental protection and human rights including child labor4 countervailing an tidumping and scape clause actions in order to carry out the various di rectives and require ments congress has placed on it the bank developed set of ec onomic impact procedures as part of those procedures the bank decided that it would automatically deny its services to exports of items to foreign firms if the ite ms could be used to produce or to expand the production of goods that had been the subject of final countervailing or antidumping duty order antidumping countervailing duty nd section 201 orders are three methods the united states has adopt ed to give relief to us industries that face certain types of unfair competition from abroad as table 1 indicates there are five possible stages to countervailing or antidumping procedure an

fina l doc and itc determinations countervailing and antidumping duty law5 as contained in title vii of the tariff act of 1930 as amended aims to offset any unfair competitive advantage foreign manufacturers or exporters may have as re sult of foreign subsidies or sales at less than fair market value that causes or threatens injury to us producers as result investigations conducted under these statutes concern the actions of specific foreign country with respect to us imports fro m that country countervailing duties can be imposed when two conditions are met 1 the commerce department determines that good that is being imported into the united states is receiving subsidy in the manufacturing production or exportation and 2 the itc determines that us industry thereby is being materi ally injured or is threaten ed with material injury or that the overall health of the us industry is being materially retarded if these investigations result in affi rmative determinations dutie s equal to the net amount of the subsidies are imposed upon imports of the subsidized goods into the united states antidumping provisions concern investiga tions into whether an imported article is sold in the united states at less than fair value and causes or threatens to cause material injury to domestic industry dump ing therefore is form of international price discrimination in which goods are sold in the importing market at prices that are lower than the prices at which compar able goods are sold in their home market or in third country markets in both ty pes of procedures both the doc and the itc conduct preliminary and fi nal investigations that lead to respective determinations see table 1 section 201 law sections 201 to 204 of the trade act of 1974 19 usc sections 2251 to 2254 concerns investig ations by the international trade commission into whether goods are being imported into the united states in such increased quantities that they are substantial cause of or threaten to cause serious injury to us industry6 termed an escape clause mechanism or global safeguards these provisions authorize the president to withdraw or modify concessions and impose duties or other restrictions on im ports of any article which is determined to cause or to threaten such injury to producing like or directly competitive article these investigations generally are broader in scope than countervailing or antidumping duty investiga tions and their remedies apply to any number of countries that are exporting pa rticular item to the united states section 201 action does not require finding of an unfair trade practice but requires that the injury or threatened injury be serious rather than merely material and that the increased imports must be subs tantial cause of the injury as indicated in table 2 there are four stages to sec tion 201 case an investigation an itc injury determination itc re lief recommendations nd presidential action httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31646crs4 7 pl 107189 sec 18 8 ibid 9 exim bank supports 22 million sale of us equipment to china press release export import bank january 2 2001eximbanks economic impact procedures pl 107189 made number of changes to the statutes authorizing the bank including the conditions under which it must deny its services to us firms for exporting items to foreign producers that could be used to manufacture items that are subject to an antidumping or countervailin g duty order or section 201 investigation under section 18 of pl 107189 titled out standing orders nd preliminary injury determinations the bank is prohibited from extending loans or guarantees to an entity for the resulting producti on of substantially the same product that is the subject of i count ervailing duty or antidumping order under title vii of the tariff act of 1930 or ii determin ation under title ii of the trade act of 19747 in addition congress directed the bank to establish procedures regarding loans or guarantees provided to any entity that is subject to preliminary determination of reasonable indication of material injury to an industry under title vii of the tariff act of 1930 the procedures shall help to ensure that these loans and guarantees are likely to not result in significant increase in imports of substantially the same product covered by the preliminary determination and are likely to not have significant adverse impact on the domestic economy8 this change to the banks statutes was driven in large part by congressional objections to the banks approval in decem ber 2000 of loan guarantee for project that resulted in increased steelmaking capacity in china the eximbank approval consisted of an 18 million mediumterm loan guarantee to support 217 million export of computer software control sy stems and main drive power supplies by general electric company and other us suppliers to the benxi iron steel company benxi liaoning china the banks board of directors approved the loan guarantee even though the members knew it would be used to increase steel making capacity at the plant they based their decision on an estimate by ge that the deal would support 300 jobs at the ge plant in salem virginia that would supply the equipment and on indications by the chines that if eximbank denied the guarantee they would procure similar equipment from french and german companies in this case the bank reasoned the plant modern ization would occur regardless of the eximbank guarantee so that by supplying the guarantee the u s would at least benefit from the sale of the equipment9 some members of congress however rejected this line of reasoning and ques tioned how the bank could approve such ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31646crs5 10 senate report 10752 august 3 2001 11 prior to passage of pl 107189 the bank au tomatically reviewed as part of its own internal procedures the potential economic impact of projects by firms that were subject to preliminary countervailing or antidumping dut determination if the transaction totaled more than 10 million and if the bank believed the transaction posed the risk of substantial injury to us firms or if the transaction could affect more than 1 of us production in the affected industry see economic impact proposal exportimport bank september 6 2002 12 pl 107189 sec 18 based on past experi ence initiation of section 201 investigations in this manner is quite rare since most such investigations are initiated by petitions filed by the affected industry andor laborproject when the existen ce of excessive foreign steel capacity was well known and the domestic steel industry was in state of severe crisis10 the most notable change for the bank affects the markers it must use to evaluate whether certain kinds of exports by us firms qualify for its services according to pl 107189 eximbank is directed to deny its services to exports by us firms if the item in question could enable foreig n buyer to establish or increase production capacity of an item that is the subject of countervailing or antidumping duty order under title vii in addition pl 107189 di rects the bank to establish procedures as part of its overall decisionmaking process that set criteria for denying its services for us exports that foreig n producers could use to help manufacture products that are subject to counterva iling or antidumping duty investigation as soon as the itc has made an affirmative preliminary determina tion of reasonable indication of material injury rather than waiting for final injury determination in these procedures the bank is directed to ensure that its activities are likely to not result in significant increase in imports of substantially the same product covered by the preliminary determination and are likely to not have significant adverse impact on the domestic industry11 regarding section 201 cases congress di rects the bank to deny its programs to us firms for exports that can assist foreign buyer in establishing or in increasing production of article s that are the subject of an affirmative itc injury determination regardless of any subsequent itc relief recommendations and presidential actions for instance the bank would be prohibited from providing its services to us firms that are shipping computer equipment to foreign buyer if the buyer is using the equipment to produ ce steel products once the itc announced its injury determination in cases involvi ng transactions over 10 million congress also directed the bank that it shall consider i nvestigations that have been initiated at the request of the president of the united states the united states trade representative ustr the committee on fi nance of the senate or the committee on ways and means of the house of repres entatives or by the international trade commission on its own motion12 this seems to mean that the bank is specifically required to look at those cases that have been in itiated by the government entities when the transaction is over 10 million it is unclear if the bank is similarly required to look at cases that are initiated by other entitieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31646crs6 13 12 usc 635 e3 redesignated as result of pl 107189according to the statutes as amende d by pl 107189 the bank can exercise some discretion in deciding whether to ny its programs to project regardless of preliminary or final deter mination in an antidumping countervailing or section 201 case congress also made the new pr ovision detailed above regarding section 201 cases over 10 million subject to an exis ting provision that allows the bank to balance other interests against those adva nced in the provision it seems that in giving the bank this discretionary aut hority congress intende d to have the bank weigh carefully the short and longterm economic effects of such decisions on the us economy as whole relative to the potential economic injury encountered by any particular industry this broad exception states that exception paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply in any case where in the judgement of the board of directors of the bank the short and longterm benefits to industry and employment in the united states are likely to outweigh the short and longterm in jury to united states producers and employment of the same similar or competing commodity13 assessment pl 107189 made number of changes to the exportimport banks statute that could potentially deny the banks progra ms to broad group of us firms the legislation requires the bank to deny its services to us firms that export items that foreign buyers could use to establish or in crease their production of articles that are subject to remedial duty order in injuri ous unfair practice cases or to an itcs determination of injury in section 201 cases this change is similar to the banks existing internal procedures which require it to deny its services to us firms that export goods that foreign buyers could use in their production of articles that are subject to duty order in addition th legislation requires the bank to develop procedures that could potentia lly cover us firms that are exporting items that could assist foreign buyer in producing articles that are subject to pre liminary rather than final injury determination in unfair practice cases or that are the subject of an investigation in section 201 cases subj ect to the banks own determination of potential injury under these circumst ances much broader group of exports potentially could be determined to be ine ligible to receive eximbanks services as result of the broad discretiona ry powers congress has given the bank to weigh various competing interests it is not possible to determine with certainty the extent to which the banks actions regardin g broad group of us firms that export products that could be used to enhance foreign production of items that are subject to antidumping countervailing duty and sec tion 201 cases will be affected by pl 107189 these powers allow the bank to provi its services to firms that are exporting products that can be used to produce items that have been subject to final duty order if the bank determines that th overall damage to the us economy and workers by denying its services would outwe igh the benefits that would accrue to smaller group of workers and firms moreove r it is possible that in some cases the bank could deny its services to us firm s for products that are exported to foreign buyers that could be used in producing items that have been subject to anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31646crs7 antidumping or countervailing duty preliminar affirmative injury determination that are not subject to final injury determin ation in addition the bank could act in certain escape clause cases initiated by government agencies against us firms that export products that foreign buyers could us to produce items that have been subject to an affirmative cape clause injury determinati on but not subject to any final actions due to the broad discretionary powers that are available to the president who can accept reject or modify any itc injury relief recommendations for instance of the total of 72 escape clause cases th at the itc investigated under section 201 affirmative injury determination was made in 40 cases but the president took remedial action in only 15 cases in many instances requiring less restrictive actions than those recommended by the itc of the 72 cases only eight were initiated by government entity and injury was found and remedy applied in seven of them on september 6 2002 the bank issued draft of its revised economic impact procedures and held public meeting on th proposals it is currently soliciting comments on those procedures the draft included the ways in which the bank believes it needs to alter its economic impact procedures to comply with pl 107 189 the various options the bank is consider ing to address these changes and those options it is favoring once the bank s finalized its pro cedures it will announce those procedures and make th em available to the public this report will be updated once the new procedures are available
