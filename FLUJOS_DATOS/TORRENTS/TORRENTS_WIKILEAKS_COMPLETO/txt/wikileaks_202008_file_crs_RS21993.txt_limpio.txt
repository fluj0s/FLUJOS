congressional budget resolutions by robert keith the budget reconciliation process is an optional procedure under the congressional budget act of 1974 pl 93344 as amended that operates as an adjunct to the annual budget resolution process the 1974 act first became effective for fy1976 and congress crs2 has completed action on at least one budget resolution each year except for fy1999 fy2003 fy2005 and fy2007 the chief purpose of the reconciliation process is to enhance congresss ability to change current law in order to bring revenue spending and debt limit levels into conformity with the policies of the budget resolution with respect to spending reconciliation is focused on direct spending also called mandatory spending which derives from substantive law under the jurisdiction of the legislative committees and largely involves entitlement programs discretionary spending on the other hand is under the control of the appropriations committees and is subject to enforcement under different procedures roughly twothirds of total annual spending is direct spending accordingly reconciliation probably is the most potent budget enforcement tool available to congress for large portion of the budget reconciliation is twostage process in which reconciliation directives are included in the budget resolution directing the appropriate committees to develop legislation achieving the desired budgetary outcomes and the resultant legislation usually incorporated into an omnibus bill is considered under expedited procedures in the house httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21993 and senate reconciliation legislation can be developed or considered unless budget resolution containing reconciliation directives is adopted by both chambers1 each directive to committee is specified as discrete dollar amounts of spending budget authority outlays or both revenues deficit reduction any combination of spending and revenues or the debt limit to be increased or reduced for fiscal year or range of fiscal years reconciliation was first used by the house and senate in calendar year 1980 for fy19812 as an optional procedure it has not been used every year during the more than 30 years that the congressional budget process has been in effect 18 reconciliation measures were enacted into law and three were vetoed3 since the inception of the congressional budget process the senate finance committee has been subject to spending reconciliation directives in budget resolution on 16 occasions see table 1 fourteen instances involved directives to reduce spending while the remaining two for fy2002 and fy2004 instructed the committee to increase outlays to accommodate related tax policy changes in all but one of these 16 instances for fy1982 spending reconciliation directives to the committee were accompanied by 1 the house and senate sometimes have put budget enforcement procedures into effect in the absence of budget resolution by means of deeming resolution although deeming resolution has not been used to trigger action on reconciliation measure presumably this course of action remains an option for the house and senate if consensus did not exist to support budget resolution however it might likely not exist to support reconciliation legislation either for more information on deeming resolutions see crs report rl31443 the deeming resolution budget enforcement tool by robert keith 2 the senate considered revenuereduction bill for fy1976 hr 5559 under reconciliation procedures in december 1975 it was initiated under second budget resolution for

to the committee but not spending reconciliation directives the spending reconciliation directives varied in their time frame from singleyear coverage in the fy1981 and fy1990 budget resolutions to 11year coverage in the fy2002 and fy2004 budget resolutions further the amount of required spending changes ranged from about 100 million for single year to about 530 billion over seven years the

resolution 530359 billion for seven years covering fy1996fy2002 reconciliation directives to the committee to reduce spending in the first 13 budget resolutions involved broadscale efforts to reduce the deficit in addition to the finance committee at least several other senate committees and as many as 11 in one instance also were subject to reconciliation directives in each budget resolution to reduce spending or to achieve deficit reduction deficit estimates during this period generally ranged from httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21993 little below 100 billion to nearly 300 billion per year the fy1998 budget resolution included reconciliation directives to the finance committee and other senate committees to reduce spending in order to bring deficit levels down5 the resultant reconciliation measures the balanced budget act of 1997 and the taxpayer relief act of 1997 contributed to achieving surplus of 69 billion for fy1998 the first surplus in many years for the next three fiscal years fy1999fy2001 the budget remained in surplus before returning to deficit for fy2000 and fy2001 unlike the practice for the preceding two decades the finance committee was subject only to revenue reconciliation directives spending reconciliation directives were included for the finance committee or any other committee for fy2002 the reconciliation directives included 100 billion increase in outlays as well as revenue reductions of 1250 trillion over the period covering fy2001fy2011 for fy2004 the reconciliation directives included 275 billion increase in outlays as well as revenue reductions of 5225 billion over the period covering fy2003fy2013 the reconciliation directives to increase outlays were intended to accommodate related tax policy changes for fy2006 the budget
