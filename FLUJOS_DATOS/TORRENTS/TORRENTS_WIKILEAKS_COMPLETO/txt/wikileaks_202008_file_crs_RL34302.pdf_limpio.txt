of september 11 2001 the united states lacked comprehensive national policy and strategy for aviation security the approach to aviation security was largely shaped by past events such as the bombing of pan am flight 103 in december 1988 rather than comprehensive evaluation of the full range of security risks the 911 commission concluded that the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 revealed failures of imagination policy capabilities and management by both the faa and the us intelligence community following the september 11 2001 attacks us aviation security policy and strategy was closely linked to the changes called for in the aviation and transportation security act tsa pl 107 71 which emphasized sweeping changes to the security of passenger airline operations while the importance of strategic planning was recognized it was not priority the 911 commission report concluded that the tsa had failed to develop an integrated strategy for the transportation sector and mode specific plans prompting congress to mandate the development of these strategies and plans in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108 458 while the tsa has developed these strategies and plans the documents have been considered security sensitive thus limiting public discourse on the dhs strategy for aviation security however in june 2006 president bush directed the dhs to establish and implement national strategy for aviation security and an accompanying set of supporting plans under the framework for national aviation security policy established by the president the dhs has developed publiclyavailable national strategy for aviation security that addresses threats to aviation using riskbased methodology to complement the overarching national infrastructure protection plan nipp and seeks to deter and prevent terrorist attacks against aviation mitigate damage and expedite recovery and minimize the impact of an attack to the aviation system the strategy seeks to achieve these objectives by engaging domestic and international partners and carrying out specific actions set forth in series of supporting plans for operational security surveillance and intelligence threat response system recovery and coordination congress may have specific interest in assessing whether these plans are comprehensive adaptable sustainable and adequately coordinated with budgetary decisions and resource allocation specific issues for congress may include the validity of the strategys underlying risk assumptions the extent to which 911 commission recommendations and statutory requirements are reflected in the strategy consideration of sustainability of and advancement of security technologies to meet future needs and system demands whether the strategy is sufficiently forwardlooking and not reactive in its approach the extent to which the strategy provides comprehensive framework for robust aviation security system and the degree to which strategic objectives and approaches align with budget priorities and resource availability this report will not be updated

terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the united states lacked comprehensive national policy and strategy for aviation security the united states approach to aviation security had largely been shaped by past events such as the bombing of pan am flight 103 in december 1988 and at that time was undergoing reactive shift in strategy placing emphasis on addressing the threat of aircraft bombings aboard commercial airliners albeit with limited resources and much slower time frame compared to actions taken following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 in april 2001 the federal aviation administration issued strategic plan for civil aviation security titled commitment to security the vision was for the faa and the us aviation security system to be recognized as the world leader in civil aviation securityidentifying and countering aviationrelated threats to us citizens worldwide 1 the strategic goal stated in the plan was to let successful attacks against us civil aviation occur2 in comparison to the breadth and depth of the post911 focus on aviation security the desired key results stated in this document in retrospect seem quite modest and the goal tragically unattained the pre911 strategic plan sought to improve on checked baggage and checkpoint screening performance and utilize combination of explosives detection system eds screening and positive passenger baggage match ppbm techniques to vet 100 of checked baggage in addition to improving technical capabilities to detect explosives in checked baggage strategies identified by the faa included establishing security screening operations and training standards which at that time did not exist ensuring federal air marshals were available to protect selected highrisk flight although their numbers had dwindled to 33 at the time of the 911 hijackings 3 ensuring that certified explosives canine teams were available at major us airports and ensuring preparedness and crisis management to respond to incidents that may occur the faa civil aviation security strategic plan also sought to improve air cargo security primarily to reduce transport of dangerous goods likely response to the concerns over the transport of dangerous goods highlighted by the may 11 1996 crash of valujet flight 592 in the florida everglades the strategic plan sought to achieve this objective largely through industry training and education and targeted inspections of dangerous goods transportation areas despite the emphasis on preventing aircraft bombs carried in passenger luggage the potential threat of bomb placed in air cargo was not mentioned in the strategic plan also while the strategic plan addressed internal faa security the emphasis of this strategic element was on handling and protection of sensitive information and maintaining uptodate background checks and clearances 1 federal aviation administration commitment to security civil aviation strategic plan 20012004 april 2001 p 3 2 ibid p

plan did identify the completion of facility security assessments and the protection of information systems among key results sought it did not convey any insight regarding the potential threats and vulnerabilities of air traffic facilities to physical attack or faa information systems to physical or cyberattack the faas pre911 strategic plan also identified several key results regarding external relationships including improved communications with congress the aviation industry foreign governments the office of management and budget omb and the department of transportation office of inspector general dot oig the strategic plan however did not specifically address relationships with federal law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community factors that became central focus of post911 homeland security policy debate the strategic plan also did not address relationships and coordination with the military for incident response major deficiency in the faas response to the hijackings on september 11 2001 and an area of considerable focus during post911 strategic planning while the faa strategic plan for aviation security failed to adequately consider all security risks the 911 commission concluded that the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 revealed failures in imagination policy capabilities and management both on the part of the faa and the us intelligence community although the brunt of the criticism levied by the 911 commission was directed at the us intelligence community it faulted the faa for focusing too heavily on the threat of bombings and for not involving the faas civil aviation security intelligence functions in the faas policymaking process the 911 commission pointed out that the suicide hijacking threat was imaginable and was in fact imagin ed by faa civil aviation security intelligence analysts in 1999 but largely dismissed as being unlikely 4 the 911 commission faulted congress as well for becoming entrenched in debate over airline passenger service issues while failing to focus attention and resources on the terrorist threat to the aviation system the faa civil aviation security strategic plan released in april 2001 serves as evidence that the faa did not create comprehensive strategy for protecting the aviation domain from the full spectrum of terrorist threats and did not effectively prioritize and allocate resources for reducing the vulnerability of the aviation system to possible terrorist attacks immediately following the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 aviation security policy and strategy debate were closely linked to the legislative process leading to the swift passage of the aviation and transportation security act tsa pl 10771 with regard to strategy and policy atsa gave the newly created position of undersecretary of transportation for security now known as the tsa administrator specific authority and responsibility for assessing threats to transportation and developing policies strategies and plans for dealing with these threats to transportation security 5 however the primary emphasis of tsa was on the security of passenger airline operations and the immediate focus of the tsa was to meet congressionally established requirements and deadlines for the deployment of air marshals the federalization of airport security screeners and 100 explosives detection system eds screening of checked baggage while the importance of establishing comprehensive policy and strategy for aviation security was recognized by many policymakers strategic plan for protecting the aviation domain was slow to take shape 4 ibid p 345 5 see title 49 usc 114

set forth in tsa were being carried out and while congress debated legislation to establish the department of homeland security dhs the bush administration began examining us policies for protecting the homeland against future terrorist attacks in broader context considering other infrastructure and assets beyond the aviation domain that may be at risk in july 2002 the president issued the national strategy for homeland security and in february 2003 the president issued the national strategy for the physical protection of critical infrastructures and key assets however neither of these strategies offered specific details on aviation security strategy nor did they specify how aviation security plans and programs fit into these broader strategies for protecting the homeland and its critical infrastructure and key resources cikr from terrorist attacks on july 22 2004 the 911 commission released its final report concluding that the tsa had failed to develop an integrated strategic plan for the overall transportation sector and specific plans for each of the transportation modes the 911 commission recommended that the us strategy for transportation security should be predicated on riskbased prioritization for allocating limited resources to protect transportation infrastructure in costeffective manner assigning roles and responsibilities for federal state regional and local authorities as well as private stakeholders 6 following the release of the 911 commissions final report congress made addressing the recommendations of the report key legislative priority reflecting many of the commissions recommendations in the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 which was enacted on december 17 2004 the act specifically required the dhs to develop prepare implement and keep uptodate comprehensive national strategy for transportation security and modespecific security plans reflecting 911 commission recommendation language the act required the strategy to assign riskbased priorities and realistic deadlines for implementing practical and costeffective defenses against security threats setting forth agreed upon roles and missions for federal state regional and local authorities and mechanisms for private sector cooperation and participation under the requirements established in the act the national strategy for transportation security was to be accompanied by modespecific security plans including an aviation modespecific plan the modal security plan for aviation was required to include threat matrix outlining each threat to the united states civil aviation system and the corresponding layers of security in place to address these threats and plan for mitigation and reconstitution of the aviation system in the event of terrorist attack while the act required that the first iteration of the strategy be transmitted to the congressional homeland security authorizing committees 7 by april 2005 the strategy document was delivered in september 2005 as required by law updates to the strategy and the modespecific plans must be transmitted to congress every two years these strategy documents have been designated as security sensitive information as provided for in the act consequently they have had limited distribution beyond the dhs and the homeland security authorizing committees in congress therefore there has not been extensive public discourse on the dhs approach to developing national strategy for transportation security and strategies and plans specific to protecting the aviation mode from future terrorist attacks 6 national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report p 391 7 at present the congressional committees having primary jurisdiction over the department of homeland security are the house committee on homeland security and the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs

directing the dhs to establish and implement national strategy for aviation security and series of supporting plans for implementing this strategy8 unlike prior strategies and plans that had either been too broad in scope to provide detailed information regarding aviationspecific security strategies or were limited in distribution the policy strategy and supporting plans developed under this presidential directive have been made available to the public thus offering insight into the strategic direction and approach to aviation security being pursued by the dhs in coordination with other federal agencies these documents are also much more comprehensive in their consideration of security in the aviation domain compared to prior strategy documents and therefore provide more thorough picture of us policy and strategy for mitigating threats involving aviation this report examines the current national aviation security policy the national strategy for aviation security and formal modespecific plans developed for implementing this strategic approach this report also identifies and discusses some overarching considerations for congressional oversight and possible legislative action regarding the us policy and strategy for securing the aviation domain

aviationspecific components of the national strategy for homeland security that strategy specifies that the department of homeland security dhs will serve as the focal entity for managing and coordinating border and transportation security initiatives to prevent the entry of terrorists and the instruments of terror while facilitating the legal flow of people goods and services on which our economy depends 9 the policy however addresses broader spectrum of threats to the air domain that include not only specific threats to the homeland but also threats to national security interests both within the united states and abroad therefore in addition to the overall responsibility for homeland security and aviation security for which the dhs and the tsa are directly responsible the national aviation security policy also involves matters concerning the department of defense the department of state the department of justice and variety of other federal state and local agencies and private entities and relies on close coordination with and continued cooperation from other nations on june 20 2006 president bush issued homeland security presidential directive 16 hspd 16 national security

assets and capabilities to prevent the air domain from being used by terrorists criminals and other hostile states to commit acts of terrorism and other unlawful or hostile acts against the united states its people property territory and allies and friends all while minimizing the impact on the aviation transportation system and continuing to facilitate the free flow and growth of trade and commerce in the air domain these efforts are critical to the global stability and economic growth and are vital to the interests of the united states 10 the stated policy specifies that the united states in cooperation with international partners will take all necessary and appropriate actions consistent with applicable laws statutes and international agreements to enhance the security and protect the united states and us interests in the air domain the implementation of this policy is to be consistent with riskbased prioritization of aviation security strategies and tactics activities to support this policy objective specifically cited in this directive include protecting critical transportation networks and infrastructure from terrorist attacks and other hostile criminal and unlawful acts and reducing the vulnerability of the air domain to these types of possible attacks or exploitation improving situational awareness of security issues affecting the air domain and facilitating and enhancing information sharing to improve detection of threats and appropriate responsive actions ensuring seamless coordinated efforts relating to aviation security among federal state tribal and local agencies and authorities enhancing the resilience of the air transportation system to terrorist attack including the capability to rapidly recover from such an attack and minimize impacts on economic transportation so cial and governmental systems countering the proliferation of standoff weapons such as shoulderfired missiles that pose significant risks to both

multidisciplinary and global approach to aviation security the directive required that the national strategy along with its supporting plans include at minimum riskbased pproaches to address the following threats attacks using aircraft against groundbased targets including possible attacks using aircraft to deliver or transport chemical biological radiological nuclear or explosive cbrne weapons attacks using standoff weapons such as shoulderfired missiles or other man portable air defense systems manpads attacks using onboard explosive devices and other conventional and non conventional weapons to directly target aircraft hijackings and air piracy and physical attacks or cyberattacks on aviation critical infrastructure and facilities such as air traffic control facilities and networks and navigation systems the directive also identifies several specific action items to be addressed in supporting mode specific plans to implement the national strategy for aviation security the required plans include the aviation transportation system security plan the aviation operational threat response plan the aviation transportation system recovery plan the air domain surveillance and intelligence integration plan the international aviation threat reduction plan the domestic outreach plan and the international outreach plan the national strategy for aviation

three origins or sources of threats to the air domain terrorist groups hostile nationstates and criminals the strategy document points out that while physical attacks from terrorist groups pose the most prominent threat terrorists may also use criminal tactics to move operatives weapons explosives or possibly weapons of mass destruction wmds through the aviation system the strategy notes that such threats are particularly worrisome in areas of the world where governments are weak or provide safe haven to terrorists 11 further hostilenation states may directly sponsor international terrorism directed against aviation by providing funding training we apons explosives supplies and other material support to carry out attacks against the air domain also the presence of criminal

states and in foreign countries pose persistent threat to aviation and could provide potentially violent domestic groups or international terrorists with specific capabili ties to exploit weaknesses in aviation security therefore these three threat origins or sources cannot be viewed as being mutually exclusive as they may combine in various forms to carry out attacks either directly against aviation assets or by exploiting elements of the air domain to prepare for or carry out attacks against the homeland or us interests abroad the strategy document defines three primary categories of threats against the aviation domain based on the target of the threat these consist of threats involving aircraft threats to aviation infrastructure and threats involving hostile exploitation of air cargo variety of tactics may be used to attack these targets including hijackings bombings shootings and criminal tactics such as smuggling of persons and weapons synopsis of the relationships between threat origins or sources aviation targets and tactics for attacking these aviation targets is presented in figure 1 figur 1 viation security thr eat sour ces t actics and t arg ets terrorists

of aircraft to attack other targets as was the case in the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the strategy document notes that large passenger aircraft have historically been at the greatest risk from terrorist attacks including both hijackings and bombings because terrorists have perceived that attacks against such aircraft have significant potential to cause catastrophic damage and mass casualties and disrupt the aviation system the document however notes that terrorists may also seek to attack allcargo aircraft especially large allcargo aircraft which are considered attractive as weapons to attack groundbased targets in 911style attacks allcargo aircraft and the air cargo system in general may also be attractive to terrorists or criminals as means of conveyance for weapons explosives or other supplies the strategy considers large transport aircraft both passenger airliners and to lesser extent allcargo aircraft to be at risk from possible attacks using shoulder fired guided missiles or other standoff weapons httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34302g16g138g157g146g152g151g138g149g561g3g159g146g138g157g146g152 g151g561g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g18

direct attack as well as the threat that they may be used as weapons to attack groundtargets while the strategy notes that small aircraft appear to be relatively unattractive targets for attacks by themselves because they carry few passengers it cautions that terrorists may use wide variety of small aircraft such as business jets and helicopters to destroy groundtargets especially critical assets and infrastructure the most formidable threat comes fro m the potential use of small aircraft to either transport or deliver wmd payload the strategy also notes that small aircraft are also used by transnational criminal elements to carry out illegal activities such as drugs and weapons smuggling and pose considerable challenge for border protection finally the strategy recognizes that nontraditional aircraft such as unmanned aircraft ultra lights and aerialapplication aircraft ie crop dusters may be used as either weapons or means of conveyance for wmds the strategy states that terrorists may employ such aircraft for missions that are limited in range require limited accuracy and have specific and small target for example crop dusting aircraft have been regarded as potential threat for dispersing chemical or biological agent the strategy notes that such tactics deserve very close monitoring the strategy also briefly notes the potential threat to the air domain posed by hostile nationstates from military aircraft and missiles however these threats are mainly concern for national defense and the department of defense dod rather than focus for homeland security and thus have not been major focus of the aviation security strategy and its supporting plans this threat is therefore not further considered in this discussion

infrastructure including airports and air navigation facilities are relatively few the strategy notes that air navigation facilities in particular have low public profile and are resilient to attack due to robust multilayered design that can be quickly reconstituted thus limiting psychological and economic impacts stemming from an attack the strategy however notes that there is wide variety of potential threats to aviation infrastructure the strategy notes in particular the potential threat to concentrations of individuals at major airport passenger terminals terrorists may attack passenger terminal buildings with explosives as was attempted at glasgow international airport scotland in june 2007 and in several other historical incidents12 the strategy concludes that attacks against other facets of aviation infrastructure such as general aviation airports and air cargo handling areas are less likely to materialize largely because attacks against these facilities would generally not offer the opportunity to target large numbers of people and would therefore have more limited psychological impact the strategy however was released few months before us law enforcement authorities arrested members of suspected homegrown terrorist cell who were plotting to bomb jet fuel storage tanks at new yorks john f kennedy international airport jfk and the network of jet fuel distribution pipelines in the new york city area while the actu vulnerability of this infrastructure to such an attack remains debatable the plot highlighted the possibility that aviation jet fuel storage facilities and distribution systems at major us airports may be at risk while the sophistication 12 see ariel merari attacks on civil aviation trends and ssons in paul wilkinson and brian m jenkins

plot has been questioned13 in general the potential threat to fuel farms and pipelines and other critical aviation infrastructurewhere an attack could have dramatic effect capturing public attention and potentially disrupting the aviation system on large scalemay deserve further attention from policy makers and aviation security strategists

the large scale diversity and complexity of the air cargo industry makes it potentially vulnerable to exploitation by terrorists the strategy however concludes that post911 actions to enhance air cargo security have been effective in reducing the threat of stowaways aboard air freighters that could carry out 911style suicide hijacking and the threat of explosives nonetheless the strategy recogniz that the enhanced regulatory framework for air cargo security 14 is not immune to exploitation and the air cargo system in general has been exploited for years by criminal elements in addition to possible threats to allcargo aircraft noted above the threat of terrorist infiltration of air cargo handling operations and facilities remains threat that could lead to exploitation of the air cargo system as means of conveyance for terrorist operatives and conventional weapons wmds explosives weapon components and other terrorist items while not discussed specifically by the strategy it should be noted that all sorts of criminal activities possibly including cargorelated crimes in the aviation domain could provide revenue sources to support terrorist organizations

to ensure that resources allocated at the federal state and local levels and by private sector aviation interests provide the greatest potential to detect deter and prevent attacks against aviation and mitigate the consequences if an attack does occur this riskbased approach or methodology is described in detail in the national infrastructure protection plan nipp and the nipp transportation sector specific plan tssp which were made available to the public in may 2007 15 in general the nipp serves to define the unifying structure through common framework for identifying critical assets conducting risk assessments and developing and implementing risk reduction and mitigation initiatives based on the results of these assessments16 the tssp applies this riskbased framework acro ss the entire transportation sector including the aviation domain the systembased riskmanagement framework outlined in the tssp describes risk as function of threat vulnerability and potential consequences and it analyses security risk by taking into account all three of these factors the transportation sector approach to risk management adheres to an underlying vision for riskbased decision making that seeks to establish balance between security and freedom the goals outlined in the tssp include 13 see especially bruce schneier portrait of the modern terrorist as an idiot wired june 14 2007 14 see

transportation systems enhancing the resilience ie the ability to absorb damage without catastrophic failure of the us transportation system and improving the costeffective use of resources allocated to transportation security the riskbased methodology seeks to achieve these three overarching goals by prioritizing resources based on risk this approach seeks to involve extensive participation from global state and local and private sector entities with specific domain expertise it also is intended to rely on inputs from the intelligence community expert judgment and futures analysis related to the impact or consequences of various threat scenarios wide variety of riskbased transportation sector security assessment tools have been developed to assist security strategists and planners these consist of selfassessment tools and government site evaluations reviews and analytic tools examining either risk as whole or specific risk subcomponents including threat vulnerability and consequence some specific tools being implemented to assess risk in the aviation domain include government facilitated site assistance visits and comprehensive reviews webbased vulnerability identification self assessment tool visat modules for airports that are currently under development and the faa s information systems security program issp for air traffic control systems and related functions communication and dissemination of this information to sector stakeholders is seen as critical component of the riskbased strategy

guide aviation security activities these include deterring and preventing terrorist attacks and criminal or hostile acts in the air domain protecting the homeland and united states interests in the air domain mitigating damage and expediting recovery if an attack against aviation occurs minimizing the impact of an attack on the aviation system and the broader us economy and actively engaging domestic and international partners according to the strategy for aviation security terrorist attacks will be deterred and prevented by maximizing shared awareness of domestic and international airspace aviation infrastructure and individuals having access to the aviation system therefore the strategy seeks to establish system of protection that considers not only individual elements of the aviation system but also their connections and interdependencies while the principal goals of the strategy are to deter and prevent attacks the strategy also seeks to prepare for and have in place contingencies for mitigating damage and expediting recovery the strategy identifies need for diverse and flexible response options for example allowing for the selective restriction or suspension of air traffic on local or regional levels as necessary and providing decision makers with tools and resources to effectively close and reconstitute the aviation system and take other appropriate steps to prevent further attack in general the strategy

determining the validity of the various risk models and assumptions that have been used to set aviation security policy and strategy is difficult task these risk determinations have largely arisen from restricted access intelligence information and other limited distribution sources thus constraining the ability to engage in open public discourse on the validity of their underlying evidence and assumptions nonetheless some critic s have argued that these risk assumptions and resulting policy and strategic decisions may be based on inaccurate and incomplete analysis for example some have noted that federal intelligence and security agencies are inexperienced with and uninterested in statistics 18 this has led some to argue that the use of statistical techniques to study terrorism data

estimates of riskoverstating the risk of certain scenarios while underestimating the risk of others while it appears that efforts are being made to better document global terrorism incidents and perform statistical analyses to identify risk trends more comprehensive efforts to look specifically at risks to the aviation domain may be needed to provide better guidance for developing and

commission recommendations provided framework for consideration of legislation enacted in both in the 108th congress when the commissions final report was first released in 2004 see pl 108458 and during the first session of the 110th congress in 2007 pl 11053 with regard to aviation security both the 911 commission and subsequent legislation have emphasized policies and strategies to aggressively pursue capabilities to detect explosives on passengers and pursue technologies to better screen passengers and carryon items for broad array of threat objects21 the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 specified that the dhs should give high priority to checkpoint screening technologies for detecting nonmetallic chemical biological radiological and explosives and directed the dhs to develop strategic plan for the deployment of explosives detection technologies at checkpoints such as walkthrough explosive detection portals document scanners shoe scanners and backscatter xray scanners the act authorized funding for the development and testing of these various checkpoint screening technologies however while the tsa has also recognized the importance of enhancing passenger screening capabilities progress has been slow in developing the required checkpoint screening strategy and results of using these technologies in airport settings has been mixed prompting congress to include language in the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 pl 11053 requiring the dhs to finalize its checkpoint screening strategic plan and

including reliability issues with walkthrough explosives trace detection portals deployed for field testing and the failure of shoe explosives scanners tested on registered traveler program participants in orlando florida to meet minimum standards set by the tsa the tsa has also been faced with shifting technology strategies prompting them to pursue liquids expl osives screening technologies as well the tsa has reported good results in evaluations of highly sensitive handheld explosives trace detection sensors that are now being field tested for scr eening carryon liquids at passenger checkpoints while technology testing is progressing clear strategic picture of how these emerging technologies will be deployed to upgrade and enhance screening checkpoints is still needed the recent mandate in pl 11053 to develop and implement such strategy appears to address this need however further congressional oversight of the tsas progress in implementing the strategic plan for emerging checkpoint screening technologies may be scheduled to ensure that appropriate and effective program and budgetary decisions are made to achieve strategic goals the 911 commission emphasized the need for the federal government to take over the role of checking passenger names to allow for thorough vetting of passengers against the comprehensive consolidated terrorist watchlist maintained by the federal government while this objective has largely been accomplished by customs and border protection cbp for all inbound international flights efforts to deploy system for federal prescreening of passengers on all domestic flights has been repeatedly delayed amid continued controversy over privacy rights protection of personal data and adequate procedures for redress when individuals are falsely denied boarding or singled out for additional screening while congress has generally concurred with the 911 commissions view that comprehensive passenger prescreening against the consolidated watchlist is needed congress has also been sensitive to these privacy rights data protection and redress concerns and through legislation has placed specific contingencies related to these issues on system implementation and has repeatedly directed the gao to carefully scrutinize the tsas progress in addressing specific requirements for fullscale system deployment further congressional oversight of tsa s progress toward implementing federallyrun passenger prescreening on domestic flights may be called for as the strategic plan indicates that implementation of this initiative is expected in 2008 the 911 commission also recommended that ongoing initiatives to integrate checked baggage explosives detection systems eds with airport baggage handling systems should be expedited congress has placed an emphasis on funding airport projects to integrate eds inline with baggage handling conveyors establishing the aviation security capital fund for this purpose as part of the vision 100 century of avia tion reauthorization act pl 108176 in 2003 nonetheless the gao estimates that making the needed changes at all airports in the united states to integrate eds equipment will not be completed until 2024 if future funding remains consistent with historic funding levels for thee activities 22 in recognition of this continuing funding need congress took the unusual step of including 20year reauthorization of funding for inline baggage system deployment extending authority for the aviation security capital fund and other funding mechanisms for inline eds integration through 2028 and directed the tsa to take further steps to prioritize airport eds integration projects as part of the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 pl 11053

to eds integration may be of long lasting interest for congress given the size scope complexity and cost of this initiative in addition the 911 commission recommended that the tsa intensify efforts to identify suspicious cargo and appropriately screen and track potentially dangerous cargo in aviation as well as in maritime operations toward this objective the tsa has issued regulations to increase the security of air cargo operations and has been pursuing riskbased targeting capabilities to identify shipments requiring additional scrutiny to direct physical screening resources toward elevated risk cargo with some amount of random screening congress however has been pushing the tsa toward increasing the amount of cargo destined for passenger aircraft that is screened and in 2007 passed legislation see pl 11053 sec 1602 that requires the tsa to establish system to screen 100 of cargo transported on passenger aircraft by the summer of 2010 unlike the requirement for 100 checked baggage screening which was tied to specific technology namely eds the mandate for 100 screening of cargo placed on passenger aircraft can be met using variety of approaches including xray systems eds trace detection technologies canine teams and possibly other methods for physical examination as approved by the tsa to address this mandate and achieve 100 screening of cargo placed on passenger airlines within the three year time frame set forth in the legislation the tsa will need to move relatively swiftly in developing and implementing strategy for cargo screening given the continued congressional interest on the issue of air cargo security it is likely that extensive oversight of the tsa s progress toward meeting this mandate and effectively conducting air cargo screening operations will occur over the next few years while the national strategy and modespecific plans acknowledge and emphasize passenger prescreening checkpoint screening inline eds integration and cargo screening issues the extent to which dhs efforts on these matters align with congressional views and legislative mandates remains specific topic for ongoing analysis and debate

unavoidable reality for aviation security strategists is that continued growth in demand for air travel and for shipping goods by air is anticipated the faa estimates that the number of airline passengers will increase at an annual rate of about 34 domestically and about 47 for international flights over the next twelve years23 this anticipated growth could strain passenger and baggage screening operations in the future if it is not adequately planned for similarly growth in air cargo volume is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 35 domestically and by 67 on international routes thr ough 2020 strategies and initiatives to enhance the security of air cargo operations and screen air cargo shipments must therefore also consider these growth projections in carrying out policies strategies and plans for enhancing air cargo security air traffic is also expected to increase about 38 with growth of about 37 in general aviation operations expected airspace security strategies and approaches may need to consider this growth in flight operations in devising effective security programs and procedures for protecting airspace over areas considered critical

aviation operations is being adequately planned for in the context of national strategies and modespecific plans for aviation security the strategies indicate that they will evolve with shifting threat and vulnerability characteristics on the basis of ongoing risk assessments however the degree to which the changing nature size and scope of aviation and air travel is being considered in these risk assessments remains signficant issue for policymakers and aviation security strategists with regard to the sustainability of aviation security technologies specific strategies for maintaining deployed technologies and phasingin next generation screening technologies have not yet been clearly defined while plans for enhancing aviation security under the comprehensive next generation air transportation system ngats initiative envision extensive improvements to aviation security by 2025 the roadmap to achieving these capabilities has not yet been fully defined according to the future

reactive stance failing to strategically plan resource allocation based on robust and thoughtful risk analysis instead allowing high profile events and media reaction to potentially influence decision making for example using the tsas response to the foiled liquid explosives plot in august 2006 by restricting carryon liquids some critics have argu ed that the administration is allowing single events and the media coverage and public attention they generate to shape policy decisions25 the tsa has defended its actions in response to the liquid explosives threat making available to the public documentation and demonstrations of the formidable threat posed by improvised liquid explosive devices however liquid explosives have long been known by security experts to pose formidable threat to aircraft yet us aviation policy and strategy before this plot was uncovered had not included any specific nearterm measures to screen passengers for liquid explosives critics argue that reacting to single events is nearsighted and goes against the very purpose of developing strategies and plans in the first place which is to be proactive in assessing threats and directing resources to mitigate associated risks however on the contrary if strategies and underlying plans are to be adaptive they should be able to shift rapidly in response to changing threat characteristics and changing threat levels reviewing the tsa response to the liquid explosives plot may provide more specific insights into whether this response was reasonable adaptive approach to mitigate unforseen risks or case of taking immediate and arguably questionable actions in an effort to restore and maintain public confidence in aviation security if it is determined that the tsas actions in response to the liquid explosives plot represented well thought out example of an evolving strategy that can respond quickly and effectively to emerging threats then perhaps additional questions need to be asked regarding why the emerging threat of liquid explosives was not foreseen prior to widespread public disclosure of information regarding the failed liquid explosives plot in the united kingdom more detailed examination of the deliberations and decisionmaking regarding liquid explosives both before and after receiving knowledge of the foiled plot can perhaps provide unique insights and lessons learned to aid security analysts and senior policy makers in developing strategic and tactical decision making tools to improve upon the us response to future emerging threat situations critics argue that the government must replace its practices of responding to single threats with more systematic approaches for improving homeland security lingering concern is that if aviation security policies and practices and more broadly homeland security policies and practices remain too reactionary terrorists may be able to exploit this approach terrorist may be able to trigger reactionary responses by providing misinformation about intended targets or attack methods this may lead to haphazard allocation or reallocation of resources that could be wasteful and inefficient and could even result in resources being moved in manner that could make the system more vulnerable to attack in other words terrorists may be able to more easily exploit reactionary approach to aviation security by using diversionary tactics that may increase vulnerabilities in other areas or aspects of the air domain 25 zack phillips one hit wonders government executive october 30 2006

desired elements of such strategies identified by the gao included purpose scope and methodology definition of the problem and an assessment of the associated risk an identification of the goals and supporting or subordinate objectives and activities to meet these goals and performance measure to evaluate progress toward achieving these goals an identification of resources costs and risk management analysis to determine where resources and investments should be targeted clear definition of organizational roles responsibilities and coordination and discussion of how particular strategy relates to other strategies and how plans activities and objectives will be integrated to meet the stated goals of the various related strategies while the gao used these criteria to evaluate various national security homeland security counterterrorism and infrastructure protection strategies that had been developed prior to 2004 the national strategy for aviation security had not been developed at that time and has not subsequently been evaluated against these desired elements at first glance the aviation security strategy appears to contain or address many of these desirable characteristics where the strategy and supporting plans may be lacking however is in fully defining the methodology for evaluating risk and carrying out the strategy fully documenting associated cost estimates and resource requirements providing sufficient detail regarding roles responsibility and coordination particularly among nonfederal entities that are expected to participate in carrying out the various modespecific plans and clearly indicating how the various components fit into the hierarchy of national security homeland security and counterterrorism strategies and plans and how the elements of these various plans may be integrated both within and beyond the aviation domain 26 us government accountability office combating terrorism evaluation of selected characteristics in national

national strategy for aviation security to specifically identify potential needs for more detail and specificity with regard to addressing these and perhaps other key elements of the strategy and supporting plans additionally one of the key required features of the national strategy for aviation security is that it must be adaptive consequently the national strategy and its supporting plans and documents are likely to evolve over time to address changes in threats intelligence terrorist tactics and capabilities as well as new security technologies and capabilities it is also likely that the strategy and its supporting plans will sometimes need to change quickly in the face of imminent threats therefore congress may also have particular interest in assessing the robustness of the national strategy for aviation security and the capability of the underlying aviation security system to adapt based on shifting risk dynamics

congress and the administration may have particular interest in assessing how the national strategy and supporting plans align with budgetary decisions and resource availability particularly in the context of the annual budget and appropriations process this could be key consideration as elements of the current strategy call for some considerable expansion of the tsas roles and responsibilities for example dhs objectives for the tsa to assume passenger identification functions and carry out behavioral observation both at and beyond airport screening checkpoints is likely to be human resource intensive and therefore may need further scrutiny in the context of budget and resource prioritization also technology advancements for checkpoint baggage and cargo screening are also being sought by both congress and the administration additionally new and proposed statutory requirements may also expand the functions of the tsa and other federal agencies for example provisions in the implementing the 911 commission recommendations act of 2007 pl 11053 require the swift phasein of air cargo inspections to achieve 100 inspections of all cargo carried on passenger air carrier aircraft within three years this mandate is likely to have significant cost and resource implications not only for the federal government but also for the airline industry aligning this initiative with ongoing strategic plans for riskbased profiling and targeting of cargo shipments and investment in cargo screening technologies is likely to be topic of considerable interest in the context of the federal budget process over the next few years as part of the budget process the tsa has prepared strategic context component of its congressional justification documents since the fy2007 budget cycle while these documents provide general framework of key strategic issues for the tsa they adhere to program level justification and analysis and do not provide indepth discussion of how specific programs and initiatives address specific strategic issues and risk management practices while these documents provide general framework for understanding tsa programs in the strategic context they may not provide sufficient detail regarding the methods used to set priorities and how the various aviation security programs and initiatives being pursued align with riskbased priorities as congress proceeds with initiatives to oversee and possibly modify us approaches to aviation security substantive issues relating to the contents of aviation security policy national strategy and planning documents may be considerable focus of discussion and debate while these documents will likely play an important role as general blueprint for guiding aviation security
