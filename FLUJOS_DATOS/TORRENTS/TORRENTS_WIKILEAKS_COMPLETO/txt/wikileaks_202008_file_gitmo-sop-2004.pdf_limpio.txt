showing big close up of an object do long shot or mid shot of it to establish its location in relation to other parts of the scene 9 when covering long narrow section of scene such as hallway or the walkway of tier consider slow zoom from single location and pulling focus if necessary rather than clumsily walking along it dolly shot with the inevitable disconcerting sway and judder 10 if perspective has to change ie you have to see behind objects or demonstrate their separation from each other then use of dolly shot may be unavoidable in this case use the lens at its widest possible angle to minimize sway and judder and move as smoothly as possible again plan your shot route focusing points etc before moving off 11 in small rooms or spaces toilets bathrooms caves etc use of high camera angle from corner will give the maximum coverage of the area 12 high camera angles are also useful when separation of objects on similar plains is required 13 aim for quality not quantity lot of ground can be covered with few wellplanned shots unnecessarily repeating or prolonging shots will only bore or confuse and wont enhance the evidential value of the video 14 think like an editor as

health block is constructed in two sections the front nonacute section has 22 cells that have been modified with additional safety considerations to house detainees on behavioral healthcare service that are c linically stable but because of their mental illness andor limited coping skills are at increased risk of selfh arm and are more difficult to manage in the general population the rear section delta acute houses detainees who are at imminent risk of rious selfharm suicide or require seclusion or restraint to regain internal control under medical supervision the section has nine acute cells four restraint cells and two seclusion cells nurses station two secure restraint monitoring rooms and two secure interview areas have also been constructed video monitoring is available for all cells in the delta acute section and in the passageway lockable sally port style door covered with thick plexiglass divides the block this door can be closed to control the flow of traffic to reduce noise level and control communication between acute and nonacute detainees this door will be locked only in the most extreme of emergencies ramp was constructed on the side of the facility for the ease of removing detainee by litter this ramp slopes both the front and r ear of the block and accesses side door the side door is lockable and is used as general accessegress point from the nonacute section near the middle of the facility the facility is also equipped with rear sally port this gate accesses the deadzone around delta mhf and allows access to the block via sally port 4 the rear gate is intended for ranking officers and dignitaries to minimize detainee contact while still allowing access to the facility this gate is for emergency dignitary and ranking officers only and general daytoday operational use would take away for its intended purpose the green wind screening has been doubled to reduce the ability of detainee to see into the dead zone camp delta sop will

guard staff and remaining psychiatric technician will exercise additional vigilance in detainee observation during this time c while mass suicide attempt may occur anywhere in the camp detainees housed in the delta unit may be at higher risk due to the potential severity of their illness eg psychosis or the reckless or planned actions due to severe personality disorder the immediate action plan for mass suicide attempt will be to sweep from one end of the unit to the other and secure the extremities of detainees engaged in imminent self harm behaviors with flexi cuff restraints to points of their cells that would prevent acute acts of suicide this is done as quickly as possible however the safety of the guard and medical staff is paramount as these coordinated behaviors may also indicate clandestine pl an to overpower staff the jdog s3 will ensure that adequate flexi cuff restraints are readily available for this contingency d in the event of crisismass casualty on delta

distress then directing mp teams to the appropriate detainee cell 6 the block nco utilizes oc to stop detainees engaged in imminent selfharm behavior 7 mp team enters the cell with flexicuff

severe mental illnesses that require an increased level of monitoringcare detainees at increased risk for self injurious behavior and those detainees whose behavior is so maladaptive as to cr eate significant disturbance if housed in the general or segregated housing units b the sections guard force provides security and first line observation of detainees with ready back up of behavioral health staff detainees who are at particularly high risk of selfharm eg detainees who have had repeated suicide attempts or detainees who have just returned from the acute section will have their cells marked with red tag the purpose of the red tag is to alert guard and behavioral health staff of detainees to be particularly observant of and have lower threshold for further inquiry these individuals can or have demonstrated propensity to be very secretive or resourceful in their attempts to do self harm during times of crisis or other times of potential distraction particular attention to cells marked with red tags is paramount during these times of crisis the delta block nco will verbally and immediately assign either guard to assume the responsibility of monitoring cells with red tags or task the unit nurse or unit psychiatric technician to immediately assign behavioral healthcare staff member to this task c cells with red tags will not have sheets large shower type towels will be provided only for shower purposes and will under circumstances be allowed inside any cells detainees assigned to delta mhf both acute and nonacute are issued small hand towels for use in their cells these restrictions should help guard and behavioral health staff to quickly identify highrisk detainees who have these unauthorized and potentially dangerous items in their cell d behavioral health staff will conduct visual check of detainees housed with red tags every two hours and document the detainees activity utilizing the high risk observation form when the guard force is not able to redirect detainee from behavior that is potentially selfinjurious unclassifiedfor official use only camp delta sop 1 march 2004 unclassifiedfor official use only 303 eg head banging or scratching or creating significant disturbance the guard force will contact the unit psychiatric technician or unit nurse if the unit psychiatric technician is unable to redirect the detainee from potentially selfinjurious behavior the unit nurse will be notified 306 delta acute section and selfharm precautions the acute section is for those detainees at very high risk for selfharm and who require selfharm precautions detainee on selfharm precautions is at high risk for suicide or other selfinjury they may suffer from poor selfcontrol or lack of coping abilities they often deal poorly with anger and stress many try to manipulate others and their environment by threats of suicide and selfharm they often engage in threats or actual selfinjurious behavior threats or actual harm toward others antisocial and aggressive behaviors and inappropriate sexual behaviors their behavior can be dramatic and highly unpredictable the risk with these detainees is varying degrees of self injurious behaviors including suicide only behavioral healthcare providers nurses and psychiatric technicians or another credentialed medical provider can order selfharm precautions only credentialed behavioral healthcare providers can discontinue selfharm precautions b detainees placed on selfharm precautions will be transferred into an acute cell on the delta acute unit if space is not available the detainee will be placed into restraint cell if restraint cell is not available the detainee will be placed on co nstant observation in cell 1 or 22 of the delta nonacute section c selfharm precautions w ill be in effect until the detainee is clinically stable as determined by credentialed provider and safe to return to less restrictive environment d detainees who are on selfharm precautions that are scheduled for interrogation will have their clinical status and risk assessment verified by the licensed behavioral health staff prior to leaving the block detainees on selfharm pr ecautions are
