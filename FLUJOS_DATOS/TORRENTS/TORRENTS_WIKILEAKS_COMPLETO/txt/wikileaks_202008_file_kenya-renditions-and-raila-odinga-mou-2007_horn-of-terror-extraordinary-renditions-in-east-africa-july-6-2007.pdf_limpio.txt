rep0707page 4 of 51the kenya governments culpability in the extra ordinary renditions incommunicado detention and dissapearance of over 100 people report june 25 2007 summary muslim human rights forum mhrf researched tracked and documented the arrests and detention in kenya and subsequent rendition to somalia and ethiopia of at least 100 people rounded up in early 2007 after the december 2006january2007 fresh eruption of fighting in war ravaged somalia the forum has publicized its findings and shared them with partners around the world with the result of the exposure of one of the largest episodes of extraordinary renditions of prisoners in the war on terror the forum is concerned that despite the revelations the fate of majority of these prisoners remains under very dark cloud as only between 24 and 37 of them may have been released so far with official disclosures of the actual number and identities of those released or the captives still in custody by either the ethiopian authorities or their partners in the renditions to wit the kenyan somali or united states authorities worse the whereabouts of some of those said to have been released remains mystery mhrf is duly concerned with reports of torture during interrogation of the captives lack of access by lawyers consular officials families or international monitors despite numerous pleas to the detaining authorities by various concerns around the world more disturbing is the announcement that some of mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 5 of 51them were facing undisclosed charges before military courts which are out of public visibility and whose procedures are unknown in legal processes the ethiopian government has admitted only having held 41 prisoners whom it referred to as suspected terrorists giving rise to perturbing speculation about the fate of the rest even when credible reports have revealed the presence in the country of hundreds of prisoners rounded up following the ethiopian invasion of neighboring somalia these included the ones like the group in question who were rounded up in neighboring kenya as they fled the fighting or those who were taken up as prisoners of war inside somalia and many others caught inside ethiopia itself the mhrf documentation covered 152 persons nationals of 21 countries all arrested inside kenya between january 2 31 2007 of these 30 were either released in kenya or repatriated to their home countries and four were charged in court four others are yet to be accounted for while the rest were said to have been deported according to the mhrf data 117 were rendered to somalia and later on to ethiopia on diverse dates in january and february 2007 and at least one extra ordinary rendition to the us military detention facility at guantanamo bay in cuba took place further rendition to the same facility occurred in june although it has not been clearly ascertained where exactly the subject was held prior to that the nationalities involved included kenyan us british french canadian swedish ethiopian eritrean tunisian omani yemeni rwandese tanzanian saudi united arab emirates sudanese ugandan syrian comoros moroccan and jordanian mhrf is most dismayed by the conduct of the kenya government in the whole affair from the capture to the deportation of the prisoners and thereafter its denial of due process to the captives and basic rights such as access to legal counsel consular representation family doctors or international monitors holding most of them including children and expectant women incommunicado and beyond the legally permissible periods before rendering them to countries where they feared harm without recourse to national or international law the kenya government not only facilitated the invasion of somalia by ethiopian forces who launched their forays from within kenyan territory but also gave active support to us and ethiopian intelligence and security personnel in the operation mounted on both sides of the border to capture those fleeing the fighting this enabled the ethiopian ground forces to rout the erstwhile union of mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 6 of 51islamic courts uic fighters with the aid of us aerial bombardments that resulted in heavy civilian casualties to keep the hundreds of refugees away the kenya government officially closed the border with somalia on january 3 those who managed to cross into kenya to seek refuge were rounded up put on trucks and dumped inside somalia as the fighting raged close to 200 others were detained at police precincts near border points after some initial screening before eventually being airlifted to nairobi it is from among these captives the extraordinary renditions took place the captives some with visible injuries and others evidently very ill were shuffled blindfolded and shackled most times at night around police stations in and around nairobi garissa malindi and mombasa to evade scrutiny after being arrested near the border points of liboi kiunga hulugo and mandera during their incarceration they were interrogated by among others foreign security agents including those of the united states who witnesses said were in charge of the operation raising serious questions of kenyas sovereignty perhaps most diabolical for the kenyan government was its role in the rendition to somalia of at least twenty kenyans alongside the detained foreigners and the extraordinary rendition of the kenyan sent to guantanamo bay these were followed by the governments stringent denial of the facts despite overwhelming evidence in the public domain the forum authoritatively established that all captives rendered from kenya to somalia were within few days in turn rendered to ethiopia in whose jails they have languished ever since even after bowing to pressure and finally admitting in parliament to having deported 96 aliens and producing flight manifests in court as proof of lacking any more jurisdiction in the matter the government refused to give adequate disclosure about the kenyans or the other nationalities and where and when they were held and rendered lending fuel to all manner of speculation on the subject the flight manifests obtained by mhrf during hearing of 34 habeas corpus applications the forum had filed in the high court on behalf of the detainees listed 85 prisoners rendered in three night flights on january 20 january 27 and february 10 respectively in all the three flights top kenya police officers were in charge of the escort detail mhrf heard independent evidence of other persons besides those in these flights having been handed over directly to ethiopian authorities the veil of mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 7 of 51secrecy the silence and denials without giving full frank and public disclosures may have at worse aided in the disappearance of an unknown number of people and in the least brought about so much confusion and anxiety it is for instance not clear how many suspected members of both the oromo liberation front olf and the ogaden national liberation front onlf caught in the moyale and mandera areas respectively were rendered to ethiopia after crossing into kenya during the fighting in somalia in early january the captives whose numbers were given by various sources as having been between 4070 were said to have been handed over directly to the ethiopians despite their being considered insurgents by the latter handing over that is contrary to the geneva convention on the treatment of victims of war it is noteworthy that some of these suspected rebels could have been kenyan nationals with common ancestry across the border even with the varying figures gathered it has been the mhrfs well founded conclusion that at least 100 people were rendered figure independently confirmed further the forum has so far gathered proof of kenyan citizenship of about eighteen of the detainees in ethiopia at the end of may evidence was furnished the kenya government after it demanded for substantiation even where the burden of that proof rested on the government due to obvious limitations the forum could not verify the nationalities of others caught in the theatre of the massive operation who were said to have been kenyans the forum was unable to establish the nationalities of 30 of the detainees who had been held in the country there were also unconfirmed claims that some were kenyans mhrf found that the identification documents of all the captives had been confiscated by the investigating police officers in nairobi this aggravated the danger these people faced of being rendered stateless as kenya continued to deny them after initial discussions about the fate of the kenyans rendered to ethiopia the government abandoned efforts to seek their return while other countries put pressure on the ethiopians to release their citizens in the meantime the current status of most of the prisoners is difficult to find out because the complicity of the kenyan ethiopian and somali governments in the renditions has made them most intransigent to deal with while other countries individually sought justice for their citizens majority of those remaining in custody are not surprisingly nationals of the three countries as we were finalizing this report eight detainees 5 of them kenyans were said to have been released from addis ababa and handed over to kenyan mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 8 of 51authorities at the border in moyale while two tanzanians were repatriated back home and set free the whereabouts of the kenyans remained unknown as neither did they get home nor did the government acknowledge receiving them the kenya police denied knowledge of the handing over at least one officially registered refugee rwandese ibrahim clement muhibitabo was repatriated from addis ababa to kigali despite having sought refuge in kenya where he lived on an aliens pass in nairobi with his wife and three children he was promptly jailed on being returned to rwanda the country he had fled fears that he could be harmed were very real such could be the fate of many others who it is believed had been registered as refugees and were residing in refugee camps in kenya and elsewhere when they were arrested worse could be the destiny of the eritreans the oromo and ogadenis who were handed over to the ethiopians despite the well known hostility between the latter government and the three lots according to one of the released tanzanians mohamed abushir salim only 4 detainees remained at the facility in which they were held in addis ababa after they were taken out on may 31 2007 those remaining included kenyan salim awadh salim ayub sfaxi tunisian on permanent french residents permit yemeni and another whose names were not given if indeed the facility held all the 41 detainees the ethiopians officially acknowledged then it would appear that 37 people had so far been released and that more than 70 others had disappeared since they were rendered from kenya most worrying inference indeed mhrf had prior to those releases ascertained that 24 had been freed and their whereabouts were known however it is the forums well considered contention that the circumstances of all these people those said to have been released and those who seem to have disappeared are well within the purview of the three collaborating states kenya somalia and ethiopia who with the us must be held culpable the trail of arbitrary arrests detention without trial torture and illegal deportations the forum managed to interview several of the detainees and with the guarantee of maintaining their anonymity with number of security officers involved at some stages of the detentions at some instances mhrf even ran into foreign security personnel as they did the rounds of some facilities in which the captives were held mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 9 of 51in some police stations mhrf gathered evidence from the police occurrence books ob in which the suspects were booked by officers from either the anti terrorism police unit atpu or the criminal investigations department cid two of the various units of the kenya police force that collaborated with other security organs in the operation however neither the atpu nor the cid agreed to speak officially to mhrf and together with the police headquarters to which the forum was frequently referred they denied knowledge of any arrests choosing instead to take questioners round and round the various police formations mhrf trailed the movements of the 152 captives from various points of arrests to several police stations in nairobi and its suburbs and documented their complaints of denial of their legal and human rights and the conditions they were held in violation of national and international standards at the police stations mhrf was told of orders from above and from the atpu that the inmates should not be seen by anyone the forum witnessed the turning away of lawyers of some of the detainees and officers of the kenya national commission on human rights knchr which has legal authority to enter police stations however the forum gained unofficial access to some detainees who granted it interviews which added up to the conclusions reached in this report and information shared with partners some detainees were found to be in dire need of medical help but had either been flatly denied or in the case of one expectant woman 27 year old tunisian ines chine who had bullet lodged in her body had been deprived of followup treatment the forums volunteers took medication to her and got doctor to see her husband adnan naja who had serious bout of malaria while in custody at ruai police station where assad bassam sousak from syria had his badly swollen foot treated by the same medic two of the four britons held hamza chentouf and shajahan janjua1 were both very ill while in custody at kileleshwa and hardy police stations respectively they were in need of urgent medical attention which had been denied by the police despite several attempts by mhrf to organize doctors visits chentouf had an infection in the ear that was oozing puss badly janjua had serious 1 the two with mohammed ezzoueck and reza afsharzadagen were eventually released after being flown to baidoa upon the intervention of the british government mhrf

police station where he had been held with his three children including six month old baby was denied medical attention until he was deported to huston texas to stand trial on terrorism charges those finally renditioned were held at ruai jomo kenyatta international airport the kenya ports authoritys inland container deport and gigiri police stations other police stations included spring valley kileleshwa kilimani hardy karen ongata rongai and langata all in nairobi others were at kiunga in lamu district garissa mandera malindi and the kilindini port police station in mombasa there were detainees mainly kenyans who were arrested and questioned at kasarani shauri moyo and ngong police stations before being released without charges in all 17 of the 154 were released by the kenya government eight others the 4 from the uk and the american with his three children were repatriated to their countries only four cases were taken to court of which three were dismissed and one is still pending besides the 34 habeas corpus applications the mhrf took to the high court in nairobi 6 others were filed in mombasa by families of kenyan detainees where the high court gave orders for their production however the state defied the orders releasing only one salmin mohamed khamis before the ultimatum given by the court elapsed two others fatuma ahmed abdurahman and her 4year old daughter hafsa swaleh ali were released days later following campaign by human rights groups focusing on the child the other two said khamis mohamed and salim awadh salim were rendered to mogadishu on january 27 as the matter was still in court contempt of court proceedings thereafter initiated against the commissioner of police and the commandant of the antiterror police unit are yet to be finalized the state issued deportation orders for two omani citizens businessman ahmed musallam almaashaani and his omani police bodyguard hassan salim kashub after habeas corpus proceedings for their production in court had began they were promptly flown to muscat but their united arab emirates interpreter tuweil kamilya mohamed alkindi was in bizarre move ordered deported to somalia which the state claimed was her country of origin and even referred to her as man in the deportation order after an unsuccessful attempt to take her to tanzania through which the trio had come to kenya on business trip mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 11 of 51their kenyan host milly muthoni gakuo with whom they had been arrested at hotel in malindi was released from police custody at 3am 18 days after their arrest kamilya was rendered to mogadishu on january 27 on february 7 she was amongst other detainees taken to addis ababa where she remained in custody and was interrogated by american agents until she was released on march 23 arriving home in dubai on march 25 mhrf realized the futility of its cases and dropped its quest for the habeas corpus writs on march 28 after the state had produced the 3 flight manifests and argued that the subjects were out of the kenyan courts jurisdiction even though the renditions took place while the matter lay in court constitutional application in respect of canadian citizen bashir ahmed maktal was still pending at the high court in nairobi when he was rendered to ethiopia amir mohamed mishal of the united states was severally taken out of his cell at kileleshwa police station by american agents in diplomatic cars and taken to hotel for interrogation mhrf witnessed him being brought back from one such session on february 5 in us embassy vehicle registration number 29cd389k according to mhrf field reports he confirmed that the individuals who had brought him were from the fbi who had collected him for interrogation he also informed mhrf that he had been taken to hotel somewhere in the city where he was interrogated in hotel room he was informed that he was in lawless country and had rights to legal representation therefore the fbi asked him to confess to links with qaeda or they would send him to mogadishu he further reported that he was shown photos of people they said he knew or had met in somalia at military camp allegedly terrorist training camp after denying any knowledge of alqaeda and involvement with terrorism the fbi threatened him with torture and was given day to make up his mind the following day 6th february 2007 the interrogators asked him who the visitors mhrf team were and what their business was during the visit on 6th mr meshal reports that they were very friendly2 mohammad ezzouek similarly told

somalia and be left at the mercy of the tfg and the ethiopian army3 during fact finding mission to kiunga in lamu district on february 5 local people talked of foreign security personnel being involved in the hunt on the kenyan side of the border for people fleeing the fighting in somalia4 detainee safia benaouda sweden on being released from custody in ethiopia claimed her party had been shot at and arrested by white soldiers after crossing into kenya around the liboi area5 below is an excerpt of news report in the swedish media6 benaouda said three men in us uniforms led the kenyan troops who detained her and other women and children fleeing somalia on jan 18 benaouda had traveled to somalia with her fiancé munir awad swedish citizen of lebanese descent the couple was separated when they tried to leave the country after the ethiopian military intervention in december benaouda said she was captured on the border along with group of women and children as they tried to cross into kenya the soldiers shot woman in the group she told the paper but didnt give details they were brought to nairobi and then returned to somalia blindfolded and handcuffed before being transferred to prison in the ethiopian capital addis ababa she said the woman referred to above ines chine tunisia who was with benaouda claimed during interviews with mhrf while in police custody at jkia that she had been shot by kenyan security personnel in the company of white people 3 ibid4 khurinet kiunga mission report5 reprieve and cagedprisoners reports safia benouda transcripts6 fri 13 apr 2007 124030 mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 13 of 51according to the interviews the renditions were conducted in most inhumane manner with the captives blindfolded feet shackled and handcuffed to their backs fatma ahmed chande tanzania who the mhrf interviewed on 18th may 2007 at her parents home in moshi after being released from ethiopia said they were ordered to kneel on the runway at the jomo kenyatta international airport at 3 am while it was drizzling it was so chilly and drizzling we were bundled onto pick ups and driven to the runway i saw very many people including women kneeling the lady called tuweil kamilya uae was sitting down crying the men were blindfolded and had their hands handcuffed behind their backs their feet were chained i was led to the group of women and ordered to kneel there too an armed man came to and pulled down my headscarf to cover my eyes as had been done the other women there were many children some were crying loudly the men had black hoods covering their heads we stayed kneeling there for quite some time till our knees ached we were then taken up to the plane still blindfolded i could however see through my headscarf as it was of light materialit was very scaring cold and wet7 fatma had been arrested together with her kenyan husband salim awadh salim who remained behind in custody in ethiopia other spouses were also held together as in the case of benauoda who was with her swedish husband mounir awad another swede osman ahmed yassin was recently released from addis ababa but his wife and three children were left behind presumably because they had been living in sweden on residents permits and were not full swedish citizens in most instances spouses were used to subtly pressurize one another to yield to the demands of the interrogators halima badroudine hussein of the comoros was rendered with her three children to extract information from her on the activities of her fugitive husband fazul abdullah mohamed who is wanted for allegedly masterminding the bombing of the us embassies in nairobi and daressalaam in 1998 before her release and return to the comoros she and her children had endured lot of interrogation both in kenya and ethiopia safia benaouda said of halimas interrogation in ethiopia after few weeks they started to interrogate halima she was really destroyed after that they took her for interrogation several times week they would take her around fajr and keep her there until night time sometimes her children went with her she told us that interrogating her were americans french italians swiss israelis british and later on libyans she had lived in pakistan before and the pakistanis also came to interrogate her in ethiopia8 7 mhrf fatma chande interview moshi 1904078 caged prisoners safia benaouda interview mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 14 of 51 prison conditions are appalling according to benaouda the prisoners were held in specially built dark metal cages without proper sanitation about eight chickenwire cages were built whilst we were there there was proper light in this prison there were some windows but they were locked and covered with bars to leave only small opening there were metal covering on it so light roof had bit of light coming through mattresses to sleep on the toilet was horrible always full and outside they had built some new metal cages where the men were each kept alone i could see my husband mounir in his cage there was one room for women the swedish men were kept there in those cages all the time they were there permanently other men were being taken in or out but the swedish were always there in little cages there was some light in little cages they had to open the door to eat twice day i was in separate room so i could not speak to mounir there were ethiopian guards walking around all the time9 from evidence gathered from the released detainees they were tortured to confess to either being terrorists or associating with known terrorists apart from the psychological torture there was physical torture including beatings with some ending up severely wounded the beatings took place in kenya and ethiopia say the former detainees fatma ahmed chande claimed kenyan interrogator had threatened to strangle her as he squeezed her head on table while benaouda said she had seen strangulation marks on her husbands neck he was beaten in kenya and ethiopia she added at least four babies were born in detention in ethiopia included baby boy to ines chine and adnan naja on the day they were released dozen women were found to be expectant while in custody in ethiopia kenyan halima hashim abdulrahman who was pregnant when she was released in kenya in february gave birth to baby boy as we were completing this account continuing arrests and detentions it is further disturbing that these arbitrary arrests have been going on particularly in mombasa where very ignominious patterns have lately emerged on march 31 2007 heavily armed policemen cordoned off whole residential area at kongowea and harassed every one in sight as they sought terrorists after ransacking houses and terrorizing innocent people including women and children they arrested two people who they questioned for six hours before releasing them without charges according to one of the two arrested there were americans present during the interrogation10 9 cage prisoners safia benaouda interviews 10 mhrf interview with salmin khamis mohamed upon his release after being arrested at kongowea 1407 mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 15 of 51and in perhaps the most atrocious of these recent arrests 11 people including an 80 year old man and school boy aged 14 were arrested after late night orgy of lawlessness by the antiterror police unit at guraya in mombasa on the night of april 2425 2007 after cordoning off the area and blocking the adjacent jomo kenyatta highway the heavily armed hooded security men proceeded to break down doors and parade undressed families in the rains at 3am as the officers had field day helping themselves to cash and valuables they found in the houses 10 out of the 11 were released the following day without being charged and returned to their traumatized families the remaining person ibrahim salim obeidilla was deported to the comoros despite his family having obtained court order barring the state from so doing until habeas corpus application for his production had been determined there were further arrests late may reminiscent of these earlier ones in which one was brought to court and at least one other person was deported to the comoros explaining the deportations immigration minister gideon konchellah claimed the two islamic religious teachers deported had been implicated in the 1998 bombings and were therefore taken back to their country he did not say why they were not charged with the grave offences it is noteworthy that as the crackdown continued the state strongly defended the actions of the antiterrorism police unit and defied court orders issued in accordance with kenyan law the state has continued issuing statements that cannot withstand serious scrutiny labeling the victims of the harassments and illegal actions as terrorists or their accomplices without offering proof or subjecting them to due process this has emboldened the security personnel to act with impunity and go step further to carry out acts that are pertinently criminal like the thefts reported in the guraya raid kenya has argued that the presence of refugees from the conflict in somalia was threat to its national security and hence the reason for closing its border and ordering the return of refugees back to somalia actions that ran counter to both the international and national refugee laws and the principle of non refoulment that prohibits the return of persons to countries in which they fear harm more mention should be made of the rendition to the guantanamo bay concentration camp abdulmalik mohamed kenyan who had been arrested in mombasa island in midfebruary was after month in police custody in mombasa and nairobi flown to the us military detention becoming the first detainee rendered there since december 2004 the us department of defense mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 16 of 51claimed in statement released on march 26 that abdulmalik had admitted to being involved in terrorist attacks in east africa11 according to the statement malik has admitted to participation in the 2002 paradise hotel attack in mombasa kenya in which an explosivefilled suv was crashed into the hotel lobby killing 13 and injuring 80 he also has admitted to involvement in the attempted shoot down of an israeli boeing 757 civilian airliner carrying 271 passengers near mombasa abdulmalik had been held incommunicado at the kilindini port police station in mombasa and later at the ongata rongai and hardy police stations in nairobi in brief chat mhrf managed to have with him at the latter facility on february 23 he said he had been held on his return from somalia and appealed for help mhrf managed to locate his family in nairobi and mombasa the kenya government which like the american embassy in nairobi denied that abdulmalik was kenyan did not say why he had not been charged with the criminal offences in kenya and instead was taken to guantanamo bay where the us holds people it claims are enemy combatants caught during fighting with america the two governments did not say where and how the alleged admissions were made granted that the detainee had not been accorded his right to counsel nor had any due process been observed this rendition like all the others the arrests detentions interrogations and indeed the entire operation not only had all the hallmarks of close collaboration between kenya and the us but was ample evidence of how much of its sovereignty the country had ceded to the american government the same is noted of ethiopia the third partner besides the somali transitional federal government tfg in this phase of the war on terror it was illustration enough of how much human rights and the rule of law had been put aside in the united states prosecution of its war giving advantage to these two nations of the horn of africa in their internal conflicts conclusions from the above exercise of tracking and documenting the arrests and extra ordinary renditions mhrf has reached several conclusions and observations mhrf notes the following 11 us dept of defense news release 34307 of march 26 2007 mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 17 of 51a it is now evidently clear that kenya actively participated and aided in illegal renditions or expulsions in violation of national and international law b in its actions kenya acted contrary to the provisions of article 9 of the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr which kenya ratified in 1976 that prohibits arbitrary detention c whereas incommunicado detention may violate iccpr article 7 kenya police both the regular and the antiterrorism police unit engaged in an apparent policy of holding individuals detained in connection to the somalia crisis in incommunicado detention with regard to the legal procedures underway in respect to several of these individuals in the kenyan courts the court orders of the kenyan judiciary or the standards embodied in the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr prohibiting torture and illtreatment and providing safeguards for persons deprived of their liberty d in addition dozens of individuals were held in police stations and other detention facilities in and around nairobi for several weeks long exceeding the standard 24 hour period for detention without charge and even the 14 day limit provided for pretrial detention for capital offenses under kenyan law f most of the foreign detainees were denied visitation by consular officials while in detention in the country although in the same period they were interrogated by several individuals from the kenyan antiterrorism police unit as well as by people believed to be from security services of other countries g at the time of their deportation several individuals were the subject of habeas corpus applications in the kenyan courts this was clearly in circumvention of the due process h kenya clearly went against the principle of nonrefoulment when it sent the detainees back to somalia the country from which they were fleeing and facilitated their being rendered to ethiopia which most feared would harm them article 3 of the convention against torture which kenya ratified in 1997 states that state party shall expel return refoul or extradite person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture j kenya may have willfully rendered its own citizens stateless serious violation of international law by deporting them and others legally residing in kenya to somalia without any judicial procedure article 12 of the iccpr states that one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 18 of 51k kenya continues to conduct illegal arrests and arbitrary detentions in the guise of fighting terrorism as is evidenced by recent raids in mombasa arrests which are carried out without observance of procedures and limits established by national and international law recommendations and appeals the muslim human rights forum is of the strongest conviction that the kenya government is primarily responsible for the violations and disregard of both the international and national law the disregard for the human and legal rights of the detainees their continued illegal incarceration and all the suffering they were occasioned by the arbitrary arrests and illegal deportations sharing culpability are the ethiopian and the federal transitional governments of somalia both of who actively participated in the illegal actions mhrf also holds the government of the usa culpable for the same actions as it participated at every stage and indeed seemed to have been firmly in charge of the operations even if behind the scenes it is therefore pertinent that the following appeals and recommendations be directed at the four governments as outlined below i mhrf calls on the kenya government to undertake immediate efforts to secure the prompt return to kenya of those kenyan nationals who have been illegally deported as well as those foreign nationals who were kenyan residents ii we also urge the kenyan government to publicly and privately call on the government of ethiopia and the transitional federal government of somalia to immediately acknowledge individuals detained in their respective countries and permit international access by diplomatic representatives and independent monitors such as the icrc iii mhrf also urges the kenya government to publicly and privately call on the us government to return abdulmalik mohamed from guantanamo bay to kenya to be charged under kenyan law with the criminal offences he is alleged to have committed further we urge the kenya government to call upon the us government to immediately close down the concentration camp and take the detainees before courts or tribunals recognized by international law iv the kenyan government must make full frank and public disclosure regarding the identities and location of all foreign and kenyan prisoners in mhrf horn of terror rep0707page 19 of 51its custody or transferred to
