campaign reform act of 2002 bcra1 regulates federal election activity which is defined to include 1 voter registration drives in the last 120 days of federal election 2 voter identification getoutthe vote drives gotv and generic activity in connection with an election in which federal candidate is on the ballot 3 public communications that refer to clearly identified federal candidate and promote support attack or oppose that candidate regardless of whether the communications expressly advocate vote for or against candidate and 4 services by state or local party employee who spends at least 25 of paid time per month on activities in connection with federal election 2 feca further defines public communications as broadcast cable satellite newspaper magazine outdoor advertising facility mass mailing or telephone bank communications made to the general public or any other form of general public political advertising 3 as result candidate and party committees can only use regulated federal funds to pay for such federal election activity regulated federal funds also known as hard money are funds that are subject to fecas contribution limitations source restrictions and reporting requirements4 g21g145g138g162g156g561g159g495g561g8g7g5g561 shortly after enactment of the bcra amendments to feca in 2002 the fec promulgated regulations that exempted internet communications from federal campaign finance regulation altogether by excluding such communications from the definition of public communication5 in response the two primary sponsors of bcra in the house of representatives representatives shays and meehan filed suit in us district court against the fec in seeking to invalidate the regulations the plaintiffs argued inter alia that by not regulating internet activities the fec was opening new avenue for circumvention of federal campaign finance law contrary to congresss intent in enacting bcra in 2004 in shays v fec 6 the us district court for the district of 1 httpwwwcongressgovcgilisbdque ryrd107fld0021107155 2002 2 2 usc 43120 3 2 usc 43122 4 see 11 cfr 3002k 5 the term public communication shall not include communications over the internet 11 cfr 10026 2005 the fec also determined that internet communications should not be considered electioneering communications which is specific type of broadcast cable or satellite adver tising according to the fec the internet is included in the list of exceptions in the final rules in section 10029c1 because in most instances it is not broadcast cable or satellite communication bcras legislative history establishes congresss intent to exclude communications over the internet from the electioneering communication provisions the commission concludes that congress did not seek to regulate the internet in subtitle of title ii of bcr the relatively few commenters who opposed the internet exemption did not disagree with this conclusion rather they argued that as the internet develops aspects of it might come to be used in manner like radio or television to thes commenters this potential evolution of the internet calls for more precise approach and makes the exemption as proposed too broad treatment of this issue the commission has decided to include the exemption in the final rules ra ther than attempt to craft regulation that responds to unknown future developments

fecs initial regulations governing political communications on the internet the shays court held that excluding all internet communications from the fec rule defining public communication at 11 cfr 10026 was inconsistent with congresss use of the phrase or any other form of general public political advertising in the bcra definition of public communication further the court found that the fec had failed to provide legislative history that would persuade the court to ignore the plain meaning of the statute 7 while not all internet communications fall within the phrase any other form of general public political advertising the court observed that some clearly do8 however the court left it to the fec to determine precisely what constitutes general public political advertising in the context of the internet9 furthermore while the court specifically upheld the definition of generic campaign activity as public communication it found that the fec s 2002 notice of proposed rulemaking nprm failed to provide adequate notice to the public under the administrative procedure act apa that the fec might establish such definition as the court noted it could not fathom how an interested party could have anticipated the final rulemaking from the draft rule 10 the shays court also found that the fec rule exempting internet communications from the definition of public communications meant that matter how closely such communications are coordinated with political parties or candidate campaigns they cannot be considered coordinated communications and hence subject to feca regulation 11 as the court observed it has long been tenet of campaign finance law that in order to prevent circumvention of regulation feca treats expenditures that are made in cooperation consultation or concert with or at the suggestion of candidate as contribution to such candidate12 according to the court the exclusion of internet communications from coordinated communications contrasts with prior fec rules and was contrary to congresss intent in enacting the statute13 the court remanded the case for further action consistent with its decision14

seeking comment on its proposal to amend the definition of public communication to conform to the ruling 15 in its nprm the fec requested comments on proposed rules to include paid internet

contribution and expenditure for certain internet activities and communications that would qualify as individual volunteer activity or that would qualify for th press exemption according to the fec the proposed rules were intended to ensure that political committees properly finance and disclose their internet communications without impeding individual citizens from using the internet to speak freely regarding candidates and elections eg blogging the comment period closed and public hearing was held in june 2005 and in anticipation of congressional action the fec delayed consideration of the internet regulations however with congressional action being uncertain in march 2006 the fec voted unanimously to approve the new regulations in so doing the commissioners cited the 2004 shays v fec federal district court decision as requiring them to take such action g21g158g150g150g138g155g162g561g152g143g561g20g142g144g158g149g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 generally the internet regulations reflect an attempt by the fec to leave blogs created and wholly maintained by individuals free of feca regulation so long as such services are not performed for fee as stated in its nprm while drafting proposed rule the commission recognized the important purpose of bcra in preventing actual and apparent corruption and the circumvention of the act as well as the plain meaning of general public political advertising and the significant public policy considerations that encourage the promotion of the internet as unique forum for free or lowcost speech and open information exchange the commission was also mindful that there is record that internet activities present any significant danger of corruption or the appearance of corruption nor has the commiss ion seen evidence that its 2002 definition of public communication has led to circumvention of the law or fostered corruption internet advertising on another persons website as public communication but otherwise sought to exclude all internet communications from the definition of public communication 16 the regulations apply only when money is exchanged for internetrelated campaign advertisements accordingly the funds expended for such advertisements are subject to the limitations source restrictions and reporting requirements of feca key aspects of the fec regulations include the following regulation of paid internet ads as public communications the definition of public communication includes paid internet ads placed on another individual or entitys website as form of general public political advertising with dollar threshold required the advertiser not the website operator is considered to be making the public communication accordingly the fees for such ads are subject to feca contribution limits source restrictions and disclosure requirements17 disclaimer requirements disclaimers statements of attribution are required on all political committee websites available to the public as public 16
