removed from the united st ates for variety of reasons such as entering into the country unlawfully overs taying visa or committing crime prior to removal however aliens usually have access to removal hearing or some other form of adjudication that determines whether an alien is subject to removal if the removal hearing results in an order to re move an alien from the country the alien may have recourse to seek administrativ review of the removal order assuming after administrative review that the removal order becomes administratively final even further judicial review by an article iii court may be warranted however even though judicial review of ad ministratively final removal or ders is generally available there are many exceptions to this general rule that depend on the facts and circumstances of the removal conseque ntly there is now convoluted skein of decisional law construing these exceptions working in conjunction with the already labyrinthine statutory regime governing judicial review this report shall attempt to wend way through this jurisdictional thicket by focusing on the procedural mechanisms used to initiate judicial review and the reach of an article iii courts jurisdiction to review removal order discussion concerning the procedures underlying removal hearin gs and administrative review is limited to their relation to judicial review and will not be

usc 1252d1begins the judicial review proce ss in the federal district courts3 subsequently in 1961 congress replaced apa review of depor tation orders with the petition for review offered by the hobbs act preex isting law that expedites judicial review by bypassing the district courts and placing review directly in the federal courts of appeals the antiterrorist and effective death penalty act aedpa enacted in 1996 recodified the petition for revi ew mechanism in ina section 2424 hobbs act the ina is the primary source for the bulk of the federal immigration laws including the substantive law involving the removal of aliens unlawfully present within the united states however when outlining the procedural framework for the judicial review of removal orders the ina primarily references the framework of the hobbs act found in chapter 158 of title 28 of the us code5 the hobbs act which governs the judicial review of select group of administrative proceedings gives exclusive jurisdiction to review all final administrative orders under its purview to the fe deral courts of appeals6 this effectively channels most judicial review of removal orders to the courts of ppeals and bypasses review from the federal district courts7 the treatment of removal or ders however largely differs from other administrative orders under th hobbs act because the ina subjects removal orders to additi onal procedures and rules8 one significant departure from the hobbs act is that the ina expressly forb ids the court of appeal s to take additional evidence even if it finds the new evidence material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence before the agency9 others include changes in deadlines choice of venue and other procedural rules10 the petition for review the principal vehicle for judicial review is petition for review which must be filed in the circuit in which the removal hearing was held11 before petition for review can be filed an alien must

prior proceeding was inadequate to test the validity of the removal order14 assuming that there was exhaustion of available administrative remedies and the review is not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel the petition for review must then be filed later than 30 days after the date in which the removal order becomes administratively final15 the petition must also be served on the attorney general who is the respondent in this cau of action and on an officer or employee of the service in charge of the service di strict in which the final order of removal was entered which

the deadlines may not be extended except upon motion for good cause shown18 failure to file brief within the deadline will resu lt in the court dismissing the appeal unless manifest injustice would

automatically stayed when he files his petition for review20 rather the alien must file separate motion to move the court to order stay21 as matter of practice liens typically couple their petition for review with motions for stays of removal pending decision at least one circuit the ninth upon receipt of the moti on will grant temporary stay until it rules on the motion22 the substantive standard used to determine whether court should grant stay appears to vary by circuit the ninth circuit for example grants stay of removal if the alien s hows either 1 probability of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or 2 that serious legal questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in the petitioners favor23 most of the

standard of review is meant only to assess the reasonableness of the agency factfinding rather than its veracity the inquiry is whether there is such eviden ce as reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support conclusion30 although this standard is deferential and assumes the facts on the record are correct it still obligates the courts of appeals to consider the whole record including

administrative officials have the discretion to detain an alien while his removal from the united states is pending84 moreover court may set aside any action or decisionunder this section regarding the dete ntion or release of any alien or the grant revocation or nial of bond or parole85 although this provision purports to bar the court from setting aside any action or decision regarding detention the supreme court has held that federal habeas corpus action challenging the constitutional va lidity of provision mandating the detention of criminal alien while his removal is pending was not barred86 this was because where provision precluding review is claimed to bar beas review the court has required particularly clear statement that such is congress intent which this particular jurisdictionstripping provision lacked87 thus it appears that at minimum habeas review may still be available when the claim challenges the constitutionality of the detention although the real id act

questions of law are reviewable even if the underlying matter from which the constitutional claim or question of law arises is not this however provides an additional burden in the analysis namely ascertaining what distinguishes reviewable constitutional cl aim or question of law fro m nonreviewable question of fact while what constitutes constitutional claim may appear selfevident91 determining what constitutes question of law can be more difficult because ina section 242a2d preserve s judicial review of questions of law it also operates upon the other jurisd ictionstripping provisions of the ina by only excluding questions of fact from revi ew thus an important threshold issue court of appeals must resolve is whether the matter before it is question of law or fact questions of fact ar questions about the actual events surrounding the case92 questions of law on the other hand involve the application or in terpretation of the law93 initially the courts construed questions of law as only preserving jurisdiction to review statutory construction issues94 thus the courts only had jurisdiction to review how the administrative courts interpreted the meaning or scope of term in statutory provision the courts later reco gnized that questions of law was also meant to encompass the same types of issues that courts traditionally exercised in habeas review over executive detentions95 the courts came to this conclusion by analyzing the legislative history of the real id act which altered ina section 242a2d to allow review of constitu tional claims and questions of law96 the house conference report for the real id act indicates that congress sought to provide an adequate and effective substitute for habeas corpus97 purportedly this was because the supreme court had previously expressed some concern as to whether congress could constitutionally strip from courts habeas review of removal orders without implementin g an adequate replacement98 thus in order to provide an adequate replacement for habeas revi ew not only did ina section 242a2d preserve review of statutor construction but it also compassed review of

questions of fact and law100 in other words questions of law encompass statutory construction the use of an incorrect legal standard the articulation of the correct legal standard but the erroneous application of heighten ed legal standard and an unambiguous mischaracterization of the record101 it is important to note that these courts while recognizing ina section 242a2d preserves review of constitutional claims nd questions of law have also expressly refused to review claims that while characterized as questions of law consist of nothing more than quarrels over the correctness of factfinding and discretionary decisions102 mere assertion that the ij immigration judge and bia board of immigration appeals faile d to apply the law does not convert mere disagreement with the ijs factual findings and exercise of discretion into constitutional claim or question of law103 thus in the second circuit before determining whether claim is reviewable question of law the court must first look to the nature of the argument bein g advanced in the petition and determine whether the petition raises constitutional claims or questions of law or merely objects to the ijs factfinding or exercise of discretion104 the ninth circuit goes so far as to refuse to entertain mixed question of fact and law unless all of the underlying facts are undisputed105 an additional issue is whether ina

inquire into the cause for commitment reason for pretrial detention not pursuant to judicial process and 3 to inquire whether the committing court had proper jurisdiction114 recognizing the importance

suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion th public safety may require it115 later the federal government enacted the federal habeas co rpus statute in the judiciary act of 1789 which

the advent of the incorpora tion doctrine which found most of the provisions of the bill of rights to be appli cable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment fede ral habeas corpus evolved as vehicle to remedy convictions ma in violation of constitutional rights118 many provisions in ina section 242 expre ssly forbid the use of habeas corpus as vehicle to review removal orders fo r example ina secti on 242b9 states that all questions of law and fact includi ng interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions arising from an action taken to remove an alien shall be made available only upon judicial review of final order119 at first glance this provision would only seem to impose an administrative exhaustion requirement before review of constitutional or statutory violation affecting the removal process can commence however the statute also expressly prohibits the use of habeas corpus to obtain revi ew from federal district court120 similar provision ina section 242g prohibits the use of hab eas corpus and generally denies to all courts except as otherwise prescribed by ina section 242 jurisdiction to entertain claims arising from decision by the attorney general to commence proceedings adjudicate cases or execute removal orde rs against any alien under this act121 in addition all of the express jurisdictional bars also in clude express prohibitions of habeas corpus122 as discussed above ina s ection 242a2d preserve s the federal courts of appeals jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law123 these courts when exercising this jurisdicti on have viewed ina section 242a2d as means to consolidate issues traditionally dealt with by habeas corpus with those addressed by petition for review thereby channeling these habeas issues directly to the courts of appeals124 presumably this would serve to streamline the deportation process while still effectively maintainin g the substantive protections of habeas corpus125 the reason why congress sought to pr eserve habeas protections in the petition for review was because of concerns the supreme court voi ced in prior

jurisdiction to hear an aliens petition for habeas corpus notwithstanding statutory provision that indicated that aliens would not have access to habeas corpus in removal proceedings126 congress had passed series of ju risdictionstripping provisions that could have been interpreted to preclude either federal district court or federal court of appeals from reviewin g pure questions of law127 the court expressed concern that in light of the suspension cl ause of the us constitution statute that would entirely preclude review of pure question of law by any court would give rise to substantial constitutional questions128 the reason constitutional question would arise is because the suspension clause at minimum protects habeas corpus as it existed in 1789129 habeas corpus at its historical core served as means of reviewing the legality of executive dete ntion and could have encompassed challenging detentions based on errors of law including the erroneous application or interpretation of statutes130 the jurisdictionstripping provisions if read to deny habeas review of pure questions of law w ithout presenting an adequate substitute to review such questions could raise significant constitutional issues that would require closer look at whether hab eas corpus as it existed in 1789 could be used to review pure questions of law131 rather than begin this inqui ry the supreme court chose to exercise the constitutional avoidance doctrine and construed the jurisdictionstripping provisions to allow habeas review of pure stions of law as it felt that congress did not clearly express an intent to deprive aliens of habeas corpus132 as justice scalia noted this presented putative incongruity criminalaliens could get habeas review of their removals at least with regards to questions of law which includes district court review and ppellate review while noncriminal aliens would only get review directly from the court of appeals the court in reference to this argument stated that congress could remedy this incongruity by providing an adequate substitute for habeas corpus in the courts of appeals133 following this decision congress subsequently sought to respond to the st cyr decision by enacting the real id act which expressly eliminated habeas reviewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34444crs16 134 pl 10913 div b 106 119 stat 310 2005 the real id act see also ina 242a2 a5 b9

act congress explicitly referenced the holding in st cyr while explaining the habeasstripping provisions expressing belief that retaining habeas corpus for criminalaliens unnecessarily layed removal and created confusion in the federal courts135 congress by expressly ending habeas review of these removals believed that this would lead to less delay and greater fairness in the review process136 as response to the supreme courts concer n that there must be some adequate substitute for habeas review if recourse to federal habeas corpus is denied congress crafted its constitutional claims and questions of law exception to the otherwise broad jurisdictionstripping provisions it had enacted137 furthermore congress noted habeas corpus was still available for challenges to detentions that are independent of challenges to removal orders138 as it stands today the petition for re view appears to have replaced habeas corpus as the primary means to challenge removal order preserving review of constitutional claims and questions of w for all removal orders seems to have satisfied any suspension clause concerns from the courts of appeals who now routinely transfer petitions for habeas corpus into petition for review habeas corpus however still plays relatively small role in expedited removals since statutory provision expressly allows habeas corpus to be used as vehicle to determine
