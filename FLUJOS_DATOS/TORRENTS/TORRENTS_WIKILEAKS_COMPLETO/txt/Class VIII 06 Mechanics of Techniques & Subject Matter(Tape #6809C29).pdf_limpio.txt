6809c29 class viii tape 6 mechanics of techniques and subject matter thank you and so we come to lecture number six lecture number six and we still count very good twenty nine september ad 18 class viii course there are many things which i could take up tonight the org students did their first auditing today there were two well dones one apparent false auditing report and three oh my god how could yous and amongst these apparently somebody doesnt know why list is done list is done to bring about cognition on question well let give it an exact order cognition on the subject blowing to fn realization of the question blowing to fn or an item blowing to fn or processed or relisted as in remedy b going to fn and thosere the only reasons you do list and my god you dont do list to have complete list because as near as i can figure from this auditing report the list was being corrected on the basis that it was complete i dont give damn about complete list now lets take how an auditing question can blow up on subject the fellow says were now going to do pr pr 4 and the subject of this is source sources boombol fn by golly i did realize that that that thats is wrong yes its been wrong i havent really been recognizing that and the auditor says if the auditor is one of these ones that you drop six pence in or penny in or depending what country youre in he goes on and says uh i havent done my job and the knucklehead will then try to clear the questions try to run the session and the ta will go up up up up up there is such case folder right in your case folder collection it blew up on the subject of pr pr 4 and then the auditor tried to clear the commands and tried to run it and he ran it for an hour and half and the tone arm was going out through the roof and then by simply rehabbing the fn it went snap right back to the fact that the guy had cognited at the moment that the subject of the process was given to him now if that could happen on process therefore it can happen on list but very often one doesnt announce the list but the pc all of sudden can get what the auditor is at are you connected to suppressive person or some such question is asked and the pc says what brand new idea you know wow and the auditor then says alright were going to do the wsu well christ hes got an fn right in front of his face and all hes gonna get out of that is rising tone arm now another instance given the subject for whats going to go on little bit of an r factor lecture on the subject but were gonna run so and so and the question is so and so now what do you understand with this question and at that moment something goes boom you see fn now i have seen something thats so completely insane so utterly insane that the person actually if he wound up in the hands of psychoanalyst i wouldnt say word and that is he has the pc put down the cans while we look it up in the dictionary jesus christ almighty god you mean you let pc off the cans from the moment the session starts to the end of the set bull never you say well hows he gonna turn the pages of the dictionary well what the hells he doing turning the pages of the dictionary the auditor got broken arm pc isnt let off the cans ever during session because an fn can occur at any time in the session and every now and then ill see in old reports took the pc off the cans so he could look up the word and then the tone arm starts up up up up up up up up up 425 the auditor going on and bla bla bla and bla bla bla and the next item or the next bla bla bla and bla bla bla and the next item or the next question and the tone arm going up 425 45 all the way up well where could the floating needle have been it was when he took the pc off the cans the pc looked it up in the dictionary and cognited because that is point where it can go it can go on the command the clearing of the command it can go on the first auditing question asked without it being answered or it can go on the first answer second answer and actually most often goes on the first answer on lists the first item and these godawful painful lists which you see that go eighty nine pages or something of this sort are either listing dead horse or the item was the first item so you dont let the pc off cans because those are the sequences of fn ive just given you and it happens on list and it happens on process and it can happen at any time it can happen at any time any time so dont let the pc off the cans for any reason under the sun moon or stars now i will tell you another kooky one ill give you another kooky circumstance with regard to all of this and that is this electronics men think an emeter works because hands sweat and i havent been around orgs to shoot the electronics men who say this and as net result of all of this they remain unshot and they do talk and in this great advanced modern society in which we live they think that galvanometer works because of hand sweat now the fellow you can just see the fellow sweating and unsweating he sweats read and he unsweats read and he sweats read and he unsweats read and he sweats read and he unsweats read and that is mirrored in the fact of pc wiped his hands and tone arm rose now i imagine some low ta case figured this out that if the pc wiped his hands and then you got higher ta read then immediately and directly and instantly it was the sweat which gave him the low ta read ill tell you what gives low ta read three bthetans that is low ta the whole of low ta the whole subject of low ta is contained in that pc has attested three tone arm 12 now that is something which comes from male cows when you see ta dive guys got bthetans now thered be eight thousand seven hundred and sixty five additional reasons why person doesnt have this or doesnt have that and we could have an infinity of wrongnesses there is reason of my harping on certain sets of wrongnesses im just showing you what goofynesses can come up now listen very carefully when the pc puts down the cans and moves his hands and arms the body density mass of the bthetan beefs up so that when he goes back on the cans again the ta is reading higher im afraid you cannot avoid these horribly factual facts that pc who gets low ta is an unflat three now we had an auditor here today very very puzzled very puzzled as to how his meter beautifully trimmed at the beginning of session went out of trim during the session at the end of session was found marvelously out of trim and this he was being very mystified about he doesnt know this fact it takes while for meter and can to warm up so the pc grabs hold of the cans or the meter is turned on and if you instantly trim it at that precise instant that its turned on you are turning on cold circuit and youre trimming cold circuit it takes minute or two for the circuit to warm up and your trim will change and this is not true of all emeters some of them heat up faster than others but its safe bet that if youre going to do trim check on meter you do it at the end of session not at the beginning of session and whats your meter doing so far out of trim do you carry it around by the trim knob my meters from one months end to the next just stay where theyre supposed to stay so i dont know why other peoples meters dont unless they uses the trim knob to scratch their heads or something but the point im making here is there are certain data now when you see people trying to avoid this data they have they feel the data is discreditable to themselves or somebody to whom it is discreditable is trying to argue them out of it now you can have this kind of fire fight develop up the line someplace there is such thing as service facsimile there is such thing as service facsimile its very amusing because that will be the guys service facsimile now this is this bad you can get somebody who is in foul foul condition in his life as far as casualties accidents that sort of thing is concerned and he gets to three and he cant find any he cant find any at all and the ideas upsetting to him now if his grades are out and he has not come up well through his grades his level of reality will not be adequate to embrace three anyway and so you have people going around every now and then you will find somebody going around and saying well idea of body thetans na na ah yeah yeah not true now he considers it discreditable he himself wants to invalidate it for some reason or another so he starts spreading it about so as to discredit the information and this blocks the way for an awful lot of people so therefore youve got to have grip on your standard data which is sufficient to stand up to all of this cockeyedness this is wild stuff that comes around crazy crazy stuff there is one going in angeles i think it is right this minute that it wont be possible to become clear or ot its not possible to make these grades out of seventy people polled twenty of them thought it was impossible and they wouldnt be able to make it and they didnt have much reality on it whos been at work there one of the first things you see is the invalidation of the state of clear reality is fascinating thing reality is proportional to the amount of charge off case if you took clearing course materials and handed em over to some wog he would look them over and scratch his head maybe come down with cold or something if he tried to run them if you tried to run them on him your possibility of doing so is so microscopically remote and most of em wouldnt even upset him thats how far they are from clear because there is this stable datum the amount of charge off case is proportional to the reality also proportional to the awareness so you have somebody walking down the street and there are four elephants and these four elephants are walking down in squad formation and each one of thems carrying green banners and you say to this fellow what the hell four elephants walking down the middle of the streets and he says what elephants just that just what elephants so it is very fascinating people are unaware to the degree that they havent got much reality anyway now you let one ofthese monkeys come along and tell you what reality is do you follow its one of these incredible nonsense propositions the whole subject of reality is mixed up in the subject of perception the subject of recognition the subject of truth you wonder how in the name of god the people of this planet could be lied to cause brother can they be lied to look at the newspapers they buy now if you want to know how much truth is in the newspapers all you have to do is read the report about scientology now you know thats for the birds what about the story at the right and left of the one about scientology did you ever think of that theyre just as lying as the one about scientology see the newspapers at this certain level of action here at this particular time are not particularly kicking back at us they as matter of fact their last report at least they were doing very well indeed but the level of truth the level of truth isnt there and yet these are the people who are keeping people informed well think of the people who are keeping them informed and think of the people who are quote being informed unquote see unreality one of your basic protests is unreality but unreality is proportional to the amount of charge on the case these guys are pretty charged up arent they so theyre in figurefigure bogglewoggle snuggleluggled hanging around theres an old comic strip character joe bliffelstick something like that and he always went around with little rain cloud over his head you know thats the boy thats your standard issue humanoid today see hes got too much storm going on right in his immediate vicinity to see very much out there now the quality of the charge taken off the case is very important if you take charge off on the main line of the grades as they go up why it is basic charge which then blows lot of side charge now if you just took charge off on mass without any judgement as to whether or not it was main line just take charge off just get the emeter to read put person on the cans get the emeter to read probably at the and of fifty sixty years of auditing something like that thered be great oddity would occur his reality would come up to ot do you follow now what weve got is way to go right through the fiddle of the charge line to remove those central charges which then discharge all the side charges now pc usually feels better in some way or another but an auditor who badly audits that is who audits very poorly can actually put as much charge on the case as he takes off he can invalidate the case the pc says why you know i feel better i i didnt i have floating needle or something and the auditor says case like yours sir well you do the same thing you say who or what has unmocked you or something and question didnt read person isnt pts now youve given him the evaluation that hes suppressed because youre going to now list the list so the list lists out to dead horse but the pc seems charged up alright ill give you another example of it the list is charged it does read and you give him the wrong item alright when you give him the wrong item youll hang him with that little pocket of charge because that isnt the item so it didnt discharge the list so youve got the charge of the list hung up in the fact that hes now got wrong item so that after listing action is done or after listing action session if the ta is high it was wrong item thats its very elementary tas high wrong item youre busy listing away listing away madly on case getting up to your hundred and fifty fifth page or something like this and you notice the ta is starting up well youre putting charge on the case do you see that your tone arm the tore arm is in actual fact the measure of accumulation of charge the needle surges are just gradients of the tone arm you can get tone arm actually behaving like needle and tone arm over long period of time does behave like needle tone arm measures the amount of chargeup on the case at that particular time when you get into the higher ot sections you will find something else very peculiar happens you can find that your pc will lean on something and drive his ta up and you can do your nut as review auditor trying to get this ta down on some guy who is up around six seven eight levels and his ta is up boy its up 475 or something like that and you suddenly sort it out and you find out hes leaning on something well at that level he can lean on something so much harder than anybody ever thought of that of course you are reading the side of building or you are reading the density of the ridge he is making against his body and you can fish it around actually to find out what he is doing and all of sudden why he says well you what am i doing i well pushing on the ceiling slllll down she come now you can actually reverse this when he is ot8 you can reverse this and as far as meter is concerned you can put him on the meter have him connected with the body and then have him lean on the wall just lean on the wall not go through any energy body grips and so forth after all the guy isnt the body have him lean on the wall and youll watch your ta come right on up unlean off the wall and it goes down in other words at high levels your ta starts to behave like needle which is quite quite interesting but your needle you see is just sort of of small easily read ta they are connected so you put more charge on the case down at lower level the guy isnt leaning on anything but the guys got lot of body thetans or something like that and remember that from three down you are auditing somebody with body thetans so very peculiar things can happen and you can audit him incorrectly do an incorrect action and have the ta go up you can incorrectly list him you can overrun him and so on youve got something leaning against something something making more mass than it did before so you havent taken charge off the case youve put charge on the case so if your ta is higher at session end than it was at the beginning the case is more charged up at the end than it was at the beginning elementary do you follow i mean these these these this is this is very easy this is very easy the auditor through incorrect actions put more water in the bucket than he took out and of course the tone arm measuring the amount of water in the bucket will of course measure more water in the bucket its its its just that elementary it its not very esoteric datum were dealing in actual fact with creature who can make mass and who does make mass and the mass which he makes below three or actually below seven the mass he makes and so on is normally bank mass now if he is given an item which isnt his item he then has been given something which he then grips and which stays with him and its very funny phenomenon that wrong item will be remembered very very easily by the pc now theres piece of rehabbing which is at this stage of the game being done wrong i dont know why you guys keep asking for service facsimile i notice lot of pcs can give you their service facsimile what the hells he doing remembering his service facsimile now it isnt true that because he can remember his service facsimile it wasnt his service facsimile but youre asking pc to do rather considerable feat youre asking him to remember something that has probably been erased and instead of rehabbing it youre keying it back in again so i dont know why you keep asking him for the wording i saw folder here the other day it came in from an org and it said it wasnt his service facsimile because he couldnt remember it and its probably the one valid service facsimile thats passed through the lines its whether or not it rehabs whether or not it goes fn that thats thats the whole test does it go fn alright thats it now the other thing the other thing which you must get very straight as far as emeter reactions and processes and so on that you must get very straight is that where an item or process brought about state of release there is an fn there to rehab and if it doesnt rehab he didnt go release at that point well you say well how many times can you rehab this things i dont know infinity so you say alright lets rehab this fellows grades and you could make this mistake as cs as case supervisor say lets rehab this fellows grades tell him rehab the grades and this auditor obediently tries to rehab arc straightwire tone arm rose you give him hell because he rehabbed it wrong or you say its been rehabbed too many times i saw remark in case summary here today theres complete error the person has been overrun on ruds now person couldnt be overrun on ruds not possible to be overrun on ruds it is possible to overrun one particular arc break but it is not possible to overrun the whole subject of arc breaks so when you see this you tried to rehab arc straightwire and it didnt rehab and the tone arm went up and you fish around trying to find the point of rehab and it didnt exist why naturally at that stage of the game youre going to get rising tone arm its as easy as that so what do you do about this you say well i couldnt possibly do this its obviously been overrun well you gotta make up your mind its either been overrun or not run at all one of the ways to do this is to run it and you say god thats adventurous yeah it is yes but what the hells this guy doing being being grade three without his arc straightwire in see so you run it blows down it fns thats the first time it was ever run i assure you supposing as you tried to run it it just really shot up well at that time you could indicate that it was overrun and try to fish around and find out what in the name of common sense happened to it one of the things just would be to date the session in which it was supposed to have been rehabbed supposed to have been run and get the buttons in on that session because there might have been crashing invalidation on the session of something that swallowed up the fn in some weird fashion it couldnt have been an fn which appeared below the invalidation dont get that sort of thing there was an fn but the auditor wound up on the guy and told him that wasnt it that it was good or something and the guy cant remember this session because it was sort of painful something bad happened in the session well you could you could rehabilitate the session and get the fn so obviously obviously your right procedure would be youre getting somebody you wanna rehab arc straightwire well the fellow might be protesting it being rehabbed because this is the hundred and fifth time and hes tired of the whole thing so you got protest on it something like that doesnt rehab see it doesnt rehab the tone arm starts up well now it could be protested not overrehabbed but certainly protested the rehabbing of it it could have been that the session is too painful in which it was run the later part of the session was very painful but the early part of the session was all right something goofy like this so one of the things would be to date the thing do just standard dating on your meter date the session and get in some buttons on the session and see if anything happens then youre liable to get yourself an fn now if that action didnt occur this is this is rather working very hard at it see and this is how to be very safe but if that action didnt occur it didnt ever fn it didnt ever fn thats it somebody was telling lie but your tone arm the tone arm only means overrun when it goes up on something you are running high tone arm means generality of overruns in life you can have person with high tone arm that oh boys does he got overruns in life its quite remarkable how many overruns there can be in life and one of your standard actions is to get the life overruns off of the case and boy does that cool off tas wow now let show you what kind of errors can creep in just as so youre safe guarded against your tech being shot to hell somebody says that you must only get life overruns in this lifetime because the pc liable to get back and bad things are liable to happen and whole track doesnt exist anyway somebody is trying to invalidate whole track so he says you mustnt ever try to try to get hold of life overruns earlier than this lifetime because its liable to get the pc upset well its very very interesting there have been crude versions of engram running on the whole track they apparently didnt have meters then commands god knows what they were but somebody on the whole track here and there has tried to run engrams and they inevitably have overrun them so youre liable to find an engram overrun of eighty one million years ago this guy says youre running this process what has been overrun youre running this process and the guy says whats been overrun and it occurs to him engrams good and you try now you limited by asking what session you see and pin his attention up here in pt somewhere you know in what foundation you see you could limit your question so that he could never rehab it but its obviously been overrun because it reads as overrun but you cant get an fn well now if you know the tools of your trade this wont baffle you do you remember what i told you about the incredible the pcs data man is not something that you as case supervisor or an auditor have god damned thing to do with any time auditing may be run on the only on those things which conform to current opinion any time that phenomenon occurs and its liable to occur at any time because the actually the first foundation the dianetic foundation really blew up on just this one point the board of directors was so upset over the commotion past lives would cause that they tried to pass resolution saying that more research must be done into the field of past lives well we had parting of the ways anyway because obviously to wrap up the subject one had to research what was there now lets get somebody researching under the bideawee college faculty theres this guy with high choke collar and very prim tremendous number of missed withholds second dynamic overts of various kinds but respectable citizen and all of sudden somebody says that hes going to do little research in this line or theyre gonna practice this and that why he permits scientology to be run in that university only so long as nobody just fill in the missing lines see you could fill in as long as nobody tries to pull missed withholds see as long as we never go into past lives as long as the subject religion is not touched as long do you get the idea you could fill it in see so you get limitation now that is limitation of the preclears data auditing has nothing to do with data it has to do with technique so the pc tells you theres eighteen elephants walking on the ceiling boy its not up to you to correct him he can take snoot full of some outrageous drug or gasoline or something and its marvelous we have people who have gone wing ding on gasoline i well i guess they were in the valence of car laughter and hes trying to run out this incident see and this incident has pink elephants walking upside down on the ceiling it has black bats flying in and out of his ears now psychiatry when they found data like that instantly and at once invalidated the person and then they might put it down in their report but their idea of making the thing come out straight was telling the person what the truth was now that is whole failed line it is totally failed it is fighting its last ditch fight as i speak to you now its going to go over niagara falls with barrel boy because one of the tricks it uses is when it interferes with somebody or implants somebody is to put an incredible perception in the implant so if the person says anything about it it will sound so incredible he can then be pronounced insane so you havent got anything to do with the pcs data what he tells you is what he tells you so you do list now lets get what just exactly what i mean we do list and were doing this list and he puts down pink elephants and who or what has suppressed you and he puts down pink elephants catterwacks martians dog biscuit and theres this hellish fall and he sits up and laughter and the damned thing goes fn you dont even have chance to null the list there it is of course you say dog biscuits and it reads and you say thats your item and he says yeah that sure is you say alright dog biscuits thats your item you see one of the things that gets wrong with the time track is it has incredibles on it and therefore an incredible is something that wont asis because its not credible the item is dog biscuits hes been suppressed with dog biscuits some times you practically do your nut trying to figure out how the hell did he get loused up on the subject of dog biscuits but actually if you went back into it inquired deeply which you shouldnt do but if you went back in to it sometimes the pc explains this to you it all sounds logical but youre interested in the mechanics of it just the mechanics of it did it blow down was it the item on the list your action then is to verify and give it to the pc as his item those are the things which youre supposed to do not worry about whether or not its dog biscuits do you see youre not interested in the in in in this data do you get the you get the different orientation on this thing it has nothing to do with you if you followed the exact mechanical steps necessary to resolve it why there you are youre interested in the reaction of the pc not his data the pc says oh yes boy do i have an arc break boy are they on to and so on theyre all pretty bad you know theyve been jumping all over with wicked people wicked people and so on well thats good by all means try to clean up this thing as an arc break at the moment and in the process of cleaning it up say ask him casually but not evaluatively if he has withhold and that reads and you pull it and then you check the arc break and it all of sudden doesnt read and the whole thing has cooled off reaction the pc was critical that means always invariably missed withhold see its that kind of thing youre interested in as an auditor not what the arc break was about but that he was arc broken not what the missed withhold was about but that he did have one do you get the differences now the subject of each one of the grades which is to say arc breaks withholds problems you name it but the subject of any grade the subject of any grade is timeless and endless it can always be run forever but not the commands of the grade supposing we tried to run pr pr 1 aa every time the pc looked worried and had problem man we would really wrap him around telegraph pole he would become overrun on that process right he never becomes overrun on problems you you get the vast difference there he never hes never overrun on problems he is overrun on problems process he can be overrun for instance on problems of comparable magnitude problems of comparable magnitude problems of comparable magnitude problems of comparable magnitude and you in trying to put in the ruds had better well damn well not run any process at all arc break is arcu cdei which is just the trying to find out what the arc break is itsa or earlier itsa you do rudiments by itsa or earlier incident itsa on totality and they never become overrun but if you insisted on running problem of comparable magnitude for every time you found pc with ptp you would very soon have this one wrapped around telegraph pole so the basic stable datum that you should know is that process can be overrun but the subject of grades the subject of grades can never be overrun for instance you cant overrun pr pr you you cant overrun pr pr 6 with regard to this youre asking the pc how life is well after all youre asking him some version of this as condition arent you but you start asking him about conditions vroooom booms do you see you could ask him how life is alright that also might seem to overrun pr pr 4 too or pr pr 5 right this could this could all of these so the basic background subject of it you can ask somebody what engram he is stuck in well youre trying to get revivification on pr pr 6 and usually do get one even thought it flicks through like that you could still find out what incident hes stuck in but you dont have to run the process pr pr 6 do you follow so the subject of being stuck in incidents inexhaustible every once in while you guys are talking about stuck picture the pc had stuck picture so the pc had stuck pictures its not very interesting pets have stuck pictures now supposing you run pr pr 6 every time the pc had stuck picture i dont know how much mass you would accumulate but boy you would soon have to move the pc with crane and truck now supposing after hes clear he has stuck picture and you tried to run it with power well in the first place it inevitably is somebody elses picture and he is not sufficiently permeating now into the other thetans around the only thing you can run it out of is body thetan and you prematurely beef up pr pr 3 and thats why you mustnt even rehab power you cant run power after hes clear the guy went clear without running power god almighty never run power dont ever rehab power after the guys clear but if the guy isnt clear but just on the clearing course and he cant seem to make it and he gets reality on it you go back and find out he hasnt been run on power well run power because he isnt clear its elementary in actual fact there is not its not very complicated subject beyond this the only power thats available on clear is that you would get out of body thetan and he is being run with his pictures disowned which wraps it all around telegraph pole you can run basic track you can run r6 out of body thetans because thats where most of them are stuck anyhow alright now what whats this amount to whats this amount to we just take this datum as thoroughly stable thing but the subject the subject which you have to know on this see the subject of any grade you can run basic track you can run r6 on body thetan because thats where most of them are stuck anyhow alright now what whats this amount to whats this amount to we just take this datum as thoroughly as thoroughly stable thing but the subject the subject which you have to know on this thing the subject of any grade can be run at any time forever correct along about ot8 youre gonna have hell of time trying to run one of them but you couldnt any more overrun the guy on than it would neither run nor overrun do you see but the process the process the technique that process can be overrun because it is addressed to specific point of contact with the mind and with life and it snaps that and if you overrun it it puts it back again so engrams man engrams can be run from wog to angel secondaries can be run all over the damn track at any grade you ever heard of on any grade you could run secondary straightwire but not the commands of straightwire but the whole idea of straightwire what the hell do you think youre doing when you put in ruds do you have an arc break youre asking the guy to recall do you see you ran straightwire all the way communication what are you doing in an auditing session his arc breaks are mostly involved with the fact that his comm is cut or something like that problems although youve disconnected him from the large mass of problems and he now doesnt have all his vast number of problems that he had and the whole subject of problems is not overwhelming he can still have problem you get the idea it goes right on up the line and what do you know you can have guy at five he all of sudden has flea hit him in the teeth about his body thetan hits him body thetan with home he wakes up one fine morning and finds out he has whole bunch of r6 pictures where the hell did this come from i thought i ran all that out yeah he ran all that out but hes not up to point yet where he has turned off all of his attractiveness as thetan he hasnt yet found out that hes the one that grabs hold of body thetans they really dont grab hold of him they basically dont have enough reach laughter but until guy is so clear that you hit him on the left ear and it rings for hours as thetan as being hes not got any little trick pieces of mass that are incredible and so he hasnt bothered to notice that he is mocking them up all these little patch up points poor old body thetan around with home cant find hospital address something like that caroms hits the guy and probably would leave but finds himself stuck so you run you could shoot body thetan off and by the way they react very well to negative negative exteriorization commands try not to be ten thousand feet above the city laughter but the net gain of all of this is that you undoubtedly could not run body thetan out of wog you couldnt possibly i dont think it could be done with pistol because you see theyre him he to them he is this composite being he is being but he is influencers by lot of composite beings he is not cluster somebody has originated this thing i am cluster you are cluster guy is never cluster brother he is himself with some body thetans plastered on him but hes too not enough charge off now when if the guys get up to the clearing course you get another phenomena occurring and its an interesting phenomenon when you get up into clearing course if you just let people audit the clearing course materials certain percentage of them will write in and tell you that there are these black objects and they seem to be other beings and they start flying off when they start auditing and what are these things the guy is already prematurely encountered 3 certain number of cases will do this also oddly enough you could start certain very small percentage of cases and its very small percentage at ot you could start them out at grade four service facsimile and they would go on up but the percentage is too small to pay much attention to this now if the person arrives at ot3 and he cant perceive these you must recognize that there is insufficient charge off his case now whats the whats the solution to that well youve taken the charge off of the main grade line youve you can rehab the main grade line make sure that it is run youll normally find out it hasnt been its been skimped somehow or another or more charge has been put on than has taken off and then somebody turned in false report or something like this something weird happened or you can turn around at that stage of the game and run him on down through the actual reason they get all smashed together which is accidents impacts and injuries then you can start auditing him down that line and they itll loosen up and all of sudden it all comes straight but what is that thats running an engram which is way down in the dianetics area now the process of running an engram is the only one i know of that does not overrun if the process of running an engram is to go to the beginning date the thing go to the beginning of the incident what is its duration go through it to the end tell whats there that wont overrun its not much of cause you see the subject matter to which it is introduced and so forth now you go back and try to audit the engrams which have already been audited youre not going to get anyplace because you see the reason why that one works that way is because engrams and secondaries are erased theyre not released theres difference of definition they arent something the engrams secondaries and bank masses and implants and all the rest of this sort of thing they just dont fly off or the guy just unpins them or ceases to mock them up and waits till tomorrow when they get keyed in and starts mocking them up again see thats release phenomenon you erase it there is hole in the bank where that was and it is not likely to key in again so of course there isnt anything to overrun you get the difference so the one unlimited process there is is engram running or secondary running totally unlimited with this proviso dont try to run an incident which has already been erased because now youre going back and trying to put the incident there when its not there and the person is trying to put the incident there and you can get and it reacts to the question overrun it will react to it the engram has been overrun you can get read on this cause it interprets that way to his head the truth of the matter is is you are making put it back there again would be the right the actual action which is occurring on an overrun so one chain or one incident the chain blew see now you care to run this chain he cant run the chain youre asking him something hes got to put the chain there in order to run it again thats overrun thats the overrun it isnt the command overrun its the fact that its gone and it really has gone it hasnt released hes hes now got to put one there in order to have one he hasnt got the skill to do it and he becomes very upset and very baffled his knowingness about what hes doing is not adequate to knowing that he is trying to put one there dont you see but he really doesnt know how to put one there yet and he can get all flabblebabbled up every once in while youll you will get read on 3 overrun wise up auditor wise up that is one body thetan who is run one too many times through incident one all you just do is indicate it to him hes been run through it after it was gone and so forth and he blows and then on it suddenly he finds out that theres lot more body thetans 3 wasnt overrun but the pc will read on 3 being overrun one body thetan has been overrun on one engram is what 3 overrun reads on your meter has 3 been overrun woosh very good which body thetan was run too often through the incident pull that one woosh thats good alright indicate that it has been over he has been overrun on incident one or incident two as the case may be very good we had case here the other day practically fall apart apparently the auditorpc in doing 3 did nothing but overrun everybody that he had hes one of these thorough cases laughter and the review auditor running overruns just the subject of overruns in trying to rehab overruns of course got up to prep check on 3 and was busy rehabbing this and that and my god the case just fell to pieces it went off in all directions the guy simply plastered himself with overrun body thetans by the same mechanism he was asking them to go through the one the two three more times but there wasnt anything there for the guy to go through and then probably running them verbally verbalization go to the beginning or something like this some generality that could stick kick every body thetan down the track the guys are still trying to go to the beginning there is nothing there there now is beginning then they get very confused guys that run ot3 verbalized anyhow are rather bonkers you get the funny picture of the guy pulling an empty chair up across from his auditing desk and saying to the empty chair do you have an incident one that didnt read good ill go attest 3 its actually run telepathically and you dont have lots of commands and so forth if you get up to that point without being able to think guy back to the where the beginning of the incident and thinking him through the thing you ought to quit anyway so this is the way the you you shouldnt quit you ought to get to work and finish your 3 anyway ill make it very tactful now do you differentiate between the idea of the subject and the process these are two different things so as the case supervisor dont make the mistake of believing that the person has been on the subject well this person has just had too many arc breaks run see just dont run any more arc breaks on this pc thatd be the end of him boy you could say dont again run list four the main change in your life and waffle waffle waffle waffle waffle waffle waffle see so thats so how would you overrun an arc break then well you would overrun you dont overrun arc breaks but you could overrun an arc break and you do it this way do you have an arc break good that reads what was it so and so and so and so alright when was that so and so and so and so good c d i pardon r c u c d i good indicate it to the pc good do you have an arc break well i have read here well do you have an arc break yep it read what is the arc break oh i dont know youre asking him to run the arc break which hes just run which then invalidates his ability to asis and you hang it up and the ta will go up alright thats one way to do it another way to do it is do you have an arc break yes my husband so on and so on yesterday and itsa well r c u alright id like to indicate to you that it was understanding it was break in under floating needle see ok and the auditor doesnt indicate that and the pc said yeah thats perfectly allowable for the pc to say yeah thats break in understanding hes not he didnt understand what the hell i was talking about alright good floating needle see c d i c reads also d youre curious about and desired understanding was that that was the bypassed charge good uh yes good now how do you feel about that arc break now well lets see now he has to put it there dont you see in order to answer this question and he gets bonkers mess that would occur see its gone and now youre telling him its still there and is in essence an auditor evaluation so he being an obedient pc tries you can handle his bank better than he he just assumes that it must still be there so he tries to put something there but he cant find anything to put there so the ta goes up and you leave him in mystery you play the same gag on him as look at the elephant only there isnt any elephant you see so he looks around and then you from altitude say well you damn fool cant you see this elephant cant you see this elephant anyplace anyplace cant you see this elephant and the guy says i cant see any elephant oh well drums fingers on table guess well have to send you to the psychiatrist well guy in protest like this will sort of try to satisfy oh yeah yeah i i i can get the dim outline of an elephant yeah thats why the auditors code is the auditors code you say it read when it didnt read you say it didnt read when it read we just had pc wrapped around telegraph pole he let himself go all the way through the session with missed withhold well it didnt read when it went by so i didnt say anything about it and the auditor sat there and watched him get kind of gray faced and so on as the session went on and didnt say anything about it either yes he didnt get read but the pc had missed withhold reactions and he didnt get in suppress on it now you could be damned fool and every clean read that you see get in suppress on it do you see where where rote auditing becomes impossible you could you could wind session up to whole bunch of inspections before the fact and so on so you make up for this by being yourself acquainted totally fully and utterly with the standard data you are handling you dont have to stop and think that critical pc has missed withhold you dont have to stop and think when you see somebody coming into session very sad and hangdog that he has an arc break of long duration you see these youd know youre not all fumblebumbling around i wonder how scientology compares to freudian god or is freud god was freud religion yes freud was god yes wonder how it compares to that i wonder how this has to do with my case and you havent got any time to do that time at all boy pc comes into session and he looks his eyes are pretty heavy and the auditor doesnt know his auditors code right down through the middle does not say you get any sleep hes so busy trying to find out which is the trim button and which is the plug in that he cant notice anything about the pc pc looks sort of gaunt the pc doesnt look well at the beginning of the session looks sort of gaunt the auditor doesnt in conversational tone of voice ask him if hes had enough sleep if hes had anything to eat are you physically ill doesnt ask himself anything like that he waits till hes gone an hour and half deep in the session the pcs fallen on his head if he doesnt know his auditors code the auditors code is the auditors code it isnt something that is put there for reason for instance eat and sleep are the only two things pcs have ever spun on back in the bad old days of the dianetics foundations we used to get every loony pc that could walk down the line they werent even pcs theyd just let them out of institutions and theyd walk in and theyd get audited and common denominator of those who were spinny in session or who spun and then had to be rescued in some way and heroic actions i we made common denominator what was in common to every one of these pcs they hadnt eaten and they hadnt slept and you as an auditor go and let somebody who has had insufficient sleep which you dont know too much about as case are sooner or later going to wrap somebody around telegraph pole and hes going to spin for three or four days in screaming state man sooner or later this horrible experience will occur thats why the auditors code is the auditors code it has data like this in it so when guy goes into session he sits down oh oh yawns good to sit down have you had any sleep well come to think about it i havent slept for couple of days very good thank you very much you go get some sleep and then we will have session when you are sufficiently rested and im very sorry that this has prevented you from finishing the cycle of action of session at this time indicating the bypassed charge at the same time so you dont have to take it up in the next session you say you know your data so well that you know the guy is going to have bypassed charge by not being able to complete the cycle of action so you take care of that then in other words you know your business its right on your finger tips all the time you dont have to think what if you were riding bicycle thinking every thought necessary to balance the bicycle and steer it at the same time youll go into ditch man well you go into ditch with auditing just like that if you dont know these things pang pang pang pang these are the things you watch now you all of you know you know you know this data you know it colds you know your auditors code banger see you dont have to think let see what did it say in the auditors code when the to hell with that you shouldnt even be wandering around i wonder what ron meant when he wrote that part of the auditors code it had something to do with it now lets see theres something in the bit of it had something to do with that kidding ive heard things like this the veda oh come now look at india thats known as invidious comparison the word invidious means disgraceful or bad anyway standard tech is just main line tech these are the subjects you take them up these are the only subjects you handle in standard tech they are the subjects of the grades there arent fifty processes and actions in the entirety of scientology now that isnt asking anybody very much to know and know them so cold that he says well gonna do rehab brrrrrrr bow wow bub zee zee barb barb ding ding pow pow pow and the pc says so and so exactly therefore bow bang floating needle thank you very much whats he rehabbing hes rehabbing something completely catastrophic you look over the list and horrors that this case is such an irreparable resistive case and so on do you get the relationship now do you get the relationship do you get what data you have to have what data you have to have what understanding you have to have the grip you have to have on it nobodys asking you to know very much but boy what you do know maaaaaanl you sure had better have grip that is like steel bands pc sits down in the session and right that moment just with one casual glance youve got it sorted out he isnt even talking yet you know youre going to get in the ruds and fly the needle and so forth you ought to just know where it probably is its just as easy as that and you say there he is thats whats wrong with him theres nothing mystic about it the guy will have an arc break or ptp or missed withhold or an overt motivator now youre starting to get faint see its getting less and less likely and then youve got whole bunch of things that if it didnt go if it didnt fly on that if it didnt fly on that then you go through green form till it flies cause the persons hung up on something hes pts hes doing something and you normally will find out on your green form line now you know the guys been audited hes been audited badly and so on well its lead pipe cinch you do the same thing that you would do in any other way fly the needle and take the general assessment form or an l4a something like this whatever it was that you picked up the tool you pick up the tool you know the tool would be there but youre far better off if all of your auditing is against case supervision you were either the case supervisor or you were the auditor when the auditor is both the case supervisor and the auditor hes sticking his neck out four hundred and eighty five miles cause hes violating it he knows both the auditor and the pc and if he knows the auditor and the pc variables can enter into the problem do you follow he knows the auditor he knows the pc hah hes violated two basic principles of case supervision you never talk to the auditor about the case you never talk to the pc about his case as close as you come to talking to the auditor is the auditing report as close as you come to talking to the pc is the examiners report and i can tell you now that youre fool not to have both before you when you case supervise you should have before you the auditing report in its entirety and you should have before you as well the examiners report on the pc you say well how you going to get that well the pc always goes through the examiner of course well how could you set this up if you were in private practice if youd be asked this question well i dont know i guess youd have to appoint the next door neighbor or your wife or something as the examiner and youd have to train up somebody else to audit if youre going to be the case supervisor cause i can guarantee that if youre also doing the case supervision as well as the auditing you will wrap it around telegraph pole sooner or later sounds weird doesnt it but the auditor and the pc always influence the case supervisor whenever theyre visavis with him and personal chatter on the subject of the pcs case and personal chatter with regard to the auditor with regard to the pc case are the only two points i have ever found that wrapped my case supervision around telegraph pole now theres another way my case supervision can be misrouted and upset and so on is by the pc not going through the examiner the pc leaves the auditing session and leaves review through the examiner now this has the liability that the examiner is liable to be sourpuss and the pc says oh greats boy just made it wows you know and the examiner says hm take hold of the cans boy thats the greatest session i ever had in my life yeah thats what they always say yeah good and that would actually be after the fact of the examination wouldnt it so you could mysteriously have the pc cave in by down curve from the examiner but thatd be the only point left the main liability of the case supervisor the main liability of case supervisor is false auditing report and he should protect himself every way he possibly can from false auditing report but he shouldnt go around talking to the pc he shouldnt go find the pc and look the pc up and all this sort of thing cause his opinion on the thing is the case supervisors point of view and you can figure all you want to about why it is its an empirical datum one that has been derived from experience i have already cast up the number of cases on which case supervision errors have been made they have been made by case supervisor having seen the pc and talked to the pc about the session the error of errors are talking to the auditor about the session and in when those two points have occurred in case supervision case supervision has erred they color it perhaps its cold blooded proposition but the case supervisor can be given false report he can be given an evaluative report of one kind or another oh the pc was in marvelous conditions pcs barely able to crawl out of the auditing room thats why you want the examiners now what you want from the examiners simply is the tone arm the state of the needle and what the pc says not in response to some examiners question some examiners going to say to you now what do you ask the pc and your answer to that is shut up dont ask him nothing theres sign on the desk and it says examiner the mere fact that hes given the pc the cans and checking the meter hes got the pcs folder there you see thats enough the pcll say something and the examiner writes it down and then the examiner must always say thank you very much and that is the limit of his communication because if you let them talk theyll start auditing the pc so you cut that talk to minimum youre liable to see little forms being made up someplace what gains have you had in this session well i got floating needle on this and i had cognition on that now i and theres little thing that i thought was little bit point there and i wasnt quite sure what happened there and so on but i did get floating needle on this thing but i wasnt quite sure about the thing and so on and here the floating needle is busy packing up and the examiner is sure invitation to overrun if the examiner is liable is allowed to talk the examiners liable to talk so the examiner cant talk little tiny bit i can just see it now there will be form there an examiners form and it has questions on it like was your auditor nice to you in the session did he invalidate your gains did you really make your grade and that can kill because its too fast too fast after the session somebody who is still part of the organization and part of apparently part of the line up and blood brother to the auditor sort of and the orgs line is actually challenging him he isnt challenging him so just the sign there and it says examiner and folder meter give him the cans he comes out he can say hello give him the cans when he comes out ok ta ta thank you thank you very much and he can point which direction hes supposed to go thats the end now the case supervisor has an independent tone arm needle state pc statement and he can add these things up the auditor says at the end of the session that the pcs ta was at 275 and the examiner report right on top of it says 375 there was fn at the end of session it is false report saves you an awful lot of trouble you simply make out your next one and say correct so and so and do not send them to whatever the auditors name was some other auditor correct session so and so something went wrong and then you get better because false report has tendency to be followed by false report so were getting down to something now thats very interesting is that really only an organization can process successfully and over continued long period of time only an organization can process and the individual practitioner may make lot of bucks here and there you have phenomenon of guy who is tremendously successful as in individual auditor he seems to be doing just great as an individual auditor you follow their curves they fall on their heads in couple of years its an organization action it takes the organization backup franchises fall on their heads by not having enough staff to perform all the actions of the organization and they actually are totally dependent on organizations to perform great many services i couldnt even begin to list how many services an organization has to perform therefore apparently apparently the individual auditor makes great deal of money and so forth but its usually for limited time got to be backed up franchise got to be backed up by an organization and the franchise is seldom sufficiently organized to stand by itself if it werent for an organization someplace so this is this is the thing now i want to call to your attention that the era of medicine was long and hard won and so on that the era of psychiatry is brief but these practitioners organizing themselves on union basis doing this doing that but practicing individually they really dont do well and theyre not going to do well professionally over long period of time because outfits like us can suddenly move in sideways right now they theyre worried about us frantic because were getting all the business theres lot of cream stuff coming out of that field they dont get that anymore theyre worried theyre worried about their appropriations so its an organizational action now lets look at this as an organization function youve got case supervisor theres an auditor theres an examiner theres somebody that schedules sessions even though that is also the review chief see youre already dealing with minimum number now you can run one godawful number of sessions through this line up but if the auditor has to do all of his admin the auditor has to do all of his opinionation the auditor has to do this and do that he wont hit hundred he wont hit hundred because one day hes tired or one day hes this or he slips and he doesnt catch his slips and he gets optimistic about it and he gets opinions and side data starts hitting him he wobbles because hes talking to pc all the way down the line you see case supervisors always got to have another auditor to send the pc to when he gets false report in what the hell else he gonna do so you see the minimum size and shape and design of such an activity now the auditors business is simply handling the pc it shouldnt be on anything else and his business in handling the pc is just running very standard actions on the pc and nothing adventurous running the pc rapidly to the highest possible gain level that he possibly can shooting him through the line its really very simple action but its one of these simplicities that you have to be very very brilliant to grasp i say brilliant to the degree that you have to be brilliant enough not to be complicated its actually very simple activity but it is just about as complex as the lines that certain number of functions and actions which have to be taken handling the pc theres just certain number of functions and actions you start leaving some of these organizational setups out in the handling of pc and somethingll go astray similarly in the tech itself something goes astray if you start leaving thing out like we never run present time problems anymore the pc was released on problems so he cant possibly have problem we dont know why the case is not changing at ot2 anyway the false report is about the only enemy that case supervisor has just getting back to that subject because it makes him think that standard tech isnt working and is wide open invitation to do something else the thing that isnt working is the auditors report normally you would have started out in your career and continued to do nothing but the very standard actions if you had not also seen false reports standard reports have pcs evaluating for you as to what you ought to be doing for their case trying to please people trying to do this trying to do that having case supervision work given to you with which you did not agree all these other thing come along and they finally wind you up in ball so you dont know what the hell youre doing now what youre doing here is im straightening you all out straight and as narrow and i hope you stay that way thank you very much
