the 1970s parties have sought to create mortgage instruments that would enable elderly homeowners to obtain loans to convert their equity into income while providing that repayments would be due for specified period or ideally for the lifetime of the borrower these instruments have been referred to as reverse mortgages reverse annuity mortgages and home equity conversion loans reverse mortgages are the opposite of traditional mortgages in the sense that the borrower receives payments from the lender instead of making such payments to the lender reverse mortgages are designed to enable elderly homeowners to remain in their homes while using the equity in their homes as form of income in general reverse mortgages may take one of tw forms term or tenure under term reverse mortgage the borrower is provided with income for specified period under tenure reverse mortgage the borrower is provided with income for as long as he or she continues to occupy the property for borrowers the most risky reverse mortgage is the term reverse mortgage borrowers have been reluctant to enter such mortgages because at the end of the loan term the borrower would likely have to sell the home and move for lenders the most risky reverse mortgage is the tenure reverse mortgage lenders have been reluctant to originate such mortgages because the borrower is guaranteed lifetime income and lifetime occupancy of the home this is risky because the mortgage debt grows over time and the debt could exceed the value of the home if the borrower lives longer than his or her life expectancy the use of tenure reverse mortgages has grown in recent years due to the availability of an fhainsured reverse mortgage under the fh program the risk of the borrower living too long is shifted to the federal government under prior law fhainsured reverse mortgages were subject to the fha mortgage limit for the area in which property is located the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110 289 establishes mortgage limit equal to the conforming loan limit for freddie mac present law limits the aggregate number of fhainsured reverse mortgages to 275000 loans and that limit has been exceeded notwithstanding the limit in present law the 2009 continuing appropriations resolution pl 110329 provides that fha may continue to insure reverse mortgages through march 6 2009 unless congress amends

the american housing survey ahs nearly 25 million american homeowners have mortgage debt and more than 125 m illion of them are elderly age 65 or older1 for many of the elderly homeowners the equity in their homes represents their largest asset the ahs finds that the median value of these unmortgaged homes is 127959 many elderly homeowners find that although inflation has increased the value of their homes it has also eroded the purchasing power of their fixed incomes they find it increasingly difficult to maintain their homes while also paying for needed food medical and other expenses because of their low incomes many may be unable to qualify for loans to pay for unexpected expenses house rich and cash poor is the phrase often used to describe their dilemma one option is to sell the home and move to rental housing or purchase lowercost home for variety of reasons however many older americans prefer to remain in the homes in which they may have spent most of their working years since the 1970s academics and housing advocates have sought to create mortgage instruments that would enable elderly homeowners to obtain ans to convert their equity into income while providing that repayments would be due for specified period or ideally for the lifetime of the borrower these instruments have been referred to as reverse mortgages reverse annuity mortgages and home equity conversion loans generally when borrower obtains mortgage lender advances lumpsum payment to or on behalf of the borrower and the borrower becomes committed to making stream of monthly payments to repay the loan with the reverse mo rtgage the lender becomes committed to making stream of payments to the borrower and such payments are repaid to the lender in lump sum at some future date thus reverse mortgages are the opposite of traditional mortgages in that the borrower receives payments from the lender instead of making such payments to the lender reverse mortgages are designed to enable elderly homeowners to remain in their homes while using the equity in their homes as form of income although reverse mortgages are small part of the total mortgage market their use has increased substantially in recent years this report discusses the evolution and history of reverse mortgages compares reverse mortgage products currently avai lable discusses the potential use of reverse mortgages as way to finance longterm care and raises number of issues for policymakers and the elderly aged 65 or older 2 1 american housing survey for the united states 2005 current housing

property to the seller often saleleaseback transactions are used by businesses that seek to raise working capital by selling and leasing back some property that is used in the trade or business the technique enables firms to raise capital and avoid high borrowing costs capital that was formerly frozen in real estate assets can be used to generate higher rate of return in the business itself if the business obtained mortgage against the property the mortgage would cover only 75 to 80 of the market value of the property through the saleleaseback transaction the business can obtain cash for 100 of the value of the property less transaction costs and still maintain use and possession of the property in the 1970s some advocates suggested saleleaseback transactions as way for elderly homeowners to convert the equity in their homes into source of income under this plan the elderly homeowner would sell the home and lease it back from the new owner the seller could retain the right of occupancy for life or for fixed number of years in either case the seller would become renter of the home that he or she formerly owned the burden of property taxes home insurance and repair and maintenance costs would rest with the new owner it is argued that these costs make it difficult for elderly homeowners to remain in their homes or cause them to make tradeoffs between making home repairs and taking care of necessities such as food and health care such tradeoffs may result in the elderly having owner occupied but substandard property under sale leaseback plan the ownerinvestor would be paying the operating costs of the property and be eligible for the associated tax writeoffs proponents hold that the elderly would remain in wellmaintained homes without the financial burden of such maintenance the saleleaseback plan is complicated form of equity conversion because of the number of variables that must be negotiated between the buyer and seller the parties must negotiate the sales price downpayment loan term and lease agreement the items are interrelated and may affect the net benefit of the transaction to the elderly homeowner few programs were initiated under the socalled grannie mae program company would arrange for the children or grandchildren to purchase and leaseback the home of the elderly person 3 under another plan the fouratt senior citizen equity plan the leaseback payments took two forms promissory note mortgage and deferred annuity4 the promissory note would provide for monthly payments to the seller over term equal to the greater of the sellers life expectancy or 10 years when the payments from the promissory note ended the annuity would make the same payments for the lifetime of the seller 3 q and on grannie mae home equity news

mortgages under reverse annuity mortgage ram equity in the home is used as security for loan an annuity is purchased with the loan proceeds and the borrower receives monthly annuity income less mortgage interest the borrower pays only interest on the loan repayment of the principal is deferred until the death of the owner the sale of the property or some prescribed date table 1 shows the net annuity that would be availa ble under ram to female homeowner for range of ages and interest rates the age shown is the borrowers age when the loan was taken it is assumed that borrower obtains 200000 inte restonly mortgage on the property and uses the proceeds to purchase an annuity that means that the loan balance will always be 200000 upon the death of the borrower the sale of the property or some prescribed date the borrower or the borrowers heirs would owe the lender 200000 for 55yearold borrower the annuity would be 1062 monthly if interest rates are 5 the lender would deduct 833 from the annuity and forward the borrower net annuity of 229 if interest rates are 12 the interest payment would be greater than the annuity payments so the borrower would owe the lender 938 net annuity of 938 this would defeat the purpose of entering into ram the table shows that rising interest rates are risk for homeowners and that the interest rate risk is greater for younger borrowers for 55 and 60yearold borrowers the net annuity would become negative when interest rates are at 7 or higher the net annuity would become negative at 8 for 65yearolds 9 for 70yearolds 10 for 75yearolds and 12 for 80year olds but rams may become bad financial choice long before the net annuity becomes negative for example the net annuity becomes negative at 9 for 70year old but would it make economic sense for 70yearold to mortgage the home and only receive net income of 380 monthly when interest rates are 6 t able 1 comparison of monthly re v erse annuity mor tgage benefits age of

75year old female obtained ram and died af ter receiving 12 payments the estate would owe 200000 even though the owner only received 19332 in gross benefits of course the owner could have purchased an annuity with 10 years certain option or cash refund option the 10 years certain option provides that if the annuitant lives less than ten years after the plan is issued the payments would continue to the beneficiarys estate until the 10year period is completed the cash refund option provides that if the total payments to the annuitant are less than the original premium in this example 200000 the beneficiary would receive the balance in lump sum these options reduce the monthly annuity payments and thereby reduce the financial viability of the ram under rams the risks for lenders are that the owner may live too long mortality risk the purchase of the annuity shifts the mortality risk to an insurance company though the concept appeared promising crs is aware of only one program that offered rams though they were not marketed as such in the 1990s homefirst subsidiary of transamerica corporation offered reverse mortgage plan in many parts of the country under the socalled lifetime plan the borrower would receive monthly loan advances for specified number of years deferred annuity was purchased from metropolitan life insurance company on behalf of the borrower and it would begin lifetime monthl annuity payments once the borrower received the last loan advance the borrower would receive lifetime income regardless of whether they continued to occupy the property by the late 1990s there were several complaints regarding the reverse mortgages from homefirst an extreme example is illustrated by the case of new york woman she took out reverse mortgage and received loan advances until she died after receiving 32 monthly payments when her home was sold few months later financial freedom homefirst demanded more than

monthly payments she had received during the life of the loan totaled about 580005 as result of this case and similar cases three class action lawsuits were filed against transamerica homefirst inc transamerica corporation metropolitan life insurance company and financial freedom senior fu nding corporation the cases were combined and settled before single judge in the superior court of califo

for specified period under tenure reverse mortgage the borrower is provided with income for as long as they continue to occupy the property from the lenders perspective reverse mortgages are deferredpayment loans the lender makes stream of payments or lumpsum payment to the homeowner and expects repayment at some future date the repayment is predicated upon the sale of the home at some price which exceeds the debt that has accumulated against the home the largest risk the lender faces is the risk that over time the outstanding debt may grow to be greater than the property value this may be referred to as collateral risk collateral risk is partly determined by the type of reverse mortgage the least risky reverse mortgage is the term reverse mortgage under which payments stop after specified number of years payments to the homeowner are calculated so that the loan reaches target balance at the predetermined period that target balance is less than 100 of the property value when the loan was originated as long as the property has not depreciated during the period the lender is assured that sale of the property will provide sufficient funds to repay the loan for lenders the most risky reverse mortgage is the tenure reverse mortgage because the borrower is guaranteed lifetime income and lifetime occupancy of the home in this case the collateral risk may be significant if the age of entry is too low if property appreciation rates are overestimated or if occupant survival rates are underestimated in general prior to the 1990s lenders were only willing to make term reverse mortgages the payment options under these term reverse mortgages are relatively easy to calculateall that is needed is the interest rate the term of the an and the endofterm loan balance with

time three major reverse mortgage products have become available to consumers in the us they are the home equity conversion mortgage program hecm the home keeper reverse mortgage and the cash account plan at present relatively new reverse mortgage the senior equity reverse mortgage is only available in arizona california delaware the district of columbia florida georgia maryland north carolina south carolina texas and virginia all of the plans provide the borrower with li fetime occupancy of the hometenure reverse mortgages the availability of tenure reverse mortgages is likely the cause of the dramatic growth of reverse mortgages in the past few years these tenure reverse mortgages also provide the borrower with flexibility on how the income from the mortgage is received borrower may recei ve monthly payments as long as the property is occupied by the borrower the borrower may receive line of credit which grows at some specified annual rate and upon which the borrower may make draws as needed the borrower may choose to receive large upfront cash advance or the borrower may choose any combination of the above such as smaller cash advance line of credit and monthly income the

housing and community development act of 1987 pl 100242 authorized the home equity conversion mortgage program hecm in the department of housing and urban development hud as demonstration program it was the first nationwide reverse mortgage program which offered the possibility of lifetime occupancy to elderly homeowners6 as noted above such mortgages are referred to as tenure reverse mortgages the borrowers must be elderly homeowners who own and occupy their homes 7 the interest rate on the loan may be fixed or adjustable8 the homeowner and the lender may agree to share in any future appreciation in the value of the property9 the program has been made permanent and the law was amended to permit its use for oneto fourfamily residences if the owner occupies one of the units 10 the borrower can choose from five payment plans tenureequal monthly payments as long as at least one borrower lives and continues to occupy the property as principal residence termequal monthly payments

law provided that the hecm loan may not exceed the federal housing administration fha mortgage limit for the area in which the property is located the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 pl 110289 establishes hecm limit equal to the conforming loan limit for the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac the mortgage must be first mortgage which in essence implies that any previous mortgage must be fully repaid either prior to the hecm or from the initial proceeds of the hecm prior to obtaining loan borrowers must be provided with counseling by third parties who will explain the financial implications of entering into home equity conversion mortgages as well as explain the options other than home equity conversion mortgages that may be available to elderly homeowners to prevent displacement of the elderly homeowners hecms must include terms that give the homeowner the option of deferring repayment of the loan until the death of the homeowner the voluntary sale 6 the mortgages were not initially available in texas because state law prohibited reverse mortgages texas law has been subsequently amended to permit reverse mortgages 7 if the property has multiple owners the youngest owner must be at least 62 years of age 8 virtually all of the hecm loans are sold to the federal national mortgage association fannie mae since lenders generally make hecm loans with the in tention of selling them to fannie mae and since fannie mae only buys hecm loans that have adjustable rates all hecm ans are made with adjustable interest rates 9 fannie mae will not buy hecm loans that feature equity sharing so none are made with this feature 10 section 593 of pl105276

estimates that more than 125 million homeowners age 65 older have homes that are free of mortgage debt with the growth in the public cost of longterm care for the elderly there has been research and discussion of ways that elderly homeowners may use reverse mortgages to tap this home equity and fund their own longterm care

directly primarily this would involve paying for home modifications and inhome care that would permit them to ageinplace under its use your home to stay at home initiative the national council for the aging ncoa is encouraging th use of reverse mortgages to fund longterm care of the nearly 28 million american households age 62 and older ncoa has found that about 132 million 48 are good candidates for reverse mortgage according to ncoa an estimated 953 billion could be available from reverse mortgages for immediate longterm care needs and to promote aging in place 16 that 953 billion figure however appears to have been calculated by assuming that the homeowners would on average be eligible for about 72200 in reverse mortgage loans and then multiplying by the 132 million potential reverse mortgage candidates in effect that is assuming 100 participation rate the 2005 american housing survey estimates that of the 178 million homes owned by the elderly only 64000 or 04 have reverse mortgages 17 by using reverse mortgages some of the elderly would be able to fund their longterm care expenses for number of years and thereby delay potential entry into the medicaid program it is debatable however whether and how much savings this approach would provide for the medicaid program the medicaid program has the ultimate claim on the home equity of program participants if participants fund their care through reverse mortgages they may use up most or all of their equity so there may be little or none left to be claimed by medicaid there may be cases where the net cost to the medicaid program would be less if the participants had entered the medicaid program earlier instead of consuming their equity through reverse mortgages 15 but the cash account plan is not available in all states so this may not be an option for some homeowners 16 stucki barbara r use your home to stay at home expanding the use of reverse mortgages for longterm care blueprint for action

insurance ltci is another option for elderly homeowners the demographics of reverse mortgages and longterm care insurance do not match for either consumers or the industry longterm care insurers want young consumers reverse mortgage lenders want old consumers for consumers ltci is best taken at an older age when the benefits are greater but the premiums are more expensive for insurers the major risk is that the purchasers will get sick too soon and need longterm care before they have paid enough premiums into the insurance fund for reverse mortgage lenders the major risk is that the borrower will live too long and accumulate debt against the property which exceeds the property value the different risks result in different outcomes for consumers with the same profile for example insurers are reluctant to provide insura nce to borrowers with certain health problems because of the likelihood that the borrowers may need to use the insurance lenders however will make reverse mortgages to such borrowers because there is less likelihood that the borrowers will occupy the property too long the cost of the insurance is another issue in recent years insurers have raised the insurance premiums on current customers this suggests that homeowner who used reverse mortgage to purchase longterm care insurance could face the risk that the cost of the policy could increase at some later date that would not be problem if the homeowner could afford the increased cost but if the increase were unaffordable the borrower would have to drop the insurance if this occurred it might be possible that the borrower would still have some paidup benefits but the level of coverage would be less than the borrower had planned when initially purchasing the policy

reverse mortgage enables an elderly homeowner to use the equity in the home to receive monthly income line of credit or some combination of the two repayments are delayed until the home is longer occupied as principal residence then the borrower or the heirs must repay the loan if the home is sold and the sales price exceeds the loan balance the borrower or the heirs keep any proceeds that remain 19 if the sales price is less than the loan ba lance then the lender suffers the loss the funds received from the reverse mortgage are tax free because the funds are considered as loan proceeds instead of income the payments from reverse mortgages do not affect the income or eligibility from social security or medicare bu t homeowners who receive supplemental security income ssi or medicaid 20 might have these benefits reduced if the recipients do not spend their entire sum received under the reverse mortgage each month when considering reverse mortgage several questions should be addressed participants may be provided with lifetime occupancy but will borrowers generate sufficient income to meet future health care needs will they obtain equity conversion loans when they are too young and as result have limited resources from which to draw when they are older and more frail and sick table 7 shows that the younger elderly will accumulate significant debt against the homes if they live too long will the young elderly spend the extra income on travel and luxury consumer items should home equity conversion mechanisms be limited as last resort options for elderly homeowners will some of the home equity be conserved 19 selling the home is not requirement the borrower or th heirs have the option of keeping the home and obtaining loan or using other funds to repay the

years more than 107500 loans were made in fy2007 compared to little more than 157 in 1990 what does this mean for hud since the department has potential liability for these loans as noted previously one of the greatest risks for lenders is that the borrower will live too long and that the loan balance will exceed the home valuecollateral risk under the hecm program this risk falls to hud because the lender can assign the loan to hud in those cases the collateral risk then becomes potential liability for the fha insurance fund when hud accepts the assignment of hecm loans hud becomes responsible for future borrower advances or fixed payments until termination of the loan due to the death of the homeowner the refinancing of the loan or the sale of the home at the end of fy2007 the

accumulate at that life expectancy column 5 show what loan balance would be accumulated if the borrower defies the life tables and lives and occupies the home until age 95 column 6 shows the potential liability to hud if the borrower survives to age 95 column 5 of table 7 may also be interpreted as the sales price and home value that must be obtained at the sale of the house in order for the lender to break even assuming transaction costs if borrower obtains hecm at age 62 the originally 200000 home must be worth about 313000 at the borrowers life expectancy and nearly 833000 if the borrower lives and occupies the property to age 95 the table suggests that at the expected life of the borrower there is little collateral risk for hud when making hecms to homeowners age 70 and above loans to younger borrowers are more risky if borrowers lived to age 95 there would be significant collateral risk for homeowners younger than 80 years old when obtaining hecm

for seniors in the 21st century suggests that the explosive growth of reverse mortgages may backfire for both elderly homeowners and the nations cities26 he suggests that society should not romanticize the notion of older people aging in place in their homes and be blind to the downside according to golant the downside is that reverse mortgages encourage the elderly to remain in older housing that may be unsafe because of physical deficiencies holders of reverse mortgages are disproportionately poor they often are in their 70s and 80s and more likely to live alone more than half occupy dwellings that are at least 40 years old which means they are more likely to live in houses with physical deficiencies they often do not make improvements in their homes that could help them avoid accidents golant sugge sts that we are doing disservice to elderly homeowners by encouraging them to remain in such homes instead the homes could be sold to younger home buyers who are more likely to make improvements to the homes which would contribute to revitalization of neighborhoods golant suggests that although the elderly may prefer to remain in their own homes many woul d be
