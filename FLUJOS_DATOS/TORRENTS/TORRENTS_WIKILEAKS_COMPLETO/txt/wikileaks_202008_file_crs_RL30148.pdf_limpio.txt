chronological history of us assistance to the soviet union and the new independent states nis to the end of 2001 focusing on administration and congressional actions proposals policy pronouncements debate and legislation rather than the details of program implementation in the field during 1991 the thrust of the debate between congress and the administration was whether and how to assist the soviet union as it became increasingly unstable and then headed toward dissolution chiefly concerned with the effect of the regions instability on its nuclear weapons holdings congress responded with the nunnlugar legislation in 1992 the aid debate focused on the freedom support act legislative proposal that laid out the basic authorities conditions and guidelines for technical assistance program in 1993 the clinton administration proposed several new priorities for the program and dramatic increase in the amount of funding especially for russia in all the president requested 25 billion for the region after considerable debate congress approved the request but by 1994 mix of concerns regarding the us budget deficit the unpromising outcome of the december 1993 russian parliamentary elections the ames spy case and critical questions about the implementation of the assistance program led to efforts some successful to cut funding for the region and alter existing priorities in 1995 the new republican majority in the 104th congress cut funds to the region through series of rescissions and lowered levels of funding in the annual foreign aid bill russia was particular target of these cuts as well as of conditionality and funding earmarks favoring other nis countries in 1996 the tone of debate was lower pitched and congress adopted aid levels earmarks and conditions almost identical to those of the previous year in 1997 responding to the administrations partnership for freedom initiative congress approved significa nt increase in assistance for the nis the initiative promised to place greater emphasis on grassroots peopletopeople exchanges and partnerships in 1998 nis account levels were raised again amid concerns regarding the financial stability of the region in the wake of the august financial crisis in russia in 1999 the approved overall fy2000 funding level was roughly the same as the year before but large amount was diverted from traditional economic assistance to nonproliferation activities under the expanded threat reduction initiative in 2000 criticism of russias behavior and accusations that the administration mishandled usrussian relations contributed to multiple efforts to condition assistance to russia in 2001 the need to obtain cooperation from former soviet union countries in the war on terrorism and what was seen as very forthcoming stance by russia and critical central asian countries led to reevaluation of aid relations with them and other front line stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148contents aid to the soviet

introduce perestroika in the late 1980s the collapse of the soviet union at the end of 1991 and the difficult economic and political challenges faced by its successor states since then have continually raised the issue of providing us humanitarian economic and other aid in order to help effect transition to democracy and free markets in the region this report provides chronologica l history of us assistance to the soviet union and the 12 successor states of the former soviet union fsu to the end of 2001 it focuses on congressional and executive branch proposals legislation and debate because of the immense needs in the fsu and the limits on us resources the issue of assistance has been treated by the united states as an international concern to be dealt with both bilaterally and multilaterally therefore other donor activities are also briefly discussed1 aid to the soviet union during the years of cold war the possibility of providing what is commonly considered foreign aid grant or concessional assistance rarely surfaced as an issue among us policymakers trade relations were major nonmilitary concern as relations warmed beginning in the 1970s and agriculture or other export credit guarantees and provision of most favored nation status not aid were the carrots held up to encourage change in the region the events of the late 1980s that led to the fall of the berlin wall and the opening up of the eastern bloc countries began to change all that beginning in late 1990 the united states sought to influence the struggle between reformists and hardliners within the soviet union by offering modest technical and medical assistance as well as increased credit guarantees nevertheless to the extent to which the soviet union was still viewed with suspicion and foreignhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs2 aid was seen as gift strong reluctance to provide assistance remained on the part of the bush administration as well as many members of congress it was not until the attempted coup of august 1991 and the subsequent rise of democratic movement led by boris yeltsin that us congressional leaders began to talk about large levels of assistance designed to encourage changes in economic political and security policies in the still extant soviet union several members of congress argued that provision of assistance was in the us national interest and successfully won approval of assistance to help the soviet union dismantle nuclear weapons finally just prior to the dissolution of the soviet union the bush administration came forward with proposal for the first significant technical assistance program developments before 1991 through most of the cold war years us administrations provided few direct economic aid grants concessional loans or other benefits to their chief rival the soviet union indeed normal trade was severely restricted by law the united states did on few occasions provide emergency disaster assistance as in the case of the chernobyl nuclear disaster and the armenian earthquake the united states had also extended commodity credit corporation ccc export subsidies in fy1964 and fy19721973 and direct ccc credits in fy1973fy1974 with the establishment of detente in the 1970s the united states began to shift its attitude on the question of normalizing trade with the soviet union though still barring foreign assistance bilateral trade agreement was signed in 1974 providing for mutual granting of mostfavorednation mfn status the agreement provided the soviets access to us governmentbacked credits and other trade benefits however congress attached number of conditions leading the soviets to reject the accord the stevenson amendment to the exportimport bank act and the byrd amendment to the 1974 trade act set ceiling of 300 million on the total amount of export loans and guarantees that could be made to the soviet union without direct congressional approval the jacksonvanik amendment to the trade act of 1974 linked mfn and us credits to soviet emigration policy mikhail gorbachevs rise to the soviet leadership in 1985 and his subsequent efforts to introduce sweeping political and economic reforms brought us support for closer bilateral economic relations in 1987 the soviet union gained access to subsidies for us wheat purchases under the department of agricultures export enhancement program eep new ussoviet trade agreement was signed at the washington summit in june 1990 president bush determined that the supreme soviet must enact free emigration law before he would submit the trade agreement to congress for approval the soviet legislature approved such law on may 20 1991 on august 2 1991 the president submitted the ussoviet trade agreement for congressional approval at senate finance committee hearing on september 11 1991 administration officials urged congressional approval the agreement was resubmitted on october 9 1991 without inclusion of the newly independent baltic states and measure hjres 346 approving extension of mostfavorednation treatment for soviet goods became law pl 102197 on december 9 1991 president bush also pledged to work to integrate the soviet union into the world economy initially by supporting soviet associate or observer status in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs3 international monetary fund imf and other international bodies in july 1990 the administration presented soviet foreign minister shevardnadze with paper outlining areas of economic and agricultural reform in which the united states could offer technical assistance such as market development food distribution and storage the administration also reversed its earlier opposition to soviet membership in the european bank for reconstruction and development during the course of 1990 the internal struggle between proponents and opponents of soviet reform intensified while economic conditions deteriorated for the first time the soviet leadership directly appealed for us and western food and medical assistance european governments moved quickly to provide assistance to the soviets germany took the lead with an 8 billion aid package that was part of an agreement on german reunification other european community countries pledged over 1 billion in the united states debate continued through much of 1990 over whether how and under what conditions the united states should assist moscow the administration at first expressed wariness about largescale aid even though it had philosophically adopted the goal of supporting president gorbachev it cited the fact that food shortages in the soviet union were due not to lack of production the soviet union had record harvest in 1990 but to distribution problems and the absence of market mechanisms administration spokesmen and some in congress also expressed concern that aid now might take pressure off the soviet leadership from implementing needed reforms the presidents assistance offer of december 1990 on december 12 1990 in response to soviet request for urgent food and medical assistance president bush announced the first major us assistance package it included provision of up to 1 billion in commod ity credit corporation ccc credit guarantees for soviet purchase of agricultural goods authorization of up to 300 million in exportimport bank credits for purchase of us goods the maximum allowed under the 1974 stevensonbyrd amendment to the exportimport bank act without further congressional approval an offer of technical assistance to improve food distribution and implement other economic reforms and pledge of 5 million for publicpriva medical assistance program to address soviet shortages of medicine and medical supplies under the international disaster relief program finally the president announced that the united states would propose that the soviet union be given special association with the imf and world bank this association however would not allow moscow to draw on imf loans to extend ccc and eximbank credits to moscow the president waived the jacksonvanik amendment subsection 402c2a of the trade act of 1974 he transmitted the waiver to congress on december 29 1990 citing the high level of emigration permitted by the soviet union in 1990 and assurances from the soviet government that those high levels of emigration would continue he renewed the waiver on june 3 1991 citing continuing soviet reductions in barriers to emigrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs4 developments in 1991 on february 6 1991 the administration announced that it would send medical aid directly to the baltic states lithuania latvia and estonia following the soviet military crackdown and bloodshe d there in january 1991 under this program the us agency for international development aid paid for administrative and some transportation costs for medicines and medical supplies donated by private american sources the shipments which were designed to demonstrate us concern about the baltic states were part of broader policy of increased official contacts with the individual soviet republics on february 27 1991 the first such shipment planeload of medical supplies was delivered to the baltics and to the victims of the chernobyl nuclear accident in ukraine during 1991 donated pharmaceuticals and medical supplies valued at 26 million were supplied to the baltic states and republics of the soviet union in april 1991 the soviet union after exhausting the initial 1 billion in us ccc credits requested another 15 billion in agricultural loan guarantees request president bush approved on june 12 1991 the presidents decision followed soviet assurances that the grains would be fairly distributed among soviet republics and the baltic states this offer did not require new congressional approval postcoup assistance the aborted coup attempt in august 1991 renewed the issue of increasing us and other western aid germany france and italy especially called for higher amounts of assistance to democratic forces in the soviet union other leaders including president bush were more cautious arguing that it was premature to make decisions on future assistance until rigorous and comprehensive soviet economic reform program was in place on september 10 1991 while on factfinding trip to the soviet union secretary of state baker indicated shift in this us position he said that the soviets did not need to have taken the steps but had to have made commitment and plan toward free market economic reforms to receive us aid some congressional leaders pressed for quicker and additional us action house majority leader richard gephardt proposed longterm program of up to 3 billion year in assistance in return for economic reforms house armed services committee chairman aspin proposed using defense funds to finance higher levels of us aid in the following months as the soviet union sank deeper into disarray number of actions supporting further aid were taken agricultural credit guarantees during the attempted coup president bush put brief hold on this program but resumed it when the coup failed of 500 million second tranche originally planned for release in october 315 million was made available immediately on october 1 1991 the administration released the remaining 585 million 185 million of the october tranche and 400 million originally scheduled to be released in february 1992 it also made the guarantees available at more favorable terms 100 of the principal and about 56 of the interest on private bank loans to finance these purchases were guaranteed on october 22 1991 president bush received request from president gorbachev for 25 billion in us agricultural credit guarantees and 1 billion inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs5 humanitarian aid usda officials who made several needs assessment trips to the soviet union expressed the view that famine was unlikely in the soviet union but that severe hardships were probable because of distribution problems and lack of cooperation among soviet republics us ambassador to the soviet union robert strauss on november 18 urged the united states to provide food and debt relief to the soviets on november 20 1991 the bush administration offered further aid package including 125 billion in agricultural guarantees the credit guarantees were made available in installments 500

supplemental appropriations act hjres 157 pl 102229 signed into law december 12 1991 appropriated these funds the weapons destruction program became known as the nunnlugar program december 1991 bush administration proposals since the attempted coup in august 1991 the bush administration had been perceived by many members of congress as slow to respond to the new wave of events in the soviet union one possible reason was an antiforeign policy trend among the us electorate that expressed itself in the november offyear election campaign for senate seat from pennsylvania during which president bush was heavily criticized for spending too much of his time on foreign affairs to the detriment of the us economy the administration played little role in development and passage of the nunnlugar program finally on december 12 1991 four days after creation of the commonwealth of independent states secretary of state baker outlined actions the us government would pursue to help safeguard or destroy soviet weapons establish democratic institutions stabilize the economy and overcome dire food and medical shortages these included doubling the amount of medical assistance thus far provided sending surplus desert storm food stocks to regions in particular need augmenting ongoing usia programs and working with congress to establish peace corps programs and 100 million technical assistance program president bush named thendeputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger coordinator for us assistance efforts toward the fsu to discuss the division of labor and responsibilities for assisting the region he proposed hosting an international donors conference in january 1992 other donor assistance up to the end of 1991 germany provided the largest amount of bilateral assistance to the soviet union part of it connected to the german unification process expenditure and planned commitments by germany since 1989 totaled more than 45 billion by early 1992 part of this amount was grants and direct subsidies relating to the transition agreement on the withdrawal of soviet troops including building housing in russia for departing soviet soldiers from the territory of the former german democratic republic gdr in 1991 japan had pledged about 108 million in emergency loans for food and medical supplies on october 9 1991 it had announced 25 billion package providing about 2 billion in export insurance and credits and approximately 500 million in loans to allow purchase of food and medicine throughout 1991 japan sided with the united states in opposing calls for increased assistance to the region at this time the european community ec was the major multilateral donor to the soviet union on december 15 1990 the ec pledged nearly 1 billion in food aid onethird as grant and twothirds as credit guarantees and about 14 billion in technical assistance for 1991 and 1992 in january 1991 it put temporary hold on assistance to moscow in response to the baltic crackdown but the ec aid program was resumed at the end of february apparently based on the ecs perception that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs7 soviets were easing military pressures in the baltics on october 7 1991 the ec announced an additional 15 billion in food aid credits for the soviet union part of the new ec credits was to be earmarked to buy food from eastern europe including the baltic states in order to benefit their struggling economies the ec challenged the united states and japan to meet its offer in december 1991 at the maastricht summit the ec decided to send about 260 million of food and medicine to moscow and st petersburg aid to the former soviet union on december 21 1991 the soviet union formally ceased to exist the dozen independent states that took its place presented new challenge to us foreign policymakers who determined that it was in the best interest of the united states to seek to facilitate transition from communi st political and economic systems to democracies and free market economies during 1992 debate ensued regarding the legislative framework for an assistan ce program for the region and the appropriate level of appropriations to meet us objectives soon after taking office in 1993 the clinton administration determined that the needs of the region were far greater than the previous administration had presumed it proposed dramatic increase in foreign assistance especially for russia and set some new sectoral priorities for the program although congress approved these initiatives by 1994 number of key leaders had become somewhat critical of aspects of the program they expressed concern regarding the way in which the program was being implemented the speed of implementation the level of coordination and its visible impact some criticized the administration for its perceived emphasis on russia and on boris yeltsin in particular support for the program previously broadly bipartisan appeared to be in danger by the end of 1994 developments in 1992 the international donors conference on january 22 and 23 1992 the united states convened conference of foreign ministers of 47 potential donor governments and representatives of seven international organizations to discuss coordination of assistance activities for the former soviet republics the conference focused on five key areas food medicine energy shelter and technical assistance working groups were established to develop plan of action and decide on next steps to be taken in those priority areas followup conference was scheduled to be held in lisbon portugal in the spring of 1992 and another followup meeting in japan late in the year representatives of the working groups met in minsk on february 1 1992 with representatives of aid recipient states of the former soviet union in opening the donors conference president bush pledged pending congressi onal approval 645 million in additional assistance from fy1992 and fy1993 funds including 500 million for

the stevenson and byrd amendment restrictions on provision of export credits and provided the president with authority to provide additional fy1992 humanitarian and technical assistance to the fsu from existing economic support fund esf resources the administration decided to allocate 150 million from esf in addition to the 85 million allocated in december 1991 the freedom support act on april 1 1992 president bush outlined comprehensive package of assistance to the fsu it included number of new initiatives that would establish us policy with regard to the states of the former soviet union and would provide various forms of assistance to them he also reiterated previous aid proposals that would contribute toward his new policy initiatives first the president announced us participation in multilateral g7 24 billion package of support for russia the us contribution to that package was estimated at roughly 45 billion in old and new funds commitment of 15 billion toward 6 billion ruble stabilization fund 1 billion of 45 billion in imf world bank and european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd loans counted as part of the regular us contribution to those organizations and 2 billion of an 11 billion g7 contribution in bilateral aid largely composed of ccc credit guarantees eximbank loan guarantees and some humanitarian assistance second the president proposed legislation that would in the words of secretary of state baker unite the executive and legislative branches around bipartisan program that can mobilize the american people in support of assistance for the former soviet union the freedom for russia and emerging eurasian democracies and open markets support act of 1992 was submitted to congress on april 3 and introduced as s 2532 on april 7 in addition to providing broad authority for the conduct of wide range of humanitarian and technical assistance programs the freedom support act proposal included authorization of us commitment to an earlier agreed 12 billion increase in the us quota to the imf intended for all countries but expected to benefit the former soviet union an endorsement of ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs9 participation in amounts up to 3 billion for the proposed currency stabilization funds and elimination of existing restrictive cold war trade and aid legislation finally the president offered 11 billion in ccc agricultural credit guarantees 600 million for russia and 500 million for the other states the credit offer did not require additional congressional approval the administration reiterated its humanitarian and technical assistance request for fy1992 150 million eventually drawn from existing esf resources rather than in new supplemental funds as originally sought and fy1993 470 million that was included in the aid fy1993 congressional budget presentation the administration asked congress to approve the freedom support act and any subsequent appropriations legislation prior to the visit to the united states of president yeltsin in midjune the senate foreign relations committee markedup the bill on may 13 with an extensive amendment of its own srept 102292 this bill s 2532 was extensively amended before its final adoption by the full senate on july 2 by vote of 7620 in the house of representatives the foreign affairs committee used previously introduced aid authorization measure hr 4547 as the basis for its markup on june 10 hrept 102569 the house approved hr 4547 on august 6 by vote of 255 to 164 the senate bill s 2532 was then brought up and amended by substituting the language of hr 4547 in the end the freedom support act as amended by congress was signed into law as pl 102511 on october 24 1992 as enacted s 2532 authorized 5058 million in fy1993 divided into several broad areas 410 million in humanitarian and technical assistance 708 million for various educational exchange programs and 25 million for state department and usia expenses for the region in its most controversial provision the bill authorized 12 billion increase in the us quota to the imf intended for all countries but expected to benefit the fsu although the provision would incur new outlays because the contribution in budgetary terms represented an exchange of assets and would not affect the budget deficit it did require an appropriation and was therefore perceived by some members and the public as large new foreign aid expense the act also endorsed us participation in amounts up to 3 billion for the proposed currency stabilization funds this too required new outlays and did not require an appropriation as the imf already held the necessary funds and eliminated many existing restrictive cold war trade and aid legislative provisions for greater detail on the history of the debate on the freedom support act see crs report 93907 the former soviet union and us foreign assistance in 1992 the role of congress fy1993 appropriations funding for these activities

organizations that attended the conference expressed their concern over concentrating strictly on shortterm emergency aid to stress medium and longterm assistance the world bank was appointed to lead donor aid coordination in the future the bank set up country consultative groups ccgs for each of the new republic s to improve the overall efficiency of longerterm donor assistance developments in 1993 although russia survived the winter of 199293 despite dire predictions made by various analysts its economic and political status was increasing ly precarious russia was roughly 6 billion behind in debt payments on total 80 to 85 billion debt and suffered an inflation rate of 2000 in 1992 the imf had put the foreign official financing requirements of russia at 22 billion for 1993 many observers feared that social unrest resulting from the economic policy reforms needed to obtain further foreign financing endangered the entire venture into market economy former president richard nixon former us ambassador to russia robert strauss and members of congress among others argued that increased us aid would be necessary to help the new republics succeed the crux of their view was that the economic and political stability of the region was of vital importance to us interests arguing in floor speech on march 4 1993 that the us defense budget would be 100 billion greater in the next year if the soviet union still existed as military threat senator leahy chairman of the senate foreign operations subcommittee of the appropriations committee called for 1 billion aid program he suggested that security assistance then provided to other parts of the world could be shifted to russia if it was deemed of greater importance to us interests it was in this atmosphere that the clinton administration took office clinton administration in its original fy1994 foreign aid request the new clinton administration proposed 7038 million for the fsu humanitariantechnical assistance account an increase of roughly 287 million from the fy1993 level of 417 million it also requested 400 million from the fy1994 defense budget for nonproliferation activities however increasing concerns regarding the economic and political stability of russia and consequent chorus in the united states calling for an aggressive us response led the clinton administration to give high priority to russia and the issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs11 of further assistance in its incipient foreign policy pronouncements on march 5 1993 the president pledged to take new action to help provide innovative solutions to russias problems including financial assistance efforts the administration also indicated its desire to work with the g7 nations to formulate package of assistance more efficacious than the 24 billion promised in april 1992 but that the russians and some american analysts assert was never fully delivered most estimates of actual disbursements range from 11 billion to 18 billion rather than wait for the july tokyo conference of g7 heads of state the president and other g7 leaders agreed to have their representatives discuss the aid issue at meeting on march 1314 in hong kong at the presidents suggestion representative from russia was invited to participate that meeting was concluded with the promise that an aid package expected to be targeted and more visible to the average russian citizen affected by the economic reform process would be forthcoming within several weeks vancouver summit initiative on april 4 1993 immediately following his vancouver summit meeting with russian president yeltsin president clinton announced 16 billion package of us assistance to russia all of the programs utilized fy1993 resources and none of the funds required new appropriations from congress of the total 924 million 700 million in food for progress program agricultural loans 194 million in food grants and 30 million in medical and maternalchild health grants was additional to that already designated for russia and the fsu roughly 676 million was derived from fy1993 funds and programs previously expected to go to the fsu if not for russia specifically although the package may not have been entirely new aspects of it suggested shift from the bush administration approach the terms of loans for agricultural commodities were made more concessional apparently responding to the view that the previously used ccc credit guarantee program was trade program not foreign assistance and inappropriate for country that was having difficulty repaying its debts another policy change was an increase in assistance levels targeted at privatization from 20 million to 60 million many believed that the more quickly and extensively privatization occurred the more irreversible the new revolution would be the clinton administration also targeted funds at resettling russian military officers to facilitate withdrawal from the baltics 6 million would be used to build 450 houses for officers returning to russia and to provide employment training to assist their return to civilian life the administration also proclaimed its intention to make its assistance more highly visible to the average russian citizen than the earlier aid program the president claimed that 75 of the assistance would be used outside moscow and the same proportion would be provided to nongovernmental bodies the democracy initiatives announced at the summit were to be directly targeted at the average person the administration intended to bring together range of exchanges and training programs to encourage persontoperson contacts between americans and russians the appointment of presidential friend strobe talbott as ambassador at large for the newly independent states was one sign of the administrations desire to give the aid issue higher priority at the summit the president announced further moves in this direction including appointment of vice president gore to cochair ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs12 commission on technological cooperat ion with the russian prime minister commerce secretary ron brown to cochair business development committee with the deputy foreign minister and appointment of fulltime ombudsman to facilitate us investment the importance of trade often viewed as substitute for largescale assistance was given some prominence in the summit announcement the administration stated its support of russian membership in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and access to the generalized system of preferences granted september 22 1993 it included in the aid package credit and guarantee agreements that were being negotiated for some months an 82 million exportimport credit for caterpillar inc machinery to be used on gas pipeline project and 150 million guarantee from the overseas private investment corp for an oil project by duponts conoco inc unit it also promised to try to push to completion by april 14 2 billion exportimport oil and gas loan the deal was finally signed on july 6 1993 and the first payment 245 million was approved in march 1994 finally the administration outlined 215 million in further proposed uses for the 800 million nonproliferation fund that was appropriated in the defense budget for fy1992 and fy1993 130 million would go for dismantling nuclear delivery vehicles 75 million for warhead storage facilities and 10 million for nuclear materials accountability and control there had been some criticism of the bush administration for moving slowly on utilizing the fund although disagreements between russia and ukraine on nuclear disarmament were in part responsible for delays at vancouver president yeltsin extracted promise from president clinton that the united states would review outmoded legal restrictions on trade and other relations that treated russia as though we were still communist country as result of that review the administration transmitted to congress on july 27 1993 the friendship with russia ukraine and other new independent states act approved by congress in november and signed into law on december 17 1993 pl 103199 although it eliminated many vestiges of cold war legislation it did not affect the two restrictions of greatest concern to russia the jacksonvanik amendment and cocom restrictions on technology exports the latter however were dismantled on march 31 1994 april 15 1993 bilateral us aid proposal and congressional response according to the president the summit package was only the first step of us effort to assist russia the second step was the april 15 284 billion g7 package not counting the 15 billion public debt rescheduling that occurred on april 2 which rested on imf and other multilateral organization financial resources the third step was 18 billion us assistance package announced at the conclusion of the midapril g7 meeting of finance and foreign ministers and approved by congress on september 30 1993 along with the fy1994 request arriving at funding mechanism for the proposal however required extensive negotiations between the administration and congress meeting on may 26 the house foreign operations subcommittee approved the 18 billion assistance proposal of that amount 16 billion was included as an fy1993 supplementalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs13 attached to the fy1994 foreign operations appropriations bill because there was insufficient money left under the foreign assistance budget cap for fy1993 appropriators turned to the defense budget for additional funds with the agreement of the chairman of the house defense appropriations subcommittee 979 million of the package would be drawn from supplemental fy1993 defense funds 630 million would come from fy1993 foreign assistance supplemental appropriation the remaining 200 million would be added to the fy1994 foreign operations appropriations bill the house passed the measure hr 2295 by vote of 309111 on june 17 an effort sponsored by conservatives and members of the congressional black caucus to remove the 16 billion fy1993 supplemental increase for the fsu was defeated by vote of 289140 following weeks of negotiations over whether to use defense funds as part of the russian aid package the senate foreign operations appropriations subcommittee met on september 12 1993 and approved full funding of the presidents request although the subcommittee followed the same formula used by the house the senate panel made two important modifications by earmarking 300 million specifically for ukraine and shifting 300 million of the broad technical and humanitarian aid proposal to the exportimport bank for loans and guarantees of us exports to the fsu the bill further designated specific amounts of the combined fy19931994 25 billion package for selected programs amounts that were similar but not exactly the same as those recommended by the president prior to senate consideration of hr 2295 political crisis erupted in russia on september 21 1993 when president yeltsin dissolved the legislature and called for elections yeltsin was challenged by parliament hardliners who declared his actions unconstitutional and sought to take power congressional supporters of russian assistance endorsed yeltsins decisions and argued that it was even more critical for congress to move forward with the aid package to demonstrate continuing us support for economic and political reform in russia two days later on september 23 the senate approved hr 2295 including the full 25 billion fy19931994 aid proposal for the fsu during debate however senators added number of conditions many of which were adopted in modified form in the final bill while the political crisis in moscow continued congress finalized action and the president signed hr 2295 including the 25 billion fsu aid package on september 30 rapid congressional consideration resulted from both congress desire to signal support for president yeltsin and perhaps more importantly to enact the legislation prior to the end of the fiscal year after which the fy1993 supplemental funds 16 billion for russia would longer have been available finding the necessary money entirely out of fy1994 appropr iations would have presented considerable obstacles given the declining budgets for foreign aid and defense and the desire by many to maintain domestic spending levels as shown in table 2 congress generally agreed with the administrations plan for allocating the 25 billion one of the most notable changes was the 300 million transfer to the export import bank action taken primarily so that eximbank loans and guarantees for russia and the other fsu nations did not come at the expense of financial backing for other countries lawmakers also expressed their intent that this not be an aid package exclusively for russia but that it provide at least onethird ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs14 the total for the other states this was consistent with administration estimates the final bill further recommended that ukraine receive at least 300 million and armenia 18 million although congress approved the package members attached conditions some allowing presidential waiver that would affect whether russia and the other former republics remained eligible for american aid among the most significant were russian government must be making progress in implementing comprehensive economic reforms russian government must not use aid to expropriate or seize ownershi p or control of assets investments or

summit planned for july g7 sherpas met in march and finance and foreign ministers met on april 1415 to come up with package of assistance that might have an impact on the april 25 referendum on yeltsins leadership the result was 434 billion assistance plan this included 142 billion in currency stabilization support efforts utilizing the 6 billion stabilization fund approved by the g7 in 1992 3 billion imf systemic transformation facility 41 billion imf standby loan and 11 billion in world bank import assistance further 142 billion was to be drawn from world bank ebrd and bilateral export credits and guarantees for import assistance the package included an already announced april 2 1993 15 billion paris club public debt rescheduling that allowed russia to repay debts due in 1992 and 1993 over the succeeding ten years at the july 1993 tokyo summit the g7 established 3 billion special privatization and restructuring program that was expected to distribute funds over an 18month period it was made up of 500 million in bilateral grants to be used largely for technical assistance to newly privatized companies 1 billion in bilateral export credits and 1 billion in world bank and ebrd loans to be used by russian companies to import western goods and 500 million in world bank loans to be used by local governments to help them make up for health education and other services previously supplied to employees by stateowned companies the tokyo summit also adopted us proposal to set up permanent mission in moscow specifically to better monitor its aid the support implementation group is chaired by an american and the vicechair is german the bulk of g7 aid proposals past and present rested on assistance provided not bilaterally but multilaterally by the imf the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development ebrd however until mid1993 their participation in the assistance program was limited due to the failure of russia to meet macroeconomic policy reform conditions pending appropriate policy reforms the imf world bank and ebrd were expected to lend russia as much as 45 billion during calendar year 1992 not including the 6 billion ruble stabilization fund that was not implemented through 1993 however only about 16 billion was offered in 1993 members of the g7 encouraged the multilaterals to alter their standard approach and to ease up on prior conditionality and provide assistance earlier as way of encouraging later reform following the g7 april 15 aid package announcement the imf opened new loan window for this purpose the systemic transformation facility stf despite pressure on the imf from the united states and other donors in early june 1993 the imf held up approval of 15 billion loan to russia intended to be the first under the stf pending fulfillment of specific economic policy reform conditions the loan was finally approved on july 1 1993httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs16 on june 17 the world bank approved its largest project loan ever 610 million to assist russia in rebuilding its oil industry germany continued to be the largest bilateral donor to the fsu and along with the united states german prime minister helmut kohl took lead role in appealing to other members of the g7 for increases in aid to the region however in august 1993 the german government announced it would stop providing export credit guarantees for russia under its hermes program until the russian debt repayment record improved in 1992 germany was forced to pay roughly 562 million to cover defaults from former soviet states its deficit in 1993 was reported 26 billion although japan had been expected to be major aid donor its contributions had been limited largely to the central asian republics due to its dispute with russia over ownership of the southern kuril islands concurrent with its hosting of the g7 meeting on russian aid in april however japan bowed to heavy pressure from the united states and other g7 nations and pledged 18 billion in bilateral aid for russia mostly in the form of credits and guarantees unlike previous years it did not push its demands for return of the kuril islands at the july g7 summit held in tokyo developments in 1994 admini stration fy1995 budget proposal the administrations fy1995 budget issued in february 1994 requested 900 million in humanitarian and economic assistance to the fsu twothirds reduction from the 25 billion fy1994fy1993 supplemental that had been appropriated in september 1993 it also proposed 400 million in nunnlugar demilitarization funds for fy1995 russia aid debate the december 1993 parliamentary elections and subsequent resignations of prominent economic reformers from the yeltsin cabinet generated debate among us policymakers regarding the efficacy of us and international assistance to russia representative lee hamilton then chairman of the house foreign affairs committee suggested that he would find it difficult to support further assistance if the russian central bank continued to support state industries noting that reformers never received promised support from the international community some observers including economist jeffrey sachs criticized the imf for not being more forthcoming with assistance promised by the g7 in both 1992 and 1993 of the 28 billion offered in the g7 package of april 1993 only an estimated 5 to 8 billion had been delivered year later in response the united states put pressure on the imf to more expeditiously move loans to russia the ames spy case that emerged in late february produced added pressures on the assistance program for russia several members of congress including senators deconcini and dole called for freeze on assistance senator mcconnell indicated that bipartisan support for the program might dwindle as result of the incident these events may have strengthened support for the view that the united states should target more of its assistance on nonrussian republics rather than rely on russia as the focus of reform in the region in response ambassador strobe talbott indicated that the administration would pursue 5050 split in future resource allocation decisions on february 14 president clinton pledged significant increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs17 in economic assistance to kazakhstan due to its adherence to economic policy reforms and moves to eliminate nuclear weapons assistance reportedly was expected to go from 91 million in fy1993 to 311 million in fy1994 on march 4 the president also promised to double assistance to ukraine to roughly 700 million through fy1995 on march 21 dod secretary perry pledged an additional 100 million to ukraine in nunnlugar demilitarization assistance the increasingly negative mood regarding the russia assistance program had direct impact on already appropriated funds on february 11 1994 congress approved the emergency supplemental appropriations for fy1994 hr 3759pl 103211 providing assistance to earthquake victims in southern california and for other purposes to help pay for the relief congress rescinded previously approved funding including 55 million of the 25 billion assistance package for the fsu that had been approved in september 1993 the senatepassed version of the bill had proposed 145 million rescission from this account however an effort to raise this amount to 253 million was defeated on the senate floor the senate committee report on the bill indicated that the large amounts that had been made available to the region in the previous year made the regions foreign aid account likely candidate for sharing the costs of the supplemental fy1995 fsu aid debate house debate on the fy1995 foreign operations appropriations bill hr 4426 contained mixed message on support for assistance to the fsu the house appropriations committee had reported bill fully funding the presidents request of 900 million for the region on the floor may 25 an amendment callahan was defeated by vote of 286144 that would have cut the appropriation by 348 million and excluded russia from the remaining 552 million except for humanitarian assistance however motion by representative callahan to reduce fsu funding by 245 million leaving an appropriation of 8755 million was later adopted further diminishing available funding for the region the committeereported bill allowed the nis account to be used for mongolia although the bill contained only lineitem appropriation for the region the committee report hrept 103524 recommended number of specific funding levels for various programs 20 million for law enforcement training 14 million for the peace corps 50 million for agricultural commodities for children and women 5 million for postdoctoral exchanges in the social sciences and humanities and 20 million for family planning on june 16 the senate appropriations committee reported its version of hr 4426 including 839 million for the fsu the committee recommendation 61 million less than the administration request reflected congressional criticisms made public by the washington post on june 12 the article highlighted memorandum written to the administration by representatives gephardt and michel that called the russia aid program simply inadequate in its strategy its intensity and its implementation the senate committee report srept 103287 echoed several of these criticisms unlike the house bill the senate committee specifically earmarked funds for ukraine 150 million armenia 75 million and georgia 50 million it also required that 15 million be used for family planning of which 6 million was for russia 3 million for ukraine moldova and belarus and 6 million for central asia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs18 during floor debate the senate amended the foreign operations appropriations bill with new earmarks and other additional requirements the senate directed 15 million to be used to support and expand the hospital partnership program 50 million for programs that match us private sector resources with federal funds 5 million to establish an enterprise fund for the transcaucasus region 15 million for the international criminal investigative training assistance program icitap to conduct police development and training programs and 15 million for the fbi to help combat organized crime in the fsu by voice vote the senate approved an amendment that would end most assistance to russia unless the president certified that it was complying with the 1972 biological weapons convention and was disclosing the existence of its binary chemical weapons program the senate also approved 898 an amendment that would end most aid to russia if its troops remained in the baltics after august 31 1994 or the status of those troops had not been otherwise resolved by mutual agreement of the countries involved the original senate committee bill like the house bill had set deadline of december 31 1994 the senate approved hr 4426 on july 15 by vote of 849 the conference report on hr 4426 was approved by the house on august 4 34185 and by the senate on august 10 8812 it was signed into law pl 103 306 on august 23 the conference report provided 850 million in bilateral economic assistance to the fsu it replaced many of the senate earmarks with recommendations for spending 15 million for family planning 150 million for ukraine of which 25 million should be for land privatization and small and medium business 75 million for armenia 50 million for georgia the recommended funding levels for armenia and georgia could include funds from any other act and 50 million for publicprivate partnership matching programs the bill required that up to 30 million be used for police training and exchanges for east europe and the fsu it recommended that transcaucasus enterprise fund be established it required report from aid on steps being taken to include individuals and organizations with language and regional expertise in the program the conference report prohibited funds unless the president certified that russia and latvia and estonia had established timetable for withdrawal of russian forces although it provided for presidential waiver the troops were withdrawn in august 1994 the explanatory statement recommended that at least half of appropriated funds should be used in republics other than russia implementation concerns while the debate on the aid program in 1992 and 1993 focused largely on issues of funding and conditionality during 1994 many questions regarding the effectiveness of us assistance efforts were raised in april 1994 following congressional delegation trip to russia house majority leader richard gephardt and minority leader robert michel wrote memo to secretary of state warren christopher suggesting that the program was poorly coordinated not sufficiently visible to the russian people not well targeted and not addressing issues of crime and taxation nor adequately responding to the needs of small entrepreneurs the administration had already begun to address many of these questions and during the year there were some positive signs of improvemen t the state departments nis coordinator issued individual country strategies as guidelines to be followed by the numerous us agencies involved in implementing the program susan johnson

former soviet union and us foreign aid implementing the assistance program and crs report 96261 russia and us foreign assistance current issues emerging trends two events in autumn 1994 highlighted further emerging trends in the assistance program growing emphasis in the us aid program on facilitating american private sector investment and trade with the fsu was stressed by both russian president yeltsin and president clinton during the visit of the former to the united states on september 2628 1994 over 1 billion in aid and trade agreements was approved most of it the face value of coverage of eximbank and opic export and investment guarantees further move away from predominant emphasis on russia became more apparent during the visit to washington of ukraine president kuchma on november 22 ukraine the second most populous and strategically important nation in the region had at last begun to move forward with economic reforms as result the united states began to offer more economic incentives during this visit the united states promised 200 million 72 million in the form of cash transfer precedent for the fsu in addition aid announced country allocations of the 850 million in fy1995 assistance to the fsu russia would receive 378 million or 44 of the total while ukraine would get 158 million or 185 up from about 86 of fy1994 funds following the november 1994 us election there were signs that the us assistance program to the fsu would face critical scrutiny and possible cuts in 1995 on december 12 senator mcconnell new chairman of the senate foreign operations appropriations subcommittee issued foreign aid proposal for fy1996 introduced as s 422 in march 1995 that included 12 cut from fy1995 levels to 750 million in assistance to the former soviet union the suggested decrease however was considerably less than that proposed for the whole foreign aid program the mcconnell proposal earmarked 43 of the aid for three countries ukraine armenia and georgia more than doubling their aid levels and would prohibit most aid to russia if it contributed in any way to territorial violations of any other state other donors unlike previous meetings further financial assistance to russia was not discussed at the july 1994 naples summit of the g7 instead ukraine was topic of concern the g7 offered ukraine 4 billion in international financing if it acted to undertake genuine reforms it also approved 200 million plan to close the chernobyl nuclear plant total costs were expected to reach 15 billion following the december 1993 russian elections the united states argued forcefully for an easing of credit terms by the imf and other international lending institutions while at the same time calling for continued reform meeting of g7 finance ministers on february 26 1994 stressed the need for aid and debt restructuring to follow reform on april 20 the imf finally approved new imf loan to russia of 15 billion httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs20 developments in 1995 in 1995 republican majority in congress acted to cut the level of funding for the former soviet union and for russia in particular russian aid was made subject to more conditions and earmarks for other nis states at higherthanrequested levels effectively restricted the amount of funds available for russia programs administration fy1996 budget proposal on february 6 the clinton administration issued its fy1996 foreign aid budget request that included 788 million to be provided for the fsu through the nis account under the foreign operations appropriations bill an additional 92 million was requested for the region for trade and investment activities through the opic tda and exportimport bank budgets and 40 million for exchanges through usia funds the peace corps budget also now included 16 million in additional funding to cover costs associated with its program in the region previously all these funds had come out of the nis account and were transferred from usaid to other agencies total proposed economic assistance spending for the fsu including all agencies was therefore 936 million the administration also requested 371 million for fy1996 under the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program the new congress and fy1995 aid rescissions at the onset of the 104th congress the new republican majority proposed several initiatives to reduce spendin g some of which affected aid to the former soviet union representative callahan chairman of the house foreign operations appropriations subcommittee noted on january 30 1995 that he would seek to eliminate the assistance project that provided housing for russian officers withdrawn from the baltic states on february 22 the house approved hr 889 supplemental defense department appropriation that included 110 million cut in that particular aid program on march 2 the senate appropriations committee approved version of hr 889 deleting the house cut an action maintain ed in the floorapproved version however the full senate approved an amendment to the bill that would eliminate 18 million from the overall nis program 12 million of which would have to come from russia the conference report on hr 889 approved april 6 rescinded 75 million from fy1994 and fy1995 from the nis account and reallocated 15 million from the officer housing program to other nis nonrussia programs in addition the house bill would have cut 80 million from the nunnlugar program the senate version deleted this provision the conference report rescinded 20 million for nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction activities hr 889 was signed into law pl 1046 on april 10 1995 on march 2 the house appropriations committee approved nonemergency supplemental rescission measure later passed by the house as hr 1158 that would cut an additional 477 million in fsu programs the committee did not specify which programs should be affected by the cut except that reductions should not occur in small grassroots activities outside moscow and kiev the senate version approved april 6 did not specifically rescind fsu funds but would cut 125 million generally from the fy1994 and fy1995 foreign operations appropriations that might ultimately affect fsu programs the conference report hrept 104124 rescinded 25 million of aid intended for russia president clinton however vetoed the

relations programs on june 8 the house passed the bill by vote of 222192 among other provisions the bill authorized appropriations for foreign aid to the nis 643 million for fy1996 and 625 million for fy1997 it made 116 million of these sums available in each fiscal year for peace corps activities in the fsu the bill also required that assistance be provided to the private sector to the maximum extent feasible as the full senate never took up the foreign relations committees own foreign aid authorization bill s 961 the conference report on hr 1561 hrept 104478 march 8 1996 struck out most provisions on foreign aid including assistance for the nis hr 1561 as originally approved by the house included two new conditions on assistance that were directed at the government of russia the government of russia would be ineligible for most assistance excluding humanitarian democratic reform nuclear safety and many private sector activities unless the president certified that it was pursuing without preconditions ceasefire and negotiated settlement in chechnya the president would also have to certify that russia was providing unhindered access to chechnya was cooperating with the organization for security and cooperation in europe to investigate human rights violations in chechnya was cooperating in the unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance and was taking steps to repatriate refugees among other provisions the committee bill also prohibited assistance excluding humanitarian democracy and private sector aid to the government of any fsu state that agreed to provide nuclear reactor components to iran unless the president determined that the sale included safeguards consistent with us national security objectives in report language the committee emphasized the distinction between aid to governments and aid to assist reformers and the private and nongovernment sectors this distinction would likely allow significant amounts of us assistance to continue in the event the bills conditions were not met the bill added several prohibitions on assistance that appeared in past years in the annual foreign operations appropriations bill these prohibited assistance excluding humanitarian and democracy assistance to fsu governments that directed any action in violation of the territorial integrity of any other fsu state prohibited assistance for the

580 million for the region there were two efforts to cut funds for russia specifically an amendment roemer as amended obey that limited the amount of funds going to russia to 195 million passed 4012 the original amendment would have set the limit at 150 million another amendment menendez reduced funds to russia by any amount it spent on completion of nuclear power plant in cuba while an effort brownback to restore 24 million in appropriations to the nis was defeated 34078 an amendment hefley that would have cut funding for the region to 2968 million was also rejected 104320 finally language in the committeereported bill that would allow assistance to flow to the government of azerbaijan prohibited by the freedom support act until it made progress on ending the conflict with armenia was deleted visclosky on june 15 the house passed hr 1530 the defense authorization it authorized 200 million for nunnlugar programs in fy1996 46 less than the administration request on december 13 conferees agreed to 300 million level for nunnlugar funds could not be used for peacekeeping exercises with russia or for defense conversion and some funds could not be used unless russia was in compliance with the biological weapons convention or was making progress toward destruction of chemical weapons the house version of hr 2126 the defense appropriations bill approved 200 million for the program on september 25 house and senate conferees for dod appropriations hr 2126 agreed to 300 million for nunnlugar programs in fy1996 cut of 71 million from the presidents request the bill became law on november 30 1995 fy1996 fsu aid debate in the senate on june 23 1995 the senate foreign relations committee reported s961 the foreign aid authorization srept 10499 while the bill itself would have folded the fsu and other accounts into one development assistance fund the committee report expected that 675 million for fy1996 and 620 million for fy1997 would be available to the region the bill separately and explicitly authorized 12 million in fy1996 for transcaucasus enterprise fund another provision that would have benefitted the region permanently authorized such sums as may be necessary for transport of privately donated humanitarian assistance to parts of central europe and the former soviet union an amendment offered by senator snowe that condemned the proposed sale by russia of nuclear power plants to iran and conveyed the sense of congress that russia would be ineligible for aid in the event the sale went forward was approved during committee markup the bill also provided that loans could be offered to the nis countries if they were not either keeping up with scheduled debt repayments or if the loans were not secured by revenues from exploitation of the states natural resources the measure never went to the full senate for vote the defense authorization bill s 1026 approved by the senate on september 6 authorized 365 million for the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program the defense appropriations bill s 1087 approved on september 5 would appropriate 325 million as noted above conferees reached agreement on 300 million authorization level and congress passed 300 million appropriationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs23 following the august recess the senate on september 21 took up the house passed foreign operations spending measure hr 1868 approving 705 million for fsu aid although the senate version was 125 million higher than the house level the senate expressed displeasure with administration efforts to assist countries other than russia consequently the senate bill earmarked amounts for armenia 85 million georgia 30 million and ukraine 225 million with the armenia and ukraine levels significantly higher than those planned by the administration in addition the senate included extensive earmarks for ukraine emphasizing the development of small and medium enterprises 20 million and nuclear energy safety and selfsufficiency 50 million for armenia the bill directed 35 million for food 40 million for fuel and 10 million in medical supplies other earmarks applying to the region in general included 20 million for hospital partnerships 45 million for the western nis enterprise fund 15 million for establishing transcaucasus enterprise fund and over 17 million for the fbi to set up legal attache and training programs in the nis and east europe the senate foreign operations measure also added key restriction on russian aid that was strongly opposed by the administration the bill prohibited aid to russia unless moscow terminated its planned transfer of nuclear energy technology to iran the administration raised the prospect of veto if this condition was not removed or softened with presidential waiver authority conference report house and senate conferees reported hr 1868 on october 24 1995 while agreeing to over 175 differences between the two versions including those concerning the former soviet union they failed to agree on international population language on october 31 the house approved the conference report 35171 but retained the controversial population language that might either be rejected in the senate or provide grounds for veto by the president the senate approved the conference report 906 on november 1 but continued to disagree with the house on population both bodies voted again in disagreement on november 15 causing further deadlock on final passage in january 1996 the population issue was resolved and the conference report including nis language was enacted by reference in the continuing resolution hr 2880 the continuing resolution was approved by the house on january 25 it passed the senate and was signed into law pl 10499 on january 26 1996 subsequently hr 1868 was approved by congress and signed by the president on february 12 1996 as pl 104 107 the conferees approved 641 million under the nis account they adopted many but not all of the senate earmarks these included the 225 million level for ukraine of which 50 million was designated for energy conservation and nuclear safety 22 million for small and medium enterprise development and 5 million for victims of chernobyl the bill further earmarked 85 million for armenia georgia was to receive 30 million although funds could come from other appropriations the legislation targeted 20 million for hospital partnerships infectious diseases or contaminated drinking water mitigation 126 million for law enforcement assistance 50 million for the western nis and central asia enterprise funds and another 15 million for new transcaucasus enterprise fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs24 2 although the roemer amendment was defeated 34867 195 million cap was approved in the house version of the bill the 195 million limitation on funding for russia contained in the house version was eliminated but extensive country and program earmarks in the conference report were expected to effectively prevent russia from receiving that much assistance in fy1996 the conference report also adopted senate language that would prohibit assistance for russia if it pursued arrangeme nts with iran to supply technical expertise training technology or equipment necessary for the development of nuclear reactor or related programs however the report allowed for presidential waiver on the grounds that it would be in the us national security interest to continue to provide assistance finally the legislation allowed humanitarian assistance to flow through the government of azerbaijan if the president determined that assistance provided through nongovernmental organizations the only kind permitted under the freedom support act due to the dispute with armenia over nagornokarabakh was not adequately addressing refugees major issues in 1995 as indicated by the appropriations debate described above some efforts were made in 1995 to cut funding to the region and to russia specifically as in similar efforts in previous years critics of the program based their arguments chiefly on the need to cut foreign aid generally on their preference to see funds used for domestic purposes and on specific grievance s against russian behavior the broad fsu aid program continued to find its strongest support in the congressional leadership in july 1995 during the debate on the roemer amendment to limit aid to russia to 150 million members including both house speaker gingrich and minority leader gephardt argued the importance to us foreign policy and defense interests in democratic and free market fsu they also argued that it was less expensive to assist more cooperative russia than it was to defend the united states from threatened soviet aggression during the cold war however these arguments had mixed success in the face of other pressures to cut aid to russia2 while russia was the main focus and beneficiary of the assistance program in its first years it bore the brunt of nis cuts in 1995 funding for russia declined from roughly 60 of the nis total during the first two years to roughly 40 of fy1995 funds and 21 of fy1996 funds the decline in funding for the russia program in part reflected the criticism that began in late 1994 regarding russias international and domestic behavior in 1995 russia increasingly became the target of efforts to impose specific conditionality in the assistance program early in the year russias behavior in chechnya was mentioned by congressional critics as potential condition and was one reason given for acceptance of rescissions directed specifically at russia the sale of nuclear power plants to iran was another issue that increased pressure for conditional ity in congress the fy1996 foreign aid appropriations prohibited aid unless the president assured that moscow had terminated its plans for the sale however this provision did allow the president to waive this restriction if he deemed it in the interest of us national security the administration argued that it was inappropriate to condition aid to russia on particular desired behavior in either iran or chechnya inasmuch as the aid program was intended to benefit reformist elementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs25 in russia and ultimately facilitate transformation that might ensure more cooperative relationship in the future another reason for the decline in russia funding was the congressional concern often expressed by senator mcconnell in 1994 that us foreign policy had become too dependent on yeltsin and that more funds should be funneled to other countries in the region consequently what had been recommended funding levels in the fy1995 foreign aid bill became hard earmarks in the fy1996 bill congress specified amounts for ukraine armenia and georgia the effect of which was to decrease available amounts for russia in 1994 defenders of the administration program had argued the greater importance to us national interest of russia and pointed out that on per capita basis russia had been situated near the middle of recipients while relatively strategically unimportant country armenia had been near the top they suggested that there was point in providing large amounts of funding to thennonreformers such as ukraine in his march 28 1995 testimony to the senate foreign relations committee nis aid coordinator thomas simons pointed out that the first reformist wave in russia kyrgyzstan moldova and kazakhstan was where previous funding had gone in the latter part of 1994 there was second wave of reformers in ukraine armenia georgia and belarus that were putting together imf reform programs these became beneficiaries of increased us assistance in 1995 the aid program implementation concerns expressed by congress and others the previous year were largely addressed in early april 1995 richard morningstar previously senior vice president at opic took over from ambassador thomas simons as the coordinator of the program the latter had taken number of steps to improve coordination including the formulation of individual country strategic plans and requiring usaid to transfer funds to other agencies in way that would reduce its continued responsibility for those funds after taking office morningstar took very assertive role in molding the assistance program he conducted comprehensive review of the program and enlarged the scope of the posts responsibility to include the dod nunnlugar program developments in 1996 the tone of debate on the issue of aid to the former soviet union was more modulated in 1996 than in the previous year the administration did not request more than it received from congress in 1995 congress adopted many of the same earmarks and conditions as it had in the previous year administration fy1997 budget proposal in march 1996 the administration presented its fy1997 budget proposal requesting 640 million for the new independent states nis account including 173 million for russia the fy1996 level was expected to be 168 million 173 million for ukraine 2057 million in fy1996 and 55 million for armenia 85 million in fy1996 fy1997 fsu aid debate in the house on may 29 1996

russia conditioned on its progress in economic reforms and the sale of nuclear reactor technology to iran these and most other conditions on aid to the region could be waived by the president on national security grounds the house bill departed from previous appropriations language by allowing ngos and pvos to use facilities of the government of azerbaijan in order to provide humanitarian assistance it also attempted to establish 7 to 1 ratio of assistance for the refugees in azerbaijan to those in nagornokarabak h on june 11 1996 the house approved hr 3540 by vote of 36657 amendment

assistance unlike the house bill the senate version contained extensive country and program earmarks half of all the assistance would go to ukraine 225 million and armenia 95 million another 25 million was earmarked for georgia although from all funding sources leaving roughly 295 million for the 9 remaining republics including russia the ukraine funds included 35 million for agriculture 25 million to help decommission the chernobyl reactor 5 million for small business development and 5 million for treatment of children affected by the chernobyl incident another 50 million of the ukraine funds was provided for nuclear reactor safety including 20 million for safety panels for all reactors and 20 million for simulators and training availability of funds for ukraine was subject to certification that there was military cooperation between that country and libya funds for russia could not be provided unless the president made determination that russia had ended its agreement to sell and provide training for nuclear reactor in iran there was waiver provision in the senate committee language other earmarks in the senate bill provided 15 million for hospital partnerships 15

of the total nis account be used for legal reform efforts including support for the development of commercial law strengthening an independent judiciary and bar and legal education for judges and law students the other earmarked 5 million of the ukraine allocation for land and resource management institute to identify nuclear contamination at chernobyl on july 10 the senate approved s 1745 the defense authorization bill which authorized 3279 million under the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program on july 18 the senate approved hr 3610 the defense appropriations bill providing 3279 million for this program conference report on september 28 and september 30 1996 the house and senate respectively approved an omnibus consolidated appropriations act hr 3610 pl 104208 that included the fy1997 foreign operations appropriations it provided 625 million for the nis account the fy1997 foreign operations appropriations maintained most of the senate bills country and program earmarks the measure included 225 million for ukraine 25 million of which was to be used for decommissioning the chernobyl plant 35 million for agricultural projects 5 million for the small business incubator project 5 million for treatment of childhood illnesses resulting from chernobyl 5 million for land and resource management institute to identify nuclear contamination at chernobyl and 15 million for

of which 20 million should go to safety paramete r display systems and 20 million to full scope and analyticalengineering simulators the appropriations act also earmarked 95 million for armenia 10

million be used for health and law enforcement efforts seeking to reduce violence toward women it also called for continued assistance for law enforcement and training in the nis and central europe at fy1996 levels the report further supported the transfer of 12 million from the nis account to peace corps for its activities in this region on july 30 conferees reported the defense department authorization act hr 3230 the bill provided 3649 million under the nunnlugar program and an additional 57 million for department of energy nuclear nonproliferation activities in the fsu it was signed into law on september 23 as pl 104201 the conference report on hr 3610 the omnibus appropriations act which included the defense appropriations provided 3279 million for nunnlugar activities the department of energy appropriations hr 3816 signed into law pl 104206 on september 30 1996 provided 485 million for its fsu nuclear programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs28 major issues in 1996 concern for the future of the us assistance program for russia was raised by the january 1996 actions of president yeltsin who replaced number of his key economic reformers in bid to remake his image prior to the presidential election scheduled for june 16 1996 since yeltsin had previously removed reformers only to continue reformist policies administration officials took waitandsee attitude this approach was perhaps later justified by yeltsins postelection appointment of one of the countrys leading reformists anatoly chubais as chief of staff western leaders had to balance their concerns regarding the future of reform with the possible alternative of communist victory in the election in january us and other western officials warned that russia could lose loan being negotiated with the imf if it failed to maintain its reform program in february possibly bowing to us and other western country interest in bolstering the position of yeltsin prior to the election the imf agreed to lend 102 billion to russia over three years however in move signalling continued caution the imf required that the loan be provided in monthly tranches that would follow monitoring reports to insure russia kept to its promised reform track on july 22 the imf indicated that it would delay the disbursement of 330 million tranche because of russias failure to meet reform conditions for the loan the specific problem appeared to be the yeltsin governments low cash receipts stemming from the failure to enforce tax laws the imf went ahead with the loan on august 21 however on october 24 the imf again suspended loan disbursements the october payment was made in middecember 1996 in 1996 congress continued the pattern of conditioning aid to russia one new effort appeared in the cuban liberty and democratic solidari ty libertad act of 1996 hr927 signed into law on march 12 1996 pl 104114 the new law requires reduction of assistance to any country by the amount of aid it provided in support of intelligence facilities in cuba or in support of the cuban nuclear facility at juaragua however the restriction does not apply to most if not all categories of assistance then being provided to russia including democratization the development of free market economy the grassroots private sector and secondary school exchanges in appropriations bills number of conditions on aid from the previous year were adopted at the committeelevel these included the fy1996 language prohibiting aid unless the president assures that moscow has terminated its plans for the sale of nuclear power plants to iran as in the previous year it allowed the president to waive this restriction if he deemed it in the interest of us national security the president waived the fy1997 restriction on november 8 1996 in presidential determination 9701 efforts to cut aid were introduced during floor debate on bills affecting us aid to russia and other successor states of the soviet union however some recommend ed that aid to russia be curtailed in future years the senate foreign operations subcommittee suggested in its report that aid be phased out after fy1997 noting that after that year it intended to provide modest support only for health and humanitarian needs democracy and rule of law programs nuclear safety and security initiatives in effect russia already received significant cut in aid by thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs29 fy1997 appropriations bill although the administration sought 173 million for russia due to the extensive earmarking of other countries in that bill russia would end up with about 95 million the lowest amount made available for russia programs since the aid program began the decrease in aid to russia reflected in part the continuing concern expressed by senator mcconnell since 1994 and again at hearing on may 15 1996 that us foreign policy had become too dependent on yeltsin and that more funds should be funneled to other countries in the region georgia armenia and ukraine were promoted as candidates for increased assistance and had been the beneficiaries of congressional earmarks in response the administration continued to argue the strategic importance of russia to us foreign policy while also noting that the other countries would get aid to the extent that they adopted economic policy reforms despite its delay or rejection of privatization and other reforms ukraine remained the largest recipient of nis aid in fy1997 congress earmarked 225 million for ukraine 30 increase over the administrations request for that country congress earmarked 95 million for armenia although by the end of 1996 serious questions were being raised regarding armenias commitment to democratic reform 25 million earmark for georgia from all sources contained in the senate version of the fy1997 bill was deleted from the conferenc report although conference managers noted that georgia lagged behind it neighbors in political and economic reforms view that might have been disputed by experts they recommended that funding be maintained at the fy1996 level to help insure that reforms were made the conference report also recommended that funds be provided to belarus due to its movement away from political and economic reform criticisms regarding implementation of the aid program were fewer in 1996 than in previous years but disparate views were expressed regarding the extent to which certain sectors should be supported with us assistance during 1996 as parliamentary and presidential elections approached in russia number of critics complained about the relatively small amounts going to democratic initiatives in that country only 5 narrowly defined 18 more broadly defined the conference report to the fy1997 foreign operations appropriations specifically criticized usaid and the nis coordinator for not including health and environmental health as priorities and in its discussion of aid to ukraine it urged that programs to screen and treat childhood mental and physical illnesses related to chernobyl supersede any nonconforming strategic objectives of usaid developments in 1997 on february 6 1997 the administration proposed its fy1998 foreign aid budget the request included 900 million for the nis account 44 increase over the fy1997 appropriations level of 625 million as described by the administration 372 million of the request would fund the predominantly technical assistancetype activities that have characterized the nis account and 528 million would be used to fund new partnership for freedom initiativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs30 administration introduces the partnership for free dom pff initiative the partnership for freedom initiative as proposed had several significant features responding to the concern of many analysts that the united states must remain engaged in the region the pff would extend nis programs into the foreseeable future as the old technical assistance programs were winding down by the year 2001 pff activities would continue the pff would reverse the decline in funding for the nis region that occurred since fy1995 in doing so the pff proposal also responded to concerns regarding the imminent demise of the program for russia and the relatively low levels of assistance that had gone to central asia and parts of the caucasus under the new request assistance to russia would increase by 153 in fy1998 to 242 million assistance to kyrgyzstan would nearly double and tajikistans would nearly triple assistance to the other central asian countries as well as to georgia and azerbaijan would also rise substantially finally as noted above the pff was intended to emphasize different mix of program activities than was the case up to 1997 the initiative would emphasize to greater extent than previously exchanges and cooperative partnership activities at the grassroots level trade and investment and assistance to entities outside of the central government authorization debate on may 9 1997 the house international relations committee reported hr 1486 the foreign policy reform act hrept 10594 the bill would have authorized 8399 for the former soviet union in fy1998 about 7 less than the administrati ons fy1998 request but 34 higher than the fy1997 appropriation level and 7899 million in fy1999 another provision of the bill conditioned any assistance to russia over 95 million on russias termination of all official cooperation with and transfers of nuclearrelated technology to iran and cuba it did not provide presidential waiver authority the bill also eliminated all funds for russia if it transfer red an ssn22 missile system to china waiver authority was provided for this provision hr 1486 did not reach the house floor due to the leaderships belief that there was inadequate support for foreign aid provisions instead new bill hr 1757 was introduced incorporating provisions relating to state department usia acda international organizations and other general foreign policy issues it was approved on june 11 another bill hr 1759 containing foreign aid provisions was introduced but was never debated during debate on hr 1757 several foreign aidrelated amendments were adopted including two on the nis program one rohrabacher approved 225190 would prohibit economic aid to russia in fy1998 and fy1999 if moscow transferred an ssn 22 missile system to china presidential waiver was included in this language the second fox 41512 expressed the sense of congress commending ukraine for certain foreign policy positions including relinquishing nuclear weapons and not participating in construction of nuclear reactors in iran and its adoption of democratic reforms it recommended that ukraine move to insure compensation for us investors who had been subjected to fraud and corruption finally ithttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs31 recommended that the president provide ukraine with the same level of funds it received in fy1997 225 million the senate foreign relations authorization s 903 passed the senate as hr 1757 905 on june 17 it contained nis foreign aid provisions comparable to those in the house

the same as the year before 30 below the presidents 900 million request and 175 million less than the proposed senate level as in previous years the house committee bill contained country earmarks however the bill placed significant conditions on assistance to russia and ukraine russia would be prevented from receiving assistance unless the president determined that it had terminated arrangements to provide iran with technical expertise training technology or equipment necessary to develop nuclear reactor related nuclear research facilities or ballistic missile capability half of the funds allocated to russia could be made available if the president determined that it was vital to the national interest of the united states half of the funds allocated to ukraine would be withheld until the secretary of state certified that the ukraine government was enforcing recent anticorruption decree had substantially completed privatization of state owned agricultural storage distribution equipment and supply monopolies and had fully resolved most of the commercial disputes involving complaints by us investors and established permanent legal mechanism for dispute resolution the bill restated the section 907 restriction on aid to azerbaijan unless it took steps to end blockade and other use of force against armenia and nagornokarabakh however it would allow democracy assistance to be provided in addition to the ngo humanitarian assistance which had been allowed in previous appropriations unlike the senate version of the bill it continued to apply 907 aid

privatization 15 million for border security telecommunications infrastructure 7 million for judicial reform and law enforcement 5 million for border and customs control 3 million for political party development 5 million for supsa urban and commercial development and up to 7 million for business and education exchanges the bill provided 95 million for armenia it also provided 10 million for transcaucasus enterprise fund the senate bill also conditioned assistance to russia on presidential determination that it had terminated implementation of arrangements to provide iran with technical expertise training technology or equipment to develop nuclear reactor or related research facilities the bill repeated section 907 of the freedom support act language prohibiting aid to the government of azerbaijan excluding aid to support electoral activities and political reform and opic tda and exportimport bank activities on july 17 1997 the senate approved s 955 by vote of 918 on the floor several amendments regarding aid to the nis were added one smith oregon would prohibit assistance to the government of russia unless the president certified that russia had not enacted law that would discriminate against minority religions this amendment was offered in response to the passage of legislation in the russian legislature that western observers believed would restrict religious freedom in russia the senate also approved an amendment kyl that added to the above mentioned restriction on aid to russia if it transferred nuclear technology to iran the amendm ent would include ballistic missiles in its list of items that should not be provided to iran another amendment adopted by the senate kyl earmarked 25 million of funds available to ukraine for the legal restructuring necessary

for the southern caucasus region of the latter 37 925 million was earmarked for georgia and 35 875 million for armenia the remaining 70 million of the southern caucasus funds were to be used for reconstruction efforts related to the conflicts in the region conferees recommended providing 125 million for victims of nagornokarabakh and 5 million for victims of the abkhazia conflicts the country earmarks left funding for russia and central asia both prime targets of the administrations partnership for freedom initiative significantly short of requested levels however some previous year constraints on the nis account were eliminated providing the nis coordinator with greater flexibility than in the past the bill increased appropriations for the exportimport bank with the intention expressed by conferees that the bank would participate significantly in the initiative this action conserved nis account funds that might have been transferred to supporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs33 export activities in the region in addition the peace corps was appropriated full funding in fy1998 with proviso that funds for nis activities be transferred from the nis account the conferees also allowed the use of up to 437 million of the southern caucasus funds to be used in other areas of the fsu if the secretary of state reported that they could not be used effectively otherwise and specifically if an interim settlement to regional conflicts was not achieved by may 30 1998 there were two key restrictions on aid to russia both aimed at the government of russia and presumably not affecting aid to the grassroots private sector one withheld half of aid allocated to the government until the president certified that it had terminated sales of nuclear reactor technology and missiles to iran presidential waiver authority on the grounds of us national security and that the russian government was taking steps to curtail such transfers was provided second aid would be available for the government of the russian federation if it implemented its law restricting religious minorities waiver was provided for this provision which took effect roughly 6 months after enactment of the bill aid to ukraine was conditioned on its undertaking of significant economic reforms additional to those which were undertaken in the previous fiscal year half of aid to ukraine excluding election and nuclear reactorrelated aid was withheld until the president certified ukraine was making progress toward resolving complaints of us businessmen the

request of 3822 million for the nunnlugar cooperative threat reduction program the proposed amount was 17 higher than the fy1997 appropriation on june 25 the house passed hr 1119 the defense authorization and on july 29 it approved hr 2266 the appropr iations bill both provided 2847 million for nunnlugar programs the senate version of the defense authorization s936 providing 3822 million was approved on july 11 the senate appropriated 3822 million for nunnlugar programs on july 15 in s 1005 the conference reports on both authorization hrept 105340 and appropria tion bills pl 10556 adopted the senate and administration request levels of 3822 million emerging issues and trends in 1997 perhaps the most significant development for the aid program in 1997 was the turnaround in the three year decline in aid to the nis with the partnership for freedom initiative the administration articulated longerterm strategy for the region reversing the position held up to then that the aid program would achieve it goals by the year 2002 despite indications in 1996 that senate appropriators were prepared to see the russia program continue its sharp decline congress partly accepted the administrations strong defense of the nis program in approving an fy1998 budget 23 higher than the previous year thereby allowing 40 increase in russia aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs34 another striking departure from earlier trends was the growing criticism of aid to ukraine in fiscal years 1995 and 1996 ukraine received 225 million earmark making it the largest nis recipient in those years despite the support of strong us ethnic lobby ukraines failure to adopt economic and political reform led some in congress to question the level of funding provided to ukraine the ukraine earmark came under fire by members of the house foreign operations subcommittee at hearing held on april 9 1997 members were particularly incensed by information in an article published the same day in the new york times describing the failure of reform and the ill effects of corruption on us business investment subsequently on april 29 the house appropria tions committee reported out provision in the emergency supplemental appropriations hr 1469 that granted the president the authority to waive the fy1997 ukraine earmark if that country was not taking steps to adopt reforms and eliminate corruption this provision except as it related to the subearmark on nuclear safety was adopted in the conference report on hr 1469 later vetoed by the president for unrelated reasons in the fy1998 appropriations however half of the 225 million earmarked for ukraine was withheld until issues affecting us investors were resolved in 1997 an erosion in the prohibition on aid to azerbaijan became evident as many in congress and the administration did not want the united states to appear to be biased in favor of armenia while playing role in the minsk group that oversees the peace talks and perhaps more importantly because us economic interests in azerbaijan had grown with the exploitation of oil resources by us firms the fy1998 foreign operations bill allowed both the us foreign commercial service and the trade and development agency to function in azerbaijan developments in 1998 administration fy1999 request on february 3 1998 the administration proposed its fy1999 budget including 925 million for the nis account 20 increase over the fy1998 level under the proposal countries that benefitted least from the fy1998 increase in resources russia the central asian states moldova and belarus would receive substantial increases while the other countries would face small decline addressing congressional committee on march 26 ambassador morningstar noted that the partnership for freedom initiative had not been fully funded in fy1998 and asserted that aid to russia was ridiculously low at the same hearing acting usaid assistant administrator donald pressley called for the repeal of section 907 which prohibits aid to azerbaijan fy1999 fsu aid debate in the house on july 15 the house foreign operations subcommittee of the committee on appropriation s approved draft fy1999 appropriations bill approved by the full committee on september 10 and reported as hr 4569 hrept 105719 which provided 590 million for the nis account 36 below the administration request and 23 less than the fy1998 level of the total nis account 1947 million was earmarked for the southern caucasus region includin g 779 million to support the peace effort between armenia and azerbaijan the bill also limited the amount of assistance to any one country to one fourth of the total 1475 million although the committee bill did not earmarkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs35 specific amounts for nis countries in report language it directed specific percentages of the southern caucasus funds be provided to certain countries 25 487 million for armenia and 25 487 million for georgia the bill repeated the previous years language with regard to the sale by russia of nuclear technology to iran withholding half of the assistance for the government of russia unless it terminated such sales but allowing for presidential waiver the full appropriations committee adopted livingstone amendment that repealed section 907 of the freedom support act the section that had prohibited most us assistance to azerbaijan due to its conflict with armenia on september 17 the house approved hr 4569 by vote of 255161 the final bill was amended porter to strike the repeal of section 907 adopted by the appropriations committee fy1999 fsu aid debate in the senate on july 21 the senate appropriations committee reported s 2334 its version of the fy1999 foreign operations appropriations the bill provided 740 million for the nis 20 below the administration request of 925 million and 4 less than the fy1998 level of 770 million of total nis account funds the bill earmarked 210 million for ukraine 90 million for armenia and 95 million for georgia the senate bill contained numerous restrictions and earmarks the bill withheld 50 of the amount earmarked for ukraine exclusive of funds for nuclear safety earmarked at 25 million democracy fund activities 700000 and law enforcement reforms 8 million until the secretary of state reported that ukraine had undertaken significant economic reform in fy1998 if funds were permanently withheld they would be returned to the treasury rather than redistributed to other nis countries of funds for georgia 35 million was earmarked for economic reforms including small business development and banking institutions 8 million for judicial reform and law enforcement and 20 million for border and customs control training of funds for armenia 10 million was earmarked for the american university of armenia and 4 million for nuclear safety as was the case in the senate version of the fy1998 bill the freedom support act section 907 restriction on aid to azerbaijan was loosened to allow activities of the overseas private investment corporation opic the trade and development agency the exportimport bank the foreign commercial service and activities supporting democracy and humanitarian assistance at that time opic and exportimport bank activities were prohibited the senate bill would greatly toughen the fy1998 legislative language that restricted allocation of fy1998 assistance to russia if it continued with its nuclear and missile sale cooperation with iran unlike the fy1998 restriction which withheld half of the aid intended for the government of russia as opposed to the private sector the senate bill would prohibit all fy1999 aid to russia for all programs not just government if the cooperation continued unlike fy1998 national security waiver was allowed for this condition with few changes the committee proposals for the nis were approved by the full senate on september 2 1998 in 903 vote the only relevant changes were the addition of an amendment that prohibited the exportimport bank from providing itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs36 loans or guaranties to nis enterprises that were majority owned or managed by state entities and an amendment that proclaimed the sense of congress that the imf should not provide funding to the russian governme nt if its economic policies were significantly affected by the communist party or under conditions less stringent than those imposed on asian democracies fy1999 conference report on october 20 the house approved hr 4328 the omnibus consolidated emergency appropriations for fy1999 containing the foreign operations bill by 33395 vote the senate approved the measure on october 21 by vote of 6529 the president signed the bill into law on october 21 pl 105277 the omnibus appropriations bill provided 847 million for the nis 78 million less than the administration request 107 million more than the senate earmark and 257 more than the house earmark under the nis account of the foreign operations section of the bill 801 million was appropriated and an additional 46 million was appropriated as an emergency supplemental the bill limited assistance appropriated to any one country under the nis account section to more than 30 ie 2403 million it earmarked 228 million for the southern caucasus region including 399 million for reconstruction activities related to the abkhazia and nagornokarabakh conflicts 8436 million for georgia and 799 million for armenia of the amount allocated for armenia 958 million was expected to go to one time interestbearing endowment for the american university in armenia if by may 30 1999 funds for reconstruction noted above could not be used they could be used for other purposes in the southern caucasus region the bill also earmarked 195 million for ukraine including 25 million for nuclear reactor safety half of the funds excluding the reactor and law enforcement activities were subject to withholding until the secretary of state reported in february that ukraine has undertaken significant economic reforms in fy1999 as was the case in fy1998 50 of funds allocated for the government of russia were to be withheld unless the president could certify that it had terminated sale of nuclear or ballistic missile technology to iran national security waiver was possible if the president could certify that russia was taking meaningful steps to limit contracts and curtail the transfer of technology in fy1998 the president did not waive this provision unlike fy1998 the legislations statement of conferees noted that by government of russia they did not intend to affect usrussia partnerships between hospitals universities and environmental institutions the bill extended the number of us aid programs excluded in previous years from the prohibitions of section 907 of the freedom support act which applied to aid to the government of azerbaijan if it did not take steps to end the blockade and other force against armenia and nagornokarabakh us assistance could now go to the government of azerbaijan to support democracy

during 1998 the administration responded to several prominent congressionally imposed conditions on assistance to nis countrie s on april 29 the secretary of state made the determination that ukraine had made significant progress toward resolving complaints by us investors in order to unblock nearly half of the 225 million earmark for that country at the same time the secretary continued to withhold 25 million of the total ukraine allotment that would have gone to the government of ukraine pending significant progress in adoption of economic reforms that would make the assistance more effective these funds would be diverted to the private sector if reforms were not made in the following several months the funds were eventually released on may 26 president clinton determined that the government of russia had not taken actions that would discriminate against minority and foreign religious groups and had not implemented the new russian law on religion to that effect presidential determination 9823 such determination was required under the fy1998 foreign operations appropriations in order for assistanc to continue to the government of russia however the determination also noted that the issue required continued and close monitoring the administration was unable to determine that russia had terminated its agreement to sell nuclear reactor technology to iran and therefore half of all assistance intended for the government of russia was diverted to other programs or countries under state department interpretation the roughly 24 million cut affected regional and local governments as well as the federal government of russia under the fy1999 appropriations bill for the second straight year congress increased assistance to the nis although not to the level originally requested by the administration the higher level permitted an increased allocation of funds for russia and central asia programs for fy1999 the state department and usaid were faced in midyear with possible new demands created by the august 1998 financial crisis in russia on october 2 1998 secretary of state albright said that the united states was reexamining the program and retargeting money where it can be used effectively to support economic and democratic reform the most significant early change in the economic aid program was 10 million increase in assistance to independent media which had suffered financially due to the loss of advertising revenue in october 1998 the yeltsin government formally asked the united states for food assistance to help it deal with the impact of the financial crisis that threatened to create situation of severe hunger in parts of the country during the winter on november 6 the us department of agriculture announced an 885 million food assistance package consisting of 15 million metric tons of donated us wheat under section 416b 15 million metric tons of various foodstuffs provided through low interest loan pl 480 title i and 100000 metric tons of humanitarian food aid provided to volunteer relief agencies for direct distribution to vulnerable groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs38 food for progress included in the total estimated amount of the package was 260 million in transport costs us economic interests in 1998 played role in determining aid policy in two nis countries congress earmarked only 195 million in fy1999 aid to ukraine departure from the 225 million earmark it had received each year since fy1996 the decrease could be read as continuing concern regarding the slow progress of ukrainian economic policy reform as well as concern regarding treatment of us investors the growing importance of us economic interests in azerbaijan is likely responsible for the further expansion of the types of us assistance that may be provided that country despite the formal continuation of the section 907 prohibition on aid developments in 1999 administration fy2000 request on february 1 the administration presented its fy2000 budget request to congress it requested 1032 billion in fy2000 funding for the nis account 22 increase over the fy1999 level of 847 million of this amount 241 million was expected to go for new expanded threat reduction etr initiative that would address proliferation issues arising out of the economic crisis facing russia and other nis countries the etr initiative was part of larger 10 billion administration fy2000 proposal for increasing amounts dedicated to proliferation issues in the nis the remaining funds coming from the department of defense 4855 million and the department of energy 2647 million over five years most of the 18 billion added by the initiative to amounts previously planned for nonproliferation activities would go to doe and

to fund new effort to remove the russian armed forces and equipment from bases outside russia and to dispose of ammunition dumps vulnerable to theft the fy2000 request did not mark major increase in support for the traditional efforts to build democracy and free market economies in the nis that have characterized the freedom support act program after subtracting the nonproliferation request traditional activities were funded at roughly 791 million early in 1999 responding to conditions placed on nis aid in the fy1999 foreign operations appropriations secretary of state albright issued several determinations on february 18 the secretary certified to congress that ukraine had made sufficient progress in its economic reforms to enable release of the half of its economic aid that had been withheld under the legislation on april 15 she certified that the russian federation had implemented law that would discriminate against minority religions thereby allowing all nis account aid to russia to continue on the same day she also determined that significant progress had been made in reaching an agreement with the government of the russian federation to exclude us assistance from customs duties thereby allowing aid directed at the central government of russia to continue emergency supplem ental appropriations on march 23 1999 the senate approved s 544 the emergency supplemental appropriations bill among the offsets to pay for the appropriations was rescission of 10 million from russia program appropriations made for fy1995 fy1998 and fy1999 in addition the senate bill called for 5 acrosstheboard cut in the fy1999 omnibus appropriations nondefense emergency activities 46 million of which had been appropriated to the nis account ie 23 million cut on march 17 the house appropriations committee reported hr 1141 its version of the supplemental that would have rescinded 25 million of any unobligated funds appropriated for the nis account bill conferees however dropped the house and senate offsets that would have rescinded previous nis and russia program appropriations on may 21 the president signed hr 1141 the fy1999 supplemental appropriations into law pl 10631 although chiefly providing funds for central america hurricane damages and kosovo the legislation also directed that up to 10 million from fy1999 appropriations for senate operations be used for russian leadership program to be implemented by the librarian of congress it would bring emerging russian political leaders to the united states for short visits to give them firsthand

operations bill s 1234 srept 10681 would fund the nis account at 780 million 24 less than the administration request and 8 less than the fy1999 level including supplemental on june 30 the full senate approved s 1234 by vote of 972 leaving the nis account mark intact but amending the committee bill on number of important policy pointshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs40 two floor amendments on the expanded threat reduction initiative were adopted that appeared to challenge the committee position on the issue at the proposed level of funding the committee had in effect rejected the administrations new expanded threat reduction initiative in report language the committee noted concerns raised by recent audits presumably referring to gao study on the doefunded and managed initiatives for proliferation prevention ipp program that had criticized that programs implementation and questioned the programs contribution to nonproliferation objectives because none of its projects was commercial success the committee suggested that it would be ill advised to support large funding increase for programs that may not have restraining effect on proliferation fiftyseven percent of the foreign operations bill funds proposed for etr projects were expected to be used for nuclear and chemical scientist alternative employment projects similar to the ipp program in their objective but each was to be implemented differently and none was to be managed by doe the remaining funds were intended for export control border security and ammunition disposal activities not addressed in the gao report both expanded threat reduction initiative amendments biden and schumer stated the sense of the senate that initiative programs were vital to us national security interests both also supported the restoration of funding at or near the 250 million administration request level when the bill reached conference the senate action appeared to presume that additional funding above the allocations provided by the budget resolution to the international affairs account would be available by the time housesenate conference on the foreign operations bill was held as in previous years the senate bill contained several country earmarks 210 million for ukraine up from 195 million appropriated in fy1999 95 million for georgia 844 million in fy1999 and 90 million for armenia 799 million in fy1999 there were few subearmarks in the bill of ukraine funds 25 million had to be spent on nuclear reactor safety 5 million for technology business incubator programs and added on the floor 35 million for destruction of stockpiles of anti personnel landmines of georgias allocation 8 million was for judicial reform and law enforcement training floor amendment made 15 million of armenias funds available for earthquake rehabilitation and reconstruction other floor amendments to the bill provided 2 million of nis funds for ngos teaching graduates skills for the job market and 200000 for the reap international school linkage program between north dakota and the russia far east the senate also endorsed the activities of the citizens democracy corps which provided business volunteers to the nis in report language the committee recommended assistance efforts to improve orphanage facilities support independent media develop healthrelated exchanges and partnerships and target the russian far east among others the committee bill as it had in 1998 would have prohibited all aid to russia government and nongovernment unless the president determined that the government of russia had terminated the transfer of technical expertise training and equipment to help iran develop nuclear reactor mcconnellleahy floor amendment however made the prohibition only affect half of the aid allocated to the central government of russia relieving concern raised in the fy1998 and fy1999 conditions that cut aid to local and regional governments in that country new condition in the legislation would prohibit aid to the government of russia untilhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs41 the secretary of state certified that russia had not developed separate zone of operational control in kosovo and that russian armed forces in kosovo were fully integrated under nato unified command and control arrangements the bill also withheld half of all aid to ukraine excepting nuclear safety law enforcement and business incubator programs until the secretary of state certified that ukraine had undertaken significant economic reforms additional to those achieved in fy1999 floor amendment added ukraine efforts to end corruption by its government officials as further criterion as in the fy1999 bill the legislation restated the prohibition on aid to azerbaijan contained in section 907 of the freedom support act and permitted number of exceptions including democracy opic tda exportimport bank and humanitarian assistance during floor debate senator brownback offered an amendment the silk road strategy act that would authorize us assistance programs in the south caucasus and central asia and amend section 907 to allow the president to waive the provision on the grounds of national interest considerable debate took place on the waiver issue which was resolved by its removal under mcconnell abraham and sarbanes amendment adopted by 53 to 45 vote fy2000 fsu aid debate in the house on july 14 the house foreign operations subcommittee marked up its version of the fy2000 appropriations and the full appropriations committee reported the bill on july 23 hr 2606 was approved by the house on august 3 by vote of 385 to 35 it provided 725 million for the bills renamed independent states of the former soviet union account 30 less than the administration request and 14 less than the fy1999 level including supplemental like the senate bill the house version did not fully support the administrations expanded threat reduction initiative only one amendment affecting the independent states account was offered during house floor debate the traficant amendment adopted without opposition limited assistance provided to the government of the russian federation under the account to 172 million while it otherwise avoided the dollar earmarks that characterized the senate bill hr 2606 did require that allocations for georgia and armenia reflect the proportion provided in the fy1999 allocation excluding however the amount in the total directed at nonproliferation activities and that 175 of funds for the southern caucasus region be used for confidencebuilding measures that might lead to peaceful resolution of local conflicts like the bill that emerged from the senate floor the house version withheld half of the allocation for the central government of russia unless the president determined that russia had terminated its sale of nuclear reactor technology to iran however the bill specifically excepted efforts to combat infectious diseases and child survival activities as well as nonproliferation programs from this condition and report language noted the committee intention that regional or municipal governments hospital partnerships and judicial training not be limited the house bill also largely repeated senate language excepting democracy nonproliferation tda foreign commercial service opic exportimport bank and humanitarian activities specifically including those under the child survival account this latter inclusion was new language not in the senate version from the prohibition on aid to the azerbaijan government contained in section 907 of the freedom support acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs42 in report language the committee noted that it had dropped the requirement that half of ukraines assistance be withheld pending certification that it was taking steps to resolve us business concerns and adopt policy reforms remarking that certifications were made in 1999 despite the lack of action by ukraine to resolve cases of primary concern to the committee the report also noted the committees failure to include specific amounts for the administrations etr initiative stating that although it found merit in many of the proposed activities it was not convinced that the expansion of several projects was feasible or justified the report among other priorities recommended support for partnerships between us nongovernmental organizations and ukraine partnerships between the private sector and russian nuclear institutes efforts to develop an independent media iodine deficiency elimination efforts the russian orphans program and the use of up to 5 of the child survival account for programs in the independent states in separate action on august 2 the house approved hr 1152 the silk road strategy act of 1999 the senate had earlier approved similar language as an amendment to its fy2000 foreign operations bill although somewhat duplicative of the freedom support act the silk road act authorized assistance and laid out congressional priorities with specific regard to the countries of central asia and the caucasus both house and senate versions omitted section 907 language with respect to azerbaijan conference repo rt on hr 2606 on september 27 the housesenate conference issued its report on hr 2606 hrept 106339 providing 735 million for the nowrenamed independent states of the former soviet union account 29 less than the administration fy2000 request and 13 less than the fy1999 level the conferees also agreed to recommend 180 million level for ukraine and to earmark 1292 of the total account 95 million for georgia and 122 90 million for armenia for the first time the conferees earmarked 6 million of the account for mongolia country could receive more than 25 of the total account the recommended account funding level and country earmarks would likely reduce aid for russia programs from fy1999 levels and would prevent aid from increasing to the levels proposed by the administration to permit full implementation of the expanded threat reduction program of those funds that would be allocated to russia the conference report directed that 20 million must be spent on the far east and 10 million should be used to carry out the russian leadership program which was originally funded from the senate operations budget when it was established in the may 1999 supplemental the program administered by the library of congress brought promising russian leaders to the united states to expose them to american democracy as in fy1999 the fy2000 bill withheld half of aid to the government of russia until the president determined that the government of russia had terminated any arrangements to provide iran with technical and other assistance to develop nuclear reactor or ballistic missile capability unlike previous years however the provision only affected the government of the russian federation not aid to local and regional governments further it exempted nonproliferation and child survival activities and efforts to combat infectious diseases the report contained new condition requiring that aid to the central government of russia be provided until the secretary ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs43 state certified that russian armed forces had not established separate sector in kosovo and were operating under nato command as in previous years aid was also prohibited to the government of the russian federation if it implemented law discriminating against religious minorities the conference report required that of funds allocated to the caucasus 15 should be used for measures to further peaceful resolution of the regional conflicts there section 907 restrictions on aid to azerbaijan were lifted for democracy humanitarian nonproli feration tda foreign commercial service opic and exportimport bank assistance the bill also contained the silk road strategy act that adding new chapter to the foreign assistance act of 1961 which has governed foreign aid programs since that date authorized assistance and laid out congressional priorities with specific regard to the countries of central asia and the caucasus the conferees statement included number of recommendations for example the conferees directed that 15 million of funds for armenia be used to support recovery in areas affected by the 1988 earthquake and that 25 million of funds for georgia be used for border security and law enforcement training they recommended that 25 million of funds for ukraine be used for nuclear safety and up to 10 million be used for regional initiatives they also directed that 3 million be provided to carelift international for transport of us surplus medical equipment on october 6 congress approved the conference report the house by vote of 214 to 211 the senate by vote of 5149 the president vetoed hr 2606 on october 18 in part because of insufficient funding for the former soviet union hr 3196

million more than hr 2606 although providing 19 fewer funds than the administration fy2000 request but only 1 less than the fy1999 level hr 3196 fully funded the foreign operations portion of the presidents expanded threat reduction initiative at 241 million funds from previous foreign operations appropriations could be used to meet this earmark the former soviet union provisions of hr 3196 were identical to those of the conference report version of hr 2606 with several additions as noted 104 million was added to the total funding for the region in supplemental title vi and an earmark of 241 million to come from the bill and previous foreign operations appropriations was made for the expanded threat reduction program finally 147 million earmark was added for maternal and neonatal health activities in the fsu at least 88 million of which should be spent in russia hr 3422 and the consolidated appropriations following the house passage of hr 3196 further negotiations between

unlike previous years it only recommended that 180 million should be made available for ukraine soft earmark instead of hard one the bill capped assistance to any one country at 25 of the total account 209 million with the exception of nonproliferation activities hr 3422 also required that 20 million be for programs in the russian far east and that 147 million be made available for maternal and neonatal health activities of which 60 should be made available in russia the bill provided 10 million for the russian leadership program which was originally funded from the senate operations budget when it was established in the may 1999 supplemental although the bill left funding allocations for the expanded threat reduction program up to the administration the recommended account funding level and country earmarks effectively prevented aid from increasing to the levels proposed by the administration to permit full implementation of the expanded threat reduction program the administration eventually allocated 175 million of the appropriation to the program 66 million less than the administration request as in fy1999 the fy2000 bill withheld half of aid to the government

trends and issues in 1999 in 1999 only two issues the expanded threat reduction initiative discussed above and spate of antirussia rhetoric that threatened to affect the aid program discussed below received significant public and press attention several trends however were notable for the second year in row the final nis account appropriation was higher than the amount provided by both senate and house bills resulting from last minute negotiations between congress and the administration on the overall foreign operations legislation further an increasing amount of the account went to nonproliferation activities rather than to meeting traditional economic and political reform objectives consequently more money was funneled away from usaid to other agencies than was the case previously as much as 54 percent of the fy2000 funds were expected to go to other agencies compared to roughly quarter in the first six years of the program in 1999 congress appeared to continue tougher line toward aid to ukraine over the issue of its failure to adopt economic reforms while it dropped two year provision that had required determination on the degree to which ukraine was adopting economic reforms for the first time since it began earmarking funds for ukraine in fy1996 congress made the earmark soft one recommending instead of requiring that 180 million be provided congress also showed signs of paying more attention to central asia somewhat neglected in the aid program by passing the silk road strategy act however after country and program earmarks the region was expected to receive less in fy2000 than it had the year before russia and the bank of new york scandal in 1999 russia became the subject of debate that threatened to affect the us assistance program and tied to the us presidential campaign seemed likely to be revived in 2000 in august newspaper reports of an investigation into the possible transfer of as much as 10 billion in russian money through the bank of new york inspired number of political commentators to link the occurrence of widespread corruption and capital flight in russia neither new nor startling revelations with mishandled assistance funds and an indictment of the administrations foreign policy toward russia and especially the role of vice president gore who was identified with usrussia policy by virtue of his cochairmanship of the joint commission on economic and technological cooperation the joint commission acted as conduit for discussion of key aspects of usrussia relations including trade investment space and the environment and often made recommendations on use of assistance to facilitate these matters some of the news reports implied that international aid funds may have been directed through the bank of new york if any donor funds were diverted it was not likely to include us bilateral economic assistance the us aid program had not been delivered in the form of large monetary grant most aid had been in the form of us technical expertise and equipment to the public and private sectors credit assistance to small business and project grants to ngos while serious abuse questions were raised with regard to the us food aid program in 1993 the department of agriculture insisted that its current aid program was closely monitoredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs46 although balance of paymen ts loans provided by the international monetary fund were liquid and provided on large scale there was evidence that any imf funds were among those involved in the bank of new york investigation the possibility of diversion however prompted representative jim leach to suggest that imf loans be suspended until steps were taken to insure money was not diverted the administration pointed out that imf loans approved in 1999 did not leave the imf they covered repayments of previous loans an approach initiated largely because of concerns regarding possible misuse the bank of new york issue was used by some political commentators to suggest that the administration and gore mishandled usrussia policy partly by continuing to provide aid to russia despite its descent into corruption and by using aid to support the privatization process that some believe allowed the socalled oligarchs in russia to achieve the vast wealth many in russia associate with corruption other commentators variously pointed out that corruption long predated the current system and that us support for privatization was an effort to rapidly ensure that communism could not return besides its support for privatization us assistance they noted had helped strengthen an incipient democratic system and free market economy through support for new businesses free press stock exchange and local government and continued to encourage the russian federal government to develop rule of law including private land ownership and effective tax policy despite the strong opposition of communist dominated parliament some observers believed that critics of us policy overestimated the power of us assistance to guarantee the realization of us foreign policy objectives while it was argued that both the bush and clinton administrations might have exercised more influence to prevent corrupt practices and insure the adoption of economic reforms using the leverage of imf and other international financial institution resources others argued the bilateral aid program often due to congressional constraints was too small to have decisive influence over events in russia in any event some noted not only was russia not yet lost it was never ours to lose developments in 2000 clinton administration fy2001 request on february 7 2000 the clinton administration proposed its budget for

the white house for signature pl106280 october 6 2000 among other things the legislation authorized nonproliferation activities including science and technology centers and border control assistance provided to the former soviet union while these werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs50 authorized originally under the freedom support act the authority was never integrated into the foreign assistance act of 1961 the broad legislation that governs most foreign assistance the legislation also provided the basis for separately funding nonproliferation activities managed by the state department as opposed to cooperative threat reduction managed by the department of defense rather than under the independent states of the former soviet union account in the annual appropriations bill russian leadership program created by congress in 1999 the russian leadership program had brought in two years more than 3600 russians to the united states for weektotenday community visits and exposure to us institutions administered by the library of congress the program was funded in its first year through the legislative branch appropriations bill and in its second year from the fsu

report on hr 4576 pl 106259 the department of defense appropriations for fy2001 providing 4434 million major issues in 2000 the debate on usrussia policy that had begun in 1999 intensified in 2000 as the presidential election drew nearer charges that the clinton administration mishandled usrussia policy including its use of the assistance program resurfaced in the september 2000 report russias road to corruption how the clinton administration exported government instead of free enterprise and failed the russian people issued by the partisan house of representati ves speakers advisory group on russia although focusing more broadly on the range of usrussia relations during the clinton administration the report suggested that the aid program especially aid from the imf abetted the failure of russian reform one ramification of this debate during presidential election year was that efforts to condition aid to russia that were fixture of annual legislative deliberations multiplied considerably reportedly in part because of vicepresident and presidential candidate gores close association with the formulation of usrussia policy the perennial condition in the foreign aid bill that sought to punish the russian central government for its ongoing sale of nuclear power plant to iran was strengthened by boosting the amount withheld from 50 percent in the previous years legislation to 60 percent in the fy2001 foreign aid appropriations further number of conditions regarding russian actions in chechnya were introduced in the fy2001 bill that would also cut funding by 60 percent these would withhold funds if russia did not cooperate with international investigations of war crime allegations in chechnya did not provide access to ngos doing humanitarian work in chechnya or was not in compliance with the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe regarding forces deployed in the zone around chechnyahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs51 in the spring of 2000 members of congress had proposed number of other conditions some of which were adopted by one body or the other one called for reduction in us assistance to russia by an amount equal to any loan or other financial assistance or energy sales it provided to serbia and us opposition to international financial institution loans and suspension of exportimport and opic loans or guarantees to russia in response to russias hosting of the yugoslav defense minister an indicted war criminal and its provision of loan to serbia the condition sponsored by senator jesse helms was adopted as an amendment to s 2522 section 599d after being modified with presidential waiver authority however the provision was not included in the conference report agreement on hr 4811 the fy2001 foreign aid appropriations another proposal expressed the sense of the senate that the united states should oppose international financial institution loans to russia if it delivered additional ss n22 moskit antiship missiles to china this amendment by senator bob smith r nh was added to s 2522 during floor debate it was not included in the conference report agreement on hr 4811 but in their statement the conferees expected the secretary of the treasury to urge us executive directors to oppose loans if the sale continued related piece of legislation hr 4022 introduced by representative dan rohrabacher rca prohibiting rescheduling or forgiveness of bilateral debt until russia terminated sales of the missiles was approved by the house international relations committee on april 13 2000 with presidential waiver authority provision further proposed condition would prohibit the rescheduling or forgiveness of any bilateral debt owed to the united states by russia until the president certified that russia had closed its intelligence facility at lourdes cuba hr 4118 rep ros lehtinen rfl was approved by the house 275146 on july 19 the international relations committee added presidential waiver authority that would permit the rescheduling of debt but the bill did not provide waiver for debt forgiveness further the bill still would require us opposition to rescheduling and forgiveness at the paris club possibly making the reschedulin g waiver meaningless in the senate similar legislation was introduced s 2748 senator mack rfl on june 16 2000 in addition to the above the chairmen of the two congressional foreign policy committee s sought to block rescheduling of russian debt on may 26 2000 as required by law thirty days prior to its taking effect the administration submitted to congress report on bilateral agreement with russia to reschedule its 1999 and 2000 repayments of sovietera debt while paris club creditors had opposed total forgiveness they had favored rescheduling due to the burden the debt placed on russian efforts to reform its economy however senate foreign relations committee chairman helms and house international relations committee chairman gilman rny in midjune 2000 announced they would put the agreement on hold due to russian actions in chechnya and support for serbia what made this move particularly significant was that of the roughly 485 million of us debt that would be rescheduled 155 million was part of lend lease debt held from world war ii provision of the trade act of 1974 required that arrears in this debt be punished by loss of mfn most favored nationnormal trade relations status therefore if the debt could not be rescheduled on july 1 when payment wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30148crs52 otherwise be due russia would either be forced to make the payment or stand to lose its mfn status on june 30 2000 the clinton administration announced that it would proceed with the rescheduling regardless of the congressional leaders views the administration argued that refusal to reschedule would have effect on russian policy would make it more difficult for russia to repay its debts and would create problems with the paris club donors in response gilman spokesman suggested that legislative remedy would be sought although senator helms threatened to put all ambassadorial nominati ons on hold in late july he lifted holds on 13 ambassadorial nominees developments in 2001 bush administration fy2002 request for fy2002 the new george w bush administration requested 808 million for the former soviet union account nearly the same as was appropriated in fy2001 810 million appropriated 8082 million after rescission with two exceptions the administrations fy2002 individual country allocation requests were also nearly the same as allocated in fy2001 although the requests for armenia nearly 20 million decrease to 70 million and azerbaijan roughly 16 million increase to 50 million might have attracted some attention in congress additional amounts for reconstruction in both countries were set aside from the regional pool of funds to be provided as part of an international donor effort once settlement was reached in the nagornokarabakh conflict in its congressional presentation documents the new administration promised to increase amounts allocated for grassroots level activities such as exchanges ngos and proreform and local governments amid rumors of substantial cuts in funding the bush administration launched fullscale review of cooperative threat reduction and related nonproliferation programs in russia although it had used 451 million as placeholder in the budget request in the end it requested 403 million the chief cut was in funding for plutonium storage facility 57 million decrease and the chief increase was for chemical weapons destruction an increase of 50 million fsu aid debate in the house on june 27 the foreign operations subcommittee of the appropriations committee approved its version

added by senator sam brownback rks allowing the president to waive section 907 of the freedom support act prohibiting aid to azerbaijan if he determined it was in the national interest to do so this action was taken in part to allow unhampered usazerbaijani military cooperation in the war on terrorism third amendment to hr 2506 earmarked for the first time specific military aid funds for former soviet union country armenia was to receive at least 600000 in international military education and training program funds and 4 million in military financing concerns regarding possible increased us military aid and cooperatio n with uzbekistan led to the adoption of an amendment by senator paul wellstone dmn that would require report every six months from the administration on defense articles and services provided to that country their use and the extent of any human rights violations by the uzbek government during that period finally the senate restored provision that had appeared in legislation in recent years but was not included in the fy2002 committee bill prohibiting aid to the government of russia if it implemented law restricting religious minorities as in the committee version the adopted senate bill recommended that at least 180 million be provided for ukraine and earmarked 90 million for armenia and 90 million for georgia of the amount for ukraine it recommended 25 million for nuclear reactor safety programs of the amount for armenia it earmarked 5 million for education including computer and internet access in primary and secondary schools of the amount for georgia it recommended 3 million for small business development from the whole account it recommended at least 45 million be used for child survival environmental and reproductive health and infectious diseases like the house bill it would cut assistance to the central government of russia by 60 if conditions relating to iran and chechnya were not met in the case of chechnya it required that russia allow access to ngos but unlike the house it continued previous year language requiring that russia cooperate with war crimes investigators and be in compliance with the conventional armed forces treaty that sets ceilings on troop levels the bill also required that the department of state provide report on progress by ukraine in bringing to justice the murderers of ukrainian journalists also as in previous years it exempted democracy nonproliferation tda foreign commercial service opic exportimport bank and humanitarian assistance from the prohibition on aid to azerbaijan under

than 154 million 16 million decrease from fy2001 of ukraines total at least 30 million was recommended for use for nuclear reactor safety the state department was required to report on progress made by the government of ukraine in investigating and prosecuting the murders of ukrainian journalists hr 2506 also provided at least 90 million for armenia but only recommended that 90 million be made available for georgia the bill required that at least 175 million be used for the russian far east the conference report further recommended that 15 million be used for health and other needs of victims of trafficking in persons and recommended that 49 million be used for child survival environmental and reproductive health and family planning and for combatting hivaids tuberculosis and other infectious diseases the conference report maintained language cutting 60 of funds allocated for the central government of russia excepting nonprol iferation disease and child programs if it continued to implement its sale of nuclear reactor technology to iran and if it did not provide access for humanitarian relief ngos to chechnya it maintained language prohibiting aid to the central government of russia if it implemented law discriminating against religious minorities hr 2506 also continued to exclude nonproliferation tda foreign commercial service opic exportimport bank and humanitarian programs from the freedom support act section 907 prohibition on aid to azerbaijan however in departure from previous years and response to the war on terrorism the bill provided specific waiver authority to the president for this provision running through the end of 2002 in what might be interpreted as an effort to compensate armenia for this leniency toward azerbaijan the bill provided armenia with less than 4 million under the foreign military financing account and the conference managers directed that not less than 300000 be provided armenia under the international military education and training imet program in the statement of managers conferees further recommended that of the 49 million suggested for child survival etc 15 million be used for reproductive healthfamily

result of the war on terrorism that began on september 11 2001 us foreign policy changed in numerous ways and us aid relations with the former soviet union were affected by these changes for the war to succeed the united states would require cooperation intelligence logistical and diplomatic support especially from countries in the southern flank of the fsu the countries of the fsu were quick to offer cooperation and us officials indicated that cooperating countries would be rewarded up to september 2001 the countries of central asia the socalled stans uzbekistan tajikistan turkmenistan and kazakhstan were the most neglected of fsu aid recipients while it was too early to tell at the end of 2001 whether there had been significant shift in aid relations some countries in the region appeared to reap benefits from close cooperation in the terrorism war on november 9 the united states announced that uzbekistan would receive 405 million in economic and law enforcement assistance and additional military aid was also expected some observers including members of congress expressed fear that the poor human rights records and lack of progress in democratization that have worked to limit us assistance to some central asian countries in the past would as consequence of the war now be disregarded when determining aid levels and programs during floor debate on the fy2002 foreign operations bill an amendment wellstone was adopted by the senate which would have required report every six months on defense assistance provided to uzbekistan and the extent of any human rights violations while the language was omitted from the final version of the bill authors of the conference report directed the secretary of state to report on defense assistanc and its use by uzbekistan but did not require special report on human rights violations in the caucasus region the war appeared to generate sufficient impetus for congress and the administration to ease longstanding legislative barriers to assistance to azerbaijan the administration asked congress to lift the section 907 freedom support act prohibition on aid to the government of azerbaijan and congress in the fy2002 foreign operations appropriations bill provided the president with authority up to the end of 2002 to waive section 907 if he determined it was in the national interest on december 15 secretary of defense rumsfeld told the president of azerbaij an that he expected that sanctions would be waived in the near future usrussia relations may also have been profoundly affected by the war prior to
