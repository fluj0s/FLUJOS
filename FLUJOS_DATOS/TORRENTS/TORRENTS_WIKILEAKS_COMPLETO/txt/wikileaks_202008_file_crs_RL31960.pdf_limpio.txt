george w bush on april 30 2003 signed the sm allpox emergency personnel protection act of 2003 pl 10820 compensation had emerged as major obstacle to the implementation of the administrations smallpox vaccination pr ogram soon after it began the number of workers volunteering for vaccination was far smaller than the white house had anticipated one frequently cited reason was the concern of health workers that they would not be compensated if they experienced adverse reactions to the vaccine under the administrations original plan vaccinees who suffered adverse consequences and sought re dress had two options apply to their states workers compensation program or sue the fe deral government for negligence some members from across the political spectrum favored responding with legislation while they differed on what should be in that legislation there was bipartisan agreement that given the presidents request that health and safety workers volunteer for vaccination the federal govern ment should guarantee to protect them against the possible adverse effects of smallpox vaccination some legislators articulated twofold rationale it is righ t to protect volunteers and to recruit those volunteers it is necessary this report first presents the reasons some members of congress health care worker organizations and others felt legislation was necessary summarizes the range of

security act of 2002 pl 107296 to smallpox vaccine manufacturers and the institutions and individuals who ad minister the vaccine the president had hoped to vaccinate 500000 civilians but by june 6 2003 only 37478 civilians had been immunized2 to explain the reluctance of many health workers to volunteer to be vaccinated many including senator gregg3 pointed to the absence of compensation program for people who are injured by the vaccine until the mid1970s when the world health organization announced the eradica tion of naturally occurring smallpox it was accepted that in the face of endemic in fection the side effects of the smallpox vaccine4 are dwarfed by the benefits of immunization it is difficult for some however to accept the risks of vaccineassoci ated illness and death when the risk of infection is perceived as theoretical th president backed by many health and defense experts sought an immunized core of firstresponder and publichealth personnel as public good allowing trea tment and vaccination of larger groups should smallpox infections appear at th same time many public health officials infectious disease experts lawyers and health care personnel unions noted the need for compensation mechanism the administration has said that it expected workers compensation programs to cover claims for the rare but anticipated side effects of the smallpox vaccinations5 soon however people noticed gaps in this approach other than the program that covers federal workers work ers compensation in the united states is handled at the state level

the size of the program the hhs secretary may need to clarify details that the law does not explicitly cover in order to implement the law examples include definitions regulatory tr eatment of standards of medical evidence and federal tax law the law describes contact case as iii the individual has been in contact with an individual who is or who was accidentally inoculated by covered individual34 what evidence of contact will the secretary require how would an unvaccinated person who nevertheless appear s with vaccinia infection demonstrate that for example particular anonymous subway rider was the source of infection because vaccinia infection would come only from vaccinia vaccine source it may not be necessary for compensation deter mination to show that the person had contact with someone who had received the vaccine knowing the chain of contact would be important however for public health reasons the law gives the hhs secretary authority to create the table of injuries to list injuries presumed by law to be vaccinerelated because the rules and art of causal inference that epidemiologists use do not easily line up with legislative needs to assign responsibility drafte rs of legislation turn to phrases such as preponderance of the evidence standard taking into consideration of relevant medical and scientific evidence35 or credible evidence for the association is equal to or outweighs the credible evid ence against the association36 the scientists language includes an uncertainty that the laws presumptions override whether the new legislation provides sufficient guidance to the secretary remains to be seen one could anticipate that individual claimants will question whatever list the hhs secretary promulgates questions are also likely to arise regarding the tax status of the various benefit categories for various groups of recipients whether clarification responsibility rests with the hhs secretary or with the intern revenue service the issues may involve input from both or require congressional clarification learn and proceed finally some members of congress may want to consider what lessons they could learn from the
