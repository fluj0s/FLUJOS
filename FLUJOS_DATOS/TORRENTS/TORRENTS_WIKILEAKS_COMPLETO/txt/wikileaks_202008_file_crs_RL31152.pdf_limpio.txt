program and skep ticism about administration charges that hussein would have been likely to share those weapons with terrorist organizations since the war in iraq us teams are attempting to uncover linkages if any between the former regime of saddam hussein and qaeda but little evidence has been presented thus far and many experts are skeptical that such linkage existed10 although widespread
