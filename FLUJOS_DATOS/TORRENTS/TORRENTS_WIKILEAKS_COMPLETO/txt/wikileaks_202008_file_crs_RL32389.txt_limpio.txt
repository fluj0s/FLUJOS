policy division peter kraut contractor domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress statebystate compilation of key state childrens health insurance program schip characteristics summary the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 established the state childrens health insurance program schip under new title xxi of the social security act in general schip provides states with federal matching funds to cover uninsured children in families with income that is above medicaid eligibility levels to date the upper income eligibility limit under schip has reached 350 of the federal poverty level or fpl in one state states may choose among three options when designing their schip programs they may expand medicaid create new separate state insurance program or use combination of both approaches all 50 states and the district of columbia have schip programs in operation as of june 30 2003 among these 51 jurisdictions 15 were medicaid expansions 18 were separate state programs and 18 used combination approach medicaid expansion programs must provide all mandatory benefits and covered optional services offered in the states medicaid program costsharing is prohibited for children separate state programs must follow certain coverage and benefit options outlined in schip law while costsharing provisions in separate state programs vary by family income in number of states the total annual aggregate costsharing including premiums enrollment fees deductibles copayments coinsurance and other similar charges for any family may not exceed 5 of total income in year preventive services are exempt from costsharing states must ensure that schip does not substitute for coverage under group health plans phenomenon known as crowdout the primary method for preventing substitution is requiring waiting period during which applicants must be uninsured prior to enrollment in schip states that want to make changes to their schip programs that go beyond what the law allows may do so through what is called section 1115 waiver these waivers allow states to use schip funds to cover populations not normally covered under schip such as pregnant women and parents of schip children as well as to modify certain statutory provisions such as costsharing limitations and benefit requirements this report provides an overview of state program characteristics under schip in each of the areas summarized above eligibility benefits packages cost sharing crowdout prevention and section 1115 waivers several sources were used to compile the

health insurance program schip characteristics the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 established the state childrens health insurance program schip under new title xxi of the social security act the program offers federal matching funds for states and territories to provide health insurance coverage to uninsured children from families whose annual incomes are higher than medicaid eligibility thresholds total federal funding is nearly 40 billion for fy1998 through fy2007 eligibility in general title xxi defines targeted lowincome child as one who is under the age of 19 years with health insurance and who would not have been eligible for medicaid under the rules in effect in the state on march 31 1997 states can set the upper income level for targeted lowincome children up to 200 of the federal poverty level fpl1 or if the applicable medicaid income level for children was at or above 200 fpl prior to schip the upper income limit may be raised an additional 50 percentage points above that level2 within these general rules states may provide medical assistance to qualifying children in two basic ways they may cover such children under their medicaid programs andor they may create separate schip program for this purpose when states provide medicaid coverage to targeted lowincome children medicaid rules typically apply when states provide coverage to targeted lowincome children through separate schip programs title xxi rules typically apply in both cases the federal share of program costs comes from federal schip appropriations 1 for example in 2003 the poverty guideline in the 48 contiguous states and the district of columbia for family of four is 18400 department of health and human services annual update of the hhs poverty guidelines 68 federal register 6456 feb 7 2003 2 under medicaid states must cover all pregnant women and children under age 6 living in families with income at or below 133 of fpl and all children ages 6 through 18 living in families with income at or below 100 of fpl states also have the option of covering 1 pregnant women and infants with income up to 185 of fpl 2 using more liberal income and asset standards to determine eligibility than those required under current law for certain groups and 3 using waiver authority eg section 1115 to cover persons who would not otherwise be eligible for medicaid crs2 title xxi does not establish an individual entitlement to benefits instead title xxi entitles states with approved state plans for medicaid coverage or separate schip programs to predetermined federal allotments based on distribution formula set in the law however targeted lowincome children covered under medicaid are entitled to the benefits offered under that program as dictated by medicaid law these children retain their entitlement to medicaid benefits even if schip terminates unless the state eliminates this coverage group such individual entitlement exists for targeted lowincome children covered in separate schip programs under medicaid states may cover targeted lowincome children in the following ways 1 by establishing new optional eligibility group for such children as authorized in title xxi andor 2 by liberalizing the financial rules for any of several existing medicaid eligibility categories states may also provide coverage to targeted lowincome children by creating separate schip program states define the group of targeted lowincome children who may enroll in separate schip programs title xxi allows states to use the following factors in determining eligibility under separate state programs geography eg substate areas or statewide age eg subgroups under 19 income and resources residency disability status so long as any standard relating to that status does not restrict eligibility access to other health insurance and duration of schip enrollment as of june 30 2003 among the 50 states and the district of columbia 15 were medicaid expansions 18 were separate state programs and 18 used combination approach financial eligibility standards table 1 presents summary of state eligibility thresholds and other eligibility information under schip3 the first column shows counts of medicaid expansions the second column shows counts of separate state programs and the last column shows counts of states note that the total number of programs does not add up to 51 the 50 states and the district of columbia because states with combination programs have medicaid expansion and at least one separate state program several states have two or more separate state programs 3 appendix 1 describes the information sources and methods used to compile the data presented in this report crs3 table 1 general eligibility criteria for states as of december 31 2002

unborn children 0 4 3 sources see appendix 1 combination states that have this characteristic in at least one of their programs are included in this count b in determining income eligibility for schip and medicaid some states apply income disregards see the next row in this table typically these are dollar amounts subtracted from gross income to compute net income which is then compared to the states income standard for determining eligibility the number type and amount of disregarded income varies from applicant to applicant depending on each persons specific financial circumstances some states apply selected disregards to all applicants for example in new jerseys separate schip program all income between 200 to 350 of the fpl is disregarded for every applicant in state schip plans and related documentation the sources for information on applicable income levels used in this table and elsewhere in this report it is unclear whether the reported income levels reflect the applicable standards before or after income disregards are applied in most cases the reported income levels probably reflect the standards before any income disregards are taken into account use of disregards increases the effective income level above the stated standard the exception is those states like new jersey that apply specific disregard for all applicants in these cases the reported income standard most likely accounts for universally applied disregards and more closely reflects the effective income level as seen in the first row last column of table 1 12 states had an upper income eligibility threshold below 200 fpl 26 states had an upper income eligibility threshold of exactly 200 fpl and 13 states had an upper income eligibility threshold above 200 fpl eligibility thresholds among separate state programs tend to be higher than among medicaid expansions states with combination programs use their medicaid expansion program for lower income children and one or more separate state programs for children with higher income levels crs4 in determining financial eligibility for schip states may elect to disregard some portion of income andor deduct certain expenses when calculating familys net income which is then compared against the income thresholds reported above with these methods states extend eligibility beyond the stated financial standards for example many states disregard some amount of earned income andor deduct specified amounts of child support payments in other cases states may disregard all income within specified range for example new jersey has expanded eligibility to 350 fpl the highest of any state in one of its separate state programs by disregarding all income between 200 fpl and 350 fpl as shown in table 1 46 states use basic income disregards4 states may also take resources or assets into account in determining financial eligibility for schip states determine what items constitute countable assets and how those countable items are valued generally resources such as homes and wedding rings have not been counted regardless of their value while cars savings accounts and savings bonds for example have generally been counted as shown in table 1 only two states one under its medicaid expansion program and one in its separate state program use an asset test other eligibility and enrollment characteristics presumptive eligibility and continuous eligibility see table 1 are policies designed to assist children in getting and staying enrolled in medicaid and schip under presumptive eligibility states are allowed to enroll children whose family income and resources appear to be below the applicable financial standards until formal eligibility determination is completed nine states offer presumptive eligibility continuous eligibility allows child to remain enrolled for set period of time regardless of whether the childs circumstances change eg the familys income rises above the eligibility threshold thus making it easier for child to stay enrolled thirtysix states offer continuous eligibility the majority of them for 12 monthperiod capping enrollment is one means states can use to control program spending while an individual entitlement exists for children enrolled in medicaid expansions there is such entitlement under separate state programs states with separate schip programs can cap enrollment by receiving centers for medicare and medicaid services cms approval to amend their state schip plans to include such cap two states montana and utah have specific enrollment caps written into their state plans and another state florida has language in its state plan allowing the state to cap enrollment at any time without additional cms approval under medicaid states must provide coverage to pregnant women of any age living in families with income at or below 133 of fpl states also have the option to extend such coverage up to 185 of fpl 4 states are classified as using basic income disregard if they 1 disregard some amount of earnings 2 allow deduction for child care expenses andor 3 disregard all income between specified range of the federal poverty level see appendix 1 for further details crs5 while schip does not include pregnancy status among its eligibility criteria and as rule does not cover persons over age 18 there are three circumstances under which pregnant women over 18 could be covered in separate schip programs first the family coverage option allows states to provide coverage under group health plan that may include maternity care states may cover the entire family including parents if the purchase of such family coverage is cost effective when compared to the cost of covering only the targeted lowincome children in the family and would not substitute for other health insurance there are official data that identify for which states this circumstance applies second states can apply for waivers of program rules to extend coverage to adults as of june 2003 10 states had section 1115 waivers that expanded schip coverage to include one or more categories of adults with children typically parents of medicaidschip children caretaker relatives legal guardians andor pregnant women finally in rule published in october of 2002 the definition of child for schip purposes was changed such that states may consider an unborn child to be targeted lowincome child if all other applicable eligibility requirements are met this change allowed states to extend schip coverage to pregnant women of any age who meet all financial eligibility requirements of the program three states illinois michigan and rhode island provide prenatal care to unborn children in their separate schip programs state by state detail on income disregards asset tests presumptive and continuous eligibility enrollment caps and waiting lists and prenatal coverage for unborn children can be found in appendices 2 and 4 benefit packages as noted above when designing their schip program states may expand their current medicaid program create new separate state insurance program or devise combination of both approaches states that choose to cover targeted lowincome children under medicaid must provide the full range of mandatory medicaid benefits as well as all optional services specified in their state medicaid plans states that create separate state programs choose any of three benefit options 1 benchmark benefit package 2 benchmark equivalent coverage or 3 any other health benefits plan that the secretary of health and human services determines will provide appropriate coverage to the targeted population of uninsured children referred to as secretary approved benefits plan in addition for florida new york and pennsylvania specific programs already in existence when the law establishing schip was enacted were designated as meeting the minimum benefit requirements under schip these grandfathered programs are called existing comprehensive statebased programs benchmark benefit package is one of the following three plans 1 the standard blue crossblue shield preferred provider option plan offered under the federal employees health benefits program fehbp 2 the health coverage that is offered and generally available to state employees in the state involved and 3 the crs6 health coverage that is offered by health maintenance organization hmo with the largest commercial nonmedicaid enrollment in the state involved benchmark equivalent coverage is defined as package of benefits that has the same actuarial value as one of the benchmark benefit packages state choosing to provide benchmark equivalent coverage must cover each of the benefits in the basic benefits category the benefits in the basic benefits category are inpatient and outpatient hospital services physicians surgical and medical services lab and xray services and wellbaby and wellchild care including ageappropriate immunizations benchmark equivalent coverage must also include at least 75 of the actuarial value of coverage under the benchmark plan for each of the benefits in the additional service category these additional services include prescription drugs mental health services vision services and hearing services states are encouraged to cover other categories of service not listed above abortions may not be covered except in the case of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when an abortion is necessary to save the mothers life six categories of secretary approved coverage are defined in regulation5 these include coverage that is the same as the coverage provided to children under the state medicaid plan b is the same as the coverage provided to children under comprehensive medicaid section 1115 waiver c either includes the full early and periodic screening diagnosis and treatment epsdt benefit6 or that the state has extended to the entire medicaid population in the state d includes benchmark health benefits coverage plus any additional coverage is the same as the coverage provided under existing comprehensive statebased programs in florida pennsylvania or new york or f is substantially equivalent to or greater than coverage under benchmark health benefits plan determined via benefitbybenefit comparison demonstrating that coverage for each benefit meets or exceeds the corresponding coverage under the benchmark health benefits plan secretary approved benefit plans are not limited to these six categories as long as the coverage provided is determined to be appropriate for the target population table 2 summarizes the types of benefit packages used by the 44 separate state programs that existed as of june 2003 5 department of health and human services state child health revisions to the regulations implementing the state childrens health insurance program 66 federal register 33810 june 25 2001 6 the epsdt program provides screening and preventive care to nearly all groups of medicaid beneficiaries under 21 years old as well as services necessary to correct health problem identified through screening crs7 table 2 benefits packages in separate state programs as of

federal law permits states to require costsharing7 for some beneficiaries and some services under schip costsharing policies and limits are different for medicaid expansions versus separate state programs as described below total of 38 states require some form of costsharing in either medicaid expansion separate state program or both see appendix 3 for details costsharing under medicaid expansions states that choose to implement schip as medicaid expansion must follow the costsharing rules of the medicaid program which prohibits costsharing for children under 18 nominal costsharing is allowed for persons 18 years of age and older however if state has section 1115 waiver that allows costsharing for children enrolled in its medicaid program the state may also impose costsharing for children enrolled in medicaid expansion under schip six states arkansas missouri new mexico ohio rhode island and wisconsin have section 1115 waiver programs that include costsharing for children in medicaid expansions five of these states are medicaid expansiononly states ie they do not also have separate schip program rhode island is combination state for which costsharing applies to children in its medicaid expansion under section 1115 waiver and in its separate state program for unborn children also under section 1115 waiver authority 7 three forms of costsharing for beneficiaries are most common premium usually paid on monthly basis represents the price beneficiaries must pay for insurance coverage regardless of whether services are actually received copayment is an item or service specific fee eg 10 for an office visit that is paid at the time that item or service is rendered deductible typically applied on an annual basis eg 250 deductible per year is the amount beneficiaries must incur before the insurance begins to cover the subsequent costs of care premiums do not count toward deductible requirement crs8 these six states fall into two costsharing groups three of these states arkansas missouri and new mexico require more than nominal copayments for selected services and do not require any form of premium payments or annual fees two of the remaining states rhode island and wisconsin require monthly premiums only with copayments for services and one state ohio8 has approval to implement an annual fee only costsharing under separate state programs if state implements schip through separate state program premiums or enrollment fees for program participation may be imposed but the maximum allowable amount is dependent on family income for all families with incomes under 150 fpl and enrolled in separate state programs premiums may not exceed the amounts set forth in federal medicaid regulations additionally these families may be charged servicerelated costsharing but such costsharing is limited to 1 nominal amounts defined in federal medicaid regulations for the subgroup with income below 100 fpl and 2 slightly higher amounts defined in schip regulations for families with income between 101150 fpl for family with income above 150 fpl costsharing may be imposed in any amount provided that costsharing for higher income children is not less than costsharing for lower income children the total annual aggregate costsharing including premiums deductibles copayments and any other charges for all children in any schip family may not exceed 5 of total family income for the year in addition states must inform families of these limits and provide mechanism for families to stop paying once the costsharing limits have been reached most separate state programs require costsharing in the form of either premiums copayments or both some states charge quarterly or annual enrollment fee instead of monthly premium table 3 shows costsharing patterns among the 44 separate state programs in the 36 states with such programs most of these programs have sliding scale for cost sharing ie the amount paid depends on family income eight programs require copays but premiums sixteen programs require premiums but copays finally 16 programs require both premiums and copays while states have the option to require deductibles only one state does so data not shown9 8 ohio has not implemented its section 1115 waiver 9 north dakota requires enrollees to pay 50 deductible for the first day of each inpatient hospital admission

scale programs only the amounts charged by slidingscale programs for given service tend to reflect wider range of values than the amounts charged by flatscale programs this result is largely because charges for sliding scale programs vary across multiple income bands among the 24 programs that charge copays see table 3 20 charge copays for prescription drugs 18 charge for office visits six charge for inpatient services 15 charge for emergency use of an emergency room and 22 charge for non emergency use of an emergency room the specific amounts charged under each program can be seen in

coverage groups substitution of schip for private health insurance finally states that establish schip programs must ensure that schip does not substitute for coverage under group health plans phenomenon known as crowd out10 the primary method for preventing crowdout is requiring waiting period that is specified lengths of time for which applicants must be uninsured prior to enrollment in schip waiting periods are only permitted in medicaid expansions under section 1115 waiver as seen in the third to last column of appendix 2 30 states require waiting period ranging from one to six months 10 for further information see crs report rl30657 limiting and measuring the substitution of the state childrens health insurance program schip for private health insurance by debra cohan crs11 requiring costsharing under schip may also serve as crowdout prevention measure by discouraging applicants from viewing schip as more attractive than employersponsored insurance for which costsharing is common as noted above 38 states require costsharing finally premium subsidy programs can encourage use of private instead of public insurance for lowincome children whose parents have access to employer sponsored insurance esi but cannot afford their share of the premium11 under separate state programs states that provide premium assistance for employer sponsored insurance to the families of targeted lowincome children must require 1 with some exceptions waitingperiod of six to twelve months without group health plan coverage before coverage through the premium assistance program begins 2 identify reasonable minimum employer contribution level and provide justification for that level and 3 premium subsidy that does not exceed the payment the state would otherwise make on the childs behalf as shown in appendix 2 six states provide access to esi under at least one of their separate state programs as noted above some states have multiple separate schip programs two of these states have section 1115 waivers one waives the minimum employer contribution and the other requires 50 employer contribution the remaining states require employer contributions ranging from 30 to 50 states may also provide premium assistance for employersponsored health insurance through medicaid expansions under medicaid states may pay beneficiarys share of the costs for group health coverage for any medicaid enrollee for whom employerbased coverage is available and that coverage is both comprehensive and costeffective for the state an individuals enrollment in an employer plan is costeffective if paying the premiums deductibles coinsurance and other costsharing obligations of the employer plan is less expensive than the states expected cost of directly providing medicaidcovered services two states offer esi through their medicaid expansions using section 1115 waiver authority one requires minimum employer contribution of 40 section 1115 waivers states that want to make changes to their schip programs that go beyond what the law will allow may do so through what is called section 1115 waiver named for the section of the social security act that defines the circumstances under which such waivers may be granted the secretary of health and human services may waive certain statutory requirements for conducting research and demonstration projects under schip that allow states to adapt their programs to specific needs 11 unless the state has waiver specifying otherwise states must insure that the benefit packages and costsharing obligations under employersponsored insurance programs meet the requirements in schip statute if the esi benefit package falls short of the statutes requirements states must provide wraparound services to bridge any gaps between the esi benefit package and the schip benefits package offered by the state crs12 on august 4 2001 the bush administration announced the health insurance flexibility and accountability hifa demonstration initiative using section 1115 waiver authority this initiative is designed to encourage states to extend medicaid and schip to the uninsured with particular emphasis on statewide approaches that maximize private health insurance coverage options and target populations with income below 200 fpl as of july 2003 cms had approved 14 schip section 1115 waivers in 13 states12 eight of the 14 approved waivers are hifa demonstrations in arizona california colorado illinois new jersey new mexico new york and oregon in 10 of the 13 states with approved section 1115 waivers excluding maryland new york and ohio schip coverage is expanded to include one or more categories of adults13 with children typically parents of medicaidschip children caretaker relatives legal guardians andor pregnant women three states arizona new mexico and oregon also cover childless adults under their hifa demonstrations in addition to expanding coverage to new populations under waivers some states have used this authority for other purposes rhode island has been granted approval to use redistributed schip funds to finance coverage of adults with children in its waiver program through hifa new jersey will offer the same separate schip program benefit package to adults covered under its schip and medicaid waiver demonstrations using section 1115 waiver authority both maryland and new mexico require sixmonth period of insurance prior to enrollment under their waivers14 new mexico has also modified its costsharing rules for targeted low income children under its medicaid program new yorks hifa demonstration provided temporary disaster relief in new york city due to the events of september 11 2001 finally ohio received approval to implement an annual enrollment fee and to give 12 months of continuous eligibility for certain targeted lowincome children in its medicaid program15 states can also modify their schip programs using medicaid 1115 waiver in addition to the states identified above four other states arkansas hawaii missouri and tennessee with medicaid expansions only used waiver authority to expand an existing comprehensive medicaid 1115 demonstration program other modifications affecting the medicaid expansions in these states included for example establishing 12 the 13 states are az ca co il md mn nj nm ny oh or ri and wi nm has two approved schip section 1115 waivers the remaining states have one waiver each 13 states have the option to purchase family coverage under group health plan that may cover adults as long as it is costeffective to do so relative to the amount paid for comparable coverage for the children only and it must not substitute for health insurance that would otherwise be provided to the children for states seeking greater flexibility both in selecting which adults to cover and in the benefit package offered to those adults waiver is required 14 in general for medicaid expansions under schip all medicaid rules apply thus when states with schip medicaid expansions want to implement other rules eg establish waiting periods before enrollment implement enrollment fees etc waiver is required 15 due to variety of budget and resource constraints in may 2002 oh decided not to pursue implementation of its waiver crs13 sixmonth waiting period prior to enrollment higher costsharing requirements that exceed otherwise allowable limits and authority to implement enrollment caps as necessary appendices state by state program characteristics appendix 1 describes the methodology employed throughout this report appendices 2 and 3 are statebystate matrices of selected program characteristics and selected costsharing amounts respectively appendix 4 consists of 51 tables that provide an overview of general schip program characteristics for each of the 50 states and the district of columbia as of october 1 2002 all children under age 19 in families with income up to 100 fpl must be covered by medicaid and thus cannot be enrolled in schip therefore there is medicaid expansion information presented for the four states16 that had such programs prior to october 1 2002 solely to cover such children for more information about schip see crs report rl30642 the state childrens health insurance program eligibility enrollment and program funding by evelyne baumrucker and crs report rl30473 state childrens health insurance program brief overview by elicia herz and peter kraut 16 ms tn and tx crs14 appendix 1 methodology the main source of data presented in this report is crs database that is based primarily on information contained in official schip state plans and accompanying documentation including all amendments approved by cms as of june 30 2003 schip state plans do not contain detailed information on certain program characteristics in particular for section 1115 waivers and for medicaid expansion programs in addition to the crs database other sources of data used in this report include the following information on schip section 1115 waivers is from the centers for medicare and medicaid services section 1115 demonstrations state profiles july 25 2003 at httpwwwcmshhsgovschip 1115waivpdf as well as cmsstate terms and conditions andor operational protocol documents in some cases we also contacted cms and state officials to clarify or expand on information contained in these documents for medicaid expansion programs information on income eligibility thresholds lower and upper bounds is taken from documentation accompanying schip state plans schip annual evaluation reports and crs report rl30642 the state childrens health insurance program eligibility enrollment and program funding by evelyne baumrucker data as of april 2003 on asset tests continuous and presumptive eligibility waiting

state update on eligibility enrollment renewal and costsharing practices in medicaid and schip center on budget and policy priorities prepared for the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured july 2003 crs survey of states on selected program characteristics for separate schip programs as of december 31 2002 is the basis for the presumptive eligibility information for such programs states are not required to provide detailed information on income counting methods in their state schip plans data on basic income disregards for medicaid expansions and separate schip programs are taken from two surveys 1 crs survey of selected program characteristics for separate schip programs as of december 31 2002 and 2 survey conducted under contract to crs by the george washington university of selected program characteristics for medicaid expansions and eligibility rules for other groups of medicaid children as of december 31 2002 throughout this report yes entry for the basic income disregards field means that the state disregards some amount of earnings or 2 allows deduction for childcare expenses or 3 disregards all income crs15 between specified range of the federal poverty level eg in its separate schip program new jersey disregards all income between 200350 fpl coding of basic income disregards among medicaid expansion programs requires additional explanation schip law defines schip eligible as targeted lowincome child under the age of 19 with health insurance and who would not have been eligible for medicaid under the rules in effect on march 31 1997 under medicaid states may cover targeted lowincome children in one or more of the following ways 1 by establishing new optional eligibility group for such children as authorized in schip law 2 by liberalizing the financial rules for any of several existing medicaid eligibility categories eg the povertyrelated groups using section 1902r2 authority andor 3 by liberalizing the income standards or methodologies applicable to family coverage under section 1931 many states have chosen to cover targeted low income children under existing medicaid eligibility pathways especially the povertyrelated groups rather than by establishing the optional coverage group identified in schip law on the crs sponsored medicaid eligibility survey conducted by george washington university there was field indicating which of these options state used to create its schip medicaid expansion group the basic income disregards field was coded as yes if the criteria described above were met for any of the relevant groups there are inconsistencies in state schip plans in how states report lower income boundaries that apply to different age groups under schip the lower income boundaries shown in this report reflect the upper income boundary applicable to the next adjacent age or income group for example children up to six years of age in families with income up to 133 of the federal poverty level fpl must be covered in the regular medicaid program for state implementing separate schip program for the same age group the lower income boundary shown in this report would equal 133 fpl crs16 appendix 2 selected schip
