were concerns by us weapons producers that they were at competitive disadvantage in marketing their products internationally representatives of the us defense industry argued that having us loan guarantee program that could induce private lending institutions to make loans to lesswealthy nations for purchases of armaments would enhance the ability of american companies to compete effectively for prospective weapons contracts abroad critics of such loan program argued that the united states should not expend funds to he lp underwrite loans for weapons purchases by developing nations that already lacked sufficient res ources to pay for major domestic social services other critics of this loan pr ogram argued that the united states should not provide loan guarantees to nations that we re poor credit risks and might default on the loans underwritten by the united states the delg program that was enacted is legislative amalgam that reflects the wishes of those who wished to create
