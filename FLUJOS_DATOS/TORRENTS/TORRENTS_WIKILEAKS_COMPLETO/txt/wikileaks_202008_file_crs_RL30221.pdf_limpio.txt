court about whether religious practices ought to be given special treatment by government and about congress power to mandate such treatment prior to 1990 the courts had generally applied although often with light hand strict scrutiny test to government actions that imposed substantial burdens on the exercise of religion but in 1990 in employment division v smith the court largely eliminated the strict scrutiny test for free exercise cases in response congress in 1993 enacted the religious freedom restoration act rfra reapplying and extending the strict scrutiny test to all government actions including those of state and local governments that impose substantial burdens on religious exercise but in city of boerne texas v flores in 1997 the court held that congress lacks the power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment to impose rfra on state and local governments rlpa is response to that decision and would reapply strict scrutiny standard to the actions of state and local governments on the basis not of 5 except with respect to land use decisions but of congress powers to attach conditions to federal funding programs and to regulate commerce rlpa raises several major issues first is the policy question of whether and to what degree religious exercise ought to be protected by federal law from burdensome interference by state and local governments ie whether religious exercise should be afforded special treatment by government or should instead be treated neutrally rlpa is intended to be broadly protective of religious exercise and revisions that have occurred since it was first introduced in 1998 have made it increasingly so second issue concerns whether congress has the constitutional power to mandate that state and local governments give religion special treatment questions have been raised about whether rlpa exceeds congress power under the spending clause by imposing condition on federal grants that is coercive on the states and that has little nexus to the individual spending programs to which it is attached whether rlpas use of the commerce power violates principles of federalism and whether its reliance on 5 of the fourteenth amendment in its land use provisions satisfies the requirements the supreme court has articulated for congress exercise of that power question has also been raised about whether state and local nondiscrimination statutes ought to be exempted from its purview this report provides background on the supreme courts decisions in smith and boerne and congress passage of rfra summarizes

representatives adopted slightly modified version of h r 1691 the religious liberty protection act of 1999 rlpa by vote of 306118 prior to that vote the house rejected an amendment to limit rlpas applicability with respect to some state and local nondiscrimination measures 190234 in the senate the measure has been referred to the judiciary committee while slightly modified version s 2081 has been placed on the senate calendar without referral to committee first introduced in the second session of the 105th congress rlpa is part of an ongoing conversation between congress and the supreme court for the quarter of century prior to 1990 the courts had generally applied strict scrutiny test to government actions that imposed substantial burdens on religious exercise in order for burden on religious practice to be sustained as constitutional under that test government had to demonstrate that its action served compelling public purpose and did so by means more restrictive of religious exercise than necessary to accomplish the purpose if the government could not so demonstrate it had to exempt the religious practice in question from the law or regulation or action that imposed the burden the courts often applied the strict scrutiny test with light hand however and during the 1980s the supreme court became increasingly disenchanted with the test that disenchantm ent culminated in 1990 in employment division oregon department of human resources v smith1 in which the court largely eliminated the strict scrutiny test as the standard government must meet to justify actions that impose substantial burdens on the exercise of religion it held instead that religious exemptions are compelled by the free exercise clause from governmental regulations that are religiously neutral and generally applicable matter how severe their impact on the religious practice in response congress in 1993 enacted the religious freedom restoration act rfra2 reapplying and extending in part the

continueda statutory mandate but in city of boerne texas v flores3 in 1997 the court held rfras coverage of state and local governments to exceed congress power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment rlpa is response to that decision and would reapply strict scrutiny standard to the actions of state and local governments on the basis not of 5 except with respect to land use decisions but of congress powers to attach conditions to federal funding programs and to regulate commerce rlpa thus raises serious questions about the extent to which religious exercise ought to be given special treatment by government and about congress power to mandate such special treatment by statute this report provides background on the supreme courts decisions in smith and boerne and congress adoption of rfra summarizes legislative action on rlpa in the 105th and 106th congresses and frames some of the salient legal issues implicated by rlpa the smith decision the free exercise clause of the first amendment provides in pertinent part that congress shall make law prohibiting the free exercise of religion4 it has long been clear that this clause protects religious beliefs absolutely from governmental interference but over the past century the court has used various standards of review in applying the clause to government actions that have impinged on religious practices in 1963 in sherbert v verner5 however the court seemed to settle on the strict scrutiny standard as the basic standard of judicial review religious interests the court said are to be considered of paramount importance in the constitutional scheme and government actions infringing those interests are to be viewed as highly suspect as consequence the court held that government actions alleged to interfere with religious practices are constitutional only if they can be shown to serve some compelling public interest and to be more restrictive of religious practices than necessary absent such showing the religious practice had to be exempted from the governmental statute or regulation or action that imposed the burden over the next quarter of century the courts did not always apply this strict scrutiny standard with unfailing rigor indeed religious interests prevailed in only minority of the reported cases6 and in the 1980s the supreme court indicated ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30221crs3 6continued court rejected 13 of 19 free exercise claims and the us courts of appeal rejected 60 of 67 free exercise claims they heard during that period see appendix in eeoc v townley engineering mfg

unemployment compensation to persons who were unemployed due to conflict between their faith and the requirements of job and for what it termed hybrid cases ie cases that involved not only free exercise claim but another constitutional claim as well 9congress in 1994 made the religious use of peyote by members of the native american church legal under federal law see pl 103344 oct 6 1994 42 usca 1996a oregon similarly amended its law and decriminalized the religious use of peyote after smith see ore rev stat 4759925 1996 suppgrowing disenchantment with the test by applying lower standard of review to free exercise claims by prisoners and military personnel7 but the test still seemed to some to stand as norm that gave degree of special protection to religious exercise from burdensome governmental regulations or actions however in 1990 in employment division oregon department of human resources v smith supra the supreme court largely abandoned strict scrutiny as the constitutional test for free exercise cases 54 it retained strict scrutiny for governmental actions that intentionally discriminate against religion or particular religious group8 but it abandoned strict scrutiny for governmental actions that simply sct of burdening religious practice the court said that so long as laws are religiously neutral and generally applicable they may be uniformly applied to all persons without regard to any burden or even prohibition placed on their exercise of religion the free exercise clause the court said never relieves an individual of the obligation to comply with valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes in smith itself that standard of neutrality meant that the free exercise clause was construed to mandate religious exemption from oregons laws criminalizing the possession and use of drugs for native americans who use peyote in sacramental ceremonies and consequently eligibility for unemployment benefits for two native americans who lost their jobs because of their participation in such ceremony more generally the court asserted that the question of whether religious practices ought to be accommodated by government was matter to be resolved by the political process and not the courts although it admitted that leaving accommodation to the political process will place at relative disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in the religious freedom restoration act the specific result in smith was upsetting to some9 but it was the courts abandonment of strict scrutiny for facially neutral laws and relegation of most freehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30221crs4 10the coalition eventually comprised 67 organizations

religious freedom restoration act of 1990 rfra hr 5377 s 3254 after three years of consideration congress enacted modified version of rfra into law in 199311 none of the versions of rfra considered by congress addressed any specific free exercise concern rather the intent was to restore and slightly expand the strict scrutiny test as the general standard governing the interaction of government and religious exercise because constitutional amendment would have been required to do that for the judicial interpretation of the first amendment rfra was crafted to impose the strict scrutiny test as statutory standard as enacted rfra provided that statute or regulation of general applicability can lawfully burden persons free exercise of religion only if it can be shown to be essential to further compelling governmental interest and to be the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest rfra made the standard applicable to governmental action at every level federal state and local and included those areas such as the military and prisons that the supreme court had excluded from the application of the strict scrutiny test in the previous decade12 as the means of enforcement rfra allowed aggrieved parties to bring suit if they believed their free exercise of religion had been restricted by government in violation of the statutory standard city of boerne texas v flores one of the issues that received some attention albeit limited during congress three years of intermittent debate about rfra was whether congress had the constitutional power to enact it some contended that rfra violated constitutional principles both of federalism and of separation of powers but congress ultimately decided it had sufficient power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment13 to apply the measure to the states and under the necessary and proper clause of article i to apply it to the federal government14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30221crs5 14continued be necessary

constitutionality of rfra as applied to the federal government after boerne and the supreme continued nonetheless arguments against the measures constitutionality were pressed in litigation under rfra in city of boerne texas v flores supra one of the arguments proved successful on june 25 1997 the supreme court held rfra to be unconstitutional as applied to the states 63 on the grounds congress lacked the power under 5 of the 14th amendment to impose strict scrutiny standard regarding religious exercise on the states boerne involved conflict between local catholic church that wanted to raze much of its existing structure and build larger sanctuary and the city of boernes designation of the original sanctuary as an historic structure under its historic preservation ordinance archbishop flores sued on behalf of the church arguing in part that the citys denial of building permit substantially burdened the churchs religious practices in violation of rfra and that the church therefore ought to be exempt from the citys historic preservation ordinance the city responded by contending that rfra was unconstitutional the supreme court agreed with the citys argument holding that as applied to the states rfra exceeds congress power the court stated that 5 of the 14th amendment gives congress the power to enforce the provisions of the amendment but power to adopt legislation that alters the meaning or the substance of the rights it protects moreover it said in congress exercise of its remedial or preventive power under 5 there must be congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end yet in enacting rfra the court asserted congress not only had failed to develop legislative record that showed extensive denials of religious liberty but also had made rfra so broad that it intruded at every level of government displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter particularly with respect to the states it noted rfra constituted considerable congressional intrusion into the states traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens as consequence the court concluded rfra reflects lack of proportionality or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved and contradicts vital principles necessary to maintain separation of powers and the federal balance thus after boerne state and local governments are longer bound by rfra because as to them rfra is unconstitutional the court also hinted in boerne that rfra might be unconstitutional with respect to the federal government on separation of powers grounds but that issue was not squarely before the court and the clinton administration continues to maintain that rfra is constitutional as applied to the federal government15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30221crs6 15continued court has as yet not chosen to resolve the

expansive version of strict scrutiny and made it applicable to all governmental actions judicial decisions applying the statute do not appear to have differed markedly in result from those of the presmith era religious claimants still lost far more often than they won16 nonetheless after lengthy consultations within the coalition for the free exercise of religion and among members of congress the religious liberty protection act of 1998 rlpa was introduced on june 9 1998 with bipartisan sponsorship in both the house and the senate hr 4019 sponsored by representatives canady and nadler and s 2148 by senators hatch and kennedy as introduced rlpa would have re imposed strict scrutiny test with respect to religious practices on state and local governments using different congressional powers than that struck down in boerne as introduced rlpa would have barred state and local governments 1 from substantially burdening persons religious exercise in or affecting commerce or in program or activity operated by such government that receives federal financial assistance unless application of the burden furthers compelling public interest and is the least restrictive means of doing so 2 from imposing any land use regulation that substantially burdens religious exercise unless the burden is the least restrictive means to prevent substantial and tangible harm to neighboring properties or to the public health and safety and 3 from imposing any land use regulation which denies religious assemblies reasonable location in the jurisdiction or exclude s religious assemblies from areas in which nonreligious assemblies are permitted reflecting continuing controversy over prisoner suits under rfra the bill also required that prisoner suits under rlpa remained subject to the prison

criminal justice system caused by the relief and allows any party to petition the court for the termination of such relief after two years 18this definition was direct response to number of court decisions which had limited the applicability of rfra by narrowing the range of religious practices within its purview some courts for instance had held rfra applicable only if the practice burdened by government was compelled by religious belief and thus excluded from its protection religious practices merely motivated by religious belief other courts had limited the applicability of rfra by requiring that the practices and beliefs be central to the persons religion see eg goodall v stafford county 60 f3d 168 4th cir 1995 cert den 516 us 1046 1996 cheffer v reno 55 f3d 1517 11th cir 1995

subcommittee rejected amendments to bar rlpa from being used as defense in civil and criminal actions based on federal state or local child welfare laws civil rights laws and environmental protection

retained most of the changes that had been made by the subcommittee on the constitution in its markup last year with the major exception that it reinserted the provision based on the commerce clause and allowed land use suits to be brought under that provisio n as well as under the more detailed land use section the subcommittee held hearing on hr 1691 on may 12 199922 that found substantial support for the bill but that also retraced the concerns voiced the previous year about the constitutionality of the measures reliance on the spending and commerce powers whether it constitutes too expansive use of federal power and whether its use of the commerce power denigrates religion by equating it with commerce testimony also was given raising in more forceful manner than previously

necessary to serve compelling public interest in any program or activity it operates which receives federal financial assistance and b in any instance in which the burden or its removal would affect commerce with foreign nations among the several states or with indian tribes 2 section 3 would impose strict scrutiny standard on any state or local land use regulation which imposes substantial burden on persons religious exercise if the regulation allows the government to make individualized assessments of the proposed uses to which property would be put 3 section 3 would in addition bar state or local government from imposing land use regulations that fail to treat religious entities on an equal basis with nonreligious entities b discriminate against any entity on the basis of religion or religious denomination or c unreasonably exclude religious entity from given jurisdiction 4 section 4 of hr 1691 would provide that aggrieved parties may bring suit and obtain appropriate relief against state and local governments and that the federal government can institute suit to enforce compliance with the act during its markup the subcommittee on the constitution adopted an amendment proffered by rep canady slightly altering the definition of the term religious exercise in the bill23 it also rejected two amendments by voice vote 1 substitute amendment put forward by rep watt dnc entitled the religious liberty enforcement act of 1999 that in place of rlpas strict scrutiny requirements would have required government simply to make fair and reasonable accommodation of the special requirements of persons acting pursuant to their religious convictions and 2 an amendment by rep nadler dny limiting rlpas applicability by allowing it to be used as defense against state

commerce clause provision by requiring that rlpa applies only if the burden on religious exercise or its removal has substantial effect on commerce s 2081 also adds provision stating that rlpa does not abrogate the states sovereign immunity that provision appears to mean that aggrieved individuals could not bring suit against the states in either the federal or the state courts to rectify perceived violations of their free exercise rights instead suits against the states for violations of rlpa could be instituted only by the federal government individuals would be able to bring suit only against state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief and for damages31 finally it should be noted that both hr 1691 and s 2081 continue to generate controversy about their implications for state and local civil rights statutes selected legal issues rlpa is response to the supreme courts decision in city of boerne texas v flores supra holding congress to lack the power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment to impose strict scrutiny standard with respect to religious exercise on state and local governments thus it deliberately uses different congressional powers than did rfra section 2 of rlpa relies on congress commerce and spending powers while 3 concerning land use still relies largely on 5 of the fourteenth amendment the following subsections briefly describe the constitutional controversies over these provisions and the issue of the impact of rlpa on state and local civil rights provisions 1 spending power section 2 of both hr 1691 and s 2081 would impose strict scrutiny standard with respect to governmental burdens on religious exercise in program or activity operated by state or local government that receives federal financial assistance in other words it makes use of congress spending power under article i 8 of the constitution the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common

implementing federal policies and are binding on the recipients they can be avoided only if the recipient refuses to accept the federal money although generally given broad sway by the courts such conditions are nonetheless subject to certain standards laid down by the supreme court in south dakota v dole32 the court most recently articulated the following tests 1 the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of the general welfare 2 the condition must be stated unambiguously so that the states can exercise their choice knowingly cognizant of the consequences of their participation33 3 conditions must be reasonably related to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs34 ie there must be nexus between the spending program and the condition attached to the spending 4 the conditions must not violate other constitutional provisions and 5 particular condition might exceed congress power if the states do not retain real choice about whether or not to accept the federal money with the condition ie the financial inducement offered by congress must not be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion35 thus the constitutional question about this portion of 2 concerns whether it meets these tests particularly the courts sufficient nexus and noncoercion tests 2 commerce power section 2 of hr 1691 and s 2081 also would bar state and local governments from substantiall burdening religious exercise absent compelling reason in any case in which the substantial burden on the persons religious exercise affects or in which removal of that substantial burden would affect commerce with foreign nations among the several states or with indian tribes as noted above s 2081 requires in addition that the effect on commerce be substantial thus this part of 2 employs congress article i 8 power over commerce the congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes the primary constitutional question appears to concern whether and the extent to which this power may now be limited by principles of federalism decisions by the supreme court

power has been given such broad construction that it has been described as the most potent grant of authority in 837 but several decisions by the supreme court in the past decade including the boerne decision have given higher value to federalism concerns than formerly38 in printz v united states 39 for instance the court struck down provision of the brady act that required local law enforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective gun purchasers on federalism grounds stressing that the constitution established system of dual sovereignty the framers the court said rejected the concept of central government that would act upon and through the states and instead designed system in which the state and federal governments would exercise concurrent authority over the people 40 moreover in united states v lopez supra the court struck down the gunfree school zones act of 1990 barring persons from possessing guns within certain distance of public schools on the grounds it exceeded congress power under the commerce clause the first time the court has invalidated federal statute resting on the commerce clause in more than half century41 the court stated under the theories that the government presents it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where states historically have been

any concrete tie to interstate commerce to uphold the governments contentions here we would have to pile inference upon inference in manner that would bid fair to convert congressional authority under the commerce clause to general police power of the sort retained by the states this we are unwilling to do43 most recently in alden v maine supra the court held congress to be without power under article i to subject states to suit in state courts under the fair labor standards act44 stating that the states immunity from suit is fundamental aspect of the sovereignty which the states enjoyed before the ratification of the constitution and which they retain today except as altered by the plan of the convention or certain constitutional amendments taken together these decisions raise questions about the scope of the powers reserved to the states or denied to the federal government under the constitution and consequently about the constitutionality of hr 1691s and s 2081s use of the commerce power 3 section 5 of the 14th amendment section 3b of rlpa would impose number of restrictions on state and local land use decisions strict scrutiny standard with respect to any burdens such decisions place on religious exercise if in making the decision the government has the authority to make individualized assessments of the proposed uses to which real property would be put prohibition on regulations that fail to treat religious institutions equally with nonreligious institutions prohibition on regulations that discriminate on the basis of religion and prohibition on unreasonably excluding religious institutions from given jurisdiction the section may to an indeterminate extent rely on congress commerce power as land use decisions often have substantial economic impacts that possibility seems buttressed by the fact that unlike last years version of rlpa hr 1691 and s 2081 do not limit challenges to land use decisions to 3 but allow them to be made under 2 as well but the section also appears to rely on one aspect of the supreme courts decision in employment division oregon department of human resources v smith supra and to be an effort to meet the requirements the court set forth for the exercise of congress power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment in smith as noted above the court largely abandoned strict scrutiny as the applicable constitutional test for alleged violations of the free exercise clause of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30221crs15 45employment division oregon department of human resources v smith supra at 884 46city of boerne texas v flores supra at 53031first amendment but it retained strict scrutiny in three respects 1 cases involving intentional discrimination against religion 2 cases raising hybrid constitutional claims ie alleged violations of both free exercise rights and of some other constitutional right and 3 cases denying religious exemption in program which allows exemptions for other reasons with respect to the last category the court stressed that strict scrutiny was first applied to religious claims in cases challenging denials of unemployment compensation ie cases in which the government could make individualized assessments of the reasons for the relevant conduct that history it said stood for the proposition that where the state has in place system of individual exemptions it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without compelling reason45 thus the first part of 3 of hr 1691 and s 2081 appears to be an effort to build on the latter category of cases for which strict scrutiny remains the constitutional standard subsection b1a of 3 would impose strict scrutiny on the implementation of state and local land use regulations to the extent that the government has the authority to make individualized assessments of the proposed uses to which real property would be put the constitutional question that might be raised about the section is whether the standard the court articulated is in fact applicable to programs other than unemployment compensati on that use individualized assessments although the court did not impose any conditions on this aspect of its ruling in smith it has not as yet considered the continued applicability of the strict scrutiny standard for any other kinds of programs the other parts of 3 appears to rely on 5 of the fourteenth amendment and to be an attempt to satisfy what the court said in boerne and now in florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board v college savings bank supra about congress exercise of its power under 5 in striking down rfra on federalism grounds in boerne the court stressed in part the limitations of the legislative record that had been made during its consideration by congress the history of persecution in this country detailed in the hearings mentions episodes occurring in the past 40 years it said rather it stated the emphasis of the hearings was on laws of general applicability which place incidental burdens on religion and centered upon anecdotal evidence as consequence the court concluded that the evidentiary record underlying rfra failed to show legislation enacted or enforced due to animus or hostility to the burdened religious practices or some widespread pattern of religious discrimination in this country46 for that reason the sweeping nature of the remedy imposed by rfra it asserted lacked congruence and proportionality to the wrong it was designed to correct similarly in the courts decision last summer in florida prepaid postsecondary education expense board v college savings bank supra it reinforced the standards it had articulated in boerne for congress exercise of power under 5 in that case congress had in 1992 amended the patent laws and expressly abrogated the states immunity from suit for claims of patent infringement but the court held the statute to be an invalid exercise of congress 5 authority it said

patent holders congress it stated had barely considered whether the states conduct might have amounted to constitutional violation under the fourteenth amendment as consequence it concluded congress abrogation of state immunity from suit was so out of proportion to supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to or designed to prevent unconstitutional behavior consequently to support this aspect of rlpa the house subcommittee on the constitution attempted to develop hearing record showing substantial discrimination against religious bodies in state and local land use decisions47 moreover unlike rfra 3 specifically isolates land use decisions as discrete element of the wrong to be remedied the constitutional question appears to be whether these factors are sufficient to meet the requirements the court has set forth in boerne and florida prepaid for congress exercise of its 5 power 4 rlpas impact on civil rights provisions another legal issue and the one that has proven to be the most politically contentious concerns whether rlpas requirement that states not impose substantial burden on religious exercise absent compelling interest might limit the application of state and local nondiscrimination laws the issue has emerged in part because of several court decisions involving the application of state or local laws barring marital status discrimination in housing to landlords who refused to rent to unmarried couples because of the landlords religious beliefs against premarital sexual relations panel of the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit and the state supreme courts in massachusetts and minnesota have held such landlords to be entitled to religious exception from the nondiscrimination laws on the grounds the governmental interest in preventing marital status discrimination in housing does not rise to the level of compell ing interest48 the supreme courts in alaska california and michigan in contrast have held that the state interest in preventing discrimination in housing is sufficiently compelling and that denial of religious exception does not constitute substantial burden on landlords religious exercise49 thus the issue is far from settled but the question of whether nondiscrimination statutes or regulations can pass muster under strict scrutiny standard ie whether they serve compelling public purposes also exists in otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30221crs17 50it is now settled that strict scrutiny applies to all governmental classifications based on race whether invidious or benign see adarand constructors inc v pena 515 us 200 1995 51whether governmental classifications based on gender are subject to strict scrutiny or an intermediate standard of scrutiny is uncertain in the 1970s and early 1980s the court seemed to establish an intermediate standard of scrutiny as the applicable standard requiring governmental discrimination based on gender to serve important public interests and to be substantially related to the achievement of those interests to pass constitutional muster see eg califano v webster 430 us 313 1977 massachusetts personnel administrator v feeney 442 us 256 1979 and mississippi university for women v hogan 458 us 718 1982 but more recently in united states v virginia 518 us 515 1996 the court said that the state had to demonstrate exceedingly persuasive justifications for its genderbased policy at the maleonly virginia military institute that standard seems closely akin if not identical to the compelling interest standard 52see eg heller v doe 509 us

exemptions are nonetheless desirable
