democratic identity of israel after some revision the government approved plan to withdraw from all 21 ttlements in gaza and 4 small settlements in the northern west bank and from military installations protecting them2 following withdrawal the plan calls for israel to continue to guard the land perimeter of gaza to have exclusive authority over its air space and to engage in security activity in the sea off the coast of the gaza strip israel reserves its right of selfdefense that is the right to reenter both the gaza strip and the northern west bank for preventive and reactive operations the plan originally called for israel to maintain military presence along the border between gaza and egypt the philadelphi route but israeli forces left that area after the disengagement was completed and were replaced by egyptian border police timeline on july 13 israeli chief of staff dan halutz closed the gaza strip to nonresidents on august 9 he imposed similar closure on the northern west bank implementation of disengagement began on august 15 2005 when remaining settlers we re given final 48 hours notice to depart israeli police and soldiers began removing those who did

settler homes other soldiers secured roads to the settlements and pe riphery around them to serve as buffer between settlements and palestinian areas and to prevent infiltration by israeli opponents of disengagement more troops were stationed on the israelgaza border to respond to any palestin ian attacks armor and aircra ft were held in reserve for the possibility of heavier fighting disengagement proceeded efficiently many settlers departed voluntarily and those who did not resisted nonviolently despite isr aeli officials concerns about the possibility of settler violence there were few violent in cidents and israeli fired weapon against another israeli those with religious reasons for settling in the territory were among the fiercest opponents of disengagement and ma ny of them did not leave voluntarily before the disengagement the idf had signaled its determination to succeed and to prevent violence on june 30 security forces forcibly removed extremists mainly from the radical kachkahanist movement from hotel in southern gaza settlement israeli authorities placed several kach members in administrative detention and imposed restrictions on suspected settler provocateurs in the west bank one with dual us israeli citizenship was sent home to america nonetheless suspected opponents of disengagement perpetrated two incidents of what prime minister sharon labeled jewish terrorism elsewhere on august 4 an israeli army deserter killed 4 israeli arabs and injured 13 on bus in northern israel nd on august 17 west bank settler shot 4 palestinians at the settlement of shiloh the council of j udea samaria and gaza yesha council the main settler organization vowed to resist disengagemen t peacefully and negotia ted some parameters of its civil disobedience campaign with the idf the idf prevented the council and its followers from engaging in more obstructioni st conduct such as marches into southern gaza nonetheless council leaders and nationalist religious figures successfully summoned an estimated 2000 to 4000 religious youth from israel the west bank and jerusalem to infiltrat settlements and resist evacuati on they caused the most problems for the security forces during disengagement in addition to concerns about possible israeli violence the idf had developed contingency plans to deal with the possibility of palestinian violence israel had insisted that it was not withdrawing under fire but some palestin ian militants took credit for the disengagement and there were fears that they would try to make certain that it took place under fire as it transpired hamas the largest group may ve had vested interest in keeping gaza calm to advance its political ambitions and most palestinian militant groups generally were quiet the idf chief of staff reported below average number of shooting incidents and mortar shellings with casualties coordination issues although israeli officials insist that disengagement was unilateral act they nonetheless coordinate d related issues with the palestinian authority pa disposition of assets on april 15 2005 the united states united nations european union and russia the quartet appointed former world bank presidenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22000crs4 james wolfensohn to be their special envoy for disengagement among other tasks he promoted cooperation between israel and th pa first fruit of wolfensohns labors announced on june 19 was an agreement for the demolition of settle ments in gaza with the palestinians removing debr is some sites will be replaced by highdensity housing for palestinians palestinians will gain freer movement in the northern west bank after israels withdrawal but they will not be able to build in that area because it will remain under israeli control pa lestinian officials have said they will try to change the situation in the northern west bank and their is raeli counterparts may be amenable wolfensohn also worked for the transfer of the settlers commerc ial assets primarily greenhouses to assist the pale stinians with job creation settlers reporte dly dismantled about onethird of the greenhouses and relocat ed them in israel wolfensohn raised 14 million from private us donors to the aspen institute to buy the remaining estimated 750 acres of greenhouses to transf er to palestinians the institute worked with the israel based economic coopera tion foundation the official purchaser security us officials had urged israel and the palestinians to increase security cooperation to ensure that disengagement wa s conducted peacefully in order to establish basis for resuming the peace process israeli defense minister shaul mofaz and palestinian interior minister nasser youssef agreed to coordinate on the ministerial level in joint coordination committees and between commanders in the field as disengagement neared coordina tion intensified the two sides set up joint operations centers at the erez and rafah crossings to help them respond to any violence and on august 14 palestinian security forces ployed to prevent ttacks on settlements by palestinian militants the idf commander in gaza said that pa forces had prevented attacks during disengagement and against the idf afterwards under the terms of bilateral israeliegyptian agreement egypt is deploying 750 border police to secure the gazaegyptian border philadephi rout and prevent arms and drug smuggling and terrorist infiltrati on the palestinians ar not party to these arrangements movement israel and the palestinians have not yet agreed on outlets from the gaza strip to the wider world that are essential for the territorys economic development israel fear that freer palestinian movement w ill lead to increased terrorism within israel james wolfensohn us lt ge n william ward whom the u s administration assigned to work with the palestinians on security reform and the parties are developing plan to upgrade security controls at border crossings to ease the flow of palestinian goods but new system is not yet in place israel accepted an egyptian compromise whereby the rafah crossing would be closed for six to nine months for renovations transit from egypt into gaza would then be via terminal controlled by israel at kerem shalom where the borders of israel egypt and gaza meet after that period people would resume using rafah under european british monito ring with surveillance cameras transmitting images to israel goods would continue to pass through kerem shalom the pa rejected the compromise arguing that israel remains an occupying power as long as it controls access points after israeli forces withdrew from gaza the border was chaotically open to people and goods as well as arms nd drug smugglers for several days the world bank will conduct feasibility st udies on rail link or sunken road between gaza and the west bank which would take several years to construct and

tinian seaport which will take several years prime minister sharon told palestinian president mahmud abbas that he could prepare the gaza airport which could be operati onal in months for reopening but israel has not approved the reopening implications for the future after disengagement the palestinian author ity will attempt to establish record of successful governance in gaza in order to lay the basis for future palestinian state its priorities include developing devastated economy to create jobs and housing and ensuring the security of the residents international aid will help but the pas use of funds will be scrutinized due to past pr oblems with corruption nepotism and waste moreover the pa has not yet established the rule of law in gaza or the west bank problems include vigilantism abductions of aid workers and journalists and clashes between pa security forces and militants moreover hamas intend to transfer its successful armed resistance from gaza to the west bank creating dilemma for president abbas who wants to include the gr oup in the political system and move rapidly to final status negotiations with israel although the israeli government officially recognizes that the future will see the emergence of palestinian state palestinians fear that disengagement reflects an israeli gaza first gaza only policy citing statements of israe li officials on october 6 2004 prime minister sharons aide dov weisglass asserted the significance of the disengagement plan is the freezing of the peace process and when you freeze that process you prevent the establishment of pa lestinian state and you prevent discussion of the refugees the borders and jerusalem3 moreover to assuage settlers fears that disengagement from gaza will set preceden t for withdrawals from the west bank and to win leadership contest in his rightwing likud party sharon has asserted that there will be more unilateral disengagements and repeatedly promised to retain and expand five large west bank settlement bloc s and to connect them territorially to jerusalem and israel however sharon also has suggested that in final negotiations israel might have to give up more west bank settlements he has further declared that he would not hold negotiations on jerusalem under any circumstances after israels disengagement from gaza it has been assumed that the quartet would urge the parties to return to the road map framework phase i of the road map requires israel to dismantle settlement outposts and end all settlement activity and the palestinians to end terrorism us and israeli official s disagree as to whether the requirements of phase i are sequential or simultaneous with sharon repeatedly insisting that forceful pa action against terrorists ie hamas and other groups is precondition for the road map since president abbas has vowed not to us force against factions and intends to include them in the palestinian political pr ocess sharons precondition is unlikely to be met and as noted above israel is conti nuing construction in the settlements us officials have not indicated how they inte nd to assist or accomplish the transition from disengagement
