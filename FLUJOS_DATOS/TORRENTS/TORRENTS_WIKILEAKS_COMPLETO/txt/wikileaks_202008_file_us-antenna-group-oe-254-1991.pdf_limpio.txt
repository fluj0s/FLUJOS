getspecific instructions from your supervisor as to what clear ance your guy wires and ropes must have over the traveled areas and road clearly mark all guy wires and ropes with the warning flags or signs supplied by your unit in an emergency use strips of white cloth as warning streamers if you suspect that powerlines have made accidental contact with your antenna stop operating rope off the antenna area and notify your superiors if the weather in your area can cause ice to form on your long range antenna and its guy wires and ropes add extra guys to support the system rope off the area

to the mast by use of an insulating extension the balun as sembly is connected to the radio set by cable assembly radio frequency cg1889cu mast ab1244grc or mast ab1244bgrc is used to elevate the antenna above ground and is held in vertical position by eight guy ropes theequipment is designed for hand or vehicular transporta tion when disassembled it is packed in nylon fabric roll bag 42 inches long and 39 inches in circumference antenna as3166grc the as3166grc is broadband omnidirectional biconical antenna the three upward and three downward extended radials simu late two cones which are electrically above ground making the overall antenna balanced antenna the extended radials project at an angle of 30 degrees from true vertical the nominal impedance of biconical antenna is 200 ohms requiring the use of balun transformer to match this balanced impedance to the 50ohm unbalanced one side grounded output impedance of the radio to which the as3166grc is connected the impedance transfor mation is accomplished on the as3166grc through the 4 to 1 balun balanced to unbalanced transformer attach ed between the two cones radial cone angle and radial length have been adjusted on the as3166grc to pro vide an acceptable impedance match over the frequency range from 30 to 88 mhz this feature provides broad band antenna that requires adjustments in the ele ments over the operating frequency once erected b antenna elements the extended radials consist of one each of mast sections ab24 ms117a and ms116a the mast sections are copper plated painted tubes of highstgrength

arms extended for ward at chest level pull the mast off the ground using mainly back and leg strength if available raise the mast head off the ground up to four feet by using gin pole box or concrete block fig 216 sheets 1 and 2 walk backwards to the rear guy stake until the mast is fully erect do not pull the lower pulling guy because it will automatical ly tighten during erection the large initial bow in the mast is normald now that the mast is fully erect remove the slip knot attach the pulling guys to the rear guy stake and adjust the tension in all of the guys appropriately check

operations for oe254grc it authorizes categories of maintenance for specific maintenance functions on repairable items and com ponents and the tools and equipment required to per form each function this appendix may be used as an aid in planning maintenance operations d2 maintenance function maintenance functions will be limited to and defined as follows inspect to determine the serviceability of an item by comparing its physical mechanical andor electrical characteristics with established standards through examination b test to verify serviceability and to detect in cipient failure by measuring the mechanical or elec trical characteristics of an item and comparing those characteristics with prescribed standards c service operations required periodically to keep an item in proper operating condition ie to clean decontaminate to preserve to drain to paint or to replenish fuel lubricants hydraulic fluids or com pressed air supplies d adjust to maintain within prescribed limits by bringing into proper or exact position or by set ting the operating characteristics to the specified parameters align to adjust specified variable elements of an item to bring about optimum or desired perfor mance f calibrate to determine and cause corrections to be made or to be adjusted on instruments or test measuring and diagnostic equipments used in preci sion measurement consists of comparisons of two in struments one of which is certified standard of known accuracy to detect and adjust any discrepancy in the accuracy of the instrument being compared g install the act of emplacing seating or fixing into position an item part module component or assembly in manner to allow the proper func tioning of the equipment or systemh replace the act of substituting serviceable like type part subassembly or module component or assembly for an unserviceable counterpart i repair the application of maintenance services inspect test service adjust align calibrate replace or

prescribed by maintenance standards i dmwr in appropriate technical publications overhaul is normally the highest degree of maintenance performed by the ar my overhaul does not normally return an item to like new condition k rebuild consists of those servicesactions necessary for the restoration of unserviceable equip ment to like new condition in accordance with original manufacturing standards rebuild is the highest degree of materiel maintenance applied to army equipment the rebuild operation includes the act of returning to zero those age measurements hours miles etc considered in
