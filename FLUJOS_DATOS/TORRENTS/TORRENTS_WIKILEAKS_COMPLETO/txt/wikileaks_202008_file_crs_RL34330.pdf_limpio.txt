officials signed the proposed ussouth korean free trade agreement korus fta for their respective countries if approved the korus fta would be the largest fta that south korea has signed to date and would be the second largest next to north american free trade agreement nafta in which the united states participates south korea is the seventhlargest trading partner of the united states and the united states is south koreas third largest trading partner various studies conclude that the agreement would increase bilateral trade and investment flows the final text of the proposed korus fta covers wide range of trade and investment issues and therefore could have wide economic implications for both the united states and south korea the korus fta includes issues on which the two countries achieved early agreement such as the elimination on tariffs on trade in most manufactured goods and the partial liberalization in services trade the agreement also includes provisions on number of very sensitive issues such as autos agriculture and trade remedies on which agreement was reached only during the final hours of negotiations if the agreement is to enter into force congress will have to approve implementation legislation the negotiations were conducted under the trade promotion authority tpa also called fasttrack trade authority that the congress granted the president under the bipartisan trade promotion act of 2002 pl 107210 the authority allows the president to enter into trade agreements that receive expedited congressional consideration amendments and limited debate the white house has not indicated when it will send the draft implementing legislation to congress the tpa sets deadline for the president to do this while broad swath of the us business comm unity supports the agreement the korus fta faces opposition from some groups including some auto and steel manufacturers and labor unions agricultural groups and some members of congress now are monitoring the flow of us beef to south korea following the seoul governments decision to accept such importsa move that south korea hopes will make it easier fo r the white house to submit the agreement to congress some us supporters view passage of the korus fta as important to secure new opportunities in the south korean market while opponents claim that the korus fta does not go far enough other observers have suggested the outcome of the korus fta could have implications for the ussouth korean alliance as whole as well as on us trade policy and asia policy differences between the white house and the democratic leadership in the congress over the implications of the korus fta have made the timing and even the likelihood of the presidents submission and congresss subsequent consideration of implementing legislation uncertain this report will be updated as events warrant

and south korean foreign trade minister kim hyungchong signed the propo sed ussouth korean free trade agreement korus fta for their respective countries1 if approved the korus fta would be the largest fta south korea has signed to date and would be the second largest next to the north american free trade agreement in which the united states currently participates south korea is the united statess seventhlargest trading partner and the korus fta if enacted is expected to expand bilateral trade and investment flows according to some studies the final text of the proposed free trade agreement fta covers wide range of trade and investment issues and therefore could have wide economic implications for both the united states and south korea the subjects include ones on which the two countries achieved early agreement such as the elimination on tariffs on trade in most manufactured goods and the liberalization in services trade but the text also includes number of very sensitive issues on which agreement was reached only during the final hours of negotiationsautos agriculture and trade remedies among others congress will have to approve implementation legislation for the korus fta before it can enter into force the negotiations were conducted under the trade promotion authority tpa also called fasttrack trade authority that the congress granted the president under the bipartisan trade promotion act of 2002 the act pl 107210 the authority allows the president to enter into trade agreements that receive expedited congressional consideration amendments and limited debate the white house has not indicated when it will send the draft implementing legislation to congress the tpa sets deadline for the president to do this south koreas president lee myungbak has said he hopes to have the south korean national assembly and pass the agreement soon however an uproar in south korea over the april 2008 beef agreement appears to have made many politicians in seoul wary of trying to pass the agreement before the us congress votes the united states and south korea entered into the korus fta as means to further solidify an already strong economic relationship by reducing barriers to trade and investment between them and to resolve long festering economic issues the united states specifically sought increased access to south korean markets for agricultural products services and foreign investment of importance to south korea was change in us trade remedy procedures which it considers to be discriminatory and us recognition of products made in an industrial park in north korea as eligible for preferential treatment under the korus fta supporters of the fta argue that failure to approve the korus fta would allow those opportunities to slip away however some opponents of the korus fta have argued that the agreement failed to go far enough in addressing south korean trade barriers and would be lost opportunity if approved in its current form congressionally mandated study by the united states international trade commission usitc concluded that investment and trade between the united states and south korea would increase modestly as result of the korus fta 2 this 1 for more specific information you may contact the following crs analysts william cooper x77749 general questions on the korus fta stephen cooney x74887 autos and other

shorttomedium term the korus ftas largest commercial effects are expected to be microeconomic in nature the us services and agriculture industries for instance are expected to reap significant benefits if the agreement is implemented many observers have argued that in addition to its economic implications the korus fta would have diplomatic and security implications for example they have suggested that it would help to deepen the ussouth korean alliance the united states and south korea have been allies since the united states intervened on the korean peninsula in 1950 and fought to repel north korean takeover of south korea over 33000 us troops were killed and over 100000 were wounded during the threeyear conflict 3 south korea subsequently has assisted us deployments in other conflicts most recently by deploying over 3000 troops to play non combat role in iraq however some counter this by positing that the korus fta need not be seen as necessary let alone sufficient condition for enhancing the usrok alliance mutual interests on critical issues pertaining to north korea and the rest of the region will continue to require close cooperation between the two countries in the national security sphere indeed in many respects the korus fta s fate may have more profound implications for us trade policy and east asia policy than for ussouth korean relations for instance some have also suggested that korus fta would help to solidify the us presence in east asia to counterbalance the increasing influence of china while failure to pass it could harm the alliance this report is designed to assist members of the 110 th congress as they consider the costs and benefits of the korus fta it examines the provisions of the korus fta in the context of the overall ussouth korean economic relationship u s objectives and south korean objectives the report will be updated as events warrant

country was able to accomplish some of its objectives but neither side got everything it wanted for example south korea made concessions in agriculture and services while the united states made concessions on rice and textiles yet us car manufacturers felt that south korea did not go far enough in addressing barriers to auto imports and south korea would have liked to have more us concessions on trade remedies some highlights of the results of the agreement are provided below background information on more detailed examination of the agreements provisions is provided in the main sections of this report g3g144g155g146g140g158g149g157g158g155g142g561 under the korus ftas agricultural provisions south korea immediately would grant dutyfree status to almost twothirds of

quotas that slowly expand in perpetuity much effort went into negotiating provisions covering three agricultural commodities of export interest to the united states under the korus fta south korea agreed to eliminate its 40 tariff on beef muscle meats imported from the ited states over 15 year period also south korea would have the right to impose safeguard tariffs on temporary basis in response to any potential surge in imports of us beef meats above specified levels however negotiators did not reach breakthrough by the end of the talks on the separate but parallel issue of how to resolve differences on the terms of access for all us beef in way that would address koreas human health concerns arising from the 2003 discovery of mad cow disease in the us cattle herd sales of us boneless beef from cattle aged less than 30 months though did resume in april 2007 under the terms of separate agreement reached in early 2006 however korean inspectors discovery of prohibited cattle parts in some boxes of shipped beef that did not meet those terms in october 2007 temporarily placed on hold retail sales of us boneless beef the new south korean president seeking to remove this impediment to congressional consideration of the korus fta instructed his negotiators to resolve this longstanding bilateral dispute on april 18 2008 both countries reached an agreement that will allow sales in the korean market of boneless and inbone us beef from all cattle irrespective of age as long as risk materials known to transmit mad cow disease are removed however korean public concerns about the safety of us beef and strong opposition to this agreement prompted the korean government to seek changes in late june both countries confirmed voluntary private sector arrangement that will allow korean firms to import us beef produced only from cattle less than 30 months old and announced some changes to the april agreement both countries view the voluntary arrangement as transitional step intended to improve korean consumer confidence in us beef the korus fta does not give us rice and rice products any preferential access to south koreas market the agreement only requires south korea to continue to abide by its multilateral trade commitments to increase rice imports access for us citrus products was not settled until just before the talks concluded with south korea protecting its orange sector by 50 tariff negotiators compromised on multipart solution small duty free quota was created for in season us navel oranges that would grow slowly in perpetuity sales during this september to february period in excess of this quota would continue to face the high 50 tariff for outofseason oranges that pose less competition to south koreas orange producing sector the tariff would be phased out by year 7 g3g158g157g152g150g152g139g146g149g142g156g561 trade in autos and autoparts proved to be among the most difficult issues tackled by us and south korean

the request of the president5 the usitc study concludes that us gdp would increase by 101 billion to 119 billion approximately 01 when the korus fta is fully implemented negligible amount given the size of the us economy the usitc based this estimate primarily on the removal of tariffs and tariffratequotas that is barriers that can be relatively easily quantified the study concludes that us exports of goods would likely increase by 97 billion to 109 billion primarily in agricultural products machinery electronics transportation equipment including passenger vehicles and parts us imports would increase 64 billion to 69 billion primarily in textiles apparel leather products footwear machinery electronics and passenger vehicles and parts 6 the range does not take into account the impact of the reduction of barriers to trade in services and to foreign investment flows and the impact of changes in regulations as result of the korus fta the study notes that us exports in services would increase as result of south korean commitments under the korus fta and that changes in the regulatory environment in both countries would also help to increase bilateral trade and investment flows the study estimates that changes in aggregate us employment would be negligible given the much larger size of the us economy compared to the south korean economy however while some sectors such as livestock producers would experience increases in employment others such as textile wearing apparel and electronic equipment manufacturers would be expected to experience declines in employment 7 other studies draw the same basic conclusions although the magnitudes differ because they employ different models from the usitc study fo r example university of michigan analysis commissioned by the korea economic institute timates that us gdp would increase by 2512 billion 014 of us gdp this is larger than the usitc estimate but in part this is because its authors quantified the effects of liberalization in services trade8 the authors also analyzed the impact of korus fta before the final text had been released and assumed among other things that rice trade would be liberalized which in the end was not the case in december 2005 the korea institute for international economic policy kiep published study measuring the potential economic impact of ussouth korean fta on south korea alone

economic analysis bank of korea increased economic interaction between the united states and south korea has been accompanied by numerous disagreements over trade po licies in general us exporters and trade negotiators identify the lack of transparency of south koreas trading and regulatory systems as the most significant barriers to trade with south korea in almost every major product sector many us government officials also complain that seoul continues to use government regulations and standardsetting powers to discriminate against foreign firms in politically sensitive industries such as automobiles and telecommunications another major crosssectoral complaint is that rigidities in the south korean labor market such as mandatory severance pay raise the cost of investing and doing business finally the united states and other countries have pressed south korea to open further its agricultural market which is considered one of the most closed among members of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd 10 many of these issues arose during the korus fta negotiations the intensity of these disputes has diminished considerably since the late 1980s and early 1990s in part because south korea enacted set of sweeping marketoriented reforms as quid pro quo for receiving usled 58 billion package from the international monetary fund imf following the near collapse of the south korean economy in 1997 in particular as result of the reforms south korea opened its doors to foreign investors ushering in billions of dollars of foreign portfolio and foreign direct investment fdi the result is that foreign companies including us firms now are significant shareholders in many prominent industrial conglomerates chaebol at one point earlier in the decade foreign firms owned about onethird of the south korean banking industry and an estimated 40 of the value of the shares traded on south koreas stock exchange since the 1997 crisis fdi commitments by us companies have totaled over 25 billion 11 additionally the united states and south korea appear to have become more adept at managing their trade disputes this may be partly due to the quarterly workinglevel trade action agenda trade meetings that were initiated in early 2001 both sides credit the meetings which appear to be unique to the ussouth korean trade relationship with creating more

policymakers shared certain goals in launching and completing the negotiations on the korus fta both governments saw in the fta logical extension of an already important economic relationship that would provide means by which the two trading partners could address and resolve fundamental issues and thereby raise the relationship to higher level for the united states these issues have included the high tariffs and other restrictions on agricultural imports for south korea these difficult issues have included perceived us discrimination toward south korean imports in the application of trade remedies and treatment of products made at the kaesong industrial complex in north korea while sharing some broad objectives us and south korean leaders also approached the korus fta from different perspectives that were reflected in the conduct and outcome of the negotiations primary objective of the united states was to gain access to south korean markets in agricultural products pharmaceutica ls and medical equipment some other high technology manufactured goods and services particularly financial and professional services areas in which us producers are internationally competitive but for which south korean barriers seemed to be high for south korea gaining large increase in market access was not as critical priority since south korean exporters already have significant presence in areas in which they have proved to be competitiveconsumer electronics and autos for example and in which they already face only low or zero us tariffs however south korea arguably did seek to preserve its share of the us market in the face of growing competition from emerging east asian producers from thailand malaysia vietnam and possibly china south korea likely also aimed to improve its competitive position in the us market visavis japan where the elimination of even low tariffs might give south korean exporters some price advantage launching the fta negotiations was largely at the initiative of south korea its main objective in securing an fta with the united states was much broader than gaining reciprocal access to the us market entering an fta with the united states meshed with number of former south korean president roh moohyuns long term economic and strategic goals roh made an fta the top economic priority for the remainder of his tenure which expires in february 2008 12 soon after his election in 2002 roh committed himself to raising south koreas per capita gross domestic product gdp to 20000 by the end of th decade and to transforming south korea into major economic hub in northeast asia by expanding the economic reforms begun by his predecessor following the 1997 asian financial crisis ongoing competitive pressure from japanese firms increased competition from chinese enterprises and the rapid ageing of the south korean workforce has heightened the sense of urgency about boosting national competitiveness continuing along this line of argument exprime minister han duksoo has said that failure to adopt significant economic changes will mean that koreas long term growth potential is likely to deteriorate 13 lee myungbak who was

korus fta as part of larger program to promote south korean economic growth during the negotiations south korean officials and other south korean proponents of the korus fta tended not to focus on the increased access to the us market rather they emphasized the medium and longterm gains that would stem from increased allocative efficiency of the south korean economy particularly in the services industries this would presumably be brought about by an influx of us investment and technology into south korea and by the spur of increased competition with us firms 14 the president and other senior officials in particular emphasized the need to boost the competitiveness of south korean service industries an fta with the united states they argued will help address south koreas increased economic polarization by spurring job creation in fields such as medical legal education and accounting services in free trade agreement 15 some however say an fta will worsen south koreas income gap16 also during the talks there were continuous and often large scale antifta protests generally led by south korean farmers and trade unionists the absence of mirrorimage or reciprocal us and south korean objectives in the negotiations is reflected in the structure of the korus fta except for some provisions dealing with issues specific to ussouth korea economic relations for example south korea taxation of autos and the kaesong industrial complex the structure of the korus fta largely resembles the structure of other ftas such as dominican republiccent ral american fta drcafta that the united states has entered into this conclusion does not suggest that south korea did not bring to the table its own specific demands which it did such as the exclusion of rice and held to them firmly

importer in the world its farm sector is highly protected with high tariffs and quotas17 this reflects its farmers longstanding political influence particularly that of rice producers and its urban populations deep ties to its rural roots in concluding the korus fta the united states secured nearly complete access for all us agricultural commodities and food products into koreas market however breakthrough on the beef issue technically not part of the fta talks but nevertheless the subject of highlevel discussions did not occur until june 2008 this appears to reflect the newly elected korean presidents view that an agreement spelling out the rules that apply to beef imports from the united states had to be in place before president bush could consider sending this agreement to capitol hill several members of congress had for months stated that south korea must agree to fully reopen its market to us beef under scientifically based international rules and in commercially significant quantities before congress considers or approves the agreement us agricultural groups well aware of this deals potential benefits for producers had also conditioned their support on the resumption of us beef exports in 2007 south korea was the 5 th largest market for us agriculture as export sales totaled 35 billion under the korus fta s agricultural prov isions south korea

products additional access to south koreas market see below 19 with the immediate elimination or phase out of most of south koreas relatively high agricultural trade barriers under the korus fta the us agricultural and food processing sectors would noticeably benefit from additional exports the usitc estimates that the increase in us exports of agricultural commodities and processed foods would

from 19 billion to 38 billion 44 to 89 higher in 2008 than export s under noagreement scenario almost half of this export increase would accrue to the us beef sector based on the usitcs assumption

an agreement on new korean rules that will apply to us beef imports see appendix about 20 of the export increase would benefit us producers and exporters of pork poultry and other meat products20 in another analysis the american farm bureau federation afb f projects that us agricultural exports by the end of the transition period 2027 would be more than 15 billion 45 higher under the korus fta than would be the case otherwise sales of beef poultry and pork would account for 644 million or 42 of this increase 21 because south korean agricultural exports to the united states are small 233 million in 2007 and largely complementary there was controversy in negotiating access to the us market the united states agreed to phase out tariffs and quotas on all agricultural imports from south korea under seven phaseout periods ranging up to 15 years one 10year trq would apply to imports of fluid milk and cream among other specified dairy products the usitc projects that imports of agricultural products primarily processed food products from south korea under the korus fta would be from 52 million to 78 million 12 to 18 higher than such imports under noagreement scenario g4g142g142g143g561 under the korus fta south korea agreed to eliminate its 40 tariff on beef muscle meats imported from the united states over 15 year period also south korea would have the right to impose safeguard tariffs on temporary basis in response to any potential surge in imports of us beef meats above specified levels the trigger for this additional tariff would be 270000 metric tons mt in year 1 which would increase 2 annually in year 15 the trigger would be 354000 mt22 in year 16 this protective mechanism would longer apply the 18 tariff on imports of beef offals tongues livers tails and feet and tariffs ranging from 225 to 72 on other beef products would be similarly eliminated in 15 years assuming that south korea fully lifts its restrictio ns on us beef and bilateral beef trade returns to normal the usitc estimates that the phase out of south koreas beef tariff and safeguard could increase us beef exports from about 600 million to almost 18 billion 58 to 165 above what would be the case otherwise under the korus fta the afbf projects that us beef sales would be 265 million higher as the united states recaptures its historic share of the south korean market however its analysis notes th at the market share of us beef likely will not increase over time that is because south korean tastes have developed preference for grassfed australian beef which will continue to be competitive in price against us beef even with the current 40 tariff removed on april 18 2008 us and south korean negotiators reached agreement on the requirements that will apply to korean

will now be allowed entry but are subject to various conditions that us beef exporters and the us government must meet against the backdrop of mounting public protests in korea against this agreement calls by opposition parties that it be renegotiated and the korean presidents apologies for how his government mishandled this matter the korean government secured changes intended to allay public concerns about the safety of us beef under transitional arrangement agreed to on june 21 korea will import beef only from cattle less than 30 months old korean inspections of us beef began on june 27 2008 since then new sales have begun to take off but the pace of future us beef exports now will depend on how quickly korean consumers resume purchases in light of the controversy that swirled around this issue see appendix for additional details g20g146g140g142g561 south korean negotiators succeeded in excluding th entry of us rice on preferential termsits prime objective in negotiating agriculture in the korus fta this reflects koreas efforts to maintain its stated policy of self sufficiency in rice production the national sentiment that preserving rice production is inseparable from the countrys identity and the political reality that rice farming preserves the basis for economic activity in the countryside that rice was make orbreak issue for seoul is seen in the comment made by top us trade official deputy united states trade representative karan bhatia the day after the talks concluded ultimately the question that confronted us was whether to accept very very good albeit less perfect agreement or to lose the entire agreement because south korea refused to move on rice 23 on rice the korus fta only requires south korea to continue to abide by its multilateral trade commitments to increase rice imports at present us rice exporters have access to the south korean market under 1 24 share 50076 mt of the rice import quota established under that countrys multilateral world trade organization wto commitments in 1995 and 2 separate quota available to all countries24 rice entering under both quotas faces 5 tariff entries above each quota are prohibiteda unique concession that south korea received in the last round of multilateral trade negotiations us rice exports against both quotas have fluctuated but since 2005 have risen to reach 43 million 73283 mt in 2007 future us sales are expected to grow slowly in line with the expansion of the most recently established rice quota though the us rice industry expressed disappointment with the rice exclusion the united states will have other opportunities in the future to nego tiate access for additional us rice in koreas market this could occur in the process of concluding multilateral agreement possibly by 2010 to further liberalize agricultural trade in the wtos doha development round which might require south korea to further open its rice market also the united states and other rice exporting countries could press for additional access when koreas current multilateral rice access provisions expire in 2014 23 inside us trade ustr says beef market access must precede signing of korea fta april 6 2007 p 5 24 following the 2004 renegotiation of south koreas wto agricultural commitments the united states and most other rice exporting countries beginning in 2005 have been able to take advantage of this other rice quota expanding by 20347 mt each year through 2014 market access is on firstcome first served basis by 2014 both rice import quotas under country allocations

liberalize trade in fresh oranges were not resolved until just before the negotiations concluded the united states sought the complete elimination of koreas border protection on all citrus products while south korea wanted to retain its quotas and tariffs primarily because of the importance of the citrus industry to the economy of cheju island at present south korea imposes 50 tariff on all imports of oranges irrespective of whether they enter within or outside an existing trq in reaching compromise negotiators agreed to multipart solution first small dutyfree quota would be created for inseason us navel oranges variety that is not produced in korea that enter between september 1 and the end of februarya period that coincides with the islands unshu mandarin orange harvest season the initial 2500 mt trq would increase at compound 3 annual rate in perpetuity shipments in excess of this amount during this sixmonth period would continue to be subject to the 50 tariff second in the first year this high tariff would be reduced to 30 for outofseason oranges that enter between march 1 and august 31 and then be completely phased out in stages by year 7 third south koreas 144 tariff on mandarin oranges would be phased out over 15 years the cost of selling to what already is leadin g us export market for fresh oranges would be significantly reduced as koreas high 50 tariff is phased out in 2007 south korea ranked second after canada with us sales totaling 85 million 88335 mt usda estimates that the value of the inseason 2500 mt quota and tariff reductions on all orange exports in the first year would be almost 18 million over seven years usda estimates the cumulative value of savings associated with these orange access provisions at 208 million 25

future bilateral sps disputes that arise coordinate technical assistance programs and consult on issues and positions in the wto and other international bodies where sps issues are considered the text of the sps chapter specifically states that neither the united states nor south korea has recourse to pursue dispute settlement to address any sps issue that arises instead any matter would be resolved using the formal process established under the wtos sps agreement us beef producers had argued until the april 2008 agreement was reached that koreas stance on us beef imports must be

relatively low us tariff of 25 on all imported motor vehicles except pickup trucks has made the united states good market of opportunity for south korean export s for discussion of the south korean auto industry see appendix b total korean motor vehicle exports to the united states peaked at 860000 units in 2004 according to us commerce department data it subsequently fell to 730000 units in 2005 695000 units in 2006 and 675000 units in 200727 hyundai has established major us assembly plant thus substituting for some imports kia also plans to open us assembly plant by 200928 falling imports from korea probably were affected by general softening of the us market us exporters including south korean and other foreign owned manufacturers shipped total of 12571 vehicles to south korea in 2007 the total value of south korean automotive exports to the united states including parts was 121 billion in 2007 compared to us exports of similar products to south korea of 976 million that meant us bilateral deficit in autos of 112 billion growing over the long term from deficit of 55 billion in 2000 and 15 billion in 1990 29 sangyirl nam in an academic analysis of the effects of the proposed fta found in simulation models of projected market changes korea would always gain relative to the united states from bilateral liberalization because korea has comparative advantage over the united states in the automobile sector in other words korea has been much more successful in accessing the us market than the united states has been in accessing the korean market 30 but tom walsh writing in the detroit free press presents data to show that while the net us bilateral automotive deficit will probably not decline substantially the trends are favorable to the united states since 2004 data attached to his article show that while the total value of us imports from korea rose by less than 1 from 2004 to 2007 the total value of us exports in the other direction nearly doubled up

includes broad and unprecedented range of focused provisions designed to open up koreas auto market to us cars and ensure that us automakers have fair opportunity to compete in korea34 these provisions may be summarized as follows elimination of most south korean tariffs on usmade motor vehicles korea would immediately eliminate its 8 tariff on usbuilt passenger cars and its 10 tariff on pickup trucks35 tariffs would be immediately reduced to zero in each country for autoparts imported from the other36 reduction of alleged discriminatory effects of engine displacement taxes major us complaint has been that south korea has steeply ascending vehicle tax schedule with very high rates on vehicles with larger engine capacities such as might be exported by us producers moreover the tax system has cascade effect so that subsequent taxation rates incorporate for example the 8 duty paid on an imported vehicle according to the us international trade commission usitc report on the agreement 76 of the south korean market is in vehicles with engine displacement less than 2000 cc with 54 in the range 16012000 cc 37 currently the consumer pays special consumption tax on purchase of vehicle cars below 800 cc are exempt cars in the next range up to 2000 cc pay 5 anything larger is charged 10 after an interim reduction period of three years south korea under the fta would simplify this to two tier system under 1000 cc taxfree anything larger would be taxed at 5 besides this purchase tax owners must pay an annual vehicle tax also based on engine displacement currently there are five different ranges in this system and the owner of vehicle with an engine larger than the 16002000 cc market sweet spot pays an extra 10 per cc ownership tax south korea has agreed to simplify the ranges to three 80 woncc below 1000 cc engine capacity 140 woncc up to 1600 cc and 200 woncc for anything larger 38 both of these changes would include the majority of domestically produced cars as well as imports in the highest tax bracket 32 crs report rl32883 us automotive industry recent history and issues p 60 33 the usitc calculated 2006 import market share of 42 of which 60 was from

group us manufacturers have complained that south korea sets safety regulations and automotive product standards in manner that is closed to outsiders and not transparent and that consequently results in standards idiosyncratic to korea south koreanbased producers who hold the lions share of the domestic market can afford to operate one line for domestic production and another for export foreign companies have difficulty affording the high unit cost of customizing small number of vehicles for the south korean market 39 this problem is addressed in the korus fta chapter 9technical barriers to trade and in an exchange of confirmation letters of june 30 2007 between ustr susan schwab and south korean trade minister hyun chung kim essentially the agreement provides for selfcertification on safety and emissions standards for limited number of usexported vehicles and commitment that south korea will evaluate emissions using the methodology applied by the state of california 40 south korea also agreed not to adopt technical regulations that create unnecessary barriers to trade and to cooperate to harmonize standards41 under terms of annex 9b the two parties agree to create an automotive working group which will meet at least annually and will review and resolve issues with respect to developing implementing and enforcing relevant standards technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures42 elimination of us tariffs and snapback clause the major commitment on the us side with respect to automotive trade issues is the elimination of all tariffs on south koreanproduced motor vehicles the united states would immediately eliminate its 25 duty on gasolinefueled passenger vehicles with engine displacement up to 3000 cc it would also phase out the same rate of duty on south korean imports with larger engine capacity or that are dieselpowered over three years the 25 duty on pickup trucks residual rate dating from an earlier trade dispute with europe would be phased out on south korean products over ten years 43 however the fta in annex 22a also establishes special bilateral dispute settlement panel designed to resolve automotive issues within six months if panel finds violation of an autorelated commitment or the nullificationimpairment of expected benefits the complaining party may suspend its tariff concessions on passenger cars and assess duties at the prevailing mfn rate ie snapback any tariff reductions provided by the fta 44 the usitc notes in its report that the dispute settlement provisions restrict the us snapback penalty on light trucks to the rate for passenger cars 25 while south korea could snap back to 845 39 examples of how specific south korean automotive standards discourage imports were provided by stephen j

fta estimates that while us automotive exports to korea would increase by range of 45 to 59 this would only amount to about 300400 million because of the low current baseline46 it states that tariff elimination would likely have positive effect on us exports further the overall tax burden on the south korean consumer who purchases an imported vehicle would be reduce d more or less equalizing the

today are imported from japan48 however as the detroitbased us manufacturers have plans to increase their hybrid fleets and there are south koreanproduced hybrid vehicles at present the us manufacturers could have head start on these products assuming japaneseowned companies in the united states do not also export hybrids from their incipient us production to the south korean market with respect to automotive imports from south korea into the united states the usitc simulation estimates an increase by 1317 billion 912 however it also finds that approximately 5557 would be represented by diverted imports from other trade partners 49 jeffery schott states that south korea gave priority to eliminating the small us tariff primarily because of japanese competition since 2001 the won has strengthened against the us dollar while the japanese yen has weakened creating disadvantage in the us market for hyundai whose vehicles must compete against japanese companies

opposition of two major motor manufacturers and some other sectoral groups these views were reflected in the april 2007 report of the industry trade advisory committee on automotive and capital goods itac 2 to ustr of april 2007 the chair noted that generally the manufacturers of capital goods see the fta as an important milestone in providing market access to country and region historically protectionist however in terms of us automotive equipment manufacturers the outcome is mixed53 both the us motor vehicle industry representatives and the whole of itac 2 initially recommended an unconventional approach on automotive issues in the negotiations it would have precondioned the phaseout of us automotive tariffs on the demonstration of south korean market openness in terms of improved import penetration that is on par with that of other oecd countries fifteen members of congress including representative charles rangel chair of the house ways and means committee wrote president bush on march 2 2007 with proposal along the lines of the performance metric approach suggested by itac 2 their proposal would have delayed full elimination of the us import tariff cut for at least 15 years while us representatives assessed south koreas performance in opening its market to us exports formula would be used each year to determine the number of south koreanproduced vehicles that would receive dutyfree treatment in return they also proposed snapback safeguard provision on the us tariff should south korean imports in the us market be judged to increase too rapidly the 25 us tariff on pickup trucks would remain in place subject to multilateral agreement on automotive trade at the world trade organization 54 despite the fact that the final agreement did not include performance metric approach most itac 2 members supported korus fta anyway55 the ford motor company disagreed in its statement appended to the report ford accepted that some progress was achieved with respect to existing nontariff barriers ntbs but it noted that many of the exemptions for usmade vehicles with respect to ntbs were very limited in volume or were temporary that south korea could continue to use mix of us and european standards and that taxation rates were still exceptionally high for the types of product foreign companies would most likely export to south korea on the other hand the immediate lifting of the us 25 tariff on most south korean imports would be lopsided benefit that in effect will reward south korean manufacturers for 20 years of unfair trade practices by the south korean government 56 similarly representative of chrysler testified before congress that becaus of the imbalance in uskorea auto trade we simply cannot support the uskorea free

that the proposed fta has addressed the auto industrys concerns but given the current imbalance in trade between the two countries gm foresaw that in the near term south korea would be the greater beneficiary and therefore gm would be neutral on the agreement it noted that tax policy changes promised by the south korean government would reduce the overall burden on the automotive sector and that there were caps on usexported vehicles meeting compliance with california emission standards because south korea committed to establish emission requirements on the same basis gm also commented that the sectorspecific snapback rule on tariff reductions was unique and positive addition to us ftas 58 it should be added that gms position is probably influenced by the fact that it has become ma jor investor in the south korean motor industry through its acquisition of daewoo since the acquisition gm has increased daewoo production from 310000 in 2003 to 13 million in 2007 59 gm in 2007 sold

director alan reuther endorsed the negotiating strategy proposed by members of congress described above62 he stated that the final agreement as contemplated instead would exacerbate the totally onesided auto trade imbalance between south korea and the us and jeopardize the jobs of tens of thousands of american workers63 reuther further criticized the labor rights record of south korea as very problematic he noted numerous areas of worker rights violations in south korea cited in the us department of states 2005 country reports on human rights practices and the arrest of the kmwu president in 2006 in protest against government efforts to change south korean labor laws in manner unfavorable to the union movement there64 in february 2008 speech in washington uaw president ron gettelfinger criticized the proposed fta in these terms thats not free trade and thats not fair trade that is the theft of american jobs65 president gettelfinger reiterated these views in testimony

and virtually none on the us side beyond the elimination of tariffs this could be because the global competitive problems currently affecting the unionized domestically owned sector of the us motor vehicle industry go well beyond the scope of this fta to solve67 indeed given major differences in the profiles of the us and south korean motor vehicle markets it would appear unlikely that the detroit big three which tend to specialize domestically in the production of larger vehicles could ever gain more than fractional position there through exports from the united states thus the uaw ford and chrysler oppose korus fta as potentially only adding to the severe competitive pressure their side of the domestic us industry is facing gm has secured solid investment position in south

of origin for apparel imports that is apparel made from yarn or fabric originating in either the united states or south korea would be eligible for dutyfree treatment under the fta the fta also includes special safeguard provision whereby if imports of textiles or wearing apparel to one korus fta partner country from the other increases at such rate as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry of the importing country the importing country can suspend further reduction of tariffs or it can increase the duty on the imported product to the lesser of the mfn rate applicable at the time the action was taken or the mfn duty that was in force when the fta went into effect the safeguard action can be in place for two years with possible extension of two years but more than total of four years however the importing country will have to compensate the exporting country by making additional trade liberalizing concessions equivalent in value to the additional duties expected to result from the safeguard action the concessions would be limited to textiles and apparel unless the two countries agree otherwise the usitc has estimated that if implemented the korus fta would over time lead to an increase in us imports of south korean textiles of 17 billion to18 billion and of apparel of 10 billion to 12 billion with the major portion of the increase being diverted from other countries the usitc also has estimated that korus fta would lead to an increase in us exports of textiles of 130 million to 140 million and of apparel of 39 million to 45 million to south korea 74 the korus fta would allow some fibers yarns and fabrics originating out side of the united states and south korea to become eligible for preferential treatment if the product is not available domestically in commercial quantities in either country the agreement also provides for the establishment of committee on textile and apparel trade matters to raise concerns under the fta regarding mutual trade in these products the textile and apparel industry appears split on their views of the korus fta according to the industry trade advisory committee on textiles and clothing itac13 75 some representatives of the textile producers support the yarnforward rule as benefitting their industry and also conforming to provisions in other us ftas but so argue that it should be broader by including sewing thread narrow fabrics and pocketing fabrics which are excluded from the rule others including some textile representatives and representatives from the apparel industry with supply chains in other countries have criticized the yarnforward rule as being restrictive and limiting trade opportunities members of the industry are also divided on the lack of cumulation provisions in the fta that is provisions which allow preferential treatment for limited amounts of apparel woven from components outside the fta area textile producers supported the lack of cumulation provisions while apparel producers would have wanted them included they also split on the phaseout periods for tariffs with textile producers arguing that some sensitive products were given immediate dutyfree treatment apparel producers argued that all apparel and textiles should have been given immediate dutyfree treatment footwear and travel goods are also covered under the 74 ibid p 353 75

improperly politicizing the consideration of trade remedy provision filed by us industry in process that is already transparent and open particularly in antidumping cases in article 104 either party must afford to the other an adequate opportunity for and due consideration of price undertakings by respondent companies which if accepted may result in suspension of an investigation without imposition of penalty duties the steel industry is concerned that the provision would encourage the use of suspension agreements and the injection of foreign governments into the trade law process the steel industry opposes the provision to establish bilateral commission on trade remedies article 108 as unprecedented unnecessary and would provide yet more opportunities for south korea to weaken us

korea accounting for 10 of total us exports of pharmaceuticals and 10 of total us exports to south korea in the same year south korea exported 214 million in medical devices and 61 million in pharmaceuticals to the united states of major concern was the south korean governments may 2006 change in how it determined reimbursement amounts prior to the change it maintained negative list system under which products would be eligible for reimbursement unless they appeared on the list with the change the south korean government has switched to positive list requiring product to be listed before it would be eligible making it potentially more difficult for product to become eligible announcement of the policy came without prior noti fication to us officials or affected us manufacturers and occurred at an early point in the negotiations placing cloud over them despite complaints from the united states south korea went ahead with implementing its positive list system pm manufacturers also have cited the south korean governments policies on reimbursements for pharmaceuticals and medical devices under its singlepayer health insurance program us manufacturers have argued that the policies discriminate against innovative pharmaceuticals because they establish relatively low reimbursement amounts for medicines thus not taking into account the costs that producers of leadingedge pharmaceuticals incur and that are reflected in higher prices the manufacturers wanted the ko rus fta to establish transparency as an important principal in south koreas development and implementation of reimbursement policies including an appeal process for decisions going against us manufacturers in response south korea agreed in the korus fta to allow us pharmaceutical makers to apply for increased reimbursement levels based on safety and efficacy south korea also agreed to publish proposed laws regulations and procedures that apply to the pricing reimbursement and regulation of pharmaceuticals and medical devices in nationally available publication and to allow time for comment in addition south korea agreed to establish process for us manufacturers to comment on proposed changes in laws and regulations and for them to obtain review of administrative determinations that adversely affect them intellectual property rights protection in south korea has been critical issue for us pharmaceutical manufacturers specifically the failure of the south korean government to protect from competitors proprietary data that manufacturers must submit for market approval in addition the south korean government has in some cases approved marketing of some pharmaceuticals before it has determined that the applicant is the rightful owner of the patent and trademark 92 in part for

south korea would not allow third company such as generic drug manufacturer from marketing new pharmaceutical using the safety and efficacy data supplied by an original us manufacturer as part of the market approval process without the permission of the or iginal us maker for five years from the date of marketing approval for the original product in addition if third party submits safety or efficacy information for product that an fta partner government had already approved the government is to notify the original patent holder of the identity of the third party and is to prevent the marketing of the third partys product on its territory if permission had not been granted by the original patent holder in side letter the united states and south korea agreed to not invoke the data exclusivity provision until the fta has been in effect 18 months furthermore south korea agreed of patentlinkage system that is neither government is to approve the marketing to generic drug while the original patent is still in effect another provision known as patentterm extension would require each fta government to adjust the length of the effective period for patents on pharmaceuticals to take into account delays incurred in receiving patent approval and marketing pproval the korus fta states that provision would prevent either government from taking measures to protect the public health of its residents from hivaid tuberculosis malaria and other epidemics by ensuring access to medicines the fta would reaffirm each countrys commitment to the wto tripsheath declaration reactions within the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries were somewhat split on the korus fta makers of innovative products supported the provisions that are designed to preserve the rights of patent holders and provisions that are designed to make the south korean regulatory pricing and reimbursement process more transparent and open to comments and procedural reviews at the same time industry representatives remain critical of south koreas new reimbursement procedures and argue that the new system does not take into account the benefits of innovative drugs that cause drug prices to be higher generic drug manufacturers argue that the korus fta does not contain provisions guaranteeing the availability of affordable drugs 94

financial services and chapter 15 telecommunications chapter 11 foreign investment among others major us objective in the korus fta negotiations was to obtain south korean commitments to reduce barriers to trade and investment in its services sector especially in professional financial and telecommunications services in general the two countries would commit to provide national treatment and mostfavorednation treatment to the services imports from each other promote transparency in the development and implementation of regulations in services providing timely notice of decisions on government permission to sell services prohibit limits on market access such as caps on the number of service providers on the total value of services provided on the total quantity of services provided and on the total number of persons that can be employed by services providers prohibit foreign direct investment requirements such as export and local content requirements and employment mandates and prohibit restrictions on the type of business entity through which service provider could provide service us and south korean negotiators agreed to several concepts under the korus fta that could apply the agreements provisions to broad scope of services the two countries agreed to the negative list approach in making commitments in services that is the korus fta is to apply to all types of services unless identified as an exception in the relevant annexes in addition the commitments are rachetedwhen new services emerge in the us or south korean economies those services are automatically covered by the fta unless identified as an exception if either country unilaterally liberalizes measure that it had listed as an exemption it is automatically covered under the fta furthermore if one korus fta partner extends preferential treatment to service providers from third country under another fta it is to extend the preferential treatment to its korus fta partner the united states sought greater reciprocity in the treatment of professional services and thereby gain increased access to the south korean market fo r us providers the united states and south korea agreed to form professional services working group to develop methods to recognize mutual standards and criteria for the licensing of professional service providers under the korus fta south korea

market the agreement would allow an fta partner government to impose restrictions on the sale of financial services by providers from the other partner country for prudential reasons for example to

quantities as to be substantial cause of serious injury to domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive good 115 in the case of safeguard the party imposing it must provide mutually agreedupon amount of compensation if the parties do not agree the other party may suspend concessions on imports of the other party in an amount that has trade effects substantially equivalent to the safeguard measure116 as such the agreement does not seem to require any changes to us ad cvd or global safeguard laws or substantially change administrative procedures required to implement these actions117 however in an apparent departure from previous ftas the korus fta seems to require few additional administrative steps prior to initiation of trade remedy investigation involving goods from the other party first each party would have to notify the other if an antidumping petition is received regarding the other partys imports as well as provide an opportunity for meeting between the partie s before an investigation is initiated 118 additionally the party initiating an ad or cvd investigation would be required to provide written information regarding its procedures for negotiating price or quantity undertaking known in us law as suspension agreement119 and after preliminary affirmative determination is reached provide due consideration and adequate opportunity for consultations regarding proposed price undertakings which could result in suspension of the investigation without imposition of duties provided mutually agreeable undertaking is reached120 the korus fta would also establish committee on trade remedies which would meet at least once year made up of representatives from each party who have responsibility for trade 114 south korea retracts key demand on

knowledge of the parties trade remedy laws and practices overseeing the implementation of the trade remedies chapter of the agreement improving cooperation between the parties developing educational programs on trade remedy laws and providing forum for exchange of information on trade remedies and other topics of mutual interest121 as discussed earlier the industry trade advisory committee on steel itac 12 believes that the procedural concessions made on trade remedies could politicize trade remedy actions thus possibly weakening us trade laws in particular the itac 12 stated that the us adcvd investigative process is already transparent and that the preinitiation notification and consultation requirements would delay and politicize the process122 it also objected to the undertakings provisions saying that these provisions would encourage the use of suspension agreements and introduce actions of foreign governments into trade remedy procedures123 for more information on the steel industrys reaction see discussion in section on other manufactured goods the itac 12 also opposes the establishment of committee on trade remedies saying that it such forum would give south korea an opportunity to attempt to further try to weaken us trade remedy laws124 speaking in april 2007 assistant us trade representative for korea japan and apec wendy cutler the chief us negotiator implied that the consultative committee would focus on information sharing and w ill not provide forum to discuss specific cases125 she also mentioned that the committee could be benefit to the united states by providing platform for discussing certain industrial subsidies that the south korean government may be supplying to manufacturing firms and that negotiators worked out an accommodation that was beneficial to both sides needs on very contentious part of the negotiations126 g13g138g142g156g152g151g144g561g11g151g141g158g156g157g155g146g138g149g561g5g152g150g153g149g142g161g343g344g349g561 consistent and significant goal for south korea in the fta talks was securing preferential treatment for products made in the kaesong industrial complex kic in north korea position the united states adamantly throughout most of the negotiations located near the north korean city of kaesong also spelled gaesong 40 miles north of seoul the kic is designed for south korean companies to employ north korean workers the factories of 15 south korean manufacturing firms began operating when the site opened in 2004 as of november 2007 this number had increased to 52 firms which employed about 20000 north korean workers there are plans to expand the zone dramatically the south korean unification ministry expects that by the end of 2010 about 450 south korean manufacturers and 100000 north korean workers will be in the kic 128 the kic arguably has become the centerpiece for south koreas sunshine policy of engaging north korea 121 chapter 10 section c committee on trade remedies article 108

on the kic one year after the korus fta enters into force binational committee will be formed to study the possibility of eventually including products from outward processing zones opzs using north korean labor sometime in the future129 the agreement identifies three general categories for which the committee is to develop more detailed criteria progress in the denuclearization of north korea developments in intrakorean relations and wages the environment and labor standards for the third category of issues the committee is to consider relevant international norms as well as the situation prevailing elsewhere on the peninsula after the committee has developed criteria the opz provisions in the fta lay out three step process by which products made in the kic could be incorporated into the fta first the committee must deem that an outward processing zone meets the criteria it has established second the two governments must agree that the fta should be amended accordingly third each government must seek legislative approval for any amendments to the agreement with respect to outward processing zones the agreement does not lay out the size or composition of the committee or how committee members will be chosen or the procedures by which the committee is to arrive at decisions 130 in the korus fta negotiations the united states backed away from the principle of its initial position of not ever expanding the korus fta to north koreamade products significant achievement for south korea at the same time the united states appeared to give up little in substance in the neartomiddle term the united states apparently would be able to control the decision to and pace of any move to grant preferential treatment to north koreamade products any perceptions of footdragging by the united states however may come at diplomatic price if future south korean governments push for more rapid integration of north korean industrial zones into the fta two important issues for the united states in considering south koreas demand were the conditions for north korean workers and the income the kic provides for the north korean government some us labor and human rights advocates have argued that north korean workers in kaesong are being exploited south korean officials as well as other analysts counter by saying that conditions at kaesong are far better than those in the rest of north korea additionally the north korean government derives hard currency from several sources in the kic project including leasing fees and surcharges levied on north korean workers wages which are paid to an arm of the north korean government agency before being passed on to employees in the form of north korean won to date these revenue streams are likely to be relatively small though not insignificant given the small size of the north korean economy and its shortage of hard currency if the most ambitious goals for the kaesong project are realized by the middle of the next decade the north korean government would likely derive tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars annually from tax revenues and its slice of north korean workers wages assuming the kics current tax and wage structures remain in place 131 some south koreans caution that the uncertainties over the future course of the kic project make such projections highly speculative 129 chapter 22 annex b committee on

relationship over the past 10 years the stock of ussouth korean foreign direct investment fdi valued on an historical cost basis has increased substantially due in small part to the marketoriented reforms south korea undertook after its 1997 financial crisis in 1997 the value of stock of us fdi in south korea was 65 billion and had increased to 223 billion by the end of 2006 in 2006 43 of us fdi in south korea was in manufacturing especially in computers and electronic products chemicals and other manufacturing facilities the remainder of the fdi was in services with us fdi in banking and other financial services accounting for much of this investment south korean fdi in the united states has also increased substantially in the last 10 years albeit from much lower base in 1997 the stock of south korean fdi in the united states was valued at 06 billion and had increased to 86 billion by the end of 2006 72 billion or 84 of this investment was in wholesale trade perhaps reflecting the sharp retail facilities to sell south koreanmade vehicles in the united states 132 foreign investment has been sensitive issue in ussouth korean relations for many years as us investors have tried to make inroads into the south korean economy us investors criticisms have included restrictions on foreign investment in key sectors such as communications and lack of adequate protection for

investment treaty bit that would commit each party to provide national treatment to the investments from the other party and abstain from performance requirements for foreign investments from the other party but the negotiations collapsed largely over us opposition to south koreas socalled screen quota on domestic films and the latters resistence to lifting or reducing it the south korean government reduced the screen quotas by half just before the korus fta negotiations were launched in february 2006 the korus fta chapter on investment essentially contains the commitments that would otherwise have been in bit the fta sets down general principals for the treatment by south korea and the united states of investors and investments from one partner in the territory of the other 133 the principle of national treatmentthat one party to the agreement will treat covered investments and investors from the other party noless favorably than it treats domestic investors and investmentsis paramount the fta allows each party to make exceptions to the national treatment principle but those exceptions must be specified in the relevant annexes to the agreement134 second

restrictions in the south korean labor market such as mandatory severance pay significantly raise the cost of investing and doing business in korea in contrast us union representatives argue that

barriers to trade are standards and regulations that are intended ostensibly to protect the health and safety of consumers and for other legitimate nontrade purposes but may through design and

the united states would promote transparency by allowing persons from the other party to participate in the development of standards technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures regarding customs administration and trade facilitation the korus fta would promote joint cooperation to ensure compliance with each others customs laws and regulations for example it would require the two countries to adopt procedures and regulations to facilitate express delivery shipments rules of origin define what are goods that originate in the fta region and therefore are eligible for preferential treatment textiles and apparel have separate rules of origin the korus fta would require that goods must be wholly obtained or produced in the territory of both countries or country the

lines president lee myung bak who was elected in december 2007 has made passage of the korus fta priority for his government most opinion polls show majority of south koreans in favor of the agreement though opposition has been intense from rural interests among others furthermore most polls of south korean legislators show broad support for the agreement within the national assembly which is controlled by president lees grand national party the korus fta was not significant issue in either the 2007 presidential election campaign despite the fact that one of the major candidates opposed the agreement or the april 2008 parliamentary elections for south korea entering an fta with the united states meshes with number of lees economic and strategic goals ongoing competitive pressure from japanese firms increased competition from chinese enterprises and the rapid aging of the south korean workforce has heightened the sense of urgency to boost national longterm competitiveness

counterweight to the bilateral friction that was occurring over issues such as how to manage relations with north korea and the re positioning of us troops in south korea th tensions decreased markedly in 2007 following the bush administrations decision to place greater emphasis on engagement and negotiations with north korea the election of lee who has stressed the importance of rebuilding ussouth korean ties is expected to further improve relations thus with the alliance apparently on firmer ground the korus fta longer appears as an exceptional area of bilateral cooperation although the fta s utility as an acute salve for the alliance has been reduced over the medium and longer term some argue it could help to boost the alliance by deepening bilateral economic and political ties the tensions over north korea policy which may resurface have revealed the extent to which the two countries view north korea differently most south koreans sense of threat from north korea has declined over the past decade even as americans threat perceptions have risen with the central rationale for the alliancedeterring north korean attacknow open to question in south korea and with many south koreans opposed to allowing us troops in south korea to deploy to other parts of asia such as the taiwan strait in the event of crisis the future utility and form of the alliance is being debated entering into an fta some argue is way to help reorient the alliance to adapt to the changes on the korean peninsula and in east asia however in concrete terms it is difficult to see how the korus fta would make significant difference in the strategic relationship as it is unlikely to alter either countrys fundamental interests on the peninsula or in northeast asia in contrast while the passage of the korus fta is unlikely to have major substantive impact on the strategic relationship collapse of the korus fta would probably have profound symbolic effect particularly upon the way south koreans view the alliance if the korus fta is rejected or subjected to prolonged delay by the united states it would be psychological blow to many south korean policymakers many of whom would likely see it as betrayal this would be particularly true since in their eyes they made politically costly concessions on autos beef labor and the environment to help ensure the agreement would be more favorably received in the us congress the korus ftas failure in the united states according to some korean politicians and policymakers would lend credence to arguments in south korea that the us commitment to korea and northeast asia is declining if these perceptions take hold it would increase the political costs of south korean leaders taking unpopular decisions on behalf of the alliance such as increasing south korean payments for relocating us troops on the peninsula if the korus fta is rejected or delayed in the united states us policymakers could attempt to somewhat ameliorate the negative symbolic effects in south korea by taking high profile steps to expand usrok strategic rather than economic relations

asia proliferating failure of the korus fta to be implemented would also likel mean that the united states would be shut out of regional economic groupings in east asia in contrast the implementation of the korus fta could spark interest of other east asian countries such as japan to negotiate ftas with the united states in order not to lose their share of the huge us market to south korea thus if the proponents of the competitive liberalization argument are correct the fate of the korus fta could play an important role in accelerating or decelerating the move to open market regionalism in east asia similarly the fate of the korus fta is likely to be seen as bellwether for broader us trade policy which is now in period of reevaluati on in addition to the korus fta us ftas with colombia and panama are pending but not likely to receive consideration before the conclusion of the 110 th congress leaving it to new congress and administration to decide their fates the doha development agenda round in the wto is for all intent and purposes on life support if not dead this raises questions in the minds of us policymakers and other experts regarding the future role of the wto and multilateral negoti ations in shaping the international trading framework the korus fta will likely play role in this reassessment for better or worse its rejection or indefinite delay might call into

korean negotiators reached agreement on the sanitary rules that korea will apply to beef imports from the united states it allows for imports of all cuts of us boneless and bonein beef and other beef products from cattle irrespective of age as long as specified risk materials known to transmit mad cow disease are removed and other conditions are met however to address subsequent korean concerns both sides revised this deal in june to limit sales of us beef from cattle less than 30 months old south korea published rules to put this agreement into effect on june 26 and quickly began to inspect us beef shipments the us department of agriculture similarly has begun to implement new program to verify that the beef sold is processed from cattle under 30 months old us beef exporters are now working to recapture key overseas market in 2003 south korea was the thirdlargest market for us beef exports prior to the ban imposed after the first us cow infected with mad cow disease or bse bovine spongiform encephalopathy was discovered koreas commercial significance is reflected in the position taken by several members of congress who state that congressional consideration of and support for the koreaus free trade agreement korus fta depends upon south korea fully opening its market to us beef while the us beef industry and us policymakers welcomed the april deal korean tv coverage of the issue and internetspread rumors that questioned the safety of us beef resulted in escalating protests and calls for the beef agreement to be renegotiated or scrapped us officials countered that measures already in place to prevent the introduction of bse in us cattle herds meet international scientific standards to address mounting public pressure the korean government twice pursued talks with the united states to find ways to defuse public concerns without renegotiating the beef agreement on june 21 both governments confirmed voluntary private sector arrangement that will allow korean firms to import us beef produced only from cattle less than 30 months old both view this as transitional step until korean consumers regain confidence in the safety of us beef since midjuly 2008 exports of us beef have accelerated and are gaining market share against other competitors to date korean importers are selling us beef primarily to regional markets and neighborhood butcher shops however us exporters are watching for changes in consumer sentiment that might encourage korean department store supermarket and restaurant chains to resume largescale purchases of us beef the

surviving only by linkages to other major market producers150 jeffery schott of the peterson institute for international economics has presented an analysis of south korean automotive production and shipments in 2005 based on korean official statistics which illustrates that large shares of south korean vehicles of all types are exported among passenger cars however the significance of exports tends to decline with the size of the vehicle the export share of south koreanproduced vehicl officially described as light was 69 and of small vehicles was 82 for medium cars the export share dropped to 62 and for large cars the share was 53 schott noted that ford and chrysler representatives argue that south korean tariff and nontariff barriers have restricted the supply of imported large vehicles which traditionally have higher profit marginsto reserve large share of the market for domestic producers surprisingly high percentage of south korean production of larger cars is sold in the domestic market rather than exported and these are cars that most directly compete with imports 151

alabama assembly plant starting in 2005 thus reducing the export share of that product however according to wards automotive yearbook only 91000 hyundai vehicles were produced in the us in the startup
