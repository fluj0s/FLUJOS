6212c13 shspec225 repair of r212 some of the material in this tape is covered by hcob 30dec62 urgent important routines 212 and 210 case errors points of greatest importance there is law embracing your disheartenment the more you goof the more disheartened you will get we are longer dealing with process that has to be tailored to the pc so any problems have to be with the auditor someone has to be shoved through it to win as an auditor so that he has reality on the workability of the process this is hard to confront it is like someone saying be responsible r212 produces results when it is done right or even not quite right when you first look at it you will think that r212 has hundreds of variables training auditors in r212 is based on the idea of walk before you read book on walking the only liability of this teaching method is that you need someone there who can untangle the inevitable goofs when several have gone by and the pc has gone weird the whole technology of straightening out goofedup r212 is to do it right the only crime is to lose the session records one way to lose them is careless labelling eg pc name or date or page number you need to know what went on and what the items were etc let anyone do r212 as long as they keep the papers this applies to goals dont lose old goals lists there was place to write goals in handbook for preclears those goals could very easily get lost r212 lists are even more important than goals lists since you can get back to goals with r212 if need be so mark down what happened especially if something rockslammed pain and sensation are less important to note note what happens to items when tiger drilled auditors reports are less important than lists they can be used to summarize not to keep track of ta reads needle behavior on lists is what counts give detailed report of results not session actions in the auditors report form dont get the ideas that there are lots of rules covering lots of variables in r212 one thing that will louse up some but not all cases is to represent rockslamming item instead of opposing it especially list one item you never represent rockslamming r1 the pc will go along with it the idiot but he knows that he shouldnt take his attention off the rockslamming item itself for second you are pulling his attention away from where he thinks he must remain with fixed bayonet so when fixing case check to see if that has been done when repairing case take repairing the first list one mistake as priority action because it has more bearing on the session the worst goof on list one is to represent what was rockslamming and should have been opposed it is less awful to oppose something you should represent complete opposition lists which way an item should be opposed can be problematic the closer things are to pt the more likely they are to be coterms therefore r212 has more coterms than 3gaxx being closer to pt coterms are opposed both ways who or what would coterm oppose and who or what would oppose coterm you can swap it back and forth half page each one side will run more smoothly after awhile and that is what you use opposing coterm can be tricky the commonest goof is not completing the list but trying to make it oppose instead this coterm thing is one thing that that makes it hard to complete lists represent list that goes nowhere can be dumped with small liability the item will be found later somehow there are lots of rock slams in the bank but opposition lists must be completed if you represent something that didnt rockslam you should check if you having any trouble with it to see if it is actually rockslamming what you are representing might be the item suppressed and your representing it cleans it up so it now rockslams like prepchecking representing is powerful auditing on the other hand when you start to oppose something you key it in therefore you must complete oppose lists on r212 the commonest goof relating to this fact is failure to oppose something both ways to the method described above for handling coterms is not infallible the item might not be coterm wrong way to it might be an item that is deaded down never rockslammed or wrong source if it is wrong source it never becomes nullable nullable is different from item capable of being found on it nonnullable means list where the needle wont stay clean enough on it to null it so extend the list the trick in extending an oppose list is to do it the reverse way to the other direction this will prevent list from becoming 1000 items long with ris if it is wrong way to on oppose never renull extend the list and null what you now have this because an incomplete list is the commonest error in listing if you nulled it to nothing and ran out of rock slams it is incomplete so get more items your auditing could become good enough for you to be able to null list that isnt complete to nothing if you continue the list you will find that the rock slam will turn back on on the thing that you are opposing and you will get reliable item in repairing lists get old cycles of action done in order from first to last starting with oppose lists then doing represent lists always begin with scientology list one so start with the first goof made on list one this usually involves getting the rockslamming item that was missed and opposing it in any new group on r212 there will be people who tell you that it doesnt work this is the notgoingright type of case there are two possible reasons why the case is not going right 1 rock slam on list one was missed and not opposed or 2 somebody shifted the cycle of action opposition cycles of action are always more important than represent cycles so get the earliest and come up the track consecutively unless the list one was done as later case action in which case you fix any goof there first fix the first goof on list one first so the order of repair is 1 first goof on list one 2 rest of list one goofs in chronological order 3 first goof on r212 oppose list 4 rest of r212 oppose list goofs in order 5 first represent list goof 6 rest of represent list goofs in order then there is the dead horse case on which one can find rock slam this could be an incomplete cycle of action case you should look for the following in such case 1 failure to oppose rockslamming item particularly on list one list one must be in restimulation for the case to now be laying dead horses 2 failure to complete the oppose list if the item was opposed 3 auditor needed white cane he didnt recognize or report rock slams that were there particularly in coaudit to determine whether this is the case you have to observe get one of the dead horse lists extended and see if it rockslams or extend it yourself and see 4 representing something that would become dead horse you will get complaints about cases rockslamming too much to get ruds in the best way to turn off the rock slam is to represent something that would become dead horse the rule is that case will continue to rockslam only when the subject that the rock slam is on continues to be addressed by the auditor if you are listing one thing the pc doesnt rockslam on something else you dont even get phantom slam on an uncharged list the list has to be hot to turn the slam on you can get confused as to which item is slamming as the rock slam turns on and off the phantom slam has this characteristic it never obeys the auditor it turns on and off but it cant be controlled the pc in such case cant be controlled either he is never doing what you tell him to do but rockslamming item on such case will obey the auditor the item will slam as long as the pc thinks about it then stops when he puts suppress etc on it if you get these buttons off it will slam again however you can kill an r212 item with tiger drilling it should be done briefly because the items are in pt so in patching up case look for 1 list one errors 2 oppositions it is lucky that case patchup is so simple since the number of possible errors is almost infinite however there are not infinite numbers of special cases on r212 the commonest mistake is for someone to go on and on representing and never check whether the item they are representing is now rockslamming it may well now that it has been unburdened so check it from time to time especially if it wont null false reports will give you the least difficulty except for cases where pcs tell you that they have pain when it is really sensation they will also lie about the fact that they have been invalidating items getting clean needle before nulling pulls all that up running the case parallels repairing the case doing r212 follows the same order of importance as the repair priorities an embarrassment you can get into is getting rocket reads instead of rock slams on r212 first be sure it was rocket read rocket reads take precedence over rock slams so just oppose it since the pc can use rocket read item to find goal with the pc may be continually intruding his goal at this point fine get it checked out dont leave it in doubt when he gets his goal he can run r212 better this doesnt mean that he can be run on his goal complete r212 first the case that is being cleared over the top of an r212 ptp wont stay fning even if it gets to an fn eighty percent of all cases that have tried to go clear have hung up here so it is very important
