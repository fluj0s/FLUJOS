threats through the indirect use of military force in concert with the diplomatic informational and economic elements of national power direct use of military force is the exception rather than the rule this approach relies on supporting the efforts of the government of the nation in which the problem is developing let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any

nations in time of need often look to other nati ons to provide assistance these nations seeking assistance are often struggling to quell unrest within their borders or are seeking way s to strengthen or further professionalism within their military internal proble ms or potential problems could stem from economic issues populace dissatisfied with the government social unrest or terrorism the united states has historically promoted democracy and freedom in other nations by assisting nations seeking s olutions to improve security and unrest within its borders nume rous us organizations civilian and military support this effort for the military this effort is fid joint publication jp 102 department of defense dictionary of military and associated terms defines fid as the participation by civilian and military agencies of government in any of the action progr ams taken by another government or other designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion lawlessness and insurgency 12 fid planners must consider all the elements of na tional power to include diplomatic informational military and economic the national security council n sc is responsible for planning guidance for fid at the strategic level the departme nt of state dos is normally desi gnated the lead agency for execution of fid programs however military assistance is often require d to provide secure environment to accomplish host nations hns goals the depart ment of defense dod provides personnel and equipment to help achieve fid objectives 13 supporting the fid requirements and identified needs of an hn is the compilation of the national military strategy nms joint plans and the geographic comb atant commanders gccs developed plans chapter 1 12 fm 305202 2

the ir enhanced security greater cooperation and st ronger worldwide alliances commitments to other nations based on providing more secure environment lead to various programs to help build or enhance their internal defense and development idad program or provide assistance in other areas military involvement in fid activities could range from training hn forces to secure port waterway to providing courses to combat terrorism fid could also be interrelated w ith other military operations such as unconventional warfare uw or actual combat operations one unit could have fid mission t train force while another military unit works with that trained force and conducts actual combat operations 14 the strategic end state is an hn capable of successfully inte grating military force with other instruments of national power to er adicate lawlessness insurgency s ubversion and terrorism ultimately fid efforts are successful if they preclude the need to deploy large numbers of us military personnel and equipment types of military operations related to fid are nation assistance na andor support to counterinsurgency coin counter terrorism ct peace operations po dos support to counterdrug cd operations and foreign humanitarian assistance fha these categories may to s ome degree include fid operations as an integral component in supporting the fight against subversion lawlessness insurgency and terrorism fid programs are distinct nd will vary from country to country to support that countrys idad program internal defense and development 15 idad is the full range of measures taken by na tion to promote its growth and protect itself from subversion lawlessness and insu rgency it focuses on building viab institutions political economic military and social that respond to the needs of the society idad is the hns program the hn has responsibility and control of the program devel opment programs that are carefully planned and implemented and properly publicized can serve the in terests of population groups and deny exploitable issues to the insurgents security programs provide an atmosphere of peace within which development can take place 16 the idad strategy is founded on the assumption that the hn is responsible for the devel opment and execution of its own programs to prevent or defeat subversion lawlessness and insurgency the fundamental thrust of the idad strategy is toward preventing the escalation of interna l conflict anticipating and defeating the threat posed by specific organizations and working to correct conditions that prompt violence are effective means of prevention if subversion lawlessness insurgency or terrorism occurs emphasis is placed on holding down the level of violence the population must be mobilized to participate in idad efforts thus idad is an overall st rategy for the prevention of these activities and if an insurgency or terrorism shoul d develop for coin and ct activ ities us army fid operations contribute to the overall idad strategy of the hn and are based on integrat ed military and civilian programs united states national objectives and policy 17 basic premise of us foreign policy is that the security of the united states and its fundamental values and institutions will be best preserved and enhanced s part of community of free and independent nations in this regard the united states endeavors to encourage other countries to do their part in the preservation of this freedom and independence the objective is to support us interests by ans of common effort this common effort makes use of instruments of national power to support an hn the diplomatic instrument is often first used to show us commitment the political system within the hn is key in providing the stability and must be willing to improve the stability within its borders the economic instrument has influence across all aspects of fid figure 11 page 13 shows the fid fra mework in many cases fid is incorporated into hn programs within nations that are usually ss developed and require means to improve the economy hn programs can range from favorable trade arrangements to military financing the informationa l

efforts to improve the hn although the focus of this publication is on t he the nature of foreign internal defense 2 february 2007 fm 305202 13 military instrument the military instrument is primar ily supporting role to the overall fid program this military instrument provides suppor t in the following three ways z indirect support indirect support builds strong national infrastructures through economic and military capabilities that contribute to selfsufficiency this can include unit exchange programs personnel exchange programs peps indivi dual exchange programs and combination programs z direct support in direct support us forces provi direct assistance to the hn civilian populace or military this support can be evaluation training limited information exchange and equipment support z combat operations the president must approve combat operations combat operations are temporary solution until hn forces can stabilize the situation nd provide security for the populace emphasis should be placed on hn forces in the forefront during these operations to maintain hn legitimacy with the population co mbat operations can in clude coin operations figure 11 the fid framework 18 those governments that lack the will to address their social economic or political problems are unlikely to benefit from outside assistance howe ver governments that do mobilize their human and material resources may find that outside help to in clude us security assistance sa makes critical difference where significant us national interests are involved the united stat may provide economic and military assistance to supplement the efforts of such governments chapter 1 14 fm 305202 2 february 2007 19 the creation of relatively stable internal environment one in which economic grow th can occur and the people are able to determine their own form of government is primary us objec tive economic assistance either supplied by the united states through bilateral agreements or by several nations through multilateral agreements may help achieve this objective 110 the primary responsibility for creating stable at mosphere through the commitment and use of all its internal resources rests with the threatened government under certa in conditions us policy supports supplementing local efforts to maintain this or der and stability these conditions are as follows z the internal disorder is of such nature as to pose significant th reat to us national interests z the threatened country is capable of effectively using us assistance z the threatened country requests us assistance 111 the united states government usg spends billions of dollars ye ar with certain expectations in programs to improve allied and friendly nations there are numero us benefits for the us military to conduct fid throughout the world these benefits include z fid programs help build and foster favorable relationships that promote us interests in many cases these programs lead to the establishment of personal and unit relationships z fid programs strengthen friendly nation capabilities which ulti mately strengthen us security concerns z many of the foreign areas aided by the united states provide us forces with peacetime and contingency access z training exercises with foreign nations that increase the profic iency and skills of us forces z improvement of us forces regional knowledge of specific areas which can be disseminated throughout the force environment terrain soci political economic culture and beliefs z improved effectiveness of the war on terrorism 112 subversion lawlessness and insurgency are the re sult of specific conditions within nation they may stem from the populations perception that they are suffering from conditions such as poverty unemployment religious disparity political issues crime or tribal unrest these conditions have historically set the stage for lawlessness and insurg ent activity against an established government this type of internal strife or conflict within nations borders may remain local problem or expand which allows an outside source to influence or create oppos ition toward the legitimate government in some cases outside sources may threaten the hns stability by expl oiting the conditions within that nation to further their own cause this outside influence may even establish itself within the hn to promote and support civil unrest these types of conditions promote insurgencies and their violent solutions like terrorism us military involvement in fid has tr aditionally focused on coin although mu ch of the fid effort remains focused on this important area us fid programs may aim at othe r threats to an hns internal stability such as terrorism 113 identification of the root cause of the problem analysis of the environment and identifi cation of the specific needs of the hn are key in tailoring military support to assi st an hns idad program emphasis should be on helping the hn address the root cause of instability in preventative manner rather than reacting to threats the united stat will support specific nations based on us policy toward that nation or region and will implement fid programs to support that nation through gcc security cooperation programs fid programs of all types such as humanita rian assistance and ct programs can prevent reduce or stop mitigating factors that can contribute to the beg inning or spread of terrorism and insurgencies fid activities implemen ted through the gcc may ultimately lead to stability within that nation or region and effectively reduce threats to the united states 2 february 2007 fm 305202 21 chapter 2 united states organization for foreign internal defense to assist country with its idad efforts one must understand the political cl imate social attitudes economic conditions religious considerations philosophy or plan of the insurgents the host government and the local population one should also understand how the united states implements diplomatic economic informational and military instruments in coordinated nd balanced combination to help remedy the situation missions 21 fid is the role the us military

at the request of the hn more direct forms of us military support may be provided to include combat forces the following principles apply to fid z all us agencies involved in fid must coordinate with one another figure 21 page 22 to ensure that they are working toward common objective and deriving optimum benefit from the limited resources applied to the effort z the us military seeks to enhance the hn military and paramilitary force s overall capability to perform their idad mission an evaluation of the request and the demonstrated resolve of the hn government will determine the specific form and substance of us assistance as directed by the president z specially trained selected and jointly staffed us military surve teams including intelligence personnel may be made available us military units used in fid roles should be tailored to meet the conditions within the hn z us military support to fid should focus on ssisting hns in anticip ating precluding and countering threats or potential threats military support 22 emphasis on idad when organizing planning and executing military support to fid program is essential this emphasis helps the hn address the root cause s of

important area us fid programs may aim at other threats to the internal stability of the hn such as civil disorder illicit drug trafficking and terrorism 23 at the national level the usg has two

counterinsurgency an insurgency is an organized movement aimed at the overthrow of constituted government using subversion nd armed conflict in some cases however the goals of an insurgency may be more limited for ex ample the insurgency may intend to break away portion of the nation from government control and establish an autonomous state within traditional ethnic or religious territorial bounds the insurgency may also inte nd to extract limited political concessions unattain able through less violent means coin is defined as those military paramilitary political economic psychological and civic actions taken by government to defeat insurgency fm 102 nature of insurgencies a1 insurgencies generally follow revolutionary doctrine and use armed forces as an instrument of policy an insurgency is protr acted politicomilitary struggle designed to weaken government control and legitimacy while increasing insurgent control and legitimacyt he central issues in the insurgency each insurgency has its own unique characteristics based on its strategic objectives its operational environment and available resources insurgencies normally seek to overthrow the existing social order and reallocate power within the country phases of insurgencies a2 an insurgency may be classified into three general phases accord ing to the level of intensity typically successful insurgencies pass through common phases of development not all i nsurgencies experience every phase and progression through all phase s is certainly not requirement for success the same insurgent movement may be in another phase in other regions of country successful insurgencies can also revert to an earlier phase when under pressure resuming development when favorable conditions return a3 some insurgencies depend on proper timing for thei r success because of their limited support their success depends on weakening the governments legitim acy so that it becomes ineffective then an opportunity to seize power exists when these insurgencies move to seize power t hey expose their organization and intentions if they move too early or too late the government may discover the ir organization and destroy it timing is critical phase i a4 phase i ranges from circumstances in which subversive activity is only pote ntial threat latent or incipient to situations in whic h subversive incidents and activities ccur with frequency in an organized pattern phase i involves major outbreak of violence or uncontrolled insurgency activity a5 in those nations where potential insurgency problem exists and where us interests so dictate an sa program may be designed sa programs support the total us effort to reduce the causes of insurgency initially such program will provide continuing as sessment of the threat and allow work toward strengthening the i ndigenous capacity to combat insurgency us military intelligence activity in this phase is primarily ci effort involving the assessment of such potential hostile threats as terrorism espionage and sabotage to us na tional security interests and th reliability of nonus military resources appendix a2 fm 305202 2 february 2007 a6 if an sao does not exist the nation concerned shoul d be encouraged to obtain appropriate assistance by requesting establishment of an sao or requesting jcet programs the theater commanders security cooperation strategy for the region defines the conduct of these programs the mission should include us personnel specially trained in military assistance personnel trained specifically for other fid activities may serve as augmentees for the mission by these means hn forces can have appropriate training to better facilitate their dealing with the problem phase ii a7 phase ii is reached when the subversive movement having gained sufficient local or external support initiates organized guerrilla warfare or related forms of violence against the established authority in situations where insurgency develops to more serious proportions us efforts may be expanded to include z necessary equipment and training z forces specifically trained for activities in fid z instructor personnel note under some circumstances unit advisors may also be included phase iii a8 the situation moves from phase ii to phase iii when the insurgency become s primarily war of movement between organized forces of the insurgents and those of the established authority during period of escalated insurgency th united states may expand its assistance at the request of the host government this assistance may include selected us conventional forces neverthele ss the hn government will be expected to provide the bulk of the combat forces require d in dealing with the situation it is critical for the hn forces to remain at the forefront of the effort to ensure they remain legitimate in the eyes of the hn populace this effort can be supported through the io plan causes of dynamics of insurgencies a9 insurgencies may arise when th populace perceives that the govern ment is unable or unwilling to redress their issues or the demands of important so cial groups these groups band together and begin to use violence to change the governments position insu rgencies are often coalition of disparate forces united by their common enmity for the government to be successful an insurgen cy must deve lop unifying leadership doctrine organization and strategy only th seeds of these elements exist when an insurgency begins the insurgents must continually nurture and provide the necessary care if the insurgenc is to mature and succeed a10 insurgencies succeed by mobilizing human and mate riel resources to provi active and passive support for their programs operations and goals mobilization produces wo rkers and fighters raises funds and acquires the necessary weapons equipment and supplies mobiliza tion grows out of intense popular dissatisfaction with existing political and social c onditions the active supporte rs of the insurgency consider these conditions intolerabl the insurgent leader ship articulates its dissatisfaction places the blame on government and offers an alternative the in surgent leadership then provides organizational and management skills to transform disaffected people into an effective force for political action ultimately the insurgents need the active support of majority of the po litically active people and the passive acquiescence of the majority framework for analysis of insurgencies a11 there are eight dynamics comm on to most insurgencies z leadership z ideology z objectives z environment and geography z internal support insurgency and counterinsurgency 2 february 2007 fm 305202 a3 z external support z phasing and timing z organizational and operational patterns a12 these dynamics provide framework for analysis that can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the insurgency although analysts can examine these elements separatel they must understand how they interact to fully understand the insurgency leadership a13 insurgency is not simply random political violence it is directed and focused political violence it requires leadership to provide vision direction gui dance coordination and or ganizational cohesiveness the leaders of the insurgency must make their cause known to the people and gain popula r support their key tasks are to break the ties betw een the people and the government nd to establish the credibility of their movement they must replace the legitimacy of the government with that of their own their education background family social connections nd experiences shape how they think and how they will fulfill their goals these factors also help shape their appro ach to problem solving a14 leadership is function of organization and personality som organizations deemphasize individual personalities and provi for redundancy and replacemen t in decision making these mechanisms produce collective power and do not depend on spec ific leaders or personalities to be effective they are easier to penetrate but more re sistant to change other organizations may depend on charismatic personality to provide cohesion motivatio n and rallying point for the movement organizations led in this way can produce decisions and initia new actions rapidly but are vulnerable to disruptions if key personalities are removed or coopted ideology a15 to win the insurgency must have program that explains what is wrong with society and just ifies its insurgent actions it must promise great improvements after the government is overthrown or if its goa ls are met the insurgency us ideology to offer society goal the insurgents often express th is goal in simple terms for ease of focus future plans of the insurgency must be vague enough for broad appeal and specific enough to address important issues a16 the ideology of groups within the movement may indicate differing views of strategic object ives groups may have ideological conflicts that need to be resolved before an opponent can capit alize on them ideology may suggest probable objectives and tactics it greatly influences the insurge nts perception of his environment this perception of the environment in turn shapes the organizational and operational methods of the movement objectives a17 effective analysis of an insurgency requires interpretation of the objectives possibly pursued by the insurgents to include z strategic objective the strategic objective is the insurgent s desired end state that is how the insurgent will use the power once he has it the replacement of the government in power is only one step along this path however it will likely be the initial focus of efforts typically the strategic objective is critical to cohesion among insurgent groups it may be the onl clearly defined goal of the movement z operational objective operational objectives are those the insurgents pursue as part of the overall process of destroying government legitimacy and progressively blishing their desired end state z tactical objective tactical objectives are the immediate ai ms of insurgent acts for example the dissemination of psyop products or the attack and seizure of key facility these actions accomplish tactical objectives th at lead to operational goals tactical objectives can be psychological and physical in nature for example legiti macy is the center of gravity for the appendix a4 fm 305202 2 february 2007 insurgents and the counterinsurgents leg itimacy is largely product of perception consequently it can be the principal consideration in the sel ection and attainment of tactical objectives environment and geography a18 environment and geography including cultural and dem ographic factors affect all participants in conflict the manner in which insurgents and counterin surgents adapt to these r ealities creates advantages and disadvantages for each the effect s of the environment and geography are most visible at the tactical level where they are perhaps the pr edominant influence on decisions regarding force structure doctrine and ttp internal support a19 the populations support is fundamental to the succe ss of both the insurgency and coin operations the populations support for the insurg ency even its neutrality will allo w the insurgents the freedom of movement and the ability to rest refit and recruit in the same manner coin operations require the popular support of the people to acquire the necessary information to plan conduct and continue its operations these opposing forces are in constant str uggle to gain and maintain the support of the people and thereby create an internal support mechanism external support a20 historically some insurgencies have done well without external s upport however recent examples such as vietnam nicaragua afgha nistan and iraq show that extern support can accelerate events and influence the outcome external support can provide political psychological and ma terial resources that might otherwise be limited or unavailable four types of external support are z moral acknowledgement of the insurgent as just and admirable z political active promotion of the insurgents strategic goals in interna tional forums z resources money weapons food advisors and training z sanctuary secure training plus operational and logistical bases a21 accepting external support can affect the legitimacy of in surgents and counterinsurgents it implies the inability to sustain oneself in addition the country or group provi ding support attaches its legitimacy along with the insurgent or the counterinsurgent gr oup it supports the consequences can affect programs in the supporting nation wholly unrelated to the insurgen t situation however adve rse consequences can be alleviated through anonymous contributions that are channeled thr ough various sources before reaching the insurgent group phasing and timing a22 insurgencies often pass through common phases of development the conceptualization generally followed by insurgents is drawn from that postulated by mao tsetung regardless of its provenanc movements as diverse as communist or islamic insurgencies have used the maoist c onceptualization because it is logical and based upon the mass mobilization emphasis it states tha t insurgents are first on the strategic defensive phase i move to stalemate phase ii and finally go over to the offensive phase iii strategic movement from one phase to another incorpor ates the operational and tactical activity typical of earlier phases it does not end them organizational and operational patterns a23 insurgencies develop organizationa l and operational patterns from the interaction of many factors as result each insurgency organization is uni however knowing the commonly accepted general patterns or strategies of insurgency helps in predicting the tactics and techniques the may employ against the supported government insurgency and counterinsurgency 2 february 2007 fm 305202 a5 insurgent strategies a24 there are three general strategies of insurgency traditional foco spanish word meaning focus or focal point and massoriented the following paragraphs discuss these strategies traditional insurgency a25 traditional insurgency normally grows from very specific grievanc and initially has limited aims it springs from tribal racial religious linguistic or other similarly identifiabl group the insurgents perceive that the government has denied the rights and interests of their group and work to establ ish or restore them they frequently seek withdrawal from government control through autonomy or semi autonomy they seldom specifically seek to overthrow the government or control the whole socie ty they generally respond in kind to government violence thei r use of violence can range from strikes and street demonstrations to terrorism and guerrilla warfare th insurgencies may cease if the government accedes to the insurgents demands the concessions the in surgents demand however are so great that the government concedes its legitimacy along with them huk rebellion the huk rebellion in the philippines can be considered traditional insurgency despite its communist origin the huks first surfaced as an armed force resisting the japanese occupation during world war ii fter the war when other resistance bands disarmed the huks did not after t he american liberation the huks saw chance to seize national power at when the newly proclaimed philippine republic was in obvious distress because of monetary crisis graft in high office and mounting peasant unrest by 1950 the huks had built force of 12800 armed guerrillas with thousands of peasant suppor ters on central luzon they were defeated in series of actions by the armed forces of the philippines led by ramon magsaysay by 1965 they were nearly extinct and down to 75 members largely agrarian the huks do not view the government as totally in need of replacement but that many of the people in it need replac ed recently the huk movement has been gaining popular support on the island of luzon foco insurgency a26 foco is single armed cell that emerges from hidden strongholds in an atmosphere of disintegrating legitimacy in theory this cell is the nucleus around which mass popular support rallies the insurgents build new institutions and establish control on the basis of that support for foco insurgency to succeed government legitimacy must be near total collapse timing is cr itical the foco insurgency must mature at the same time the government loses legitim acy and before any alternative appears the most famous foco insurgencies were those led by fide l castro and che guevara the strategy was quite effective in cuba because the batista regime was corrupt and incompet ent the distinguishing characteristics of foco insurgency are the z deliberate avoidance of preparatory organizational work the rationale is based on the prem ise that most peasants are intimidated by the authorities and will betray an group that cannot defend itself z development of rural support as demonstrated by the ability of the foco insurgency to strike against the authorities and survive z absence of any emphasis on the protracted nature of the conflict appendix a6 fm 305202 2 february 2007 castros junta in 1952 fidel castro began his revolutionary movement in cuba after an unsuccessful attack of fort moncada he was imprisoned upon release in 1955 he fled to mexico to train new group of guerrilla warriors in 1956 castro and 82 of his followers returned to cuba on yacht of th is group only 12 of castros followers made their way to the sierra maestra m ountain range from his remote mountain base castro established 100 to 150man nucleus as castros organization grew small unit patrols began hitandrun type operations while castro continued to expand his area of influence the popularity of the corrupt batist government waned in may of 1958 the government launched an attack on the sierra maestra stronghold castro withdrew deeper into the mountains while spreading his message on national reform batistas continuing r epression of the country led to general strikes and continuing growth in popular support for castros small cell of revolutionaries finally batista fled the country on 1 january 1959 and castro established junta and became the prime minister and president massoriented insurgency a27 massoriented insurgency aims to achieve the political and arme d mobilization of large popular movement massoriented insurgencies emphasize creating pol itical and armed legitimacy outside the existing system they challenge that system and then destroy or supplant it these insurgents patiently build large armed force of regular and irregular guerrillas they also struct base of active and passive political supporters they pl an protracted campaign of in creasing violence to destroy the government and its institutions from th outside their political leadership normally is distinct from their military leadership their movement normally establis hes parallel government that openly proclaims its own legitimacy they have welldeveloped ideology and decide n their objectives only after careful analysis highly organized they mobilize forces for direct military and political challenge to the government using propa ganda and guerrilla action the distinguishing characteristics of massoriented insurgency are z political control by the revolutionary organization which ensures priority of political considerations z reliance on organized popular support to provide recruits funds supplies and intelligence z primary areas of activity especially in early phases in the remote country side where the population can be organized nd base areas established w ith little interference from the authorities z reliance upon guerrilla tactics to carry on the military side of the strategy these tactics focus on the avoidance of battle except at times and places of the insurgents choosing and the employment of stealth and secrecy ambush and surprise to overcom the initial imbalance of strength z phased strategy consisting first of primarily organizational phase in which the population is prepared for its vital role in the second pha armed struggle is launched and the guerrilla force gradually builds up in size and strength the third phase consists of mobile more conventional warfare conceptually this third phase is accompanied by popular uprising that helps overwhelm the regime it is in concept protracted war insurgency and counterinsurgency 2 february 2007 fm 305202 a7 advising salvador military for 12 years beginning in 1979 the united st ates

fought the guerrillas to standstill and tablished the groundwork for negotiated settlement by 1991 initiating event a28 it does not follow that an insurgen cy will erupt if the preconditions for an insurgency are satisfied the conflict must await an initiating event an initia ting event mobilizes the energies of the discontented and directs them toward violent action its impact is more psychological than physical and need not follow immediately after the event the event may have little significance but an elite group or an organization may at some time give it special significance possible initiat ing events include z an event that gains symbolic significance this event may be an economic or social disaster particularly antagonizing action by the regime or heroic act of defiance by an individual z an event that forces action such as an invasion by foreign power z the emergence of charismatic leader for example fidel castro or mao tsetung z the perception of tactical or strategic advantage by revoluti onary elite z the decision by revolutionary elite to issue call to arms z the influence of foreign agents or propaganda a29 if situation is explosive almost any event may serve as an ini tiating event its correct timing may also produce flood of events in short period making it hard to point to single event as the act that initiated the struggle thus it may be more helpful to think of series of acts as an initiating event initiating events may be historical with the insurgents r ecalling the event for the populace this technique frees the insurgent from waiting for proper event to occur note fm 305201 special forces unconventional warfare operations has additional information on insurgency tactical counterinsurgency operations a30 tactical coin

coordination of all coin operations appendix a8 fm 305202 2 february 2007 a31 there may be need for tactical operations inside or near an urban area to feat an insurgent attack any insurgent effort to seize and hold an urban area will probably involve operations in nearby areas as well when the police or other internal security forces cannot cope with the atta ck inside the urban area military forces can participate these forces can set up security around the urban area and deny the insurgents reinforcements or support military forces a32 when military forces reinforce police units to defeat insurgent forces i nside an urban area they require close control and coordination the military forces shoul d make every attempt to empower hn forces to remain at the forefront of operations to bu ild or maintain legitimacy in the eyes of the populace at times they may only require military units to c onduct outer cordons or act as quick reaction force qrf for police operations as soon as the police for ce can manage the situation the military forces withdraw insurgent forces a33 when insurgent forces seize an urban area proper authorities evaluate from tactical and psychological aspect whether to recap ture the area by using major military force or other techniques the probable psychological impact on the enemy noncombata nt civilians and friendly troops influences the amount of force and specific techniques used to recaptu re an area the safety of civilians and friendly troops probable damage to property and the military fo rces available are consider ations the principle of minimum essential force will help reduce casua lties in the noncombatant civilian population coordination a34 riotcontrol munitions and nonlethal weapons systems can be used against targets so that military forces can close with and capture the enemy with minimum injury to the noncombatants as such military operations must be coordinated with the civilian police mission impact considerations a35 subordinate commanders have maximum flexibility in the execution of their missions but receive specific responsibilities and enough guidance to ensure coordinated effort events may cause rapid changes to coin oplans and allow units to use their resources against exposed guerrilla forces a36 maintaining high morale in units engaged in co in operations presents problems different from those in limited and conventional operations operating ag ainst an elusive force that seldom offers clear target and where tangible results are seldom obtained requires continuous troop indoctrination and training a37 during independent prolonged missions unit suppor t depends on the ingenuity courage and tenacity of commanders and staffs at all echel ons command and staff action in coin operations emphasizes z detailed planning of smallscal decentralized operations z covering extended distances z extensive contingency planning for the use of reserves and fire support z deception operations z the use of electronic warfare ew operations z detailed planning and coordination of activities with nonmilitary government officials a38 in coin operations command and staff action also emphasizes detailed coordination and direction of the intelligence collection effo rt these actions take place by z coordinating with hn and us intelligence agencies and hn regul ar and paramilitary forces z using combat forces and ew intelligence elements to include radar and remotely monitored sensors and other technical surveillance systems insurgency and counterinsurgency 2 february 2007 fm 305202 a9 z using local people in the development of intelligence colle ction systems z systematically and thoroughly interrogating prisoners and suspects a39 in addition command and staff action in coin ope rations emphasizes incorporating and monitoring government internal development programs in the oplan these actions include z preparing and executing integrated plans that include io ca prc and psyop z operating with and assisting hn military paramilitary and police fo rces z integrating logistics functions especially aerial resupply into all planning military operations in counterinsurgency a40 the objective of military operations in coin is to provide secure environment in which balanced development can occur military ope rations should not be i ndependent military actions aimed solely at destroying insurgent combat forces and their base areas military operations must be part of synchronized effort to gain broader goals the sf team commander must convince his counterpart to in tegrate intelligence io ca and psyop activities into every military operati on sf advisors and their hn counterparts must be aware of the impact their actions have on the populace nd other idad programs sf personnel have extensive knowledge of uw language nd culture that makes them uniquely qualified to advise and assist the hn in how to organize equip train sustain and employ combat forces in coin operations sf may participate in the ty pes of operations described below consolidation operations a41 consolidation operations are longterm populati on security operations conducted in territory generally under hn government control their purpose is to z isolate the insurgents from the populace z protect the populace from in surgent influence z neutralize the effects of the insurgents on the population z neutralize the insurg ent infrastructure a42 the people are unlikely to support the hn govern ment fully until the government provides enough longterm security to free its people from the fear of insurgent reprisals consolidation ope rations accomplish these objectives strike operations a43 strike operations are shortduration tactical operations conducted in contested or insurgent controlled areas unlike consolidation operations st rike operations are primarily offensive operations small highly mobile combat forces operate in disper sed formations to locate nd fix the insurgent force upon locating the insurgent force strike force commanders have their forces attack pursue and destroy it if contact is lost the strike forces resume aggressive patrolling to reestablish contact and destroy the insurgent force before it can rest reorganize and resume combat operations the purpose of strike operations is to destroy insurgent forces and base areas isolate insurgent forces from their support and interdict insurgent infiltration routes and lines of communicat ions locs remote area operations a44 remote area operations take place in insurgentcontrolled or contested areas to establish i slands of popular support for the hn government and deny support to the insurgents they differ from consolidation operations in that they do not establish permanent hn government control over the area ethnic religious or other isolated minority groups may populate remote areas they may be in the interior of the hn or near border areas where major infiltration routes exist remote area operations normally involve specially trained paramilitary or irregular forces sf teams support remote area operations to interdict insurgent activity destroy insurgent base areas and demonstrate that the hn government has not conceded control to the insurgents they also collect and report informa tion on insurgent intentions in more populated areas appendix a10 fm 305202 2 february 2007 psyop and ca programs help in obtaining local s upport for remote area operations success is more likely if z significant segment of the local population supports the program z the hn recruits local personnel for its remo area paramilitary or irregular force z hn forces conduct remote area operations to interd ict infiltration routes in areas nearly devoid of any people in this case sf teams advise nd assist irregular hn forces operating in manner similar to that of insurgents but with access to superior logistics resources border operations a45 hn police customs or paramilitary border for ces should be responsible for border security however the threat may require combattype border operations particularly in remote areas sf teams advise and assist hn forces assigned to prevent or interdict the infiltration of insurgent personnel and materiel across international boundaries the intent is to isolate insurgent forces from their external support to include external sanctuaries secondary purposes are to locate and int erdict insurgent land infiltration routes destroy insurgent forces and base areas in areas adjacent to the border and collect and report information on insurgent capabilities and intentions bord er operations normally require restrictive prc measures these prc measures are particularly annoying to border tribal and et hnic groups that do not recognize the international boundary the hn governme nt must make continuing psyop effort to gain and maintain the loya lty of the affected populace urban area operations a46 clandestine insurgent activity may be extensive in urban reas activities may include terrorism sabotage psyop and political organizational intelligence and logistic operations this insurgent activity may strain the capabilities of police and other civil authori ties police internal security and other hn government organizations will be high priority targets for th insurgents the insurg ents normally try to exploit local civilian organizations by subverting their goals and objectiv to serve the insurgent cause the insurgents strive to create situations that cause hn police and military forces to overreact in manner that adversely affects the populace sf units with ssistance from assigned and attached military police mp and ci personnel advise and assist hn for ces engaged in urban area operations the purpose of these operations is to eliminate the centralized direction and control of the insurgent organization create insurgent disunity and destroy the insurgent infra structure that threatens the hn government when military forces reinforce police in an urban area they must closely trol and coordinate their operations by doing so they minimize collateral damage and prevent hostile p ropaganda victories that occur when us or hn military forces overreact to insurgent actions therefore the need for psyop and ca support greatly increases in urban areas populace and resources control a47 sf personnel provide advisory assistance in the prc area as determined by the loc situation among the considerations are attitudes of the populace c oncept techniques and control measures of the program dc operations and forgiveness and rehabilitation attitudes a48 most of the population of any given target area is initially unresponsive to the efforts of the incumbent government or the insurgen ts in some societies there may be traditional distrust of the government and dissatisfaction with social and economic conditions however the population may not have any inclination to revolt in other societies distrust of any influence from outside sources may exist in most instances the general desire of most of the public is to be left alone to earn livelihood and to conduct its normal affairs an effective psyop program can exploit this desire for normalcy and direct popular feeling against the insurgents a49 the advocates of revolutionary warfare may be very small but capable and active segment of the population only small minority of the population may have actively participated in or s upported the insurgency and counterinsurgency 2 february 2007 fm 305202 a11 initial efforts of the insu rgents the forces of the government and its adherents usually represent countering minority it incl udes government officials civil servants professional military and police units leading politicians the wealthy and managers of industry commerce and banking firms a50 most of the population remains uncommitted the insurgents have to persuade or force the population into active or passive support of their goals the struggle is therefore not over terrain it is struggle for the support of the populace if the insurg ents win popular support among the majority of the populace the military successes of th hn government are irrelevant concept a51 the design of the prc program complements and supports the other idad programs by providing secure environment in which to administ er these programs the prc goals are to z sever the supporting relationship between the population and the insurgents z detect and neutralize the insurgent apparatus and activities i n the community z provide secure physical and psychological environment for the population a52 the hn security forces have primary responsib ility for prc operations since civilian communities usually have some system of law and order logical approach is to build on the existing w enforcement structure some developi ng countries use paramilitary forces to help civil police in prc if law enforcement system does not exist in the ao or if the existing structure is corrupt inept or compromise d the sf unit may have to help the hn organize train and develop capable police force when insurgent activities exceed the cap abilities of the police and their supporting paramilitary forces hn regular military forces may have to augment the police since the population is more likely to accept control measures enforced by hn personnel than by for ces of an outside nation us for ces will normally participate in prc operations only when the situation is clearly bey ond the capabilities of the hn s ecurity forces and only when us assistance is requested techniques a53 intelligence procedures and psyop apply to sf in prc operati ons the following paragraphs discuss these procedures and psyop intelligence procedures a54 intelligence must be coordinated at all levels intelligenc procedures must provide high degree of penetration of the target constant pressure coll ection of information and rapid dissemination of intelligence these procedures allow quick response by prc for ces prc intelligence requirements form significant part of the overall intelligence effort psychological operations a55 psyop are essential to the success of prc for maximum effectiveness s f soldiers direct strong psyop effort toward the families of the insurgents and their popula rsupport base the psyop aspect of the prc program tries to make the imposition of control more palatable to the people by relating the necessity of controls to their safety and wellbeing psyop fforts also try to create favorable national or local government image and counter the effects of the insurgent propaganda effort control measures a56 sf can advise and assist hn forces in developi ng and implementing various control measures the following paragraphs discuss prc measures security forces a57 police and other security forces use prc measures to deprive the insurgent of support and to identify and locate members of his infrastructure appropriate psyop help make these measures more acceptable appendix a12 fm 305202 2 february 2007 to the population by explaining their need the government informs the population that th prc measures may cause an inconvenience but are necessary because of the actions of the insurgents restrictions a58 rights on the legality of detention or imprisonmen t of personnel for example habeas corpus may be temporarily suspended this measure must be taken as last resort since it may provide the insurgents with an effective propaganda theme prc measures can also include the following z curfews or blackouts z travel restrictions z restricted residential areas such as protected villages or reset tlement areas z registration and pass systems z control of sensitive items resources control of cr itical supplies such as weapons food and fuel z checkpoints searches and roadblocks z surveillance censorship and press control z restriction of activity that applies to selected groups labor unions po litical groups and so on deterrents a59 many law enforcement systems have department of the army procedures in prc they incl ude roadblocks and checkpoints raids searches and sc reening operations and mob and riot control an established reaction force police or paramilitary personnel executes these actions as necessary and exploits insurgent contacts legal considerations a60 the legality of these methods and their impact on the populace govern all rest rictions controls and department of the army measures in countries where government author ities do not have wide latitude in controlling the population special or emergency legislation must be enacted this emergency legislation may include form of martial law permitting government forces to search without

and b4 lists in chronological order the tasks the special forces operational detachment sfod performs for mission handoff during longterm fid operations the sf commander may elect to replace an sfod for various reasons mission handoff is the process of passing an ongoing mission from one unit to another with discernible loss of continuity it is based on 179day requirement and involves two sfods procedures b1 the overall authority for the handoff and assumption of command lies with the commander ordering the change the authority for determining the handoff process lies with the incoming comma nder since he will assume responsibility for the ssion this changeover process may affect the conditions under which the mission will continue b2 the outgoing commander advises the incoming commander on the tentative handoff process and the assumption of the mission directly or through liaison if this advice conflicts with the mission statement or the incoming commanders desires and the conflict cannot be resolved with the authority established for the incoming commander the commander orde ring the relief resolves the issue b3 as rule the commander ordering the change does not automatically place the outgoing sfod under the incoming sfod opcon during the changeover process although this procedure would present clear and easily defined solution to establishing the incoming commanders authority it is not the most effective control for us forces should hostile contact occur during the process b4 if the incoming sfod or the hn unit it advises is in direct fire tact with the insurgents during the handoff the sfod immediately notifies the higher hq ordering the exchange if the incoming sfo d commander has not assumed responsibility his sfod immediately comes under opcon of the outgoing sfod and is absorbed into that sfod position the outgoing sfod commander and his hn counte rpart will control the battle if the outgoing sfod commande r has passed responsibility to the incoming sfod commander the outgoing sfod comes under the opcon of the incoming sfod and the hn unit coordinates its movements with the new sfod considerations b5 the incoming and outgoing sfod commanders must consider eight factors z mission the incoming sfod commander must make detailed study of the sfod mission statement and understand the present mission tasks and the implied mission tasks the m ission may also require unit with additional skill sets such as ad vanced special operations direct action or water operations knowing the mission commanders concept of the mission commanders critical information requirements ccir priority intelli gence requirements pirs and information requi rements irs will help him understand the mission after complete indepth study of the operational area the incoming sfod commander shoul d complete the handoff in manner that allows for continued uninterrupted mission accomplishment the changeover must not allow th enemy to gain any operational advantages appendix b b2 fm 305202 2 february 2007 z operational area the incountry sfod provides tinuous intelligence updates to the sf commander original pirs and irs were established for the original mission along with operational strategic and tactical information the incomi ng sfod must become totally familiar with the ongoing pirs and irs and the upcoming mission pirs and irs z enemy forces the incoming sfod commander must have the latest availabl intelligence on all enemy forces that affect the mission this intelligence include s data on terrorists and terrorist related incidents over the past several months in addition t the normal intelligence provided to the incoming sfod commander on regular basis the situation c alls for liaison from the outgoing sfod opsec is critical to prevent the enemy from discovering the impending rel ief and then exploiting the fluidity of the change and the concentration of us forces z friendly forces to the incoming sfod learning about the friendly forces is as important as knowing the enemy situation the sfod must be fa miliar with the c2 stru cture it will deal with on daily basis the sfod must know all friendl units in adjacent aos and be aware of the conventional forces units and the capabilities of their mission support base the sfod must also be aware of other operations units and their capabilities if possible the incoming sfod members should receive biographi cal data on their counterparts to include photographs these data allow sfod members to familiarize themselves with their counterparts before deployment z hn forces the incoming sfod plans and prepares fo r quick and frictionless transition in counterpart relations however potential or anticipated friction between the hn unit and the incoming sfod may cause the relief to take place more slowly than desired therefore the incoming and outgoing sfods need period of overlap to allow for incountry facetoface contact with their counterparts before the mission handoff continued execution of the mission must be achieved within the capabilities of the sfods the hn unit and the available supporting assets if us combat support units are to be relieved the relief should occur after the relief of the sfods they support z civilian populace the incoming sfod must do an indepth area study giving close attention to local problems popular support for us activ ities taking place within the ao may directly influence changes in the mission statement the outgoing sfod must provide this critical information and describe in detail all completed civic action projects and those that re underway the incoming sfod must understand the functioning of the hn government and the status of any international civilian or governme nt agencies involved in or influencing the situation in its ao z terrain and weather some handoff operations may require th sfods to move by foot into and out of the ao the outgoing sfod plans and reconnoiters the rout used for infiltrating the incoming sfod and those used for its exfiltration these rou tes must provide the best possible cover and concealment if possi ble the sfods make this exchange during darkness or inclement weather z time the depth and dispersion of units and the number of operations conducted will determine the time required to exchange sfods there must be an overlap period to allow the incoming sfod to become familiar with the ao and to establish rapport between the sfod personnel and their hn counterparts howe ver the handoff operation must take place as quickly as possible the longer the operation takes the more the sf personnel in the ao become vulnerable and lucrative target for the insurgents quickly execut ed relief will reduce the time available to the enemy to strike before the incoming sfod has time to consolidate its position the sfod should not sacrifice continued and uni nterrupted execution of ongoing operations for speed the incoming

law and us domestic law us sa and arms transfers programs are subject to specific congressional authorization appropriation and oversi ght commanders and other fid planners must consult with their legal advisors to ensure they conduct operations iaw ever changing us legislation and policy in general legal considerations on the in ternational level center on the question of describing the conflict in the hn as interna tional or internal insurgency legal considerations for the united states mainly involve using the proper funds for the type of mission being conducted additional country issues and specific us legislation must also be considered international legal considerations e1 under international law armed conflicts fall into two broad areas these areas are those of an international character and those not of an international character international conflicts e2 declaration of war and an invasion of one country by the armed forces of another clearly result in international conflict the definition of an international flict is broader however as rule if the combat effects of conflict go beyond nations bounda ries and seriously affect other countries the conflict is international all the customary laws of war on hostilities between states govern international armed conflicts the 1949 geneva conventions and all ot her treaties that make up the laws of war also apply as practical matter an important concern of the soldier fighting in this type of w ar is his right to prisoner of war pw status if captured noninternational conflicts e3 noninternational conflicts are typically called insu rgencies clandestine forces usually engage in hostilities their purpose is not to hold fixed territory or to engage government troops in direct combat but to wage guerrillatype war in this war they can lose themselves in the civilian populac by posing as noncombatants insurgents therefore are organized bodies of people who for public political purposes are in state of armed hostility against the estab lished government an important legal aspect of noninternational conflict is that captured combatants do not enjoy the rights of pws they may be prosecuted as criminals under the laws of the hn the fact that an insurgent follows the rules of war or is in uniform will not give him pw st atus under international law article 3 of each of the four geneva conventions of 1949 provides the primary source of rights and duties of persons involved in noninternational conflicts common article 3 has two parts first part e4 the first part provides that persons taking active part in the ho stilities including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those out of combat becau of sickness wounds detention or any other cause shall in all circ umstances be treated humanely humane treatment specifically excludes z violence to life and person in particular murder mutilation tortu re or any cruel treatment z hostagetaking appendix e2 fm 305202 2 february 2007 z outrages upon personal dignity in partic ular humiliating and grading treatment z passing of sentences and carrying out executions without previous judgment pronounced by regularly constituted court affording all the judi cial guarantees that ci vilized peoples recognize as vital second part e5 the second part requires collecting and caring fo r the wounded and sick common article 3 does not grant pw status to insurgents it does require the government to grant them fair trial in regularly constituted court before carrying out the courts sentence after gu ilty verdict e6 common article 3 incorporates basic human rights human rights also include other rights mbodied in the phrase life liberty and th pursuit of happiness such as th right of free speech freedom of worship and freedom of the press us personnel w ho notice suspected violations of basic human rights must report the facts to their chain of command unde r us law

because of their status the sendi ng state wishes to exercise us military forces are always subject to the uniform code of military justice ucmj e20 us policy is to maximize us jurisdiction over the armed forces it may deploy to foreign nation the legal status of us forces in foreign nation is usually defined in one of the following types of international agreements z emergency wartime agreements z sao agreements z sofas e21 during military emergencies the united states normally obtained exclusive jurisdiction over its troops in foreign countries emergency agreements have normally been short and uncomplicated the classic examples of these types of agreements are the 1950 korea the 1968 lebanon and the 1984 grenada stationing agreements e22 sao agreements provide lower level of diplomatic immunity to us troops stationed in countries under these agreements each agreement is individually negotiated with the country in ques tion and therefore is usually different soldiers on tdy in these countries for example fid mission re usually attached to the sao and automatica lly assume the protection accorded t hose personnel agreements of this type normally provide the same diplomatic immunity for anything done in the performanc of official duty personnel performing fid mission may come within the scope of the sao agreement itse lf or be included by the terms of an sa contract ente

applicable international agreement this page intentionally left blank 2 february 2007 fm 305202 f1 appendix f advisor techniques the advisor techniques outlined in this ppendix apply to the individual advisor and an sf unit in fid operations in some instan ces in the past us advisors were not selected based on language skills or ability to deal effectively with their counterparts they were selected based on military occupational specialty mos and availabil ity for an overseas hardship tour the us military services have demonstrated their professional excellence in training foreign personnel and units in technical skills however they have not performed well in advising in politicomilitary matters because of their lack of background tr aining and competence in these areas application f1 influencing hn military institutions to support mocratic process can only be done with the long term presence of us military personnel working alongside hn forces personnel who arrive for short visits will be treated as visitors and will not penetr ate the fabric of the hn culture or its institutions although short visits can serve other useful purposes the longterm presence of us military personnel is required to strengthen hn democratic institutions and convince the hn m ilitary institutions to reform hn officials are not normally confused over moral ground rules however b ecause of the dangerous situation confronting the nation they are convinced they must ignore these ground rules f2 an advisor must strive to transmit the concept of democratization to his count erpart these concepts are often considered common sense or co mmon decency and so basic in the united states they are not discussed much in training the most important mission of an advisor is to enhanc the military professionalism of his counter part he must influence the hn m ilitary and prepare them to deal with the changing environment by emphasizing civilian contro l over the military and demonstrating the advantages of democratic system of government f3 major cause of an advisors failure is his inab ility to maintain good working relationship with his counterpart the unsuccessful adviso r often fails to understand why hi s counterparts may not feel the sense of urgency that he does he is unable to r ealize that his counterpart w ill remain and continue to fight the enemy long after his tour is over and he returns to the safety and comfort of the united stat f4 the advisor must be aware of the scope and limitations of the principal sa programs authorize d by the faa and aeca the current roe for the ao will termine what level of sa personnel may perform any duties of combatant nature th include any duties related to training and advising that may engage us personnel in combat activities the environment pl ays big factor in an dvisors role the following paragraphs address what the advisor needs to know to prepare for his role stage of development f5 in situations where the hn government may have been in existence only short the administrative machinery may still be developing the advisor mu st be aware of such situations and not be overly critical in an insurgency the hn government is experiencing major problems for instance the money needed for social and economic programs is mos tly directed toward security needs in an ideal situation the hn government would use this money to cure the societys economic and social ills appendix f f2 fm 305202 2 february 2007 organizational makeup f6 the advisor must know hn sociopoliti cal and military organizations nd their interrelationships to include personalities political moveme nts forces involved and social drives he must impress upon his counterpart the need for an integrat ed civilmilitary effort to defeat the insurgents his counterpart must learn that military actions are subordinate to and s upportive of the economic and so cial actions required to remove the insurgencys causes status of advisor f7 the advisor must fully understand his status in the hn agreements between the uni ted states and the hn spell out his status these agreements may provide full diplomatic immunity or very little immunity without an agreement the advisor is subject to local laws custom s and the jurisdiction of local courts regardless of the diplomatic immunity afforded him the advisor observes local laws appl icable laws of war and army regulations and directives rapport f8 rapport is sympathetic relationship between people that is based on mutual t rust understanding and respect personal dislike animosity and other forms of friction characterize the lack of rapport f9 the need to establish rapport with hn counterpart s is the result of unique military position in which the advisor has direct authority or control over their actions however an advisor can influence or motivate his counterpart to act in certain ways by using the proper advisory techniques f10 effective rapport must exist to gain the control needed to execute the mission the successful advisor establishes rapport that allows influence over the c ounterparts actions despite the absence of formal authority f11 rapport results when each individual perceives the other as competent mature responsible and compatible working toward common goal if the advi sor can convey this attitude to his hn counterpart longlasting effective rapport will exist techniques f12 an advisor must always remember that he is an advisor and not commander he is not th ere to lead troops f13 having the counterpart select particular coa is only possible if he perceives t he advisor has the professional competence to give sound advice if the c ounterpart does not believe the proposed solution to problem is effective or realistic he will question the advisors competence the advisor must explain to his counterpart why the advice is sound f14 the advisor does not use bribery or coercion si nce results achieved from these actions are only temporary as soon as the payment is made or th force is removed the counterpart has reason to comply in practice these techniques are not effi cient and will not achieve the longterm goal of developing proficiency competence and initiative in the counterpart f15 the advisor must be careful not to bribe or coerce counterpart unintentionally he must be aware that as an american soldier he might have privilege d status in the hn the advisors presence may garner personal benefits for the counterpa rt through his position of having oneonone association with an american conversely the advisor may make counterpa rt afraid of offending to the point of complying with every suggestion the advisor makes f16 in short psychologically pressuring counterpart is not recommended such pressure is used only as last resort since it may irreparably damage the relationship between the advisor and his counterpart however psychologically pressu ring the hn counterpart may sometimes be successful forms of psychological pressure may range from the obvious to the subtle the advisor never applies direct threats pressure or intimidation on his counterpart indirect psychological pressure may be applied by taking an advisor techniques 2 february 2007 fm 305202 f3 issue up the chain of command to higher us commander the us commander can then bring his counterpart to force the subordinate counterpart to comply psychological pressure may obta in quick results but have very negative side effects the counterpart will feel alienated and possibly hostile if the advisor uses such techniques offers of payment in the form of valuables may cause him to become resentful of the obvious control being exerted over him f17 advising works both ways the advisor sets an example for the counterpart by asking his advice the advisor must realize that the counterpart is the expert in his country and that he can learn much from him f18 the advisor must avoid giving the counterpart the impression that status reports and adminis trative requirements are the most important items such an impression may cause the c ounterpart to become aloof because it may be difficult and timeconsuming for him to get this information the advisor must tre at his counterpart as an equal he must so give the respect he himself expect s to receive he must take care not to make this fellow soldier feel like an errand boy f19 the advisor transacts important business directly w ith his counterpart to ensure full understanding of difficult subjects he uses the soft appr oach to request official information f20 the advisor does not present too many subjects at one time or unnecessarily prolong the dis cussion of one subject the advisor schedules another conference later if needed f21 the advisor corrects the most impor tant deficiencies first upon hi s arrival in the ao he will find many matters in need of immediate corrective action he avoids telling his counterpart that everything is all wrong rather he looks for the good systems and policie s and praises his counterpa rt on his successes at this point the counterpart will normally point out deficiencies that need correction as his idea and joint problemsolving process can begin in some cases it may take month or more to sell one idea f22 when making recommendations the advisor phrases them in way th at will not impose his will on the hn commanders decisions the advisor leaves enough room for his counterpart to exercise hi s prerogative one of his counterparts greatest fears is that his troops will see him as dependent upon his advisor the advisor carefully choos time and place to offer advice f23 during combat operations the advisor advises the commander but never usurps his command or authority the amount of advising during combat operations is small the advisor does most of his advising while preparing for combat he bases his dvice on his observations or those of his subordinates during past operations he holds private critique with the commander upon completion of an operation f24 the advisor must not be afraid to advise agains t bad decision he does it tactfully however he acts as staff member who recommends change of action to an american commander he respe cts and with whom he works daily f25 the advisor approaches the subject under discussi on from different directions and with different words to make sure the advice given is clearly unde rstood he does not accept yes answer at its face value yes may mean the person understands but does not necessarily accept the suggestion it may also be used to cover lack of understanding f26 the advisor always exercises patience in dealing w ith counterpart he never expects job to be done at the snap of finger and he does not snap finger f27 the advisor cannot accept information from his counterpart in blind fa ith he checks it discreetly and diplomatically but he must check it f28 after the advisor plants an idea he lets his counterpart take credit for it as if it were his ow n idea f29 advisors are transients the advisor tries to learn what the previous advisor had tried and has or has not accomplished he asks him for hi s files and thoroughly debriefs him to prevent reinventing the wheel the advisor keeps an open mind and judges matters himself f30 the advisor starts preparing folder about the advisory area and duties as soon as possible he maintains worksheettype folder during the tour to better unders tand the job followon advisors will have complete file to assist them in completing projects appendix f f4 fm 305202 2 february 2007 f31 the advisor does not hesitate to make onthespot corrections he must be extremely ta ctful above all he does not make the person he corrects lose f ace in front of his peers or subordinates embarrassing the counterpart in most cultures can cause serious loss of rapport and possible mission fail ure the advisor respects the almost universal custom and sire of saving face f32 an advisor must never make promises he cannot or must not carry out he never pledges us assets unless he has the authority and capability to deliver them f33 once advisors are committed their activities should be exploited their successful integration into the hn society their respect for local customs and mores and their involvement wi th ca projects are constantly brought to light in formulating realistic policy for the use of advisors the commande r must carefully gauge the psychological clim ate of the hn and the united states personal qualities f34 advisors must rely on their abilities to sell the most indefinite commoditythemselves the traits of an advisor encompass all the traits of leadership plus the ab ility to adapt to his environment this environment changes with the assignment area to sell himself the advisor mu st prove his value and present favorable personality in the eyes of his c ounterpart this selling occurs in time by gradually demonstrating his capabilities in an unassuming but firm manne r f35 the advisor avoids rushing personal acceptance by the counterpart overselling himself will arouse suspicion and delay acceptance time spent developing healthy relationship will pay large dividends later f36 an advisor must be extremely flexible patient and willing to ad mit mistakes he must persevere in providing sound advice he must also be diplomat of the highest caliber and possess an unusual amount of tact an advisor must be honest he must ma intain high moral standards and be understanding and sincere he must present good military appearance st ay in good physical condition and lead by example f37 the advisor must know thoroughly the organization quipment and tactics of the unit he advises he must be professional and proficient he must dem onstrate an awareness of his counterparts problems f38 the advisor must be positive but not dogmatic in hi s approach to any subject if however he is not sure of the subject matter he says so and takes the steps to obtain the correct inform ation he does not try to bluff his way through problem f39 persistence balanced with patience is favorable trait of an advisor if he discovers problem he tries to solve it he recommends the proper measures to take and then follows through patience is of utmost importance he continually brings the matter to his counterparts atte ntion until he sells him on taking the measures to solve the problems or correct the deficie ncy ultimately the goal is to advise his counterpart in such way that he takes the desi red action feeling that it was through his own initiative rather than the advisors f40 successful advisor must have subject knowledge the ability to monstrate his capabilities in an unassuming but convincing manner and the clear indica tion of his desire to get along with counterparts and other associates common sense is possibly the greates t asset of the successful advisor ultimately this uncommon commodity separates the effective adviso r from the ineffective one with common sense everything is possible without it failure can be expected advisory goals f41 the advisor emphasizes inplace training when the its return to garrison focus on battle drills and sops twentyfivemeter firing ranges are ideal to conduct marksmanship training zero reduc ed range qualification night firing and instinctive firing techniques f42 the advisor spends maximum time with the unit so the troops get to know and trust him he talks to and gets to know the troops not just the unit leaders he gets excellent feedback in the common soldiers candid comments such comments often reflect troop morale and operational effectiveness he stays abreast of what is going on in the unit he also st ays in close contact with the commander and staff advisor techniques 2 february 2007 fm 305202 f5 f43 the advisor encourages frequent command inspections by the commander in some hns this act ion is new concept or an uncommon practice many hn commanders are reluctant to inspect they rely solely on correspondence and reports to evaluate unit effectiveness f44 the advisor continually stresses the obvious advantages of good milita rycivilian relations to avoid the idea of military arrogance wh ich easily irritates the civilian popul ace the development of proper soldiercivilian relationship is critical factor in idad and in coin improper behavi or by soldiers toward civilians must be immediately corrected f45 the advisor constantly strives to raise the hn units standards to t he level needed to complete the mission he guards against lowering his standards but realizes most hn units needing advice may not have the logistic educational or nutritional base to perform to us standards and in that sense may not be expected to meet us standards f46 the advisor keeps training standards high enough so that the unit is prepared for combat at all mes he does not use training time for housekeeping matters f47 the advisor stresses human rights and the conseque nces of mistreating suspects and prisoners the advisor constantly promotes unit esprit corps to stain the unit in the face of difficulties the advisor persuades the hn

advisor establishes and mainta ins rapport more easily by drinking in moderation and eating with counterparts iaw cultura lly acceptable rules refusal to accep t their drink and food is often considered an insult f49 the advisor does not become discouraged ll advice will not be accepted some will be implemented later f50 the advisor cannot forget that careless word or action can cost the united states dearly in good will and cooperation that may have been established with great effort and at cons iderable cost the advisor does not criticize hn policy in front of hn personnel it is the advisors obligation to support the incumbent government just as he does his own this obligation is us national policy f51 the advisor studies his counterpa rt to determine his personality and background he makes every effort to establish and maintain friendly relationships he learns something about his counterparts personal life and demonstrates an interest in his likes and dislikes f52 he sets good example in dress posture and personal conduct and in professional knowledge and competence he emphasizes the importance of doing things on time by demons trating punctuality many cultures have very casual attitude toward time he realizes howev er that he will never change their culture but may succeed in modify ing their behavior to meet mu tually recognized mission needs f53 he develops sense of responsibility toward the unit he advises to the degree that he senses personal fulfillment for job well done he avoids the pitfall of becoming so involved with the unit that he cannot readily recognize failures f54 the advisor accepts invitations to dinners cocktail parties and ceremonies he engages in cordial social conversation before discussing business matters he only discusses business ma tters when appropriate f55 the advisor recognizes and observes military courte sy and local customs and courtesies when in doubt he leans toward the polite the advisor does not

2007 fm 305202 g1 appendix g intelligence operations intelligence is an integral part of fid opera tions intelligence is fourphase cyclical process order of battle ob intelligence occurs in two phases and requires more detailed intelligence at the lower echelons role of intelligence g1 the primary duty of intelligence personnel engaged in fid is to produce inte lligence to prevent or defeat lawlessness or insurgency the sf unit must be ready to train advise and assist hn personnel in intelligence operations intelligence pe rsonnel must collect information and produce intelligence on almost all aspects of the fid environment when they know that insurgents terrorists or common crim inals receive aid from an external power intelligence personnel seek information on the external powers role in the insurgency they need information not only on th armed insurgents but so on their infrastructure organizations and their relations hips with the populace these rela tionships make the populace most lucrative source of information g2 sound collection program and proper use of the various collection agencies and information sources will result in very heavy volume of information flowing into the intelligence production element because of the insurgent environm ent politics and military tactic s intelligence personnel can meet intelligence requirements only by reporting minute details on great variety of subject areas each detail may appear unrelated to others and insignificant by itself however these details whe n mapped and chronologically recorded over long periods and analyzed with other reported details may lead to definitive and predictable patterns of insurgent activity g3 the insurgent recognizes the shortc omings in his military posture therefore he must minimize the weaknesses inherent in using and supporting isolat ed unsophisticated forces that use ponderous and primitive communications and logistics systems he uses the weather terra in and populace employing secrecy surprise and simplicity pl ans and actions these unsophisticated forces will carry out must be simple comprehensive and repetitive therefore the so lution to problem is system that as whole is complex but in part is independent having simple logical and uniform characteristics intelligence requirements g4 accurate detailed and timely in telligence is vital to successful fid operations this dependence on intelligence and ci is greater in fi d operations than in conventional ope rations because of the differences addressed below foreign internal defense operations g5 in fid operations the targets are elements of the populace ʊeither civilian supporters or members of the insurgency the differences be tween supporters and members are usually illdefined complete awareness and intimate knowledge of the environmen t is essential to conducting current intelligence operations the basic nature of the internal security probl em requires an intensive initial intelligence effort to pinpoint the roots of subversion conventional operations g6 in conventional operations force may succeed in capturing military objective by attacking with overwhelming strength force can sometimes attain success in these situati ons without timely and appendix g g2 fm 305202 2 february 2007 detailed intelligence such success is not the case in fid th insurgents seldom hold terrain they will not overtly commit themselves except when cornered or wh the odds heavily favor their chances of winning most importantly their base of operations is in th populace itself the insurgen ts therefore cannot be easily detected and overwhelmed insu rgents require close scrutiny delicate and discriminating analysis and aggressive and accu rate countermeasures g7 the intelligence required is of the type quantity and quality that z provides goals for daily or major operations intelligence that cates guerrillas for tactical counterguerrilla operations z enables hn forces to retain or regain the initiative z enables hn forces to put continuous and increasing pressure on insurgent security the intelligence cycle g8 intelligence operations follow continuous four phase process known as the intelligence cycle figure g1 the intelligence cycle is oriented to the commande rs mission supervising and planning are inherent in all phases of the cy cle even though the four phases ta ke place in sequence intelligence analysts perform all concurrently while intelligence analysts proc ess available information the intelligence staff collects additional information plann ing and directing the collection effort to meet new demands the intelligence staff disseminates the inte lligence as soon as it is available or needed figure g1 the intelligence cycle directing g9 the hn commander through his senior intelligence offi cer sio directs the intelligence effort the sio supervises collection management before the operation and guides the effective use of collection assets during the operation he develops and maintains database s through research and intelligence preparation of the battlefield ipb ipb coupled with the available database provi des basis for situation and target development the ipb and database provide way to pro ject battlefield events and activities in the ao and to predict coas by comparing these projections with act ual events and activities as they occur the sio can provide the commander with timely complete and accurate intelligence g10 intelligence agencies from national level down constantly velop and maintain intelligence databases the sio accesses these databases to prepar initial intelligence estimates and to analyze the ao showing probable coas the sio bases this analysis on the mission requirements and th commanders intelligence operations 2 february 2007 fm 305202 g3 pirs intelligence analysts integrate the resulting intelligenc estimate with other staff estimates and present them to the commander the commander can then decide what actions he must take to perform the mission collecting g11 the commander and his s2 and s3 begin the coll ection effort by determining requirements and establishing their priorities they may base their requirements on mission enemy terrain and weather troops and support availabletime available mett t and the commanders planning guidance g12 pirs are the basis for intelligence operations the commander persona lly approves them pirs are those intelligence requirements for which commander has an anti cipated and stated priority in his task planning and decision making in essence the sio organizes his pirs and irs as follows z he subdivides strategic pirs and irs into military political econom ic psychological and social categories focusing on the national or international level z he subdivides operational pirs and irs into military psychologi cal and social categories focusing on the provincial or subnational level z he subdivides tactical pirs and irs into milita ry psychological and social categories focusing on the local level g13 within each of the above categories the sio identifies the specific di scipline or discip lines that can be best used to collect needed in formation the disciplines include z human intelligence humint z signals intelligence sigint z imagery intelligence imint z technical intelligence techint z measurement and signature intelligence masint z opensource intelligence osint note of these disciplines humint sigint and imint are usually of greatest use to sf g14 specific information require ments sirs are the specific items of information needed to satisfy pirs and irs they are the basis for collection operations g15 intelligence analysts advise the sio on the pi rs and irs they analyze mettt and the commanders guidance and concept of the operation to dete rmine needed information or intelligence they review the existing database to identify available in formation and information to be acquired they pass requirements for new information to the collection management and dissemination cmd section as collection requirements g16 based on requirements the cmd section manages the collection effort the section develops collection plan keyed to the mettt the commanders c oncept of the operation and the current situation the section continuously updates the collection plan g17 in fid operations the problem is to identify and th locate the enemy as frequently stated in an insurgency the front is everywhere even after identifying and establishing operation patt erns of members of the underground the local police or security force must locate the enemy before they can capture them there are essentially three methods of obtaining contact intelligence z patrols after developing some knowledge of the behavioral patterns of the underground or guerrillas from study of their past movements patrols or pol ice squads can search for physical evidence tracks and campsites if there is c onsistent pattern patrols can be selectively dispatched based on anticipated movement of the insurgents z forced contacts when the guerrillas are separated from the people their normal underground supply channels are cut off this separation for ces the guerrillas into the open to contact their underground and auxiliary elements after id entifying members of the underground and the appendix g g4 fm 305202 2 february 2007 auxiliary the police can arrest them the guerrillas will then have to visit the remaining members of the underground and auxiliary more often to get required support z informants using informants is reliable and quick means of obtaining specific data required in contact intelligence through process designed to protect their iden tity informants pass information about movements pos itions and activities of the insu rgents almost immediately the local security force receives this information its commander should be authorized to take immediate action on his own authority with requirement to seek approval from higher authorities g18 intelligence personnel must consider the paramete rs within which revolutionary movement operates frequently they establish centralized intelligencep rocessing center to collect and coordinate the amount of information require d to make longrange intelligence estimates longrange intelligence focuses on the stable factors existing in an insurgency for example various demographic factors ethnic racial social economic religious and political characteristics of the area in which the underground movement takes place are useful in identifying th members of the underground information about the underground organization at national district nd local levels is basic in fid operations g19 collection of specific shortrange intelligence bout the rapidly changing variables of local situation is critical intelligence personnel must gath er information on members of the underground their movements and their methods biographies and photos of suspected underground members detailed information on their homes families education work history and ssociates are important features of shortrange intelligence g20 destroying its tactical units is not enough to defeat the enemy forces must neut ralize the insurgents underground cells or infrastructure first because the infra structure is his main sour ce of tactical intelligence and political control eliminating the infrastructure within an area achieves two goals it ensures government control of the area and cuts off the enem ys main source of intellig ence an intelligence and operations command center is needed at district or province level this organization become s the nerve center for operations against the insu rgent infrastructure information on insurgent infrastructure targets should come from such sources as the national police and other established intelligence nets agents and individuals informants g21 security forces can induce individuals among the general populace to become informants security forces use various motives civicmindedness patrio tism fear punishment avoi dance gratitude revenge or jealousy and financial rewards as persuasive arguments they use the assurance of protection from reprisal as major inducement security forces must maintain the informants anonymity and must conceal the transfer of information from the source to the security agent the security agen t and the informant may prearrange signals to coincide with everyday behavior g22 surveillance the covert observation of persons and places is principa l method of gaining and confirming intelligence information surveillance technique s naturally vary with the requirements of different situations the basic pr ocedures include mechanical observation wiretaps or concealed microphones observation from fi xed locations and physical surveillance of subjects g23 whenever suspect is apprehended during an ope ration hasty interrogationtactical questioning takes place to gain immediate information that could be of tactical valu the most frequently used method for gathering information map studies and aerial observation however is normally unsuccessful m ost pws cannot read map when pws are taken on visual reconnaissance flight it is usuall their first flight and they cannot associate an aerial view with what they saw on the ground g24 the most successful interrogation method consists of map study that is based on rrain information received from the detainee the interrogator first asks the detainee what the suns direction was when he left the base camp from this information he can determine general direction t he interrogator then asks the detainee how long it took him to walk to the point of his capture j udging the terrain and the detainees health the interrogator can determine g eneral radius in which the base camp can be found he can use an overlay for this purpose he then asks the detainee to identify significant terrain features he saw on each day of his journey ri vers open areas hills rice paddies and swamps as intelligence operations 2 february 2007 fm 305202 g5 the detainee speaks and his memory is jogged the interrogator finds these t errain features on current map and gradually plots the detainees route to finally locate the base camp g25 if the interrogator is unable to speak the detainees language he interrogates through an inte rpreter who received briefing beforehand recorder may also assist him if the interrogator is not familiar with the area personnel who are familiar with the area brief him before th interrogation and then join the interrogation team the recorder allows the interroga tor more freeflowing interrogation the recorder also lets knowledgeable interpreter elaborate on points the detainee has mentioned wit hout the interrogator interrupting the continuity established during given sequence the interpre ter can also question certain inaccuracies keeping pressure on the subject the interpre ter and the interrogator must be well trained to work as team the interpreter has to be familiar wi th the interrogation procedures his preinterrogation briefings must include information on the detainees health the circumst ances resulting in his detention and the specific information requi red successful interrogation is contingent upon continuity and welltrained interpreter tape reco rder or recorder taking notes enhances continuity by freeing the interrogator from timeconsuming administrative tasks processing g26 processing is the step in the intelligence cycle through which info rmation becomes intelligence it consists of recording evaluating integrating and interpreting certain factors are unique to the internal defense environment intelligence analysts must apply these fac tors to determine insurgent capabilities and coas and provide the intelligence n eeded for all facets of fid operati ons an oftenove rlooked technique of determining what the insurgents are doing to influence the population can be found in opensource media analysts should make concerted effort to review and capture any and all insurgent messages found on the internet television ra dio broadcast and newspapers as well as signs placed on walls of buildings in builtup areas once coll ected these messages should be track ed and measured against future actions of the insurgents and population these ssages support understanding of the insurgents thought process that can be considered in planning counterinsurgent action recording g27 like conventional tactical situations fid opera tions require large amounts of information on continuous basis intelligence analysts promptly compare this informa tion with existing information and intelligence to determine its significance to large degree th extent of the recording effort will depend upon the insurgent activity in the area g28 depending on the echelon of responsib ility the state of insurgent activ ity in the area and the degree of knowledge of the enemy the cu rrent intelligence graphic requires at least two annotated maps the incident map and the insurgent situation map sitmap each of these recording devices norm ally is transparent overlay covering largescale topographic map of the area the incident map provides historic cumulative information on insurgent activity trends or patte rns properly maintained entries let the intelligence analyst make judgments about z the nature and location of insurgent targets z the relative intensity of insurgent interest in specific areas z insurgent control over or support from the population z potential areas of insurgent operations g29 the insurgent sitmap represents intelligence much of the sitm ap is built around the information recorded on the incident map inte lligence analysts will find it difficult to pinpoint insurgent installations and dispositions with the same degree of confidence as in conventional tactical situation the insurgents can displace on short notice making report outdate d before it can be confirmed the sitmap can graphically substantiate the trends or patterns deri ved from the incident map which improves the economy and effectiveness of the collection effort the sitm ap provides ready guide for briefing the commander the civil authorities or other interested parties g30 other annotated maps include the trap map and personalities and contact maps the trap map is used if the insurgent is capable of sabotage or terrorist action it will portray particularly attractive target appendix g g6 fm 305202 2 february 2007 locations for insurgent sabotage or terrorism insurgent targets could be road and railroad bridges communications centers theaters and assembly halls and places where the terrain favors ambushes and raids these areas are plainly marked on this map directing attention to possible insurgent access and escape routes g31 initial intelligence about th insurgent situation may be information on locations and activities of individual agents espionage agitation organization nd liaison the personalities and contacts map records the appearances movements meetings and di sappearances of these agen ts largescale city street map or town plan is required to track the individuals dated symbols indicate obs ervations and incidents depending on the amount of insurgent activity intelligence analysts can combine this map with the incident map g32 the intelligence worksheet and the annotated maps serve to isolate problem areas and form ties between items of information and intelligence collected in t he early phase of an insurgency the enemy is building his own organization his organizational procedu res and tactics will therefore be unique the intelligence analyst must study personalities and analyze inc idents g33 the insurgency analysis worksheet helps identify information and i ntelligence needed to satisfy pirs and irs it provides guide for analysis of an environment for operations short of war g34 the hot file is the most important working file it includes all ava ilable material pertaining to an incident or groups of possibly related incidents of curre nt interest this file contains material on persons agents or suspects or places likely to be involved in insurgency activity g35 if propaganda is major part of the insurgent ffort in the area current propaganda and psyop file should contain items pertai ning to the grievances insurgen ts are exploiting such as z literature z background material z propaganda speeches z analyses of local grievances g36 each insurgent personality has local personality and organ ization file if the local police force carries out surveillance they can transfer basic identifying and biog raphical information from dossiers to card file this card file helps train friendly rveillants to recognize key personalities on sight the organization section of this file contains information on z the history and activities of the fronts for the insurgent organiza tion z other subversive or suspected groups and their officers z overlapping directorates of membership in and liaison among insurgent fronts g37 the area study files contain uptodate and pertinent data on the z geography z hydrography z climate z political and economic characteristics z civil populace z military and paramilitary forces z resistance organization z targets z effects of the abovelisted characteristics g38 resource file contains all material of importance but not of immediate value it may include inactive incident files inactive personality and organization f iles and photography intelligence operations 2 february 2007 fm 305202 g7 evaluation g39 evaluation is the examination of information to determine its i ntelligence value the intelligence analysts knowledge and judgment play major role in evaluating information therefore he must know the theory of insurgency in considering if fact or event is at ll possible he must realize that certain events are possible although they have not previously occurred and have been thought unlikely to occur initially intelligence production starts with unconfirmed information th at is subsequently supported confirmed or denied by additional and related information as the intelligence analyst obtains more information the insurgent situation capabilities and proba ble coas become increasingly clear integration g40 evaluated information becomes intelligence only after intelli gence analysts have integrated it with other information and interpreted it to determine its significance integration involves c ombining selected data to form pattern that will have meaning and establish basi s for interpretation in his search for related information the intelligence analyst checks the incid ent file the friendly and suspect personality files and the organizational file after obtaining all related items of information from the intelligence files he begins to assemble the available information to form as many logical pictures or hypotheses as possible alternative methods of assembly are an essential prerequisite to any val id interpretation the assembly of information to develop logical hypotheses re quires good judgment and considerable background knowledge in formulating hypotheses the intelligence analyst must avoid limitations resulting from preconceived opinions g41 the intelligence analyst uses the ipb process for intelligen ce production the ipb supports commanders and their staffs in the decisionmaking process the commander directs the ipb effort through the ccir which for the sio and his intelligence analysts include the pirs and irs all other staff elements are active participants in the ipb fm 305102 army special operations forces intelligence and fm 34130 intelligence preparation of the battlefield contain detailed discussions of the ipb process interpretation g42 interpretation is the result of deducing the probabl meaning of new information and determining its implications about future insurgent activities the meaning of the information is determined in rel ation to the insurgent situation and the insurgents probable coas disseminating and using g43 the final step of the intelligence cycle is disseminating an d using the intelligence processed intelligence and combat information are of little value if not livered when needed failure to disseminate this intelligence defeats thorough nd successful collection and processing effort because of ipb the sio produces variety of templates overlays association and event matrixes and flowcha rts appropriate to metttc he provides these products to the hn commander and s3 for approval and guidance as followup the sio provides the correct products promptly to the right consumers he also ensure s these products are adequate for and properly used by them where appropriate the sio must advise and coach nonintelligence personnel in their use he must also use his ipb products to identify gaps in the intelligence database and redirect his collection effort threat analysis g44 threat analysis focuses on the examination of the insurgents nds ways means vulnerabilities centers of gravity and friendly methods for gaining the initiative xploiting success and achieving early victory insurgents are potentially quite vulnerable in some areas the insurgents z are normally outnumbered and outgunned by the security forces although they may have local fire superiority z are deficient in mobility communicati ons medical and l ogistical support appendix g g8 fm 305202 2 february 2007 z are considered illegal by the government in power z lack stable political econom ic and territorial base g45 insurgents are aware of their di fficult situation therefore they must protect and overcome their vulnerabilities they must maintain security while building strength and support they can do this by z developing underground organizations and support systems z infiltrating government or ganizations for intelligence and political purposes z gaining the willing or unwilling support of th populace for intelligence logistics and manpower z establishing remote base areas z using multiple secret routes z using mines and booby traps z using caches g46 the insurgents must gain and maintain the initiative by carrying out actions that distract security forces forcing the security forces to take defens ive posture they also can gain and maintain the initiative by carrying out actions th at weaken the government in power they weaken the government by attacking its political and economic infrastructure through acts of terror military attacks against economic targets and the skillful use of propaganda g47 security is essential for the in surgents success because it provide s them with the time to make longterm strategy work to do so they must protect their vulnerabilitie s and weaknesses and maintain the ability to exercise the initiative security is the insurgents true center of gravity the government must use intelligence to expose vulnerabilities regain the initiative and dest roy the insurgencydeveloped and intelligenceoriented strategy th hn forces must focus their efforts on planni ng and conducting operations that reduce the insurgents freedom of action and attac k the insurgents vulnerabilities order of battle intelligence g48 ob is as important in an insurg ency as in conventional combat operations however the intelligence analyst must recognize some differen ces in nomenclature and approach th applicability of the ob factors differs in an insurgency from c onventional operations there will also be differences in application between phase i and phase ii insurgen cy situations the elements of th ob factors are dependent on each other they are closely related and must be considered as whole informa tion on one of the elements will often lead to reevaluation or alteration of info rmation previously receive d on another element the normal practice of developing and maintaining ob down to and including two echelons below the intelligence analysts own level of command does not apply to fid the nature of the insurgency and the phased development of its forces require much more detailed ob and pertain to much lower echelons the following paragraphs address the ob factors and explain their app licability to insurgency situations composition g49 in some insurgent movements m ilitary force is only one of seve ral instruments through which the insurgents seek power development of military force has the lowes t priority during the early stages of an insurgency as long as the party core and civil organi zations are established and move effectively toward the goal of the insurgency the military arm may either be dorman t or simply exist in cadre form until needed as support arm phase i considerations g50 rather than collecting information on the identification and org anization of specific insurgent units the intelligence personnel concentrate on the internal workings of insu rgent activity groups knowledge of their composition can be key to the entire planned course of the insurgency tails of composition may include the appearance of new organizations the re lative amount of enemy effort in rural and urban operations the internal c2 chain and the organization of the insurgent groups intelligence operations 2 february 2007 fm 305202 g9 phase ii considerations g51 the concern of the intelligence analyst will be to determine the composition of the insurgent combat units including their organization and c2 the gree of sophistication encountered indicates other factors training logistics and st rength armed platoons or small terrori st cells indicate the overt military portion of the insurgency plan is just beginning armed battalions and large urban terrorist groups indicat there is serious menace to the current government political structures g52 tightly disciplined party organization formally structured to parallel the existi ng government hierarchy may be found at the center of some insurgent movements in most instances this organizational structure will consist of committed organizations at the v illage district province and national levels within major divisions and sections of an insurgent military hq totally distinct but parallel command channels exist there are military chains of command and politi cal channels of control the party ensures complete domination over the military structure by using its own parallel organization the party dominates through political division in an insurgent military hq pa rty cell or group in an insurgent military unit or political military officer combat forces g53 the organization of insurgent combat forces is dependent on the needs the tactics used and the availability of personnel and equipment frequently subordinate elements of insurgent units employ independently the intelligence analys t who receives confirmed report of an insurgent unit operating in his area cannot therefore assume that the parent unit is also present disposition g54 determining the disposition of the insurgents i nvolves locating their operational training and supply bases locs and areas of political control the intelligence analyst can arrive at the insurgents potential dispositions by developing patterns of activity these patterns originate from map study and know ledge of insurgent tactics insurgent base areas for instance are normally n ear areas the insurgents control politically thereby providing an early warning system by plotting ins urgent sightings and combining this information with weather conditions time factors deta iled investigation of insurgent incidents and aars the intelligence analyst can select possible enemy dispositi ons and possible areas of tactical deployment these areas while appearing to be under the control of internal defense forces may be under the political control of the insurgents phase i considerations g55 this phase considers the location deployment and movements of insurgent organizations or personnel the insurgents strength and tactics may be revealed to some extent by discovering whether they concentrate their effort in few places or di sperse throughout the target nation if they initially concentrated their effort in one city or in rural area then the spread of the insurg ent organization is key to how long they have been operationa l and how successful they have been phase ii considerations g56 how the insurgent forces are depl oyed can indicate whether the enem is making widespread show of strength with units scattered about the country or is concentrating his forces around few key targets the deployment can also show whether the enemy is going to conce ntrate on such activities as interdicting transportation or actively seeki ng battle with government forces strength g57 intelligence analysts must think of the strength of the insurgen t forces in terms of the combat forces political cadres and popular support the intelligence analyst can apply conventional methods of strength appendix g g10 fm 305202 2 february 2007 computation to determine insurgent strength the insurgents wi ll try to have their strengths overestimated by the hn security elements to give this false impressio n the insurgents will rapidly move their units and use multiple designations for single element th intelligence analyst view s reports from the populace on insurgent strengths with caution and stresses the impor tance of actual counts of enemy personnel he finds it more difficult to determine the popular support for the insurgents although guide may be th percentage of an area under government control as oppos ed to the percentage under insurgent control useful indicator of the extent of insurgent political control is the willingness of the populace to report information on the insurgents phase i considerations g58 the cadre that organizes and activates the movement usually consists of highly trained aggressive professionals who exercise an influence out of proportion to th eir actual numbers the intelligence analysts concern is with the number of units in exis tence in this phase the intelligence analyst identifies and evaluates new groups and organizations that have ppeared in the nation and the changes in the size of existing groups phase ii considerations g59 the actual number of men available to the insurg ency now assumes the im portance it lacked to some degree in phase i by knowing the amount of weapons and equipment the insurgents have the intelligence analyst can estimate their capabilities against friendly forces the degree of popular support for the insurgents will be manifested in such areas as recruiting for the ir forces tactics g60 tactics include enemy doctrine and the conduct of operations according to that doctrine insurgent forces may be more flexible in their application of doctrine t han regular military organizations the friendly forces must know and understand the doctrine that guides the insurgents if the are to counter enemy efforts effectively the choice and application of insurgent tactics is an appraisal of friendly and insurgent strengths insurgent tactics will involve political m ilitary psychological and economic considerations all closely integrated speed surprise and hea vy application of firepower and mobility describe military tactics phase i considerations g61 an absence of strictly military operations nd an emphasis on subvers ion and organizational development describe this phase although instances of terrorism may begin to occur in the l atter stages of phase i military activity is usually limited to recruiting and estab lishment of military cadres phase ii considerations g62 an increased emphasis on the study and evaluation of ins urgent military tactics is required tactics during this phase are usually limited to ambushes raids sabotag and terrorism these activities provide the insurgent with supplies experience and sel fconfidence while eroding friendly morale and reducing friendly economic and military capabilities training g63 insurgent training will be closely related to the tactics the use and will include vigorous political indoctrination the combat forces and people with in an area under the insurg ents political domination receive training the insurgents carefully plan and train for i ndividual operations and phases of movements intelligence operations 2 february 2007 fm 305202 g11 phase i considerations g64 the insurgents train and indoc trinate their cadre and newly accepted or recruited indigenous personnel during this phase trai ning consists of political indoc trination along with propaganda communications and intelligence coll ection techniques some training normally takes place in another country and change in the number nd type of personnel traveling to that country may indicate this fact phase ii considerations g65 intelligence analysts devote much attention to z locating training camps and areas z identifying training cadres z interdicting the movement of insurgents to and from outofcountry training areas logistics g66 in an insurgency as in conventional warfare the insurgents effectiveness is very much dependent on their logistical support in an insurgencys early stages the requi rements for military equipment and supplies are less than in later stages accurate intelligence of the insurgents sources and availability of supplies and equipment is essential to determine their capabi lity to maintain and expand the insurgency phase i considerations g67 two particular items have always been essential to the phase i insurgentsmoney and printing press if they are highly successful in establishing and motivating their power base the may never really have need for the usual items of milita ry supply money often co mes from abroad but bank robberies unusual or excessive fund drives payroll deduction requests or sudden affluence among suspect government officials are cause for suspicion equipm ent to produce and disseminate propaganda printing presses and radio sets is of special nature and the friendly government can easily control its purchase and use phase ii considerations g68 in this phase logistics is larger and more elaborate requirement for the insurgents they must now get store transport and maintain weapons amm unition explosives signal equipment and medical supplies they now need more people to operate th logistics system insurgent supply caches or supply lines become critical concerns to friendly forces friendly forces must control the borders and coastlines to detect or deter the movement of supplies friendly forces must als use aerial surveillance over remote areas or areas the insurgents use effectiveness g69 effectiveness describes the qualitative ability of the insurgen ts to achieve their political or military purposes the insurgents effectiveness can be judged by the type and number of operations they are able to perform phase i considerations g70 in phase i the term combat effectiveness usually does not apply although the ins urgents use words like struggle and front the words do not denot the use of armed forces usually there will be overt indications of the effectiveness of insurgent operations intelligence analysts may gather information on these operations through careful observation of organi zations movements and elections at all levels penetration of these activities by government agents is very desirable nd can make significant contribution to the ob picture appendix g g12 fm 305202 2 february 2007 phase ii considerations g71 the effectiveness factor now expands to include the combat effici ency of insurgent military forces by carefully evaluating the other ob factors and taking note of actu combat experience an intelligence analyst can evaluate the insurgents combat effectiveness or lack thereof the intelligence analyst can determine insurgents strengths and weaknesses and from this info rmation calculate their capability to follow various coas personalities g72 personalities are not listed as separate ob factor in conventional situation they are of greater importance in an insurgency and as ch are listed as separate factor phase i considerations g73 in phase i personalities are an extremely important factor duri ng this phase when the insurgency is just beginning to organize and function and trying to spread its influence the loss of comparati vely small number of men can practically destroy or set back its progress the apprehension compromise or exposure of its leaders may destroy the insurgency knowing who the insurgent leaders are ca n also furnish valuable indication of how insurgents train and how effective t he overall effort will be phase ii considerations g74 as in phase i personalities are important enough to warrant their consideration as separate factor many insurgent units will use th eir commanders name rather th an conventional designation electronic technical data g75 in the early stages of ob intelligence there is often lack of uni form communications procedures this fact prevents the developmen t of an extensive electronic techni cal database vhf citizens band sets may play role in early terrorist operations equipment available to th insurgents will range from the most primitive to the most modern even equipment not generally avai lable in the armed forces of major world powers such as spread spectrum and frequency hoppers can be easily obtained phase i considerations g76 the propaganda needs may result in insurgent sponsored mediumfrequency or commercial radio am broadcasts transmitters may be located outside national boundaries or in remote inaccessible areas these broadcasts frequently use code words to co mmand and control insurgent operations later there may be some increased use of vhf transmissions and more organized communications procedures the standardization of communications practices reflects communications training phase ii considerations g77 much more extensive use of communications equipment characte rizes this phase insurgents will capture equipment from government sources purchase or steal it from commercial sources have externa l sponsors who provide it or obtain locally manufactured equipment communication procedures may reflect an external sponsors doctrine and training practices miscellaneous g78 other items contribute to knowledge of the insurgents such as goals and methods the followi ng paragraphs discuss these items intelligence operations 2 february 2007 fm 305202 g13 phase i considerations g79 this category can include z historical studies of people and parties involved in the insurgency z code names or numbers z any other information that does not fit under the other eleven categories phase ii considerations g80 several miscellaneous items now become vital adjunc ts to the other factors weapons insignia code names and numbers and types and colors of uniforms nd flags help identify enem units they also help identify the source of outside aid the source of weapons and equipment smuggled into or purchased in the target nations and the morale and effec tiveness of the insu rgent armed forces note the following points must be remembered when applying the ob factors to an insurgency z the insurgents methods may change but their principles do not z the previously discussed ob factors are closely interrelated and cannot be analyze d separately z when an insurgency escalates to phase ii situation the ob effort must be expanded considerably the enemy combat units must now be considered in addition to the various phase i organizations and activities that will still b active special intelligencegathering operations g81 alternative intelligence gathering techniques and sources such as doppelganger or pseudo operations can be tried and used when it is hard to obtain information from the civilian populace these pseudo units are usually made up of exguerrilla andor security force personnel posing as insurgents they circulate among the civilian populace and in some cases infiltrate guerrilla units to gather information on guerrilla movements and support infrastructure g82 to persuade insurgents to switch allegiance and serve with th security forces requires much time and effort properly screened prospective candidates must choose between serving with the hn security forces and facing prosecution under hn law for terrorist crimes g83 government security force units and teams of varying size conduct infiltr ation operations against underground and guerrilla forces they have been especially effective in getting information on underground security and communicati ons systems the nature and extent of civilian support and underground liaison underground supply methods and possible collusion between local government officials and the underground before such unit can be properly trained and disguised however intelligence analysts must gather much information about the ppearance mannerisms and security procedures of enemy units most of this information comes from defectors or reindoctrinated prisoners defectors also make excellent instructors and guides for an i nfiltrating unit in using disguised team the selected men should be trained oriented and di sguised to look and act like authentic underground or guerrilla units in addition to acquiring valuable information t he infiltrating units can demoralize the insurgents to the extent that they become overly suspicious and d istrustful of their own units insurgent counterintelligence and security g84 since coin is the restoration of internal security in the ao it demands vigorous and coordinated coin effort insurgents generate broad ci and secur ity programs to thwart government penetrations they set up security and early warning nets in rural and urban areas these systems ar composed of carefully recruited individuals chosen primarily because their work places them n ear sensitive insurgent installations typically lookouts may be newspaper vendors build ing janitors young students farmers small shopkeepers or fishermen appendix g g14 fm 305202 2 february 2007 g85 these lookouts report possible government raids or other operations to liaison men chosen because they can travel without attracting notice liaison men are often letter carriers taxi drivers or traveling vendors who pass the information to insurgent officials g86 the security and ci wing of th insurgent political organization produces false birth certificates identification papers and travel permits the agents require for trave l jobs and other activities to make it difficult for the police to check the authenticity of forged document the fictitious birthplace listed is often in location that cannot be checked easily identity papers frequen tly list the bearer as peddler freelance writer or artist because these occupations are difficult for the police to ch eck insurgents sometimes avoid the forgery problem by stealing or buying genuine documents from some individual who they then may kill g87 meeting sites are security problem insurgents prefer sites in which the arrival of several persons at about the same time will not attract attention or ar ouse suspicion they favor woods and other secluded areas when they must hold meetings at house or apartment they try to avoid those neighborhoods in which wellknown antigovernment agitators live such areas may be under surveillance they change meeting places frequently when possibl they arrange meetings to coin cide with some outwardly legal proper reason for bringing individuals together they st agger the arrivals and departures family members answer the door guards stay after the meeting to look for incriminating items left behind g88 insurgent groups routinely conduct security checks of members potential members and collaborators normally they do not accept recruit until they have i nvestigated his present and past family life jobs political activities and close associ ates probationary period follows if they urgently need person with special skills the insurgent group may bring in person but assign hi m or her very limited tasks until the investigation is completed g89 insurgent groups test clandestine agents regularly the insurgent security personnel may without warning summon an individual to test his reaction if he is guilt of disloyalty he may sense possible exposure and desert insurgent security personnel may keep suspect ignorant of change in meeting place if government security forces show up at the original site the insurg ent organization knows the suspect is government informant strict conformance with security procedures is required cell members are subject to punishment if they do not report violations security s ections discover and liquidate hostile agents they spend as much time if not more watching their own personnel as they do the enemy s friendly forces counterintelligence and security g90 the techniques pertaining to friendly clandestine collection operations also apply to covert ci activities the emphasis however is on information of ci interest rat her than intelligence interest but during ci operations information of intelligence intere st may also be obtained and should be passed to interested agencies g91 most of the ci measures used will be overt in nature and aimed at protecting installations units and information and detecting espionage sabotage and s ubversion examples of ci measures to use are z background investigations and records checks of persons in sensitive positions and persons whose loyalty may be questionable z maintenance of files on organizations locations and individuals of ci interest z internal security inspections of installations and units z control of civilian movement w ithin governmentcontrolled areas z identification systems to minimi ze the chance of insurg ents gaining access to installations or moving freely z unannounced searches and raids on suspected meeting places z censorship 2
