december 19 2003 libya announced it would dismantle its weapons of mass destruction wmd programs and open the country to immediate and comprehensive verification inspections libya pledged to eliminate its chemical and nuclear weapons programs subject to international atomic energy agency iaea verification eliminate ballistic missiles with 300 km range or greater and payload of 500 kilograms accept international inspections to fulfill nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt obligations and sign the additional protocol2 further libya would eliminate all chemical weapons stocks and munitions and accede to the chemical weapons convention cwc and allow immediate inspections and monitoring to verify these actions3 since december 2003 libya has also agreed to abide by the missile technology control regime mtcr guidelines and signed the comprehensive test ban treaty 1 this update was prepared with the assistance of andrew demkee research associate 2 the additional protocol infcirc540 gives the international atomic energy agency iaea additional access to information and sites within country for nuclear safeguards purposes the united states has signed but not yet ratified the protocol 3 the white house fact sheet the presidents national security strategy to combat wmd libyas announcement december 19 2003 congressional research service the library of congress crs2 libyas decision likely rested on several factors the burden of 30 years of economic sanctions had significantly limited oil exports and stagnated the libyan economy making the prospect of renewed international investment that would follow renunciation of wmd very attractive further libyas elimination of its wmd programs was necessary condition for normalizing relations with the united states4 the administration has attributed libyas decision to abandon its wmd to president bushs national security strategy some officials claim that iraqs example convinced libya to renounce wmd others point specifically to the interdiction of centrifuge parts used for uranium enrichment in october 2003 still other observers have suggested that libyas wmd programs were not very successful while ending libyas pariah status became particularly important to colonel qadhafi at least two accounts record libyan offers to renounce its wmd programs dating back to 1992 and 19995 prior assessments of wmd programs despite libyas membership in the npt from 1975 and the biological and toxin weapons convention or bwc from 1982 most observers believed libya was pursuing range of wmd programs albeit not entirely successfully the bush administration httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21823 noted in 2003 that we have long been concerned about libyas longstanding efforts to pursue nuclear chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles6 libya continues to deny any bw program but its chemical weapons capability including use of cw against chad in the 1980s and facilities at rabta and tarhuna was well known libyas ballistic missile arsenal was comprised of scud bs 300km 700 kg payload acquired from the former soviet union handful of north korean scudcs 600km 700 kg payload and 500700kmrange missile under development called fatah the fatah program reportedly continued throughout the 1990s although hampered by international sanctions israeli intelligence claimed also that libya had received 1300 kmrange dong missiles from north korea but us intelligence disputed this notion7 2001 national intelligence council assessment stated that libyas missile program depends on foreign support without which the program eventually would grind to halt8 libya signed the international code of conduct against ballistic missile proliferation icoc in november 2002 4 in giving up arms libya hopes to gain

negotiations us and british officials first inspected libyan weapon sites laboratories and military factories in october 20039 this coincided with the interdiction in the italian port of taranto of shipment of uranium enrichment centrifuge equipment ultimately bound for libya initial visits revealed more extensive libyan nuclear activities than previously thought and significant quantities of chemical agent thus far us and british officials apparently have found evidence of an offensive biological weapons program some observers have suggested that each of libyas programs suffered from shortages of parts and technical expertise as result of years of sanctions10 libya has provided significant information about its nuclear chemical and missile programs including data on foreign suppliers in fact libyas revelations about pakistani scientist aq khans nuclear black market dealings have aided iaea inspections of irans nuclear program and helped prompt pakistan to investigate khan httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21823 nuclear program11 many observers over the years discounted libyas nuclear weapons program because of its failure to procure key components and lack of indigenous resources and expertise yet libyas declarations revealed that aq khan seemed to have solved the procurement problem if not the problem of expertise12 in 1997 libya acquired 20 preassembled p1 centrifuges and the components for another 200 libya constructed three different enrichment cascades but only the smallest using 9 centrifuges was completely installed by 2002 in 2000 libya received 2 centrifuges of more advanced design p2 using maraging steel and placed an order for 10000 of those assistance on centrifuge enrichment reportedly came from aq khan former head of pakistans enrichment facility khan reportedly also provided libya with an actual nuclear weapons design which was handed over to iaea inspectors in december 2003 and sealed onsite according to one source the design closely resembles 1960s vintage chinese nuclear warhead13 one report suggested that such warhead would not fit on libyas scudc missiles and that key parts of the weapons design were missing14 libya

with range of 300 kilometers and payload of 500 kilograms or greater in early 2004 libya relinquished 5 north korean scudc missiles which us officials described as an emerging scudc program16 libya hoped to convert its scudb arsenal estimated at between 80 and few hundred into shorterrange defensive purpose missiles and end military trade with north korea17 according to one source in february 2005 libya asked the united states to buy 417 scuds for 2 million each the united states reportedly bought ten for testing18 there is further information on the status of the fatah program libyas

states eliminated the most sensitive aspects of libyas wmd and missile programs first on january 22 2004 nuclear weapons design information was sent to the united states and days later us officials airlifted about 55000 pounds of documents and components from libyas nuclear and ballistic missile programs to oak ridge tennessee nuclear components included several containers of uranium hexafluoride used as feedstock for enrichment 2 p2 centrifuges from pakistans khan research laboratories and additional centrifuge parts equipment and documentation beginning in december 2003 iaea inspectors visited libya to confirm its declarations since then the iaea has had unlimited access to requested locations and has verified the consistency of libyas declarations concerning its uranium conversion program enrichment program and other past nuclearrelated activities libya has applied the additional protocol which it ratified on august 8 2006 on an interim basis since december 2003 in

strictest us sanctions regimes as result of its support of international terrorism25 libyas cooperation in several areas has allowed sanctions to be lifted in september 20 2004 president bush made three determinations about libya that would allow lifting certain sanctions pursuant to the arms export control act aeca and the exportimport bank act of 1945 first he determined that libya received nuclear enrichment equipment material or technology after august 1977 that the continued termination of assistance under section 101 of the aeca would have serious adverse effect on vital us interests

received design information intended for use in the development or manufacture of nuclear explosive devices and that the application of sanctions would have serious adverse effect on vital us interests pursuant to section 102 b of the aeca third he determined that pursuant to section 2 b 4 of the exportimport bank act of 1945 it is in the national interest for the export import bank to guarantee insure or extend credit or participate in the extension of credit in support of us exports to libya26 president bush also rescinded the national emergency with respect to libya and lifted trade travel and commercial restrictions further measures included releasing 13 billion in frozen assets providing opic guarantees and removing restrictions on direct flights between libya and the united states libya was finally removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism on june 29 2006 issues for congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21823 prior to libyas removal from the list of state sponsors of terrorism us assistance in wmd dismantlement was limited to funding provided by the state departments nonproliferation and disarmament fund ndf because such funds are not restricted by limits imposed by other laws since 2004 ndf has committed about 342 million to the wmd disarmament process in libya including funds for removal of equipment and material 5 million retraining of former wmd scientists and personnel 25 million export control assistance 1 million securing radiological sources 7 million and destroying chemical weapons and agents 25 million state department officials estimate that about 20 million more will be required to help libya destroy the rest of its chemical stockpile senator lugar has stated that the ndf does not have the size scope or experience to do dismantlement operations to employ nuclear scientists or undertake longer term nonproliferation efforts one possibility is to use cooperative threat reduction ctr funds for these activities which became theoretically possible with the expansion of the application of ctr funds since fy200427 but which was impossible in practical sense before july 2006 because of libyas status as state sponsor of terrorism ctr funds may also contain more restrictions than ndf funds particularly in contractual requirements congress may wish to consider whether to provide additional assistance to libyan disarmament and if so how 26 president determination 200444 september 10 2004 69 fr 56163 27 the fy 2004 national defense authorization act pl 108176 approved expansion of nunnlugar programs to other
