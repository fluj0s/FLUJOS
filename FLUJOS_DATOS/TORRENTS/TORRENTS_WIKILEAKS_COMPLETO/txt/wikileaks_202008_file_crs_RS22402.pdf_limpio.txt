updated as necessary background the dollar amounts allocated to health car in the budget of the department of defense dod have more than doubled since fy2001 growing from about 17 billion to over 42 billion in fy2009 dod projections fo r health care indicate that even further growth can be realistically anticipat ed perhaps reaching 64 billion in fy20151 in 1990 according to dod estimates healthcare ex penses constituted 45 of dods budget by 2015 they could reach over 12 this growth in healthcare costs could have substantial effect on spending for other defense

by jennifer jensonthe defense health system which is open to some 92 million potential beneficiaries is large and complicated but in brief dod provides varying kinds of care to different elements of the eligible populat ion 1 complete medicalcare benefit to active duty personnel and depende nts 2 benefit program with annual enrollment fees and copayments to retired military personnel and their depe ndents who are not eligible for medicare 3 program for those retirees who are eligible for medicare and enrolled in medicare part b known as tricare for life tfl that covers almost all costs that medicare does not cover and is f unded with an accrual fund that is considered part of the defense budget and 4 premiumbased health care benefit for reservists and their families known as tricare reserve select military retirees aged 65 and above also remain eligible for treatment in military dical facilities on space or serviceavailable basis as of 2007 36 of tricare benefi ciaries were retirees under age 65 and their dependents approximate ly 20 were tfl retirees gener ally age 65 and older and 44 were active duty personne l and their dependents care is delivered through one of four pl ans the first is tricare prime health maintenance organization hmo which is required for active duty personnel and open to dependents and many retirees two other plans are tricare extra preferred provider option in which beneficiaries seek care from pr oviders who have agreed to an established fee structure and tricare standard formerly champus in which beneficiaries can seek care from any licensed provider nd obtain partial reimbursement2 fourth plan tfl serves as supplemental paye r to medicare for care by licen sed providers prescriptions are available from military pharmacies at cost they can also be obtained from civilian pharmacies linked to dod or by mail order w ith relatively low copayments eg 3 for generic prescription 9 for brand 22 for nonformulary prescription special versions of these plans for be neficiaries in overseas and remote areas are also available several factors associated with these plans have led to current and projected cost growth first increases in costs of deliverin g medical services and of prescriptions reflect trends in medical care deliver throughout the civilian economy3 pharmacy costs have seen the fastest rate of growth in dod health care spending quadrupling from 16 billion in fy2000 to 65 billion in fy2007 second the establishment of tfl in the fy2001 defense authorization act pl 106398 greatly increased costs by extending significant medical benefit to millions of medicareeligible retirees and their dependents third expanded access to defense health care for nonactive duty reservists was provided in the defense authorization act for fy2007 pl 109364 in addition copayments in tricare prime have been eliminated and the catastrophic cap for retirees has been lowered from 7500 to 3000 increasing costs to dod several additional fact ors have contributed to concer ns about the costs of defense health care in comparison to other plans in cluding those available to civil servants under the federal employees health benefit plan fehbp dod provides generous benefit with limited contributions and copayments required of beneficiaries observers alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22402crs3 4 defense health

budget office growth in medical spending by the department of defense september 2003 p 27point out that most defense health care is not directly related to treating combat injuries in recent decades the multibillion dollar sy stem has been directed towards care of dependents especially in the areas of obstetrics and pediatrics and to the care of retirees at stages of their lives when medical needs nd to increase even with the need to care for injuries resulting from the us commitment to operation iraqi freedom the bulk of dod medical care is currently provided to pendents and retirees not to the operating forces4 tricare beneficiaries both active duty nd retired tend to make greater use of professional care than other sectors of the population in fy2004 according to one estimate in tricare prime the outpatient utilization rate was 44 higher than in civilian hmos the inpatient utilization rate was 60 higher5 healthcare analysts tend to ascribe this to lower outofpocket costs for dod beneficiaries6 low cost to beneficiaries and increases in the quality and efficiency of defense health care in recent years have reportedly d many retirees with civilian jobs to choose tricare rather than plans available through their civilian employers special supplements by employers for tricare benefici aries are illegal see 10 usc 1097c in the fy2007 budget request dod first propos ed changes to constrain the costs of health care by focusing on care for retirees and their dependents who are not medicare eligible for these beneficiaries dod pr oposed charging for the first time annual enrollment fees for tricare standard and so significantly increased annual enrollment fees for tricare prime nnual deductibles woul d have also been increased initiatives were proposed that would affect active duty military and their dependents nor were changes proposed for healthcare benefits available to retirees eligible for medicare those aged 65 and over along with much sm aller number of disabled retirees who are covered by tfl the tfleligible benefici aries have been requi red to make somewhat higher copayments for some prescriptions dod strongly urged that in the future cost shares be adjusted annually for inflation the fact that enrollment fees for tricare prime were set at 230 for individuals and 460 for individuals and their dependents in 1995 and not subsequently adjusted has been viewed as an important contributing f actor to the current budgetary situation the administrations fy2008 budget sub mission was based on the assumption of 18 billion in proposed assumed savings to be derived from unspecified benefit reforms for the fy2009 budget submission the admin istration endorsed the recommendations of the task force on the future of military health care mandated by the defense authorization act for fy2007 pl 109364 see below and assumed 12 billion in savings from the increased tricare premiums and copaymentshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22402crs4 7

quadrennial review of military compensation qrmc issued its report on deferred and noncash compensation for members of the uniformed services7 the qrmc recommended that tricare prime premiums for single retirees under age 65 be set at 40 of medi care part b premiums which vary by the enrollees adjusted gross income tricare standardextra premiums for single retirees would be set at 15 of part b premiums family rates would be set at twice the single rate regardless of family size tricare deductibles would be linked to medicare rates with copayments waived for preventative care and prescription drug payments limited to more than two thirds of the average copayment faced by civilians at retail pharmacies in addition the qrmc recommended that health care for retirees under age 65 be financed through accrual acc ounting in order to illuminate how current manning decisions will affect future costs congressional responses the fy2007 fy2008 and fy2009 defense authorization acts

incentives to employees who are retired servicemembers to rely on tricare the fy2007 national defense authorizati on see section 711 of pl 109364 also required the establishment of dod task for ce on

over the long term including the beneficiary and government cost sharing structure required to sustain military health benefits nother provision of the same act section 713 required the government accountability office gao in cooperation with the congressional budget office cbo to prepare an audit of th costs of health care to both dod and beneficiaries between 1995 and 2005 the task force on

costsharing provisions anachronistic and recommended phasedin changes in enrollment fees and deductibles that would restore costsharing re lationships that existed when tricare was created for

23 billion over five years as part of the fy2009 budget request dod asked for authority to implement the recommendations of the task force on the fu ture of military health care dods budget submission assumed savings of 12 billion fro m the additional fees charged as well as reductions in use of services by military re tirees although the congress rejected the proposed fee increases for fy2009 it did addre ss the cost containment issue in another way by enacting number of preventive health measures8 intended to reduce usage at some point in the future the preventiv care measures included the following waiver of copayments for nonmedicare eligible tricare beneficiaries for preventive services including cancer screening annual physical examinations and vaccinations section 711 of pl 110417 threeyear military health risk management demonstration project to evaluate the efficacy of providing incentives to encourage healthy behaviors section 712 smoking cessation program for nonmedicare eligible tricare beneficiaries section 713 preventive health allowance dem onstration project running through december 31 2011 in which not more than 1500 members each of the army navy air force and marine corps annually would receive 500 if without dependents or 1000 with dependents in order to increase the use of preventive health services section 714 additional authority for studies nd demonstration pr ojects relating to delivery of health and medical care section 715 reporting requirements were incl uded and the results of thes projects may be useful in informing future policy decisions however the congressional budget office cbo cost estimate does not project any sa vings and suggests that if dod were to carry out each of the programs authorized by section 712 alone the cost would be about 50 million per year over period of three years based on costs for other demonstration projects9 more ambitious approaches the fact that both armed services committees called for extensive outside reviews of military healthcare financing indicates that congress may revisit proposals for fee increases at some point as part of more comprehensive changes in defense healthcare budgeting different approaches have alr eady been suggested one option mentioned by cbo would provide an opportunity for retirees to forego defense health care until they turn 65 in exchange for lumpsum payment10 the size of the payment would be adjusted to level that would be less co stly to dod over the longer term than current programs the acceptability of this appro ach to retirees is uncertain the number ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22402crs6 11 ibid pp 1920 12 for additional background on hsas see crs report rl32467 health savings accounts by bob lyke chris l peterson and neela k ranade 13 department of defense final report of the task force on the future of military health care december 2007 p 92 retirees who would take such payout is unknown and might be very limited given the attractiveness of tricare another approach would be to offer bene ficiaries cafeteria plan under which they would receive an annual cash allowance for hea lth care using this allowance they could then select tricare plan new option involving lower rollment fees and higher co payments and deductibles or apply some of the funds against premiums for civilian health insurance this could in effect allow retir ees to establish health savings accounts hsas for themselves and their dependents cbo estimates that such an approach could reduce dods outlays by 25 not including the cost of the cash allowance11 however hsas are controversial and making them available to military retirees could raise concerns among both beneficiaries and ot hers with an interest in government health programs12 still another option would be to readjust budgetary categories to remove healthcare spending for retirees both for those not yet eligible for medicare and the accrual fund for tfl from defense appropriation acts some have argued that this approach would encourage more meaningful analyses of curre nt defense issues by removing the need to consider tradeoffs with retiree health care others have countered that such maneuver would undermine analysis by obscuring the true costs of deci sions affecting military manpower conclusion dod has maintained since 2006 that there is need to adjust fees to make up for frozen fee structures over the pa st decade and that the proposed rates are still much lower than the fee structures of civilian plans including those in the fehbp13 retiree organizations have continued to argue that proposed raises in enrollment fees and co payments are unfair that the requirements of military service are unique and extraordinary and that healthcare premiums have been paid in service and sacrifice some further argue that fee hikes are especially inappropriate for retiring servicemembers who have borne the costs of the war on terro r during the past several years there are complex considerations with rega rd to any of the various approaches to dealing with the growth of military medi cal spending in the case of retired servicemembers and their dependents most recognize special responsibility inasmuch as health care after retirement is viewed as an important incentive to follow difficult and often dangerous career other observers argue that competing requirements for defense funds do exist and that funds for medical care should not be seen as unlimited these issues have been present ever si nce dod proposed fee increases in 2006 and are not expected to disappear in the near future
