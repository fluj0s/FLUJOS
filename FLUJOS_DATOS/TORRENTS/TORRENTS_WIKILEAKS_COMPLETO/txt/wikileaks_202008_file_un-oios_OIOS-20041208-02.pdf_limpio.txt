nations unies office of internal oversight services unhcr audit service oios audit of unhcr payroll ar200416202 executive summary in august and september 2004 oios conducted an aud it of unhcr payroll the audit focused on interfaces of the unhcr payroll system especially those affected by the transfer of responsibility from unog to unhcr as at the end of 2003 oios also reviewed the status and causes of overpayments to separated staff with outstanding b alance of nearly us 330000 as at 31 december 2003 when the payroll services were transferred to unhcr as of july 2004 the unhcr payroll serviced some 5800 staff processing monthly gross salaries of some us 31 million resulting in monthly net payments of some us 17 million overall assessment oios assessed the current unhcr payroll system inte rfaces and procedures administering overpayments to separated staff as below average in general internal controls related to salary payments were operational nonetheless full reliab ility of the system was undermined by delays in the receipt of payment instructions due to personne l status changes also reporting and control procedures still needed adjustment after the transf er of the payroll services payroll system interfaces the timely processing of the personnel payroll clea rance action form cp35 continues to be problem within unhcr although the personnel admin istration section has already taken the initiative to simplify the data entry process more needs to be done the establishment of key performance indicators to measure the timeliness of the completion of the document could serve as good management tool to motivate staff this wou ld allow identifying those officespersonnel not performing to an acceptable level establishing accountability and encouraging those involved to resolve matters faster dhrm concurred with oios recommendation the monthly duty status summary cdss reports to xpedite action by the payroll section were not always submitted there was control in plac to ensure their completeness and that the documentation supporting them was clear and compreh ensive the importance of the submission of the dss reports should be reemphasized and prop er procedures established to ensure the completeness and accuracy of payroll amendments dhrm agreed with oios recommendation and will assign responsibility to control dss submi ssions the pious and payroll systems are two independent s ystems oios emphasized the need to perform reconciliation between the different data s ources prior to migrating from the existing payroll system to msrp without this there is assurance that unhcr is migrating complete and accurate data dhrm is currently exploring the ways and means to r econcile the data after the transfer of payroll responsibilities from unog to unhcr and with the introduction of msrp the payroll and msrp systems have not been ab to provide sufficient reports for the budget section to correct payroll allotment account charges pending the development of new reports from msrp the accuracy of payroll related budgetary charges for 2004 cannot be assured the budget section indicated that additional report s were now available and they had started to make necessary adjustments overpayments to separated staff sufficient attention had not been given to the clea rance of overpayments to separated staff totalling nearly us 330000 some of the overpayments dated back as far as 1998 and one case to 1993 while some research and followup was done on the r epayment the lack of effective procedures for writeoffs led to incomplete action and the acc umulation of overpayment balances also in many cases the long processing time of p35s betwe six months to over one year was one of the main reasons why unhcr was unable to make recover dhrm initiated action to writeoff nonrecoverable overpayment balances for many of the overpayments it is difficult to as sign responsibility at this late stage also to review them individually is cumbersome exercise and considering the age of the transactions and the materiality of the individual amounts involved it would not be cost effective oios would suggest that dhrm be selective in the cases chosen for an indepth review with focus on the more current and material balances also lessons need t be learned and procedures put in place to avoid future reoccurrence of overpayments dhrm will organise regular meetings to analyse overpayment causes and identify the required improv ements the largest overpayment occurred in 2002 for some u s 68800 to 38 cformer local staff at sub office peshawar the analysis of this case demonst rated that it occurred due to number of unfortunate events including the lack of timely tra nsmittal of important payroll information and the miscommunication of instructions between field and headquarters the delays were unacceptable particularly at headquarters responsibility could not be assigned to one individual section or field office the finance section has drafted an instruction ciom fom to reinforce the procedures to ensure the correct treatment of salary related transaction s by field offices oios considers that clear guidance could significantly improve the understand ing of payroll related transactions and should be expeditiously issued oios suggests that the ins truction be expanded to include reference to the dss report processing provide more practical examp and encourage more prudence when processing termination payments the draft iomfom is currently undergoing final r eview by dhrm december 2004 table of contents chapter paragraphes i introduction 13 ii audit objectives 4 iii audit scope and methodology 56 iv audit findings and recommendations payroll system interfaces b overpayments to separated staff 722 2342 v acknowledgement 43 i introduction 1 in august and september 2004 oios conducted an audit of unhcr payroll the audit was conducted in accordance with the standards for the professional practice of internal auditing promulgated by the institute of internal auditors and adopted by the internal audit services of the united nations organizations 2 as of july 2004 unhcr payroll serviced som 5800 staff and processed monthly gross salaries of us 31 million cresulting in monthly ne t payments to staff of some us 17 million the unhcr payroll was transferred from unog to unhc r as of 31 december 2003 and is now operated and managed by the division of human r esources management cdhrm the only changes to affect the payroll system since the transfer are the interfaces between the payroll section and other organizational units within unhcr such as the budget and finance sections as part of the migration of the services unog tran sferred the payroll balance sheet as of 31 december 2003 it included overpayments cpotenti recoveries to separated staff members caccount number 3005000 totalling us 327711 3 the findings and recommendations contained in this report have been discussed with the chief personnel administration section and other d hrm officials during the meeting held on 15 september 2004 draft of the report was shared with the director of the division of human resources management and the chiefs of the personne l administration payroll budget and finance sections the comments made orally and in w riting are reflected as appropriate in this final report ii audit objectives 4 the main objectives of the audit were to evaluate the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of the internal controls of the payroll systems and procedures review the status of overpayments made to separated staff and identify the reasons for them as well as any process and procedural weaknesses w hich may have led to their occurrence ii audit scope and methodology 5 as requested by the personnel administratio n section cpas dhrm the audit focused on the system weaknesses as well as the responsibil ity for the yearend closure procedures relating to the handover of payroll services to hcr from unog oios also reviewed the new interfaces between the different organizational units involved in the payroll systems and procedures oios did not however conduct an inde pth review of the core elements of the payroll as this had been done by oios in 2000 and by the board of auditors in 2002 oios examined nonetheless overpayments to separated st aff listed in account 3005000 at the date of transfer and the movements of the account over t he last year with reference to this oios also reviewed the progress of clearing the account the procedures for the recovery of the balances and how accountability of the overpayments was establis hed 6 oios reviewed relevant documentation and in terviewed number of staff from the payroll section pas the finance budget and treas ury sections and the management system renewal project cmsrp sample of the overpayment s to separated staff was reviewed to identify the reason for them to and to assess unhcr s response to their occurrence 2 iv audit findings and recommendations payroll system interfaces 7 during the review oios analysed the interfa ces existing between the core payroll system and other offices involved in the payroll cycle th main payroll system has not changed since oios previous audit however some of the interfac were different due to the transfer of responsibilities from unog to unhcr as well as the implementation of msrp personnel administration section 8 pas is generally the main source of informa tion for data input into the payroll system and is responsible for channelling instructions ini tiated by field or headquarter units to the payroll section as noted in previous oios reports cunhcr payroll submission to united nations joint staff pension fund of separation docu ments by unhcr the late receipt of completed personal action instructions cpais and p ersonnel payroll clearance action forms cp35 has been assessed as the cause of many of th problems while pas cannot control the full cycle of pai and p35 processing it is oios opinion that they could be more proactive and assertive in advocating improvements to the process oios appreciates that pas has already taken the initiative to simplify the data entry pro cess nonetheless system to identify problem field offices as well as methods to assist and res olve the reasons for the inherent delays that is consistent obstacle to an efficient process need to be found oios suggested that the development of key performance indicators for those involved in the process as measurement of the timeliness of the issuance of these importan t documents could serve as good management tool to motivate staff this would allo w to identify those officespersonnel that are not performing to an acceptable level to establish accountability and to encourage those involved to resolve matters faster 9 currently data can be electronically upload ed to the payroll system for certain budgetary data changes ceg adjustment by data batches at th start of new fiscal year however this needs to be further developed by the use of similar techniques for other data fields according to the chief payroll section the possibility of allo cating resources for the development of more comprehensive data upload system is currently being assessed oios welcomes this and would suggest that if resources are limited it could be gradually phasedin by introducing different elements of the pai information considering that t he existing payroll system will continue for some time attention should be given to automating certain elements of data input recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management sh ould reiterate the importance to field and headquarter personnel f timely processing of the personnel payroll clearance action cp35 forms and take action to streamline the process by electronic upload of the personal action instruction data key performance indicators should be established to measure the timeliness of their completion and subm ission to the payroll section officespersonnel not achieving the timeli nes established should be required to justify the reasons for the delays c rec 01 3 10 dhrm agreed with oios recommendation and indicated that it has started to work on its implementation oios was pleased to note that dhrm has already init iated action but will keep the recommendation open until the key performa nce indicators to monitor the processing of p35 forms have been established and concrete steps have been taken to streamline the electronic upload of pai data 11 oios noted that correct and timely duty st atus summary cdss reports to expedite action by the payroll section were not always avail able the importance of these reports was demonstrated in the peshawar case csee below wher eby miscommunication andor misunderstanding between the parties involved resul ted in considerable overpayments to separated staff 12 the submission of the completed dss report s is currently controlled by the secretary of the payroll section who simply registers their rec eipt action is initiated if the report is not submitted or if documentation attached is not clea r or comprehensive if dss report is not received it is assumed that action is required this weakness in internal controls needs to be addressed and exception reporting introduced to sure adequate followup is initiated the importance of the submission of the dss report shou ld be reemphasized and proper procedures established by pas to ensure the completeness and ccuracy of payroll amendments recommendation head2right the unhcr personnel administration section should f ormalize the process of submission of the completed duty status summary reports and assign responsibility to oversee the process to ensure completeness and accuracy of payroll amendments cre c 02 13 dhrm in principal agreed with oios recommendation suggesting assigning the responsibility to oversee dss submission process on geographical unit basis the office indicated that the related instructions would be re leased latest by the end of december oios agrees that it may be practical to assign responsib ilities on geographical basis oios keep the recommendation open until the proposed improvements in the process have been introduced 14 the personnel information online update s ystem cpious and the payroll system are two independent systems oios recommended that peri odic reconciliation between different data sources be performed reconciliation has not bee n done since 2000 dhrm informed oios that as it took significant effort to followup n matters and resolve the differences found they cannot afford regular involvement of personnel in s uch time consuming exercise in their opinion this was not high priority as it would ultimately result in relatively low number of required corrections oios appreciates that such an exercise requires resources but would reiterate that to ensure unhcr personnel and payrol l data is complete and accurate reconciliation between the different data sources i s imperative prior to migrating from the existing payroll system to the new msrp payroll wi thout this there is assurance that unhcr is migrating accurate data 4 recommendation head2right the unhcr personnel administration section should c onduct full data reconciliation between pious and the payroll s ystem databases to ensure the data to be migrated to msrp is comple and accurate early planning is important so that appropriate res ources are allocated for its timely completion crec 03 15 dhrm agreed with oios recommendation and informed us that the action has been taken to find the ways and means for further integr ation and reconciliation of data in the different systems oios is pleased to note that dhrm agrees that there is risk of data discrepancies and that appropriate action will be t aken we will keep this recommendation open until evidence is provided as to the integrity of t he data to be migrated to msrp budget section 16 since the conversion of fmis at headquarte rs to msrp insufficient reports in comparison to those previously received are being generated for the budget section at the beginning of 2004 the budget section had requested the msrp team to provide reports equivalent to those formerly available from fmis h owever the first report csitrep was only received in july 2004 the report did not contain r eliable data and needed further finetuning as result budgetary changes in the management syste m could not be accurately or timely adjusted consequently expenditure adjustments for the perio d from january 2004 onwards were still pending at the time of our audit hence budgetary information on the distribution of costs by officesheadquarter units was unreliable and was n ot an effective basis for subsequent budgetary planning andor expenditure analysis 17 the existing payroll system cannot handle retroactive changes to allotment accounts therefore retroactive changes need to be adjusted manually after the accounting for salaries is complete according to the payroll section system changes to make retroactive budgetary adjustments are too complex and it would not be fea sible in light of the expected future changeover of the payroll system consequently adj ustments need to be made manually which is cumbersome and prone to error thus if timely and relevant reports were not presented which identified the required amendmentscorrections the only changes made would be those noted by field offices this is not sufficiently systematic to provide reliance that all the necessary amendmentscorrections will be made 18 the budget section informed oios that in november 2 004 it had submitted to the msrp team request for further 14 specific expenditur reports which are required to assist in reviewing expenditures also the responsibility fo r all expenditure adjustments had been previously delegated to the finance section the ag reement to assign responsibility for the adjustments for salary related expenditure to the b udget section was only finalized in october 2004 since then the section has started to make the necessary adjustments 19 oios notes that after august 2004 some imp rovements have been made to address the budget sections reporting requirements the budget section had requested the payroll section to provide the electronic version of the dollar histo ry file instead of the hard copy of the 5 earnings and deductions register to address the lac k of comprehensive reporting from msrp the electronic dollar history file was received sta rting august 2004 the payroll section indicated that they would continue to furnish compl ementary reports to the budget section oios appreciates this however the quality of this and other payroll section reports still need some improvements recommendations head2right the unhcr budget section should ensure that revie w of 2004 salary charges is completed and the related adjustm ents are processed before the closure of accounts for the year 2004 cr ec 04 finance section 20 the finance section performed various payr oll related reconciliations to ensure that the data transferred from the payroll system to msrp cm po batch reconciliation was accurate and complete and that payments to staff at the field l evel cvf522 and vf523 accounts reconciliation were made as instructed on the mpos as at the end of june 2004 there remained some 9500 unreconciled cunmatched field payment entries and payables on accounts vf522 and vf523 all relating to the financial periods prior to 31 decem ber 2003 efforts however are being made to reduce the number of unmatched items on these accou nts monthly targets for clearing the entries have been set and the achievement of them is being monitored responsibility for reconciliations relating to entries in 2004 has been allocated to t he relevant finance clerk the mpo batch reconciliation was uptodate and under control 21 the finance section was also maintaining b ank reconciliations for two newly opened bank accounts in headquarters for the payments of s alaries to headquarter personnel and for professional staff based elsewhere oios noticed th at while the reconciliations for the two bank accounts were uptodate at the time of audit they contained high number of uncleared items that needed to be resolved urgently if these item s remain for longer period there is high risk that errors or overpayments will not be cleared it becomes more difficult to rectify errors and recover overpayments with the passage of time recommendation head2right the unhcr finance section in coordination with unh cr treasury section should review and address the uncleared it ems listed in the reconciliation of the two payroll bank accounts th responsibility of this task needs to be assigned as well as deadli ne for its completion crec 05 treasury section 22 two bank accounts were opened in january 2 004 to accommodate the transfer of the payroll services from unog to unhcr in addition t wo senior treasury clerks were allocated on full time basis to service these accounts and to effect payments internal controls over the payments made were assessed as satisfactory howeve r as noted above extra efforts was 6 required to fully complete work on the reconciliati on of the bank accounts b overpayments to separated staff 23 with the transfer of payroll services as f 31 december 2003 unog transferred the unhcr payroll and general payment balance sheet th is included balances relating to payroll travel and other staff receivables and payables mo st of the accounts were of an operational nature pending payment or clearance within few mo nths it also included however overpayments to 151 separated staff members recorde d in account 3005000 totalling us 327711 24 as part of oios audit the data on accoun t 3005000 was reviewed to better understand the dynamics of the account and the freq uency and rate of clearance of overpayments comparatives over the last year are provided in the table below date 31 august 2003 31 december 2003 30 june 2004 total overpayment amount 33175996 32771077 35521538 separated staff members listed 141 151 172 25 there was little change in the account in the period under review there were some movements including recoveries and offsets and som overpayments were added 26 the account recorded overpayments to staff members who had been separated for more than one year some separated as far back as 1998 nd one overpayment related to staff member separated in 1993 for each recorded overpayment letter had been sent to the former staff member demanding its repayment however with very few exceptions most of the letters were returned undelivered or simply not replied to oios found that in many of the overpayment cases the p35 had only been received by the payroll sect ion between six months to over one year after separation it is evident therefore that the lon g processing time of p35s is one of the main reasons why unhcr was unable to recover these overp ayments 27 oios discussed the causes leading to the l ong processing time of p35s and the main conclusion reached with those staff interviewed was that personnel responsible at the field level and at headquarters had limited processing capacity if p35s were not prioritized their processing was postponed sometimes for an indefinit time other processing delays originated from field offices where human resource personnel delayed the process due to its complexity and uncertainty on how the separation case should be ndled this problem area has already been addressed under paragraph 8 analysis of overpayments 28 sufficient efforts have not been made by u nhcr to clear account 3005000 the finance section did some work in august 2003 to ide ntify potential problems for further follow up in the intervening period pas and the payroll s ection have done periodic reviews and followedup on some cases these reviews however would have been more effective if the 7 outcomes had been properly communicated and discuss ed with the relevant parties involved as this was not done the recovery process has been fu rther hindered oios found that in general communication between the relevant parties was ofte n lacking and needed to be considerably improved to ensure issues and concerns were properl and openly exchanged and steps were initiated to implement the proposed recommendations 29 moreover with several officespersonnel i nvolved in reviewing the reasons for the overpayments the efforts invested were duplicated sometimes without satisfactory outcome oios noted several cases where writeoffs had not b een requested causes for overpayments were not properly established and responsibilities were not assigned within reasonable timeframe despite the work done unhcrs attempts to recover many of the overpayments remained unsuccessful in oios opinion the process of anal ysing causes for overpayments and requesting writeoffs lacked coordination and leadership none of the officesheadquarter units clearly knew who should be initiating the writeoffs and b oth the finance section and pas expected the other to be the decisionmaker as already recommen ded by oios in the 2000 audit the writeoff process needs to be more clearly defined with one officeunit held responsible for the decision 30 the account still included four overpaymen ts csome us 13700 which had already been identified in oios 2000 payroll audit yet app ropriate action was taken oios appreciates that one of the reasons for delaying the writeoffs was due to an instruction issued by pas to put onhold further work on overpayments until completi on of the ccurrent oios payroll audit dhrm had requested oios to assist in the establishm ent of responsibilitycies for the overpayments and to determine what officeunit shou ld absorb the losses 31 in oios view the cases yielding negative cor response should have been submitted for writeoff it is unrealistic to think that over payments outstanding since 1998 and earlier would be recovered at this stage also to retain these ba lances as receivables is contrary to the prudence principle of accounting after exhaustive and unsuccessful follow up the overpayments that did not yield recoveries should h ave been either writtenoff or fully provided for for account 3005000 oios would assume that after letter demanding repayment had been returned undelivered or was not replied to wit hin reasonable period the corresponding balance should have been assumed as nonrecoverable and an appropriate provision made recommendation head2right the unhcr division of human resources management in conjunction with the unhcr division of financial an d supply management should ensure that appropriate steps are taken to write off nonrecoverable balances clear policy should be established to ensure after reasonable followup that overpayments not recovered are properly provided for and not continued to be recor ded as receivable for an indefinite period crec 06 32 dhrm agreed with oios recommendation and informed us that the action to writeoff nonrecoverable balances has already been initiated oios is pleased to note the initial action taken but will keep the recommendation open until t he appropriate writeoffs have been initiated and policy for the policy for financial treatment of nonrecoverable balances has been established 8 33 oios attempted to categorize the overpayme nt balances by the office responsible for the overpayment or by reason of the overpayment the ex ercise proved to be cumbersome and demanding and therefore did not enable oios to duct an indepth review on casebycase basis considering the age of some of the cases and that documents and personnel involved were difficult to access such an exercise was not cost effective particularly considering the resources already invested by unhcr staff without positive outcome for the future however it is important that unhcr establish and disseminate proc edures to ensure that timely action is taken to review cases and resolve them oios suggested th at interoffice meetings to share information and observations be held plan of action should b developed and clear decision made on the common approach to be taken moreover the cost eff ectiveness of continuing to review each and every individual case needs to be taken into accoun t and consideration given to the age and materiality of single cases to ensure efficient use of resources oios believes that some of the older cases would not yield positive outcome dhrm has accepted oios recommendation to organize regular monthly meetings with participatio n of the personnel administration section finance and payroll sections to jointly address pro blems and identify areas requiring improvements 34 in overall terms oios analysis of some f the larger overpayments taking into account the preliminary research conducted by the finance s ection highlighted specific risk areas these included weaknesses in handling salary advances cbo th issued in headquarters and in the field payments of the lump sum of the hardship and mobili ty allowance misunderstandings and miscommunication of instructions on the dss reports the general rate of the processing of pais and p35s and poor or lack of communication betwee n various offices oios is aware that some of these issues have already been addressed but ot hers need immediate attention to minimize the likelihood of mistakes recurring peshawar case 35 included in the balance of overpayments to separated staff was an amount of us 68600 relating to overpayment of emoluments made to 38 cal staff at suboffice peshawar pakistan csop during 2002 these overpayments were made to local staff mostly interpreters and clerks hired in late 2001 on shortterm basis the contr acts were subsequently extended to 30 june 2002 which triggered their inclusion in the centra lized payroll system from january 2002 onwards due to operational reasons their contrac ts were discontinued as at 28 february 2002 giving rise to the 6 weeks termination indemnity m ost of these staff members were subsequently hired from 1 march 2002 as project staff under cal ngo for period of between 6 to 10 months the combination of these human resources ma nagement decisions resulted in unnecessary cost to unhcr of some us 16000 at th is stage oios does not question the operational reasons nonetheless we would highli ght the paramount importance of timely and accurate human resource planning 36 unfortunately the payroll cycle starting from the input from the field level chuman resources personnel to dhrm and the payroll sectio n does not work effectively for shortterm arrangements specifically in this case pais for i nclusion of the listed staff reached the payroll section only in march april and may 2002 after th staff members separation the monthly payment order cmpo for march 2002 therefore includ ed some of the separated staff rightly 9 sop ignored the mpo instructions meanwhile dummy separation action pais reached the payroll section before the april 2002 salary calcul ation which triggered withheld status for salaries blocking their appearance on the mpos fro m april 2002 onwards nonetheless the monthly dss of august 2002 released the payments on instructions from pas the human resource officer and assistant releasing the paymen ts claimed that this decision would have been based on instructions from the field however documents supporting this decision could not be found in pas as result the payroll system re troactively calculated salaries for the former staff members for the period when they were on wi thheld status the august mpo received by sop was assumed to represent the termination paymen t whereas in fact it instructed sop to pay the salaries for the fivemonth period from april t august 2002 thus payments equal to five months salary were retroactively made to the staff separated as at 28 february 2002 apparently in sop neither the finance assistant preparing the salaries nor the senior administrationfinance officer approving the payments questioned the size and validity of them 37 after the august 2002 payment the listed separated sop staff members continued appearing on the following months mpos as their s tatus for salary calculations was released sop did not make any more payments to the separated staff believing that their termination payments had been made 38 in january 2003 the payroll section stopp ed the salaries for the separated staff on instructions from pas requesting them to be placed on withheld status finally the completed p35s allowing full withdrawal of the former staff members from payroll system were received by payroll section on 23 april 2003 almost fourtee n months after the termination date and eleven months after their issue by sop this time p eriod is unacceptable particularly at the headquarters end sop claimed that the initial ay was caused by the late submission of leave records by supervisors of separated staff the payr oll section finalized their records after receipt of the completed p35s the overpayment exceeded th annual leave balance and six weeks termination indemnity payable on separation 39 the last action relating to this case was the issuance of official letters to staff members informing them of the overpayment and requesting re covery some of the letters were returned undelivered others were not responded to thus rec overy of these overpayments is highly unlikely further action has been taken to initi ate writeoff of these overpayments even though it is doubtful that recovery will be forthcoming 40 oios noted that if proper review had bee n done earlier unhcr could have recovered overpayments totalling some us 4700 from the four local staff members who moved from the so peshawar to kabul in early 2002 they were only separated in late 2003 reasonably long after realizing in mid2003 that unhcr had made overpayme nts 41 in conclusion oios has listed issues surf acing from this case which in some way have contributed to or resulted in overpayments oios r eview did not allow responsibility to be assigned to single person or office nor improve the chances of recovery of the overpayments already made however the following summarizes the main concerns and highlights the weak areas that need to be addressed by unhcr to ensure nonrecurrence as follows the unjustified issuance of 6 month contracts ando r their early termination when facto 10 staff remained in the office as project staff the slow processing of pais and p35s caused by eit her insufficient andor untrained personnel in the field pas and the finance section miscommunication of staff members status on dss re ports the lack of followup on the receipt of unusual ins tructions received from another office cthe payroll section did not question the pas instr uctions to release salaries sop did not question the payroll sections instruction cmpo to pay salaries five times the usual size the postponement of indepth reviews which would h ave led to the recovery 42 in response to the above listed issues cer tain measures have already been taken pas has started to develop simplified pais and p35 s timely development would have an impact on the overall processing time the payroll section since july 2003 has introduce d split mpos to segregate regular and termination benefits this change allows field offi ces to distinguish termination and regular payments the finance section has drafted an instruction ciom fom addressed to field offices to reiterate the procedures for salary related transac tions including the appropriate accounting entries salary calculations and how to interpret t he mpos the document has not yet been issued as it still has to be validated by dhrm oi highlights the importance of this document thus would urge that its completion is ex pedited in oios view the iomfom should include some practical examples to assist fi eld staff in accounting for and calculating salary payments the instruction should reiterate t he importance of accurate and complete dss reporting give instructions on its processing and reemphasize the need to exercise prudence in processing termination and other unusua l payments the draft iomfom is currently being reviewed by dhrm recommendation head2right the unhcr finance section in cooperation with the u nhcr division of human resources management should issue an instruction on payroll related activities for field offices including practical guidance in accounting for and calculatin g salary payments the instruction should also highlight the importanc of accurate and complete duty status summary reporting crec 07 v acknowledgement 43 i wish to express my appreciation
