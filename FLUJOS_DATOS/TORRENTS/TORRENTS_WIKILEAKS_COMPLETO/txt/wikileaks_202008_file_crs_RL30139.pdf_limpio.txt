coastal zone management fund nonorf account once again for fy2001 noaa proposed to transfer the great lakes environmental research lab glerl to where it is believed it would best support operational programs opposition to this proposal was expressed by the house in fy2001 appropriations deliberations because in fy1999 budget deliberations congress requested master plan for transferring all marine research labs currently under oar to still not having received such plan the request was not approved in hr 4690 nor did the house approve 100 million increase in coastal zone management grants but rather reduced ocean and coastal assessment funding requested by noaa by 36 below the presidents request in its bill report on hr 4690 hrept 106680 the house noted that over billion in authorizations

under the magnuson stevens fisheryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30139crs11 conservation and management act marine mammal protection act and the endangered species act see figure 4 below nmfs research programs are clear example of how rd funding is tied directly to the agencys operational responsibilities that are directly linked with american commerce and in this case the us fishery industry for example programs under this budget activity include research programs to restore and rebuild american fishery habitats where some fish stocks have declined heightened public attention to this problem drew large funding increase for nmfs in fy1994 and modest funding levels have been maintained since in the fy2001 budget funding of 160 million was requested for pacific coastal salmon fisheries of which 60 million would implement the us canada pacific salmon agreement other funds of up to 10 million were requested for declining fishery stocks in the north atlantic and gulf of mexico and nearly 8 million increase was requested for financing the fishery industries the largest proportion of spending requested for nmfs for fy2001 was for conservation and management operations accounting for about 50 of the nmfs budget for fy2001 there was less funding being sought for information collection and analysis in support of fishery stock assessments and the primarily because of large increases realized in fy2000 appropriations however funding for management in general would increase significantly also an additional 16 million was requested for fishery research vessels frv construction to contribute to 5 year effort to modernize the noaa marine fleet an initiative approved by congress in the fy2000 budget in hr 4690 the house approved total of 4054 million for nmfs which is about 4 less than fy2000 appropriations and 11 less than the fy2001 request significant reductions by the house were targeted at programs that pertain to information collection and analysis pacific coastal salmon recovery and other conservation and management operations relating to endangered species as well as the presidents request for coral reef conservation efforts the senate appropriations committee approved 544 million for nmfs and increases were primarily targeted at enhancing conservation activities including 123 million for stellar sea lion recovery with specific language in the senate bill report s rept 106404 september 8 2000 on how those fund would be dispersed 39 million for fishery industry information and managemen t programs and 6 million for state indust ry programs the committee agreed with the house on proposed funding levels for pcsr approving 58 million for this activity hr 4292 appropriated total of 5179 million for nmfs pl 106554 hr 4577 section 209 provided nmfs an additional 50 million including 20 million for stellar sea lion protection measures and economic disaster relief of 30 million for compensation for damages to alaskan fishing industries over time agencybacked funding cuts in nmfs have primarily occurred because of assuming more of the coastal ocean science responsibilities under the coastal oceans program cop noaa officials have deemed it more appropriate for nmfs to focus on its fisheries management endangered species protection and fishery enforcement responsibilities for more detailed information on nmfs see

request for fy2000 including funding to improve climate prediction models under climate in the 21st century initiative for solar research and tracking solar geomagnetic storm activity and research thrust into the role of oceans processes in climate the president signed an executive order in march 1999 to combat nonindigenous species endangering the health of us coastal marine and major waterways for which the oceans and great lakes research component of oar plays major role noaa claims oar weather research programs have continued to improve severe weather forecast and warning capabilities of the national weather service these activities have been funded under the interagency us weather research program resultant data has been collected and fed directly into noaa weather operations and experimental models us weather research has also improved knowledge about severe storms and the science of weather modification important for us transportation and agriculture sectors while noaa claims its skills at forecasting severe weather events has improved others have questioned whether fundamental weather services may be deteriorating as result of nws technology which has replaced human observations with automated ones oar has stressed that the national weather service has been able to continue to improve its ability to track landfall of hurricanes and better predict storm intensity because of the us weather research program global climate change research in oar is divided between research in short term to interannual climate fluctuations and longterm climate research the former studies the nino and nina phenomena for example while the latter researches climate changes which occur over decades to centuries and includes new research on the north atlantic and pacific ocean decadal oscillations in the ocean noaa participates in the interagency us global climate change research program through its office of globa l programs ogp and also in the high performance computing initiative in efforts to improve climate change prediction more information on issues surrounding the science of global climate change may be found in crs issue brief ib89005 global climate change by wayne morrissey and john r justus and the crs electronic briefing book on global climate change at httpwwwcongressgovbrbkhtmlebgcc1html noaas climate and air quality research programs play role in understanding regional air pollution and its ecological effects and the role of oceans in climate for fy2001 the president requested an increase of 25 million to fund these activi ties oar has also been instrumental in studying stratospheric ozonehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30139crs13 depletion and in developing substitutes which do not damage the ozone layer for environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons cfcs noaas participation in high performance computing efforts is aimed at improving performance of computerized climatechange models for which 6 million increase is requested under pac for supercomputer upgrade at the geophysical fluid dynamics lab at princeton nj also under new climate change observations and services initiative for fy2001 some 32 million was requested to enhance clima observations including ocean observations and to improve climate data and information acquisition and management solar weather research at noaa has been instrumental in supporting the us space program and the telecommunications and electric power industries in addition suite of 12 noaa environmental research labs erls are funded under oar and nmfs also operate federal research labs which are integral to noaas mission oar also funds noaas participation in the global learning and observation for better environment globe program for which 2 million increase for total of 5 million was requested for fy2001 ocean and great lakes research at noaa has investigated ways to protect marine coastal and estuarine environments from pollution hypoxia oxygen deficiency and harmful algae blooms and major inland waterways and the great lakes from nonindigenous pest species such as the zebra mussel for fy2001 the president requested 88 million for these programs noaa has promoted and supported state and local research efforts on marine environments and the economy through such activities as the national sea grant college program for which 60 million was requested the national underwater research program nurp and funds for sea floor observatories accounted for another 11 million of the request also funding of 6 million was requested by the administration to transfer the great lakes environmental research laboratory glerl from oar to hr 4690 provided 2646 million for oar for fy2001 this is about 13 below the presidents request for fy2001of 3025 million and 12 less than fy2000 appropriations for oar of 3005 million much of this difference may be attributed to the house not providing funding for climate change observation and services initiative or the globe program the house also decreased funding below fy2000 levels for the remaining climate and air quality research programs resulting in an overall decrease of 32 for climate research the national undersea research program nurp was not funded however the sea grant program was increased by 3 above requested levels the house provided oar funding of 71 million for glerl the senate appropriations committee in its action on hr 4690 restored number of funding cuts for oar proposed by the house this includes higher funding levels than the house and presidents request of 65 million for the sea grant program 17 million for nurp and 14 million of the 28 million requested for climate observations and services mainly for ocean observations conferees on hr 4292 approved 3232 million for oar slightly higher than senate appropriations committee funding levels national weather service nws for fy2001 the president requested 635 million for nws 75 million in pac which included an 8 million increase for base operations in forecast and warning services 15 million for personnel cost increases and such sums as necessary to complete the 1989 nws modernizatio nhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30139crs14 effort the request is about 5 31 million greater than the amount of 604 million appropriated for fy2000 pl 106113 and 3 17 million greater than that requested by the president for fy2000 for fy2001 funding requested for nws is 23 of the total noaa budget significant funding level increases have been predominantl driven by efforts to improve modernize and automate weather observations and improve public forecasts and warning s of severe weather events nws also has been upgrading its central computer facility nws began implementing its modernization efforts by deploying suite of new weather techn ologies into fullscale operation the first was the installation of nexrad radar at selected sites and with eventual followon of the automated surface observing system asos at former weather service offices many of which did not receive nexrad doppler radar the latest technological component to be implemented is the advanced weather interactiv processing system awips which integrates data from number of operational environmental monitoring and observing systems to assist in short term forecast and warning of severe weather events for fy2001 noaa has requested 7 million to improve the communications capability of awips also 6 million was requested under pac to continue to expand and upgrade the noaa weather radio nwr network by fy 2000 the national weather service had consolidated 219 of its original manned weat her service offices wsos into about 123 new highly automated weather forecast offices wfos other major additions to the suite of technologies at wfos include an interface with nws river forecast centers rfcs which predict flood events also noaa has sought to expand its network of advanced hydrological prediction system ahps flood modeling efforts the nws national centers for environmental prediction ncep are also linked to awips to facilitate the issuance national severe storm forecast and warnings from different regions of the united states noaa has continued to replace and improve its radiosonde balloon network which collect s realtime data about the state of the nearsurface atmosphere and 7 million was requested for this activity under nws pac for fy2001 the house approved 6217 million for nws in hr 4690 which is about 2 less than the presidents request for fy2000 and 3 greater than fy2000

new funds to create national environmental data archive and access system nedaac nesdis is responsible for funding launch and final deployment of us polar orbiting environmental satellites poes which gather environmental science data by circling the globe from poletopole and geostationary orbiting environmental satellites goes which more or less stay in one place above earths surface and are used for tracking and characterizing major storms in the northern midlatitudes funding of 7 million was requested for nesdis for fy2001 to invest in new generation of goes technolo gy to improve instrumentation used for hurricane forecasts and to enhance understanding of deep layer convection and atmospheric moisture content and transport in tropical cyclones nesdis acquires environmental data collected from satellites and ground monitoring stations and has developed environmental data archives and products at its national climatic ncdc oceans nodc and geophysical data centers ngdc noaa is the sole source for collecting and distributing civil weather data which is mandated under the land remote sensing and commercialization act of 1984 pl 98365 over time noaa has shared responsibilities with nasa to compile data archives from such missions as landsat 4 5 6 however nasa has since assumed management of the landsat program including landsat 7 and the department of the interior us geological service is responsible for data archives the president did not request funding for fy2001 for the regional climate centers rcc whose climate prediction services the clinton administration claimed serve only select economic sectors of the us economy congress had appropriated 25 million for these centers in fy2000 major priority for fy2001 noaa requested 567 million for satellite observing systems funding to be derived from both orf and pac accounts it has also requested an advanced appropriation of 15 million for construction of new satellite operation facility in suitland md another 6 million was requested for global disaster information network gdin nesdis environmental and data management systems line would receive 49 million to acquire environmental data and produce information products and services and assessments in the atmospheric marine solid earth and solarterrestrial sciences portion of this funding would also go into preserving and making available historical environmental data as well as developing an environmental information clearinghouse that would make access to environmental satellite data products available to the public nesdis currently provides goes and poes satellite data in the form of visual images or data sets for the minimal costs of reproduction for scientific researchers and at competitive costs for commercial users both the house and senate have stressed the importance of providing funding for preservation of historical satellite data and digital conversion of other products originally produced in paper format and by facsimile when hr 6490 passed the house is approved total of 1066 million for nesdis which is slightly less than the presidents request but about 4 less than fy2000 appropriations the house did

which will help to develop the tools to minimize risks to coastal environments from coastal development including oil and gas activities there are also number of other fisheries accounts that fund and finance different aspects of the us fishing industry including its international treaty obligations insurance and noaa liabilities funds which total about 14 million the house approved 58 million for

public feedback on the progress of efforts with nws modernization ninola nina forecasting and research on other shortterm climate fluctuations still others related to funding of noaa programs which members of congress have claimed are not expressly authorize d under law also of concern was the rate of recovery and extended conservation of american fisheries as well as levels of funding provided for endangered species protectio n and enforcement noaa is statutorily mandated to collect and maintain environmental and civilian weather data for purposes of scientific research to provide severe storm forecast and warning and to produce environmental data products from satellite data and each of these activities requires annual appropriations also congress has directed noaa to expand partnerships and share mission responsibilities for data collection and other activities with the private sector whenever feasible in the second session of the 106th congress the prevailing issue seemed to be the extent to which federal funding would be available to support several environmental protection initiatives involving noaa and other federal agencies proposed by the president in his fy2001 budget the clinton administration claimed these cenr initiatives would 1 expand noaas role in environmental protection by devising ways to restore health to ailing marine and coastal ecosystems and 2 enhance noaas contribution to certain sectors of the american economy such as the us fishing agriculture telecommunications and insurance industries the clinton administration claims the benefit from such investments would be avoiding costs to taxpayers resulting from severe weather events and certain natural disasters such as flooding and enhanced environmental knowledge through scientific research and better understanding of natural phenomena that may affect us commerce for the most part the house and senate aligned with the administration for fy2001 in their priority to complete national weather service modernization this is true to lesser extent with some of the other environmental priorities of the clinton administration that were proposed noaa like other federal agencies is facing an aging research infrastructure which includes buildings equipment and research vessels and has pursued efforts over the past several fiscal years to modernize its research capabilities and facilities noaas chief financial officer is required to plan for longterm capital acquisition expenditures at the agency and to report these in noaas annual budget request under the procurement acquisitions and construction pac account in addition noaa has been challenged by some in congress to find cost savings improve internal management efficiency and demonstrate accountable results for its federal spending as many federal agencies have been consequently noaa as an agency of the department of commerce has implemented aspects of such laws as the 1993 government performance and results act gpra to improve its internal management and financial practices and is regularly reporting performance results on schedule that coincides with doc gpra requirements progress of nws modernization efforts the national weather service nws is nearing completion of its weather forecast and warning modernization effort nws has succeeded in consolidating andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30139crs22 closing most of its former weather service offices wsos which it credits to deployment of variety of new technologies for public forecast and warning of severe weather events in new highlyautomated nws weather forecast offices wfos however some in congress are concerned that nws coverage necessary for public warning of severe weather events has deteriorated as human observations are replaced by automated ones for example senate hearings in fy1999 resulted in the retention of nws central regional headquarters crh currently responsible for the midwest and central plains and gulf states rather than consolidating it with eastern regional headquarters in miami florida crh has been key player in tracking and forecasting hurricanes and tornadoes in region particularly prone to such severe weather furthermore congress has called for highly prescriptive measures to be taken before allowing nws to close wsos including certifi cation of deterioration in existing weather services including consultation with the secretary of commerce with modernization transition committee mtc prior to closure of any weather forecast offices see pl 102567 title vii weather service modernization section 705 for existi ng law hr 1553 the national weather service and related agencies authorization act proposed changes in this act dealing with noaa competition with the private sector for providing weather forecasts and warnings see noaa authorization below over time noaa has encountered problems with some private contractors who have provided the integral technological components of nws modernization congressional hearings have been held since fy1997 to examine schedule delays and cost overruns for example the automated surface observing system asos described as the senses of new wfos has required major rebuilds of its software and recalibration of some of its sensors the advanced weather interactive processing system awips described as the brain of nws modernization is the last major and some say most critical technological component nws has stated that awips will bring weather modernization efforts to fruition congress has questioned the schedule of implementation and final costs of awips and has mandated funding caps since fy1998 for fy2001 congressional funding for nws emphasized full deployment of awips in all wfos nws and the modernization transition committee continued to assess the performance of the suite of modernization technologies in operation with respect to determining whether there has been any degradation in services the mtc was disbanded in december 1999 after having reported its findings and recommendations to the secretary of commerce also for fy2001 the president requested 173 million for upgrading existing awips technology under pac to include communications enhancemen ts in hr 4690 the house approved 16 million for this activity but the senate appropriations committee approved the full amount requested by the administration hr 4292 approved 163 million for this activity noaa also has requested funding to continue to expand national advanced hydrologica l flood prediction system ahps and to replace its aging balloon

significant improvement in skill in the agencys severe weather forecast and warning capabilities in fy1995 to save agency costs congress directed noaa to cease rd spending on improvements for goes satellite technology it instead authorized offtheshelf technology for the next several ensuing goes launches noaa has also expressed concerns about nesdis funding levels given its statu tory requirements to collect longterm series of meaningful earth sciences data and weather measurements from space continued funding is reportedly critical because of past experiences which have resulted in data gaps due to satellite or sensor malfunctioning or launch failure or scheduling this is deemed especially important given the lack of redundancy of equipment to prevent such gaps the house approved some 497 million for these purposes for fy2001 and the senate appropriations committee approved 504 million an amount that president clinton had requested hr 4292 approved 581 million for this activity cost savings for nesdis have been anticipated through consolidation of noaa polar orbiting environmental satellites poes activities into joint national polar orbiting environmental satellite service npoess jointly managed by noaa nasa and dod of late the largest proportion of funding for npoess at noaa is found under the pac accoun t for fy2001 the house gave completion of
