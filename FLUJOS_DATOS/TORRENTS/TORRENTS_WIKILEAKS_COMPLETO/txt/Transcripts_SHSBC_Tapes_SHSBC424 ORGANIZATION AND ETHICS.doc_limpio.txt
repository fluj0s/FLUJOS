organization and ethics lecture given on 18 may 1965 thank you for forgiving whats the date male voice may 18 ad 15 may 18th ad 15 saint hill special briefing course saint hill england earth espinol confederacy this part of the universe is ours you dont know your address well i like to give people their address and location well iagain today im just filling in time theres nothing much to talk to you about hardly any data as matter of fact its quite the reverse some poor hco secs around the world are beginning to stagger under the burden of new policy letters and that sort of thing that have been coming out and i should let you in on what thats all about very simple they are the staff status policy letters which add up to the equivalent of about eight staff statuses and on the new org board we are going to remedy an old old evil in organizations by putting on the org board the fellows certificate initials after the name of the staff member and then his classification as an auditor and then the roman numeral which is his grade as pc and then that is followed by an arabic numeral which will give his staff status and his staff status simply depends on what studies he has completed on staff checksheet and it says then for what staff rank he is now qualified now the way it happened in the past is in trying to appoint somebody at far distance i was utterly unable to plow through all the fog and unknowns and so forth to find out who was there but under the new system we will be swapping org boards around through the organizations at mad rate and these org boards of course will be direct copies of the org boards so that in filling posts and that sort of thing it is very simple just to look at the org board and to find out well whos qualified for promotion see and in that particular way youll probably see something like this start appearing on an org board hgc staff auditor hga vii 9 see staff auditor what the hell is he doing as staff auditor see youll see one of the secretarial levels and so forth bs blank blank 1 of course youd never get anything that bad itd have to be deputy of the deputy of the deputy dont you see but nevertheless there is slot missing on the org board and heres somebody fitted by training and that staff status also includes factor of experience you see now to get itto be general staff member on the new org board person has to haveto become technical staff memberhas to have basic technical certificate and that is earned in the organization and it simply has to do with some of the basic and fundamental facts of the organization thats all its very very simple thing and for an administrative staff member to have anything more than temporary rating they have to have just their basic certificate which is just the basic organization certificate they know where the comm center is you know but nevertheless have to have studied for those things and passed the little checksheet that goes with them then theyre qualified as provisional and provisional would be staff status i and provisional of course can be shifted now provisional can be shifted about dont you see to balance up personnel and that sort of thing rather easily you dont have to ask his permission to do so and after period of time if that person gets his provisional status checksheet filled for his next one why he moves up to general staff member and at that time why he has equality privilege and fraternity dont you see and you have to shoot him in order to transfer him you get the idea in other words he has worked for and attained positionwhere he well he could be pretty sassy and still have nothing happen to him but then it goes on up from there there are the ranks in an organizationjust the same old ranks there have always been theres incharge rank that we have called from time to time this has popped up and disappeared and so forth weve called something an officer well an incharge would be the head of subsection or something like that its like address in charge youve seen that on boards and so forth well thats your first and lowest executive rating and then there is the officer rating which is simply the section hes in charge of section like you have here the cramming section well that would be the cramming officer and then you move up and theres couple ofor three designations that dont have any status as such but they are merely titles so you understand that there could be quite few titles on board which arent associated with status well theres this thing called communicator that doesnt have any rank or status fellow is communicator see and theres this thing called deputy you see deputy in front of name that doesnt mean theres anybody appointed to it post can also have deputies that has regular appointee you may see two or three deputies down from an hco exec sec you see deputy hco exec sec well it doesnt mean thing if the post is assigned locally by an organization why it may only be assigned as deputy if it is appointed from saint hill why then that becomes an acting which is the first rank and for while the post is held under an acting status and then is held in full status the acting is simply removed but youd know then the difference between local and saint hill appointment dont you see your local appointments are all deputy where they are executive appointments if theyre saint hill appointments why then they are acting or nothing in front of it you see that would be for instance say youd have such thing as deputy hco exec sec that would be one of the higherthe highest two ranks in the org that doesnt mean any permanency of any kind whatsoever small breath of air can come in the window and take that title off the board dont you see because its not anything but an assigned title its just somebody filling time until somebody can be put there or they can be confirmed dont you see then you see something like acting hco exec sec well youd know at once that that was saint hill appointment and that is an official appointment and after short period of time up to year why that title is held as acting and then is wiped out on the acting and becomes just hco exec sec and that was full appointment well when i say that there are some of these statuses that dont have any number after them dont you see its that type of thing you see deputywell that doesnt change anybodys number because theyre deputy see but person would have to have in actual fact the staff status of the post to be an acting so theyd have to pass the checksheets about the organization and so forth in order to be an acting appointment two or three things can occur then you can take person and put them on and see how they do dont you see well actually you cant wait for saint hill to investigate something while the post of d of t is going begging so somebody has to be assigned to this as deputy situation now that may or may not be reversed by saint hill you see and so local org could fill up almost any post with deputy rating they dont have to consult anybody but for that post to have any meaning or draw the pay of that level it would have to be filled from saint hill and of course saint hill is enormously assisted on this now because the department of examinations will be giving checksheet examinations for these and right now are giving checksheet examinations without the check sheet they just take blank piece of paper and every bulletin the person passes and policy letter they pass why they give them an okay on that as having been passed well thats later transferred over to the checksheet where it belongs so what im doing at this present moment is simply turning out the bulletins and policy letters and materials which are necessary for these various statuses and they look an absolute avalanche you see here is your status for director your status for secretary your status for executive secretary relatively undifferentiated these bulletins are just pouring out so one will be the theory of the organization itselfthe theory of its construction how it is put together and why dont you see well this thing is coming right out alongside of pens must be filled at nine oclock in the morning dont you see well of course thats an hco exec secs status theory of the organization how do you put it together what makes it tick theres an awful lot to know that way now one of the things thats interesting about these status hat books that will eventually be writtentheyre not now being written up in the form but in the eventual hat book youll find it an interesting thing some of these are now being put together but theres summary paragraph which takes the whole department and little sentence will take up the section that will be the works thats simply heads you see well we take department of review now the whole function and action of the department of review and everything that it does is all given in one paragraphthrirrrrpboom see and then each one of its sections is given in one sentence prrirup but that heads the writeupthe full writeupwhich just goes on page after page after page of the full writeup of the department of review and the full writeup of every one of its sections well person working in that zone who is slated for that quarter of the org of course knows the big portions but everybody else at certain status level has to know the little paragraphs and sentences thats so they merely know what thats for over there not how to run it so that they can work with it they say oh yes yes thats such and so section oh yeah well thats supposed to take the students and so forth yeah well actually how they do that is quite remarkable but isnt included in the broad training level so if fellow gets assigned then to department or division that he has not been in previously why in addition to that his status might not be disturbed but his appointment would remain acting do you follow until he had mastered that particular division and thats why the difference between the acting and the permanent appointment you get the idea so you never appointyou could take somebody from permanent appointment let us say of director of awell lets take the d of t hes permanent appointment d of t and you want to upgrade him and the post is open on qualifications division so well the secretary of qualifications is open and there is nobody eligible over in that line for status or longevity or anything else for it and hes obviously for it dont you see well you could make this person acting qualifications secretary and then confirm it at the time when he had burned the midnight oil on all of the hat books you see of that division and at that moment why he would become the qualifications secretary now that you might say is the longrange look and true enough youve got to start somewhere to bring order and organization into things and it is definitely the longterm look and its going to take quite while to build this up i dont imagine this will be in total operation before next week now im joking there i expect itll be in total operation all over the world by august in full cry its very interesting that orgs right now are they havent got the org board yet this is foul trick on my part it was not meaningful and so on but there were some other things that had to be gotten out before you could get out the org board and the org board shifted about bit and only couple of weeks ago settled down into some framework that looked very good and doesnt seem to be shifting framework at all there it is and now it just depends on the thirtyseventh hour of my day in order to get it done because ill have to letter itwrite it up and letter it totally ive just got it in rough draft right now ive got to put it in more amplified rough draft and then letter it and then take it down to the darkroom and make big copies of the thing and then shoot it out all over the place and theyll have their org board but this org boardbits and pieces of it have been released for instance the technical division was recently released well just their technical division i just told them to get in technical division and appoint an ethics officer and appoint director of examinations see that was all just their technical division and that and that well i showed them little picture in sec edmaybe you saw the sec edjust crudely handdrawn picture of the org board of the technical division and thats quite adequate and i told them to put it over underneath where they used to have the academy and the hoc and so forth and just put it down there in that form well theyll get it up there and so forth and then theyll find this horrible thing occur then theyll find that they more than have that technical division more or less set up they start to be hit by some of the traffic thats begun to move their ways by the way organizations are beginning to move off of emergency right now london just moved off of emergency today and was highly congratulated for it other organizations are coming up and things look pretty good but auditor 8 is going to hit in just matter of weeks in their areas to everybody in their areas and thats going to start building up traffic and that traffic will build in toward that technical division so im trying to get them to get technical division there in order to take care of the traffic and get their courses and so forth stretched out just right to take the heavier traffic see well thats dandy theyll do all that thats for sure and they start moving traffic through their technical division and theyll realize theyve got an ethics officer and the ethics officer will be finding his feet and straightening out the lines all the ethics really does is hold the lines firm so that you can route and audit you see all ethics is for in actual fact the totality of its operationit is simply that additional tool necessary to make it possible to get technology in thats the whole purpose of ethics is to get technology in well man doesnt have that purpose for his law and justice he wants to squash people who are giving him trouble that isnt the case in the handling of ethics its an entirely different operation and youll find out its fabulously successful operation theyll handle it with too much violence and theyll handle it with too light and theyll eventually get it adjusted and theyll eventually learn this fabulously simple point that ethics is there to let you get technology in you see its the tourniquet before the doctor arrives you got the idea it makes it possible to get technology in if an area is too enturbulated and theres too much chitterchat and yipyap going on in an area things are knocked apart and the people in it are being knocked around to such degree you cant get technical in all youve got to do is just shut it up long enough and say down dog right up to the point where you cantill the auditor arrives you get the idea so you can just hold that area now you straighten it out with ethics and then you get the technology lined up now auditors start to audit with the process theyre supposed to audit with see now the cases start to move through the hgc the way they are supposed to now the student begins to go up through his courses and get the material hes supposed to we dont have forgetful little omissions like not giving them any checksheets or anything see and this technical goes in see well when youve got technical in why ethics thats as far as you carry an ethics action you carry ethics action to the point where you get technical in further and its interesting to by certain comparative figures that the publication of suppressive as suppressive person is apparently the equivalent of public hanging you get exactlyim not speaking jokingly you get exactly the same responses from the individual and theres something interesting about that over the years i found out that when you cancel somebodys certificates bang within two or three years he was back straightened out and doing fine at the absolute outside two or three years but when you didnt cancel his certificates he wandered off and you never heard of him again and he went to hell now theres an interesting one for you thats simply an empirical datum for instance the other dayim now checking off all mailings that go out from organizations and the other day i was quite fascinated to see name as the featured scientology lecturer at big open evening that was being advertised every placea name and five six years ago at least that he went around in one small circle and he was pounding and screaming and howling and that sort of thing and he was going to do this and that and the other thing and so forth so i just told him well your certificates are cancelled and by the time you see fitthe way we did it in those daysto get yourself five hundred hours of auditing at your own expense i think it was why well entertain giving them back to you well what do you know at the time we used to do that they always used to put on they didnt care they didnt care but its very interesting how glad they always were to get their certificates back that was what was remarkable about two years went by and by george he did get his auditing he did get straightened out hes been doing fine ever since and here he is i noticed him the other day and so forth just checking through literature why hes the organizations featured lecturer at an open evening and so forth in other words everybody has forgotten about this until ive reminded you do you understand and when in other words you have exerted an orderly disciplinary action in some direction where somebody is wrecking people and trying to smash up the org and trying to push things around for some reason or other putting label on them brings them back and if you dont do anything about them at all not only does the enturbulation continue but they go off and get lost and go to hell in balloon isnt that an interesting thing so my data is quite positive in that direction that it is very unkind thing to do not to try to bring order into scientology area and its an extremely unkind thing to do not to give somebody hard knock when hes trying to knock down everybody else around him and say quiet fellow lets quit it now see its very interesting now man of course has tremendous reaction to something called justice and what he laughingly calls justice but of course man has understanding with which to back up any of these hangings that he commits himself to in other words he doesnt have real justice because it has end product its total end product is punishment its total end product is doing something now that it doesnt straighten out the community is manifest becausewell it does some good butperhapsbut its manifest in the fact that crime continues to rise across the world and the crime statistics of the world today are going up much higher and faster than population is increasing and its such worry to law enforcement officers today that those that i have spoken to just within the last year were in very apathetic frame of mind and they just wanted to lie down and quit thats funny frame of mind for the worlds best police force to be in isnt it well thats because theres end product well you put somebody in prison so you put them in prison so when you let them out of prison they go steal another car and you put them back in prison do you see worse than that they are incapable of doing more than worsening an individual with the type of disciplinary action which they employ so it has end product but punishment so its just old time mest universe punish everybody down with everybody dont you see well now you try to bring in an ethics system across this line of course you jar lot of peoples banks and that is quite easy to do because of course those words are to be found in the reactive mind as end words so as result youll get considerable reaction but its very interesting that much greater proportion of people in scientology today favor decent ethic level and favor ethics actions weirdly enough than are batting back against it because they see that this will square things up well actually what it eventually does is get them better training better processing better organization and better grip on the subject of scientology and less abuse with it thats the exact end product of an ethics action and ethics is onlypeople will have to learn this along these lines in scientology that the total extent of an ethics action is to get technology in thats all its for and not for anything else now you cant sentence people to technology thats quite interesting you cant sentence somebody to getting better but you sure as hell can sentence him to not getting better because after all what are we doing we are factually and only there gratuitously as matter of fact helping people to help themselves and to get better that is our total action now nobody has got pistol to our heads forcing us to do this so the only thing that we would do would be the normal thing which we would do anyhow after guy has made just so much ruckus we lose our desire to assist him and that is really the basic expression of an ethics action its simply an expression of this normal reaction of we dont care to assist you anymore or we dont care to assist you for week or two let you think it over do you follow so the end product of an ethics action is to get technology in and thats its total action now far from blowing up an organization if you very carefully look over the ethics levels actions or the justice actions of organizations and huge governments and empires and companies and this and that and compare these things you find some rather astonishing data falls out in your lap its so contrary to what you might believe that you might tend to discount it but after while the data itself is too overwhelming the taut ship the harshly run empire the viciously conducted regiment normally has very high esprit and works like mad can get itself out of most anything and survives practically forever and the sloppily run ones go by the boards quick i first got on the track of this in studying some time by the way when you havent anything else to do read gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire thats quite thing i undertook that some years ago because i was having trouble sleeping but i decided i would read it from one end of that manyvolumed volumes to the otherread the whole thing and it was quite an interesting exercise i hope i never get so ambitious as to start reading the encyclopaedia britannica from one end to the other but i will say i am running out of reading matter now that ian fleming has picked himself up another body may have to do it but i was considerably struck in this study by something i didnt understand at all and i couldnt make any sense out of it all and it just left gawpjawed only long periods of progressive rule and recovery from barbarian attacks and internal upsets were periods when the emperor was nut just sadistic boob it doesnt make any sense at all now good emperor would come in and he was going to straighten everything out and get the roads open and do all the progressive things he should have done and he would be dead from within two to eighteen months he would have been assassinated and everything would have fallen in and then another bloke takes over tortures everybody in sight shoots everybody down in flames throws them to the lions and the elephants because just that afternoon he was bored like caligula some fellow who was being king of the wood or something down somewhere south of town so he went down there with some bully boys and killed him just for the hell of it it was sort of shrine he felt like desecrating shrines that day he gave knighthood to his horse he was chattering maniac and he went on ruling tiberius pervertyears and years and years and he dies with his boots off quietly in bed surrounded by his weeping retainers but the next guy after that that says hes going to defeat the enemy and hes going to straighten out the empire and rebate taxes and do land reforms and do all the good things that you think good emperor would dodead and i couldnt believe it and that datum kept racking around in my belfry round and around and every once in while id well it had to be true because there it was its part and parcel of history so i looked it over and compared it to my own knowledge of the subject yeah that was true i never tried to run anything like that gee you know it just didnt make any sense to at all now i run an expedition or ship or something like that normally all the discipline that would take place on the thing is id whistle somebody up on the bridgewithout normal mast or anything that youre supposed to have you knowid just say this is just between you and youve let the side down boy now what you going to do about it and he would tell what he was going to do about it and that was the end of that and i used to have very nice quiet orderly ships i never lost anybody doing anything it was quite amazing see so this other didnt make any sense well apparently you could if you were dealing very intimately with relatively small group by the dint of personality alone spread out an area of calm that everything is orderly in all right now ill let you in on secret you is about ready to move out into that turbulent area called general public and hes nuts were longer just operating here see weve had our troubles internally but theyre always at the public points of the org theyre where the org is hit by the public in general see those are the points you can expect to go those are the first lines to go out well the registrarpc line just getting the pc fromto the registrars desk and getting the pc up to the d of p that is usually the first line to go well of course thats the receptionpublic entrance line and the lines in that vicinity are always shattering when im in an org i put that line together about everyonce every three months it just completely disappears and goes to pieces well thats an interesting thing isnt it i used to blame usnot very seriouslybut i used to think there was something dreadfully wrong with us that we tried to put movement of this magnitude and wiseness on earth and could still be that enturbulated and knocked about and so on i eventually got so i could look little bit outside the organization and i found out that we werent being knocked aboutthats whats funny compared to other things theyre really knocked around yeah but theyre held with brutal discipline to hold them in line at all theyre stood right up there very tight but in our length of time of existence weve seen several organizations go to pieces there are several governments that have gone downhill very markedly theyve become rather disorderly crime ratio has gone up the number of bankruptcies per the number of companies has increasedincreasedincreased its going up higher and higher the measures being taken by governments are normally aimed at managers theyre trying to sort of put things out of business the enturbulation there is very great the police officer has been less and less and less able to hold things and during that same period of time weve been more and more able to hold things and we have been getting better and better and our organization lines are becoming more and more sensible and we have had more and more durationthat is to say more and more survival potential and the technology at the same time was getting better of course but it was being better applied dont you see were running an exact reverse curve well we could keep this up for long long while we could go on our gradient scale and to some degree individually and otherwise why we will go on our gradient scale but if we suddenly start expanding organizations we are reaching straight out into that raw tumultuous mass called the public were reaching straight out into society that has never looked so good and was quite so bad in other words we had to have some kind of weapons some kind of tools to extend our reach so we could get our job done in time now all we had to do was extend our reach now how does scientology executive extend his reach how does scientology staff member extend his reach how is he able to hold more people still so that they can get processed how is he able to do this well i found out another factor and this is by the way the key factor that influences this i found out that as people moved on up toward ot that certain disdain occurred well it ceased to be important any more than you might consider it important to kick over an ant heap if things got too annoying or something like that somebody is going to bite do you follow somebody is going to bite so i started to design ethics when i saw that it was going to be necessary that people take orderly bites you see weve got to take orderly bites for instance before picking up the capitol at washington and turning it around on its base and setting it down again youd damn well better give somebody comm lets be legal about it now that sounds utterly incredible doesnt it and yet you really are looking at something like that it doesnt matter whether it is within your range of reality or not just envision it as possibility matter how fancy this might bebut still consider it as possibilitythat if beings became more and more powerful and they became annoyed about something and started to straighten something up theyre liable to straighten them up with such thoroughness that hardly anybodyd ever recover do you understand andthis is the other missing factorunless they have some orderly method of straightening things up they will take it upon themselves to straighten them up in their own jolly good way and itll make one hell of mess now there was the entrance point of ethics and the other side of the entrance point of ethics is as an organization expands i dont say that an ot should be under justice he must have some orderly agreed upon communication line by which he does something for instance im in an argument right now with washington dc on one simple fact our attorney there is absolutely aghast at the declaration of lyndon johnson as suppressive person he says this wont do at all well i dont know the guy is all over our backs i think hes suppressive he hadnt called off the fda were having to do it ourselves were having to go over and undo practically half the government to get the fda undone youre not kidding we are youre doing beautiful job over in washington do beautiful job not only do they have senate investigation of health education and welfare and the fda goingwhich probably will cost the fda the bulk of its appropriations and may kick the head outbut as soon as thats over the house is going to investigate the fda theyre already using our terms in the courts there when they discuss the matter the suit is only stated in the exact same terms which you could care to find in the policy letter which i wrote to cover it when it originally occurred and the terms which occur in those policy letters and so forth are now part of us court pronouncements so we can reach and of course i was just joking i did suggest you see however that the president of the united states should at least be given an amnesty and that we do this thing in an orderly fashion and i really didnt see any reason why you couldnt consider him suppressive if he was trying to wipe out our organization by not calling off his dogs i thought that was some of his responsibility but our attorney says that this would make the president mad now its interesting that this is not contested by our attorneys because it is silly and our attorneys down in victoriawere being less successful in this argument were arguing back and forth but now rather soft approach is being used on this and were trying to get it done let ask you this burning questionlet ask you this burning question are you for just shooting somebody down without warning or do you want ethics see thats the question now what are you in favor of the kind of law that just freakishly and like the thunder and lightning all of sudden strikes down anybody in sight or is it the kind of law that you say here is the path narrow as it may seem you try to take scientology out of the running and thats off the edge of the path and if you have done that things are now going to happen and we do them in very legal fashion in other words we have illegal hangings every one of our hangings is legally done you get the idea theres always thirteen turns in that hangmans noose see theres always thirteen steps to that gallows in other words even blind man would find out after while that he was being warned you get the idea now this doesnt happen to be for i can handle you guys i can handle lot more but what am i supposed to do stand around here as the only cop now right now what youve got in essence is little system of ethics which is being adjusted in actual usebeing adjusted and its procedures are being looked over and its working very very nicely and of course it isnt too different than what weve been doing but its being done on scheduled action and it is effective and the only reason its there is to hold things quiet until technology can be gotten in all right very good in acting along these particular lines we of course have it rattling around inside organizations rattling around scientologists i imagine there are two or three people here on staff right now that probably in the last twentyfour hours have seen an ethics report handed in on them of one kind or another just some executive handed in an ethics report on them see did willfully and knowingly upset the ashtray all over my shoes theyre becoming used to the tools of the thing and with familiarity they will then be able to use it sensibly theyre now finding out how much shock you can give somebody with scientology ethics it is brutal dose man when its shoved all the way home and they find out how lightly it has to be used the lightness of use is fantastic for instance we have had somebody who worked at saint hill here as cleaner for many years and amount of talking to her amount of persuasion by others has caused her to find out that there was an organization present or there was any kind of an organization going on she just works for mary sue and myself and she goes on and she does all this work and so forth and if anybody else talks to her why she goes up in screaming fit well now you would expect ethics would upset somebody like that but quite on the contrary i turned her in the other day for scarred frame on door obviously some heavy piece of furniture had been slammed against the door like an elephant butting into it something very undelicate and i wrote out an ethics chit and of course sent her her copy now you would have thought shed have blown screamed and so forth she very nicely then answered up on the thing and stated that it had been done by workmen when they were moving furniture up on that floor and she did identify it and so forth and so help pete today turned in damage report on broken curtain cord that she had found in the house and forwarded it to ethics from person who very short time ago just considered that we were all lot of nuts that was an awful upgrade of case if youre going to handle things in your immediate environment if youre going to handle this mass of public out here if youre going to handle raw meat and all of its suppressions and potential trouble sources and all the rest of this and the various ills that we run into when we handle these people youre going to need weapons with which to do it you start funneling them into the organization and this guy says nyahyah yah3 and he starts knocking around wrrhwrrhwrrhwrrh well if you have any familiarity with this thing called ethics youll be able to tap him on the shoulder and he wont yahyahyah at least if he does hell yahyahyah someplace else you understand now you would be surprised what this does technically how it backs up your technical now here at saint hillin our new activity which we call an hgc and which we had public pcs for to amount to anything so we constituted qualifications division here at saint hill we put our technical division together and then put our qualifications division together and whats going together right now is the qualifications division in full when we get the qualifications division in full again well come back to the technical division and put it together again more broadly dont you see well play it against these two factors whats getting all the attention right now is the qualifications division now in the handling of these various lines it is simply putting up channels for people to travel on now if you are going to do your job at all you are going to have to have some way to route and handle without getting into an altercation every time you said boo now in this hoc that we had running and so forth we had two persons now so far that would have just baffled d of p to the end of time the d of p just would have gone around holding his head in his hands and wondering what to do and he would have been sending cable to saint hill or something like this and he just would have been worried about this and so forth he wouldnt have known what to do because those were spook cases those two cases they ran like dream got tone arm action they went outside and collapsed now one is collapsing on highly cyclic basis hes up on tuesday and down on wednesday see three days ago hes telling somebody how bad off he is but just today theres despatch in saying how hes just found out his chest and asthma have cleared up well you can absolutely count on the fact that within thirtysix hours its how bad off he is again this case is rolly coaster case what is rolly coaster case this is your technical advance your rolly coaster case is potential trouble source and just on the other side of him there is suppressive person invalidating his gains and that suppressive person was always out of our view before and we could just hold our heads in our hands saying why does that guy get so good and get so bad and how does he go up and down well ill audit him some more the one thing you must never do is audit potential trouble source hes never going to get any betternot until hes labeled as potential trouble source and told to disconnect or handle hes going to go bzzzzzzzzz and actually its an awful mess because by the fact hes getting better he then becomes such threat to the suppressive person that he just gets done in his environment becomes absolutely unlivable to the degree that he makes progress the pressure has got to come back against him and youre just killing the guy the better you make him the more hes going to be hit from the other side and sometimes you dontwell you dont even know the identity of this person see so you see case going bzzzzbzzzzblu what is this he was in wonderful shape when he left your auditing room terrible shape on tuesday then he comes back and you give him little assist see now hes fine on wednesday on friday you meet friend of yours and say you know that pc of yours well he was threatening to commit suicide last night and they had to call in the police what in the name of god is going on youd think see big mystery created youd blame it on your auditingwhat had you done youd blame it on the technology you were using didnt have any relationship to it at all just on the other side of this boy and out of the sight of the auditor was suppressive now how are you going to handle the suppressive well youd certainly better label him one way or the other now nobody is handling this person and theyre stark staring mad what do we do with this guy how do we handle this bird well how we handle him isby george you better not go on processing that fellow you better not because youll make him worse matter what you do about it youll make him worse its not that your technology isnt working thats the trouble it is youre spoiling somebodys total svengali control here and the harder you push at it and the better you make himyou could wind him right up you know with cyanide pills in the coffee you understand youre putting him in grave danger of his life so whats the nice thing to do hes always had this problem around him but nobody ever said your problem fella do something about it see so you give him little policy letter on the subject of the potential trouble source and it tells him what hes got to do you dont even have to issue an ethics order on such an action unless watch this nowunless technology doesnt go in see in other words if we can get technology in short of shooting somebody we will you see but supposing he starts going yowyowyow and so forth and poor agnes she has perfect right to berate because i am such dog boy this guy is caved in isnt he now he says well if you wont process i guess i will just have to leave scientology too to go off in my own way with agnes one agnes suppressive person one pc anot just pts now he elected himself out in other words the degree of action which you can put against him to straighten out the situation is quite considerable now the normal action would be to tip somebody off on this even with an ethics order this is quite normal action not the preferred or the ordinary procedure im just saying its just one that could be done cases vary you would say now you know youre going to be labeled pts potential trouble source here and if you can just get your wife in before she is labeled suppressive person she can be processed but after that point why we couldnt touch herif it goes this far and theres lot of trouble in this so why dont you get her over here and get her audited now frankly you wouldnt be able to do this in an organization which was just teaching and processing up to level i because suppressives let tell you by experience are pretty crazyyou understandtheir normal run now if person isnt very crazy you hand the label to him hell straighten out he can see the light but if hes real crazy man he cant see anything hes just got to fight well if you knew what he was fighting you wouldnt feel so sorry for him hes back there on the track few trillion years fighting the ugbugs hes solving present time problem which hasnt in actual fact existed for the last many trillennia in most cases and yet he is taking the actions in present time which solve that problem with the ugbugs what the devil is that all about well its the guy is totally stuck in present time hes got 999999999 percent of his attention units are at some past period of the trackan exact precise past period of the track and in that precise exact instant he is fighting off something and is trying to handle something by some means and those are the means and practices which he is using in present time he does not have any problem with you you do not have any problem with him at allnone you arent back there where he is and he isnt up where you are now you can assume there are problems but that isnt the problem hes trying to solve and that is the whole anatomy of psychosis and i knew we would find it someday thats the whole anatomy theyre just stuck on the backtrack with 99999 percent and theyre fighting off theyre trying to give the person poison before they can be strangled themselves so theyve got to go around and theyve got to give everybody poison you see and then they reclassify poison because that is too direct you see by cross association identification and so forth why then theyve got to do something to get somebody to do something and they just see it and it just adds all up and everything becomes everything and associative restimulators are all over the place and theyre actually performing this same action theyre performing this same action so of course you try to help this person he misidentifies you at once just like mad dog does you extend any help in his direction and he bites you of course hed bite anybody that came anywhere near him why the guy is stuck on the backtrack and the flying saucer pilots are getting him dont you see anybody that approaches him or tries to have any effect upon him of any kind whatsoever is immediately and instantly identified as flying saucer person or something of the sort and therefore has to be shot down in flames and killed and so on hes just defending himself in some mad insanity against things that are longer there and so on he falls into several categories as he does this and theyre very short and all that material is at class vii but the action here that he is trying to do is mistimed that is to say it wasnt successful back then but hes still trying to do it now only hes trying to pull it on you so your effort to solve his problems do not in actual fact solve the problem he is in because hes in problem with somebody that hasnt got anything to do with you now you could blame yourself and say i wonder why im having so many problems with this person when in actual sober fact you arent having any problems with this person youre not even giving that person any problems do you see hes just fighting off this chimera now another thing is is when he is driven down to the first dynamic to that degree he of course then will attempt to solve things by knocking off everyone else thats perfectly good solution the way to live is to kill everybody so if he sees anybody getting any stronger or any better he goes stark staring mad this is the one thing which mustnt happen nobody must get better because these flying saucer pilots if they got any stronger theyd be able to get him so nobody must get any better thats the one thing which mustnt happen so scientology will get it right in the teeth the better we get you seeand the better known it is that we are actually helping people you may thinkyou may think that the saving grace of scientology is for everybody to know that it works instantly and immediately and just goes fine oh that is the moment when you had better start watching out weve gotten by so far because it is well known that were complete frauds its almost as if i designed it that way well right now were about to stick our necks out we can handle anything that breathesrapidly and immediately we can push somebody up to clear and we can push them up to ot here we sit weve got the technology we have the organizational technology and as we start to expand and we start to have broad dramatic effect upon the communityalready were within an inch of it were receiving bid and are in receipt of bid that is from vicinity of the united nations to train scientologists for it very interesting international city is being listened to the only organization i wrote it for was the united nations youve never seen mention it since i knew sooner or later theyd tangle up with it because they havent got any other solution theyve tangled im talking about wednesday night now organizations start beefing up and getting big and sassy and their pricing range and amount of service and that sort of thing starts to improve now im not trying to run through just public weve got to retrain psychologists psychiatrists doctors weve got to train them we got to handle them some of those guys are pretty batty fortunately for us theyre not all crazy but some of them are real crazy how do we handle them are we going to sit around and argue ourselves deal dumb and blind about how we are not actually trying to hang them from the local rafter that our process is an entirely different thing do we go on exhausting all of our energies on the more suppressive members of the society or do wedo you expend those same valuable energies upon the broader body of the society which do we do well we certainly had better get out of the road the boys who want to stop us because theyre not trying to be convinced theyre just trying to stop you if you made those flyingsaucer pilots any stronger man theyd have it see they know whats dangerous and thats people who get any bigger or tougher because after all theyre in this terrible state of having to fight off all these people and very hard to do being followed by green alligator you havent had much experience yet on this level chart we havent actually given you much data about it but as you start to put that togetherand certainly those of you who move into level vii youre going to be aghast youre going to be aghast at how wrong you have been you have been wrong youve been wrong right along with youve considered the insane portion of the society lower than it was its very very high and you start running right down amongst the grass roots on these people and you find out what they really think and what they really been up to all the time they were walking around wearing their cute little old ladys bonnetkrdrdrdrdand life is going to be to you much more exposed affair and people are going to stretch out there and the sheep and the goats are going to be looking different and youre going to find out that some of these people that you had little bit of trouble with and you thought they were just kind of tough caseif you ever go back and process one of those guys your hair will stand on end tough case what the hell were you doing in the same room with gorilla weve gone through one of these periods of finding out more about man and mankind that of course we couldnt crack the back of whats the anatomy of insanity and we know that now and you canif you recall or look over literature and so forth of those days i said the one thing you could understand about insanity is that we didnt know anything about it and it was incomprehensible and that was the thing you could understand about insanity and we left it parked there well weve gone on to this point and i can tell you down to gnats eyebrow what insanity is see insanity is now comprehensible totally comprehensible ive just described it to you you didnt find that very complicated did you guy is stuck on the time track fighting off the werewolves haha its not my guess man its not my guess thats subjected to processing proof that happens right before your eyes at vii pow there he isboom and thats the end of that process you see in dianetics we were trying to run the trackwe were trying to run the whole track and trying to make the track be good and so forth weve moved so far in fifteen years that what might have taken us thousands and thousands of hours of very good processing can now be done in less than fifty with total positiveness on an insane pc thats progress you hit the society with that you better damn well have the organization you better damn well have the training you better damn well have the ethics to back you up adrdrdrdr talk about jumping into the tigers mouth to see if he has halitosis i dont fancy myself in the role of having to be the only one who can bring any order the only one who can straighten up something the only one you know that only one gets tiresome after while you know of course it would at once be lie to say i didnt do the work but would also be an imposition to say i was the only one who could then ever do anything you see these two points are different so if i have any trouble at any time handling some suppressive at five or six thousand miles im sure some executive someplace is having trouble handling him on the other side of the desk so ive tried to give him weapons with which he could handle this situation and those weapons are fitted well technically potential trouble source does behave that way suppressed person is in that condition if you label the person you can resolve the situation and get technology in if you dont label them and dont call spade spade you will never get the technology in if you dont clear the way for technology and use it to get technology in its going to take you many times as long to get the technology in so it speeds it up how long does an ethics action last an ethics action lasts until technology is in elementary how much ethics do you use you use enough ethics to get technology in when do you stop an ethics action well you stop it when youve got technology in this is very elementary and very funny because somewhere along the line youre going to have somebody complaining about all these unfinished cycles of action somebody is going to complain about them but hed be fool if he did theres been an interrogation madly in progress there have been interrogatories going out to this or that and the other thing there is data being amassed theres stuff being put in folders theres programs of whole investigation of this and that is going forward theres paper paper paper paper piling up here and theres more work being done and comm ev has now been formed up and theyre busy choosing interested parties to this comm ev and so forth and all of sudden you dont hear anything about it anymore at all its just dead vacuum what happened to all this technology got in you understand what was all that doingness well that doingness was going to go all along and mounting up higher and higher and higher until technology finally got in somewhere along the line you see its total planning and ill tell you the awfulest thing you ever saw in your life terrible thing has just occurred lives are being blasted ruin stares many people in the face in the london area at this exact moment theres long long list of interested parties that contain amongst them several very suppressive people and some who are just there for witness purposes oh its very serious affair its committee of evidence to obtain data on the spreaders of false and malicious rumors so that they can be sued by the association for redress and damages and that moved right out into civil law didnt it in other words thats committee of evidence married up with civil law and it means business too if it doesnt settle down why it will go on proceeding dont you see but what actually is occurring poor little old hco up there has been just knocked around by suppressives until it doesnt know whether its coming or going so i just used this mechanism to say down dog lets have nice quiet quiet area while we get hasi london put back together again see theres fake about it but to show you how bad it is since hco has been putting it in up thereputting ethics inand straightening it up straightening it up straightening it up theyve been on steady increase and theyve been on sufficiently steady increase that they are now the first org out of an emergency area isnt that interesting and theyre going to have the ten fifteen people that are stark staring nuts in the london areaout of all of those millions of people in london you see theres only this little handful and theyre just going to be as quiet as smothered bird going to be real quiet and during their quietude technology will get in its all very interesting because its all very serious and yes it could go right on through to final conclusion that did blast this that and the other thing and would blow up most anything but its question then of when this technology will get in well in london thats the only question its not question of where does the ethics proceed that is not the question at all its how long do you have to hold the area down now maybe the hco sec up in london can breathe she was being bothered the last couple of days lot by interested parties calling in and saying they were innocent and hadnt said anything and nobody was saying anything and everything was awful quiet where they were which i thought was very healthy sign you would be surprised how psychopathic some of these things can be because proceeding from psychopath of course theyre psychopathic you have idea some of the rumors that go aroundor maybe you do theyre utterly fantastic its all the more incredible because how the hell would i have time to do these things how the hell would anybody have time to do these things here i am at work hammer and tongs turning out bulletins and plans handling despatches and roaring it up and trying to form up this and straighten up that and so forthand somebody thinks ive got time for some of these other actions tshuth they compliment and heres probably the only outfit that ever hit this planet that meant exactly what it said and was doing exactly what it was doing and was doing exactly nothing else and was achieving its targets right straight along the linepow pow pow and this organization is guilty of yackyackyackyackyack and yackyackyackyackyack and the other day yekyekyekyekyoh i fortunately have some knowledge of the psychopathic personality and what he will do and imagine but its sometimes very peculiar how they can dream it up one of them the other dayvery interesting up in londonill just tell you this little aside and so forth boy he had everybodyoh these big generalities you seehe had everybody in east grinstead was suing saint hill because saint hill was totally broke you see and our accounts were all in bad shape and everything was bad you see big great genera saint hill is absolutely paid right up to the notch the only suits in progress at the present moment are those that were leveling to collect little money from some private persons that owe us some dough not even scientologists huhhhh you never saw happier more prosperous picture you never saw public atmosphere around and about that was calmer see but this guy is saying and its all in jam and do you know what its about and my authority is my attorneys which are down in east grinstead and murhurhur and merhurhurhurhur oh hes just having ball see so the other day they lowered slight boom on this particular direction and they called spade spade and he was put as part of that comm ev up in london and you know he came in and told the people that he had told all this to who had sat and listened to him and taken the notes on it that he had never said anything like that before in his life he had never mentioned it what people would miss about this he believes that he believes that just as he himself never said it in the first place it was some circuit see why of course now he says with perfect truth that he never said it thats true how the hell could he say anything he hadnt been there for seven trillion years well anyway right nowright now withwhen we havent got things straightened out along on the new org board and few things like that you see more of ethics internally in organizations than you might ordinarily see when youre sitting out along one of these organizational channels one day youll just thank your stars youre sitting there maybe as an examiner and so forth and some student will come in and fly up in your face and so forth and all you told him is hed better study his emeter little bit harden and he just takes your head off and practicallyso forth and at that moment its choice between restraining yourself from frying his brains and sending chit to ethics so it will accumulate in his file and i think youll be very happy to send little chit to ethics and say doakes discourtesy to examiner ethics of course nothing happens to doakes in actual fact nothing will happen to doakes for days or weeks but sooner or later somebody will decide that its too enturbulent right now in that particular course and so theyll go look in the ethics files and they add them all up and they find one nice fat file and they feel they need head on pike so there is doakes theres his head on pike now we find out that all during this time that it wasnt hit or miss or by chance and so forth we find out he in actual fact hasnt been making any progress and it was actually damned lucky for us that we found out about it now because we can do something about it so anyway youll find out that the organization will run as long as it has channels and as long as the particles on those channels dont carom off the sides of the channels and collide with the working parts of the organization now if you can bring that about then you can have an organization that has total capability of pouring through it practically the whole human race in the absence of holding the sides of the channel being able to remove the barriers to progress in the absence of such tool why you just couldnt ever work up to volume everything has to be handled on such tiny particularized individual basis and people are caving in and you have to replace your registrar every three months because the public impact wears her out dont you see that sort of thing well you dont need that sort of thing as it goes so im sure im sure that the boys with the more entheta look at life got it all figured out that weve all gone stark staring mad you see with all this justice were just having little fun with justice just now and when we learn about it why well be able to control fairly wide sphere of public in such way that they dont all get destroyed thats the main danger the main danger to them is not ethics its having their silly heads blown off because they make somebody mad seenot i wouldnt blow their heads off but i cant guarantee somebody else wont so there is more or less the way that things fit together these days heres the direction that were going as matter of fact its probably with your heads stuck down amongst the textbooks and wrapped around in the environment with various particles flying around and handling all sorts of small problems and that sort of thing it may sometimes look like youre not really moving or going anyplace or things are happening which are very poor indeed and so forth well you just take little bit of an overall look at the situation and you find out that its pretty pretty darned fantastic the only thing thats wrong with scientology these days is the advances are quite unbelievable nobody could do this in fifteen years its not possible youre going to see scientology in size and so forth which compares to some of your very large industries in the not distant future you will have amongst you not just scientologists youre going to have to fall back on lot of wog man you cant make scientologists that fast and use them in admin it wouldnt be possible yeah well you could give them beginning scientology course and you could do that well here at saint hill ive already piloted the operation ive been working alongside of nonscientologists on staff for quite while and its very easy to do as long as you have discipline in when they begin you got to have discipline in when they begin and let them go along with it and let them know something about it and handle it and handle it in disciplined fashion if you do that you dont get any troubleinto any trouble with nonscientologist he knows where he stands he knows what the score is and hell work hell work very nicely and scientologist can work right alongside of him as matter of fact if he happens to be stark staring madand i do mean that advisedlyof course you have some collision because you always do but in actual fact over period here of six years easily 70 80 percent of the work at saint hill has been done by nonscientologists who didnt know anything about it at all so in your large central organizations youll find out the technical and qualifications division your upper executive levels and so forth will be mainly composed andtheyll be actually totally composed of trained personnel but then even in those divisions all of your clerical actions everything connected with filing and typing and keeping address plates and putting things together and all of the types of clerical actions you can shake stick at lots of professions that you could name will be mixed up in that organization well it has to be kept and straightened out and that organization has to be straightened out too thats been one of the little things that has been very hard in putting together the org board how do you put together an org board that doesnt take scientologist to keep it straight see and thats one of the things thats been solved in relationship to this because that takes considerable amount of discipline they find out that discipline is much better than the one in the factory which they just left but if you dont have any discipline at all they just collapse they feel theythat you re soft in the head or something and they dont know what to make you out they walk around they havent got any walls to bump into theyre very used to disciplinary walls you see unless you give them some they feel quite disturbed and quite lost and quite unsafe actually so weve piloted this out so thats one of the factors of expansion and then youre expanding into public where law and order has actually ceased to exist today you could more get person arrested for stealing your pocketbook than you could fly to the moon on washboard if the cop did arrest him he probably wouldnt even bother to take him in front of the magistrates court youd just be very interested if you wanted to talk to the police this isnt being advertised of course it just happens to be deadly true youre walking out into society that is losing its grip on order and its pretty poor show now youve got the additional fact that when you put in stable datum enturbulence will blow off well lets not get all the enturbulence in our teeth let somebody else have it in their teeth too the net result of what were doing is trying to make an orderly show for the future those of you who are aboard at this particular timemay not on course for instance may not sometimes feel that you are handled with all the gentleness that you might be handled that youre maybe yanked into this pattern and yanked into that pattern and so forth and i dont come out and hold your hand its not that i dont want to talk to youa long way from it and so forth i miss talking to you as heavily as my schedule is put together its almost impossible for to turn around twice i have to economize and only turn around once the main thing about it is is i do get individual reports on this that and the other thing thats going on i know about where you sit and know just about what the score is and youll find at this moment sec ed is transferring those students who have been on slow drag over considerable period of time into special completion unit under review at cost to themselves which pulls them off of the lines puts them back on the original checksheets theyre on so they can finish that with cycle of action and get what they came for and also have their cases straightened out and be terminated that of course unmatches the unmatched particle flow in other words the student who has lagged behind weve had unit on emergency and this is more or less the way im ending the emergency you might say were pretty well ending the unit but what were doing in actual fact is simply the machine now you might say is geared to take certain particle flow of students along certain particular line well those who have been dragging are certainly going to get less attention unless they are given some special attention on this and those that are overdue up into the next slots and so forth had better be handled well the place to handle that is qualifications division because it corrects whats going on on the assembly line dont you see it takes things that cant run on the assembly line and puts them over and handles these and thatll probably be taking place here tomorrow morning the next day there will be mad scramble on this but the whole action is ive seen here very plainly that there are certain people who just plainly would never finish up at all unless theyre given some specialized attention on the thing and i dont intend to lose them we need every auditor weve got you see changes like this sometimes you dont see the overall picture and its little bit hard to understand and it sometimes works some privation or upset on you once in while something like that well im not trying to tell you its all for the best in this best of all possible worlds because that would tell you at the same time that i never make any mistakes i donti dont work on that formula at all i just try to be right far more often than im wrong and then i consider if thats that and then we take care of that then it will somehow or another work out its highly satisfactory in the final analysis its not so satisfactory of course when you happen to be the one who gets caught in the wrong solution but theres always of course one thing you can count on im the first one to change it when i find out its wrong well anyway i wish you lots of success with youwith this new lineup and with the new unit that youll be moved over onto and im officially as of this moment ending the emergency on unit c without shooting anybody in flames its been lecture more or less on organization and ethics and how those thing compare to each other and what their actual use is and i hope you can benefit from it to some degree thank you very much
