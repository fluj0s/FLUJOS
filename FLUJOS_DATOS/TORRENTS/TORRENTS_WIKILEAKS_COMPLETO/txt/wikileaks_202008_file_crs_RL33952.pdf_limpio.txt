summary the single european payments area sepa is planned electronic payments system that upon completion in 2010 would allow individuals sm all and medium sized businesses and corpor ations to make electronic payments throughout the european union as efficiently and safely as such payments are being made on the national level today the major piece of legislation to create sepa the payment services directive was proposed in 2005 but has been tied up in the european commission disagreements among member states about the capital requirements of financial services firms offering cro ssborder credits and payments services and limiting the antitrust powers of eu member states governing financial services were two of the major reasons for the protracted legislative debates however on march 27 2007 the council of economic and fina nce ministers agreed on compromise on these two issues that still needs the european parliaments approval congress is interested in sepa because it has been monitoring the european unions effort to unify its 27 member countries financial markets congress recognizes that upon implementation of thes efforts such as the eu financial services action plan fsap the financia l conglomerate directive fcd and now the payment services directive psd could significantly impact american firms the european payments systems are extremely fragmented there are 31 national systems including norway switzer land iceland and liechtenstein that are governed by national and local laws and pr actices on average the cost of making payments in the eu remains relatively ex pensive even though more lessexpensive electronic payments are being made replacing the more costly cash and papercheck payments european payment services cost s include the inefficiencies caused by the use of nonstandard customer interface in compatible formats between foreign and domestic banks and less automate d internal banking systems by one measure these inefficiencies and others are estimated to cost the eu between 2 and 3 of its gross domestic product gdp the imf estimated eu gdp w ill be 176 trillion in 2008 which would mean between 352 and 528

eurozonewide electronic payment services sepa is expected to allow individuals sma ll and mediumsized enterprises smes and cor porations to make electroni c payments throughout the eurozone as efficiently and as safely as such payments are being made domestically today sepa is to bring about similar economically unifying effects in electronic payments as the euro banknotes and coins brought about since their january 2002 introduction because of th at introduction businesses and individuals in the eurozone are able to make cash payments within and across 15 countries using single purse of currency the most recent plan is to include all 31 european union member states as well as norway sw itzerland iceland and liechtenstein which have agreed to participate in the euro payment system2 sepa has been work in progress since its conception in 2002 numer ous delays and lack of legislative and regulatory agreements have frustrated the european commission in brussel its main advocate3 even though the private european banki ng industry is expected to pay for sepa the lack of progress could be explained by the european bankers uncertainty about their ability to profita bly recoup their costs once the system is constructed in 20104 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33952crs2 5 for an updated version of this legisla tion visit h ttp wwweuroparleuropaeuomk

european and american financial markets major recent development in the european efforts to unify its markets was that on march 27 2007 the eu council of economic and finance ministers agreed to compromise on two controversial issues the capital requirements for financial services firms offering crossborder credit and payments services and limiting or preempting the antitrust powers of eu memb er states over financial services under their jurisdiction because of these unresol ved issues the european parliament failed to take scheduled december 12 2006 vote on the payment services directive psd that the european commission published in 20055 the psd is aimed at removing most of the legal and regulatory barriers to market competition in the european union particularly the eurozone and overcoming the regulatory obstacles to intereurozone payments the direc tive for example addresses fundamental questions raised regarding liability and burden of proof in cases of credit

the medium to long term the european banking industry will benefit from cost savi ngs regarding euro area payments and also from poten tial new revenue streams6 besides the political controversies the european banking indus try does not seem to be convinced about the future benefits conse quently it has been tardy deve loping sepa the slowness of the creation of sepa s brought criticisms of the epc and the banking industry including threat of possible regulatory intervention unless efforts to create sepa are sped up7 the epc response was that sepa is on schedule in accordance with the revised december 2004 roadmap th revisions clearly overlooked the benchmarks set in the earlier roadmap of 200220108 on the government side concerns were expressed by the european commission and the european central bank because the epc has missed critical points on its own roadmap one argument the european commission put forth is that epcs efforts so far would not remove th fragmentation of the eurozone payments system because the needed massive irreversible migration of users from the current dominant national systems to sepa may not come about some in the european central bank argue that the banking industry should speed up the sepa implementation process9 in defense of the epc gerard harsink its chairman responded that the council was responsib only for drawing up the rules and standards for the payment produc ts and for implementing them10 t h implementation is being held up by lack of approval of the psd which is aimed at integrating the existing national payment systems into

european commission in this situation there is risk that member states can face legal action by private parties who might claim damages for losses incurred because of late implementation of national legislation11 the risk of such damage claims is because financial firms throughout the eu have incurred major expenditures in preparation for the implementation of the mifid the uk financial services authority has estimated the changes being made by financial firms in the uk could run up to 2 billion the market in financial instruments directives was implemented on november 1 2007 on schedule even though some mber states had not finalized their implementing legislati on the european commission was criticized by representatives from several european fi nancial advisory bodi for implementing the mifid which will impose huge adminis trative burdens on the eu securities industry without any apparent benefits to the industry12 these european securities dealers and managers are concern there will not be consistency in the implementation and enforcement of mifid by the 27 member states these concerns are raised because they found the mifid too vague in its definitions of such terms as competence and best execution which c ould lead to an uneven playing field because of different interpretations the eu payments system when sepa is developed it will be one of the worlds largest

by the use of non standard customer interfaces incompatible formats between foreign and domestic banks and low degree of automa tion in banks internal systems19 the eus main argument for sepa is that it would lead to less fragmented payments system that would benefit from economies of scal and reduced transaction costs the european banking industrys concern about sepa is par tly that it will have to restructure its currently profitable wholesale and retail payments system to accommodate sepa sepa is expected to have the greatest impact on retail transactions small value transactions the wholesale large value transactions electronic payments system which handles most of the crossborder transactions is functioning well but it too must be rest ructured in support of the argument for sepa the eu commission found huge price differences in providing payment services among member nations the difference was as high as eight times in addition in some countries the standard execution time for crossborder payments is one day while in others it takes up to three days20 the wholesale ectronic payments system most wholesale transactions are made through major banks with corresponding banking relationships with local banks in most important foreign cities at least 80 of banktobank crossborder payments are made through corresponding banking arrangements or via intrabank transactions

electronic messaging systems is the society for worl dwide interbank financial telecommunications swiftthe retail electronic payments system on the retail side the construction of sepa began in february 2004 but soon ran into difficulties in assessing the different euinfrastru ctures in place for processing payments the european banking industry opted for the creation of pan european automated clearing house pea ch ach systems are large volume electronic payment processing systems the system usually enables corporations and consumers to make routine payments more efficiently than cash or checks payrolls recurring bill payments and government payments to individuals and agencies such as social security benefits are examples of typical ach payments achs are broadcasters of payments to many payees or receivers of payments from many payees for single ach customer peach would be able to make these payments throughout the europan union but would have required banks to either close their systems and move to another infrastructure or transform proven and fficient national achs into peachs in 2005 number of existing automated clearin ghouses declared their intention to become sepacompliant without necessa rily transforming their systems into peachs indications are that the eurosystem would accept this approach it encourages both the migration of national to sepacompliant infrastructures and the establishment of additional peach pr oviders to encourage the necessary competition in the market23 the banking industrys effort to minimize costs has been contributing factor in the slow ness of implementing the peach process24 furthermore there is little confidence among financial analysts that these systems will work efficiently together while the openness to variety of sepa compliant infrastructures facilitates agr eements among the eu member countries it undercuts capturing the cost savings from econo mies of scale it is essential that critical mass of payment instruments is processed in the peach infrastructure including local volumes in order to be competitive with the lower unit costs of the large national achs major reason for the resistance to sepa is that the bulk of the costs of processing intraeu payments lies within the financial institutions client orderreporting automation back office auto mation critical mass of payments is needed to significantly reduce the unit cost of this processing excess profits in the retail electronic payments systems t h fragmentation in eu financial markets with 27 national

weighted average profit ratio varied from 3 to 147 with an average of 65 suggesting strongly that there are excess profits in the eu credit card market source commission services retail ba nking

the european commissions study from which this data wa s obtained the weighted average fee for 100 atm withdrawal on another bank with debit card is 114 however the fee charged ranged from pennies to

average fee in the 12 eu member states was 2 however the weighted average fee ranged from 0 to 10 the study concludes that the charact eristics of the reta il banking industry make it difficult to

directive in september 2005 the european paymen ts council adopted the sepa direct debit rulebook for national cons ultation what the member nations had to consider in this rulebook was complete set of business rules pr actices and standards which govern the direct debit scheme in sepa the rulebook includes the roles and responsibilities of the partic ipants business and operati onal rules and legal and contractual frameworks major unresolve d issue for the epc is the way debts are issued amended and cancelled but this could be overcom by the passage of the payment services directive the paymen t services directive could resolve issues such as whether the debtors can give the mandates to debit thei r accounts directly to the creditors or whether the debtors shoul d give the mandates to their banks either directly or through the creditors27 currently in some count ries debtors give the mandates to the creditors in other countries the debtors give the mandates to their banks the

the economy committee between july 12 and september 12 2007 vote should be taken in the plenar committee of the european parliament30 sepas implications for the united states the single european payments area could have some significant implications for us international financial services providers however until the system is operational the actual extent of sepas impact on the united states remains speculation sepa is not likely to signifi cantly change the whol esaleside electronic payments which rely heavily on corre sponding banking relationships and governmentoperated payments systems where the impact of sepa is likely to be felt is on the retail side of the payments business even if the system only partially reaches its optimal efficiency goals in retail payments there is assurance that these benefits will be fully shared with us financial services providers the main reason is that common legal and regulatory standards that are being negotiated naturally exclude the united states which is mainly on the sidelines it is possible that the outcome of these negotiations could make it more difficult for us institutions to compete in europe for example under sepa us financia l services providers could be relatively disadvantaged by dditional regulatory re quirements or denied benefits made possible by sepa in short us institutions customers may have to pay additional fees or meet specific require ments to make electronic payments within the eurozonehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33952crs11 31 european commission report on the retail banking sector inquiry

sepa as the eu has done in the past such regulation could limit the type of services us providers offer and the pri ce they charge for those services the eu 2002 visa decision is an example intercha nge fees are interbank fees paid between the card payers bank and the payees bank for the card issuance and the electronic clearing and settlement of the cards transactions to lower the cost of credit cards for european merchants the european co mmission pressured visa europe to apply fixed fee per transaction in determining its interchange fees mastercard on the other hand was allowed to base its interchange fee on per centage of the transaction value the commission reported that the decision had the effect of reducing visa crossborder interchange fees while mast ercard enjoyed higher revenues from its crossborder interchange fees the european commission complained to the european banking industry about interchange fees it argued that these fees are higher than they should be in the eu however the commission has not mandate d how eu member states determine interchange fees as it did for masterca rd and visa the most recent commission study shows that interchange fees remain excessive in many member countries that are using one or both methods to determine their fees31 because us financial institutions are outside these negotiations but are subject to their decisions member states could gain an advantage on us institutions by negotiating exemptions andor amendments in favor of their countries financial institutions further possible concern is that the european commission plans to build sepa using europeans enterprises exclusively because sepa is european built us institutions access to sepa doesnt nece ssarily have to be concern however the lack of us presence in the rules negotiations as well as the physical construction could later cr eate problems in terms of software and hardware compatibility and protocol for us ins titutions access visa europe the card payment organization with vast experi ence in developing electronic payments exchanges for credit and debit cards as well as other methods of electronic payments is expected to play significant role in building sepa32 however to get this business visa europe had to separate from the visa um brella organization visa europe is now notforprofit enterprise owned by 6000 european member banks the newly incorporated visa europe has the opportunity to bid for new business as well as more flexibility to deal with the changing european payments system33 the united states is

directive are cr itical and difficult hurdles for the european union to overcome like most governmentled initiatives sepa is focused on the reduction of costs to end users individuals smes and corporations initially however the sepa effort translates into higher cost for european financial services providers that supply these electronic payment services domestically and across borders the european banking industry is resisting sepa because they are reluctant to invest in more efficient payment system from which there is little or assurance that they will be able to profitably recover the cost of their investments despite the heated debates in the european parliament it is very likely that the payment services directive will be approved however like other directives it is likely to be loaded with amendments which could reduce sepas effectiveness in lowering end users costs for payments transactions if us financial services providers in the eu are forced to adapt to regulatory modifications of each national system us financial services providers could lose their competitive advantage on the other nd if the directive is effectively implemented harmonizing member states laws and regulations and eliminating regulatory fragmentation us internationa l institutions could benefit from dealing with one set of regulations instead of dealing with financial regulatory subtleties of 31 participating and member states us providers in many areas of financial services are already technologically competitive in the european union which makes them capable of exploiting the new opportunities that sepa might create more quickly than some of their european competitors
