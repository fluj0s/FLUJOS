h c 1 7 complements the larger lockheedmartin c5 galaxy in the intertheater airlift role and the lockheed martin c130 hercules in performing intratheater airlift for the department of defense dod c17s can carry some 169000 pounds of outsize or oversized cargo such as an abrams tank or apache helicopt ers to or from small austere runways the program had difficult time winning congressional support in the late 1970s and c17 development was layed until initial funding wa s finally approved in fy1981 by 1982 dod was concerned its ai rlift shortfall was too urgent to await development of new plane and decided to purchase aircraft readily av ailable for production thus congress approved funds in the fy1983 budg et to purchase 50 additional c5b cargo planes and 44 new kc10 extender aerial refueling aircraft to quickly bridge the airlift gap2 because dod wanted to develop the c17 and buy additi onal c5s congress directed dod to develop comprehensive descri ption of its future acquisition plans the result was the airlift master plan of september 1983 which compared severalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22763crs2 3 logisticians use concept known as maxim um on ground mog as planning factor to measure the potential flow of various airc raft types through mobility airfield alternatives for modernizing the airlift fleet and concluded that the c17 was the most costeffective performance considerations the air force states that performance characteristics of the c17 are significantly better than those of other cargotransport ai rcraft the c17 can land on shorter more narrow runways and is more maneuverable on the groundcom pared to larger c5s or commercial transport planes such as the boeing 747 these characteristics expand the number of bases that c17s can use and the num ber of aircraft that can use an airfield simultaneously3 in explaining the november 1995 decision to buy another 80 c17s dod officials cited as critical feature their calculations th at eight c17s could land and offload 3852 tons per day in space wher only three modified 747s could operate delivering 1754 tons per day dod also expected the c17 to be more co steffective than its competitors based on projected lifecycle costs the c17s perfo rmance in the reliab ility ma intainability and availability evaluation ex ercises of julyaugust 1995 confirmed its supporters expectations about operational capabilities w ith favorable cost implications in part because fewer people are needed to operate and maintain the aircraft as part of the 1993 omnibus agreemen t between the air force and mcdonnell douglas dod agreed to change certain contr act specifications that were causing design and cost problems the most noteworthy of these changes included reducing cruise speed from mach 077 to mach 074 maximum payload from 172200 to 169000 pounds and ferry range from 4600 to 4300 nautical miles ronald fogleman commanding general us transportation command said these ch anges did not affect critical operational requirements explaining that 3200mile mission with 110000lb payload had been established as goal and that the c17 would meet or exceed this requirement production and schedule the c17 program has experienced notewor thy turbulence as acquisition plans have fluctuated over time the fy1985 budget included 129 million to begin fullscale development of the c17 with plan to produce 210 aircraft the airlift master plan had projected requirement for 210 c17s w ith 180 in the active fleet and 30 additional aircraft for backup and spares and for tes ting and evaluation dod was also expected to retain 114 c5s many of whic h would be turned over to the air force reserve and air national guard by the mid1980s the c17 program appeared on track but somewhat behind schedule production di fficulties later contributed to slipped delivery schedules and increased development costs in apr il 1990 defense secretary dick cheney reduced the program from 210 to 120 production c17s reflecting revised estimates of airlift requirements in view of the collapsed sovi et union and domestic budgetary constraints in december 1993 dod agreed to buy another 12 c17s during fy1994fy1995 but defense secretary aspin stated that the contract would end with the 40 aircraft then on order if mcdonnell douglas failed to resolve production and cost problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22763crs3 4 harry levins transportation commands chief emphasizes the need for more c17 cargo planes st louis postdispatch february 2 2002 p 9 5 marc selinger dod

in that even t dod would buy mix of c17s and modified commercial transport planes or c5 military transports by accepting the 1993 agreement mcdonnell douglas incurred loss of nearly 15 bi llion on the development phase of the program in addition the company agreed to spend 456 million in process improvements and testing dod agreed to provide an additional 438 million for the program 237 million to settle claims w ith mcdonnell dougla s and 201 million for flight testing in november 1995 with the c17 program back on track dod decided to continue procurement of the c17 for total program of 120 aircraft dod argued that additional airlift capacity was critical and that if c17s were not procur ed other less capable cargotransport aircraft would be needed to make up the shortfall most members of congress recognized the need for additional airlift although some questioned the need to buy as many as 80 more c17s in january 1996 the defense acquisition board dab approved plans to buy 80 c17s for total of 120 aircraft over sevenyear period fy1997 fy2003 in multiyear contract this plan was expected to yield 5 savings of the programs projected 18 billion cost and was viewed as less expensive in comparison to singleyear buys or multiyear procurement over longer period further dod argued buying c17s in six or seven years would provide the pl anes sooner and more costeffectively and would avoid expected funding competition with other programs after 2003 critics argued that the longterm c ontract could entail financia l penalties for reducing annual buys if budgetary constraints in future ears forced the dod to choose between buying c17s and other aircraft such as f22a raptor on may 31 1996 the air force and mcdonne ll douglas now owned by boeing signed 162billion multiyear procurement cont ract for 80 aircraft to be produced over seven years the first of these 80 airc raft was delivered on august 10 1998 bringing total deliveries to 41 aircraft in late 1998 14 more aircraft were added to planned buy bringing the planned total to 134 c17s by late 2002 the air force had 100 c17s in early 2002 air force officials asked for more c17s john handy commanding general us transportati on command said he needed 222 c17s to meet the nations airlift needs representing an increase of at least 42 aircraft over his predecessors estimate4 in april 2001 his predecessor genera l tony robertson stated that 170 to 180 c17s were needed to meet requireme nts outlined in dods mobility requirements study 2005 mrs055 in august 2002 boeing was awarded 97 billion contract to produce an additional 60 c17s which w ould bring dods inventory to 180 this contract was expected to keep the long beach california production line open until 20086 but appropriations conf erees added an

gaonsiad9750 found mission capable rates to be 862 5 higher than required however the gao noted that the c17 was not required to perform many tasks it had previously struggl ed with during operational testing such as landing at austere airfields on short wet runways performin g strategic airdrops of both troops and equipment and providing aeromedical evacuation capability the c17s ability to operate from austere airfields in albani and macedonia was demonstrated during operation allied for ce in marchjune 1999 when c17s achieved 96 missioncapable rate in joint testimony before the senate armed services committee secretary of defense william cohen and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general henry shelton extolled the c17s contributi ons to the kosovo conflict stating the c17 was the workhouse of the airlift for ce providing for the rapid deployment of critical warfighting and humanitarian materiel they further testified that throughout operation allied force us forces had to overcome many limitations in transportation infrastructure poor airport surface conditions in tirana albania for example slowed aircraft turnaround times limited throughput and slowed the onward movement of forces and humanitarian supplie s our transportation and other logistic assets proved to be flexible effective nd efficient in responding to these limitations in particular the c17 made the concept of direct delivery the strategic air movement of cargo from an aerial port of embarkation to an airfield as close as practicable to the final destination reality9 dod stated that the c17s
