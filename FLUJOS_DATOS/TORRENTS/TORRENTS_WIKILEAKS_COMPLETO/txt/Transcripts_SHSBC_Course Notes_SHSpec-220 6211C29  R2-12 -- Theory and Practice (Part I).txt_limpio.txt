6211c29 shspec220 r212 theory and practice part i there are many indicators and few stabilities about lists there is only one absolute rule about lists that we have as stable datum list must be nullable there is difference between an indication and rule the following gives some indications first of all where there is rock slam on the list you have dead horse list dead horses consume most of the auditors time in r212 so this is of interest but if after fifty items with rock slam if the pc is still interested go on to seventy or eighty if there are rock slams by then unload list with slam wont produce an item on the other hand rock slam on list doesnt guarantee that you will find an item nullable list is list that you can go down without getting midruds in every eight to ten items to clean up dirty needle if you find that you have to put in midruds this often that is an indicator that you may be on dead horse the study of what makes nonnullable list is point of orientation from which to study assessment there are three sources of nonnullable list the first is wrong source the thing from which the list is being listed is improper there is way to establish this on an early list one assessment the item could be one that merely parallels the gpm without ever leading into it it can also be wrong source because you are opposing the wrong item maybe it rockslammed and turned on sensation you list from it then when you null the needle gets dirty even after you have extended the list it could have looked perfect when you listed it and still not be nullable what happened was that the items rock slam wasnt solid it was lock on the gpm rock slam needs something to lean on for you to wind up with something by using it when you have reliable item wall to discharge against you will find the opposed item if you have clean needle on an item that is not reliable item if you oppose it the list is never going to end you are cutting out paper dolls from the gpm you are just picking off locks from the gpm if sensation turned on however be sure to continue to list until the somatic turns off even if the list goes nowhere you can settle for light case of sensation get off the horse and find another item from your list one dead horse lists do produce some gain pcs can cognite etc dont stay with it forever unload when the pc feels pretty good if the pc has interest gets cognitions and has rock slams this guarantees that the list is dead horse however the presence of these indicators doesnt guarantee nullable list another way to foul up and get nonnullable list is to audit the case in the presence of tremendous missed withholds thats rare getting ruds in should be enough to handle this situation actually it is really the missing item that gives the pc feeling of having missed withhold the third source of trouble is the incomplete list an incomplete list may look like nonnullable list if you find this to be the case unload it is rule that list must be nullable so at the point where you find that list is nonnullable go back to list one nullable list is one where items go out easily and the needle stays pretty clean and cleans up easily if it gets dirty during nulling it is good idea to check suppress about once page as you null because suppressed list acts like complete list you dont have to go over what you have nulled if suppress reads just clean up the suppress button get used to how many items need to be listed before you get rock slams this depends on how identified the case is the more jammed up and messed up the pc is the longer the list will go the odd case that is very heavily identified may go 150 items before rockslamming another lighter case may go fifteen or twenty items the ta doesnt necessarily indicate the degree of identification mass doesnt necessarily equal identification and some items are massier than others what if the pc has an item solid steel the dead thetan case will require lot of listing he will need represent lists by the carload getting rock slams the pc will feel better and eventually the list one will get hotter and hotter the mechanics of it are that essentially we have new therapy listing is auditing lrh knew that listing on goal was auditing now it is clear that listing in general is auditing listing an opposition list to anything that continues to rockslam ie reliable item is auditing the more magnitudinous the read the more reality the pc has on the thing anything that reads is safe to list you could develop process for say sick pc you could find out what is bothering him he says my liver you check it for read if it reads you do represent list with what would represent liver to you pretty soon he has more liver trouble you could even assess it by interest without meter the thing that combines interest and reality is the rock slam it is also ridge wherein everything is identified the dynamics are collapsed eg the food faddist when you hit the button you get an automatic release it is not that the pc is thinking so to summarize what makes nonnullable list 1 wrong source faulty assessment eg of list one b the thing from which the list is being listed is improper this may not be auditor error on early list one assessments there is way to be sure that you have the right thing to oppose or represent the item could be one that merely parallels the gpm without ever leading into it c using nonri to oppose it could look perfect when you list it and still not be nullable 2 auditing the case in the presence of many missed withholds this is rare 3 list is incomplete an indicator for nullable list is that it comes out with interest and positiveness so the rule is that list must not be continued that is being invalidated by the pc that is overlisting another indicator of overlist is comm lag or groping for items that is danger sign dont worry about these phenomena in r212 but do pay attention to these last two when listing goals invalidation is not ok in any case inval is preceded by comm lag and then the pc groping for the right way to word it all will produce nonnullable list from that point on so the signs of overlisting in order of appearance are 1 comm lag 2 groping for items 3 pc invalidation of the list the invalidation can be fairly faint just questioning doubt hesitancy about the items the list might have been nullable earlier you can try to null the earlier part list is not nullable if 1 it does not produce rock slam and 2 if it is being delivered by the pc with great uncertainty however the most uncertain person in the world listing from proper source will be the most certain person you ever saw good indicators in listing are 1 interest 2 certainty 3 rock slams bad indicators are 1 rock slams 2 uncertainty we arent too concerned in r212 with whether we get an item or not many cases are below rockslamming so you just keep assessing you keep listing the pcs outofsession appearance is concern of yours as long as he stays interested while he is in session he may well get fancy somatics if you quit in the middle of an opposition list just complete each cycle to the best of your ability some pcs will run fifteen lists off of list one with rock slam then get one on the list itself which continues to rockslam make sure the pc isnt thinking of items and then suppressing them all the items he thinks of should go on the list r212 is itself therapeutic activity if we also get reliable item slamming persistently and get the opposition list listed to an ri the pc will feel marvellous how often this happens is monitored by the accuracy of the auditor an auditor who is doing it all right should expect to be dead on the beam about fifty percent of the time this is due to the aaa factor if you are batting fifty percent ie half of the represent lists you do wind up with an rl and half of the opposition lists get an ri you are good poor auditor may get an ri ten percent of the time and someone will have to straighten out the case sometime but the case will feel better and make gains fifty percent of the time there isnt reliable item there to get so when listing you are only being therapeutic the pc will feel almost as good even if there isnt an ri from the gpm on his r212 list
