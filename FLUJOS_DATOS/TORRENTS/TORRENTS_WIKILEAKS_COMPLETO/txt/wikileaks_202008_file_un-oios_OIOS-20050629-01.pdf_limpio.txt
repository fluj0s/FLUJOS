had been opened for these staff members in hrms the documentation filed was sporadic and often did not include details of rental subsidy in other instances personnel files were not available as th imis payroll function regarding rental subsidy was only implemented in january 2002 the p ayment history of staff members before that date is not available in imis therefore it wo uld have been appropriate for some record to be kept in hrms of the rental subsidy status of the staff members concerned oios suggests that hrms refine their policy on what documentation should be held in hrms and

for the professional practice of internal auditing 2 the rental subsidy scheme operates as part of the post adjustment system the aim of the scheme is to facilitate the settlement f new staff members and to encourage mobility within the common system by subsidizing th rental costs of eligible staff members whose rental accommodations are of reasonable stand ard but cost significantly more than the average for the duty station 3 the relevant provisions governing the re ntal subsidy entitlement are staff rule 1037 stai200016 5 december 2000 rental subsidies nd deductions last amended by stai20044 17 december 2004 effective 1 january 2005 stic200090 5 december 2000 rental subsidies nd deductions and genevaoi164amend5 of 23 july 2002 and amend6 f 4 january 2005 rental subsidy scheme in geneva 4 oios previously reviewed unogs administrat ion of rental subsidy in 1998 when it was found that the system was adequately administer ed but annual reapplications were not always on file imis data was not always reliable nd spouse annual income information was not recorded on the rental subsidy form 5 draft of this report was shared with the unog division of administration their comments are reflected as appropriate in this rep ort ii audit objectives 6 the main objective of the audit was to asse ss the administration of the rental subsidy entitlement at unog and more specifically to evaluate the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls evaluate whether adequate guidance and procedures re in place determine the reliability and integrity of the data available from imis ensure compliance with regulations rules polic ies and procedures iii audit scope and methodology 7 the review focused on unog rental subsidy p ayments covering the period of 1 january 2003 to 31 december 2004 the total number of staff that received rental subsidy in 2003 andor 2004 was 233 with total expenditure of us 136 million oios selected 46 personnel files for an indepth review and analysed all payments made to staff oios followedup on unusual or unexpected trends in paym ents that were identified with regard to 52 staff members 2 8 the audit activities included review and assessment of internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations rental subsidy guidance individual thresholds and deductions for garage parking 9 stai200016 and stic200090 in relation with the rental subsidy scheme regarding reasonable maximum rent levels as set out in genevaoi164amend5 of 23 july 2002 provide unog staff members with clear informat ion on the provisions on the rental subsidy entitlement however the information with regard to individual threshold percentages is not circulated in geneva as opposed to new york and is only available through the automatic computation in imis it is therefore diff icult for staff to establish what they are entitled to to improve the information service to staff oios suggests that unog circulate the individual threshold percentages on an annual b asis or whenever changes in these percentages occur hrms agreed and stated that an information circula r will be issued when icsc revises the rental thresholds applicable to staff with and without dependents hrms will continue to provide upon request trial calculations to all eligible staff so as to ensure that they are aware of their entitlements 10 in its report of 6 may 2003 concerning th oios audit of unhcr rental subsidy ar200360103 oios recommended unog to reconside r the garageparking fee deduction in calculating the net rent in order to ensure co nsistent application of the rental subsidy scheme among duty stations and among staff living i n switzerland and france oios is pleased to note that the application of the garage parking deduction for the purpose of calculating net rent when the relevant amount is not mentioned in the lease or in separate contract has been discontinued by genevaoi164a mend6 of 4 january 2005 b rental subsidy application forms 11 the rental subsidy application long form is user friendly and includes clear references to the supporting documentation that nee ds to be submitted it furthermore provides good basis for human resource officers t verify the accuracy of the information provided by staff members 12 oios noted in one of the personnel files r eviewed that staff member whose nationality was swiss and whose place of recruitmen t was geneva erroneously received rental subsidy the error was detected the rental subsidy payments were discontinued and action was taken to recover the previously paid amo unts nonetheless oios suggests that hrms request ohrm to create field in the rental s ubsidy application form under general information for staff members nationality and pla ce of recruitment this should mitigate the risk of such erroneous payments in the future hrms agrees to include staff members nationality and place of recruitment on the form 3 c annual reapplication 13 section 4 of stai200016 requires staff members to reapply annually for rental subsidy indicating all changes that may affect the ir individual situation and the amount of the rental subsidy to which they are entitled oios not ed that although the annual reapplication short form was submitted in most of the cases st aff members were usually late with their submission which caused in some instances signif icant delay in the rental subsidy payment process while there is good control built into i which automatically stops payment if the annual reapplication form has not been received the delay of submission in the claims by staff members resulted in large retroactive payment s which require manual intervention and are thus more prone to error oios was pleased to n ote however that since late 2004 as default setting in imis two reminders for rental s ubsidy reapplication are included in the email covering the monthly payslips of the staff mbers concerned 14 the rental subsidy reapplication short f orm reads under paragraph 7 heading ii income and rent information that copy of leas elease extension and evidence of recent rent payment must be attached oios found that such information was not systematically on file we understand that this was not requested by hrms for staff members under their administration but in the reapplication reference was made instead to the previous lease oios appreciates that in many cases rental leases h ave duration of more than one year or are automatically extended and in these cases it seems unnecessary to attach the same lease again moreover paragraph 5a of stic200090 in dicates that such supporting documentation is only needed in case of first tim or revised re application while oios agrees that evidence of recent rent payment should be submitted with the reapplication it does not see need to resubmit the lease document with each reapplication unless there is change or revision oios therefore suggests that th reapplication short form be updated accordingly stating that copy of the leaselease extension must be attached in case of changerevision of the lease agreement hrms agreed that copy of the lease is not necessary if the situation of the staff member rem ained unchanged b imis payroll processing 15 as noted above imis automatically calcula tes the rental subsidies payable and imis and payroll are linked in such way that rental bsidy payments automatically stop after one year when the reapplication has not been received andor processed and after seven years at the end of the entitlement it also automatically r educes the payment after five years 60 per cent six years 40 per cent and seven years 20 per cent with regard to cases related to force majeure 60 40 and 20 per cent respectively as of the third year 16 it is noteworthy to mention that as imis release 4 payroll including rental subsidy was only implemented at unog in january 2002 speci fic information relating to the staff members payroll history before that date is not available in imis this is especially important as oios found that personnel files of sta ff posted outside europe and north america were not always available andor that their files did not always contain documentation relating to rental subsidy therefore followup and control in these cases are difficult 4 c personnel filesdocumentation 17 hrms personnel filing system was found to be in good order it was not clear however what the procedure was for staff members f organizations that have their own personnel officers andor staff on loan but payrol led through unog oios found that in some cases although personnel files had been opene d for these staff members in hrms the documentation filed was sporadic and often did not include details of rental subsidy in other instances personnel files were not available for xample oios was not able to find personnel files for staff members in receipt of ren tal subsidy working for unfccc unitar ocha and ece most of the staff members cerned were serving at duty station outside europe and north america while ap preciating that hrms does not administer unfccc and unitar staff they are respon sible for ocha and ece therefore it was reasonable to assume that appropriate person nel information including rental subsidy should be available in hrms on further followup w ith hrms we were informed that ocha files were eventually found but have not yet been presented to us for our review explanation was forthcoming as to the unavailabilit of the personnel file of an ece staff member for the ece case in response to the draft report we were informed that the staff member had been transferred to new york in oios view there is need for hrms to refine its policy on what filesdocuments should be maintained within hrms and once established make efforts to ensure human resource fficersassistants comply with it hrms indicated that it is making efforts to streaml ine and rationalize its filing system on continuous basis v acknowledgement 18 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of human resource management service and unog payroll egbert c kaltenbach director internal audit division ii office of internal oversight
