divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450cruise ship pollution background laws and regulations and key issues summary the cruise industry is significant and growing contributor to the us economy providing more than 32 billion in benefits annually and generating more than 330000 us jobs but also making th environmental impact s of its activities an issue to many although cruise ship s represent small fraction of the entire shipping industry worldwide public atten tion to their environmental impacts comes in part from the fact that cruise ships are highly visible and in part because of the industrys desire to promote positive image cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers and crew have been compared to floating cities and the volume of wastes that they produce is comparably large consisting of sewage wastewater from si nks showers and galleys graywater hazardous wastes solid waste oily bilge water ballast water and air pollution the waste streams generated by cruise ships ar governed by number of international protocols especially marpol and us dom estic laws including the clean water act and the act to prevent pollution from ships regulations and standards but there is single law or rule some cruise ship waste streams appear to be well regulated such as solid wastes garbage and plastics and bilge water but there is overlap of some areas and there are gaps in others some such as graywater and ballast water are not regulated except in the great lakes and concern is increasing about the impacts of these discharges on public health and the environment in other areas regulations apply but critics argue that they are not stringent enough to address the problem for example with respect to standards for sewage discharges environmental advocates have raised cerns about the adequacy of existing laws for managing these wastes and they contend that enforcement is weak in 2000 congress enacted legislation restri cting cruise ship discharges in us navigable waters within the state of aska california aska and maine have enacted statespeci fic laws concerning cruise ship pollution and few other states have entered into voluntary agreements with industry to address management of cruise ship discharges meanwhile th cruise industry s voluntarily undertaken initiatives to improve pollution prev ention by adopting waste management

activities are regulated and scrutinized in number of respects by international protocols and us domestic laws includi ng those designed to protect against discharges of pollutants that could harm marine resources other parts of the ambient environment and human health however there are overlaps of some requirements gaps in other areas geographic differe nces in jurisdiction based on differing definitions and questions about the adequacy of enforcement public attention to the environmental impacts of th maritime industry has been especially focused on the cruise industry in part because its ships are highly visible and in part because of the industrys desire to promote positive image it represents relatively small fraction of the entire shi pping industry worldwide as of january 2008 passenger ships which include cruise ships and ferries composed about 12 of the world shipping fleet1 the cruise industry is significant and growing contributor to the us economy providing more than 32 billion in total benefits annually and generating mo re than 330000 us jobs2 but also making the environmental impacts of its activities an issue to many since 1980 the average annual growth rate in the number of crui passengers worldwide has been 84 and in 2005 cruises hosted an estimated 115 million passengers cruises are especially popular in the united states in 2005 us ports handled 86 million cruise embarkations 75 of globa l passengers 63 more than in 2004 the worldwide cruise ship fleet consists of more than 230 ships and the majority are foreign flagged with liberia and panama be ing the most popular flag countries3 foreign flag cruise vessels owned by six comp anies account for nearly 95 of passenger ships operating in us waters each year the industry adds new ships to the total fleet vessels that are bigger more elaborate and luxurious and that carry larger numbers of passengers and crew over th past two decades the average ship size has been increasing at the rate of

many small cities on land during typical oneweek voyage large cruise ship with 3000 passengers and crew is estimated to generate 210000 ga llons of sewage 1 million gallons of graywater wastewater from sinks shower s and laundries mo re than 130 gallons of hazardous wastes 8 tons of solid wa ste and 25000 gallons of oily bilge water5 those wastes if not properly treated and di sposed of can pose risks to human health welfare and the environment environmen tal advocates have ra ised concerns about the adequacy of existing laws for managing these wastes and suggest that enforcement of existing laws is weak 2000 general accounting office gao report focused attention on problems of cruise vessel compliance w ith environmental requirements6 gao found that between 1993 and 1998 foreignflag cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in us waters few of the cases included multiple illegal discharge incidents occurring over the si xyear period gao reviewed three major waste streams solids hazardous chemicals and oily bilge wate r and concluded that 83 of the cases involved discharges of oil or oilbased products the volumes of which ranged from few drops to hundreds of gallons the balance of the cases involved discharges of plastic or garbage gao judged that 72 of the illegal discharges were accidental 15 were inten tional and 13 could not be determined the 87 cruise ship cases represented 4 of the 2400 illegal discharge cases by foreignflag ships including tankers car go ships and other commercial vessels as well as cruise ships conf irmed during the six years studied by gao although cruise ships operating in us waters have b een involved in relatively small number of pollution cases gao said several have b een widely publicized and have led to criminal prosecutions and multimilliondollar fines in 2000 coalition of 53 environmen tal advocacy groups petitioned the environmental protection agency epa to take regulatory action to address pollution by cruise ships7 the petition called for an investigation of wastewater oil and solid waste discharges from cruise sh ips in response epa agreed to

further assessmen t through data collection and public information hearings8 subsequently in december 2007 the agency released draft cruise ship discharge assessm ent report as part of its response to the petition this report summarized findings of recent data collection activities especially from cruise ships operating in alaskan waters epa expects to issue completed report by the end of 2008 and at that time will identify range of options and alternatives to address cruise ship waste streams9 this report presents information on issu related to cruise ship pollution it begins by describing the veral types of waste streams and contaminants that cruise ships may generate and release it iden tifies the complex body of international and domestic laws that address pollution from cruise ships as there is single law in this area some wastes are covered by in ternational standards some are subject to us law and for some there are gaps in law regulation or possibly both the report then describes federal and state legislative activity concerning cruise ships in alaskan waters and recent activities in few other states cruise ship companies have taken number of steps to prevent illegal wast discharges and ve adopted waste management plans and practices to imp rove their envir onmental operations environmental critics acknowledge these initiatives even as they have petitioned the federal government to strengthen existing regulation of cruise ship wastes environmental groups endorsed companion bills in the 109th congress the clean cruise ship act s 793hr 1636 that w ould have required stricter standards to control wastewater discharges from cruise ships congress did not act on either bill nor did it act on similar legislati on that was introduced in the 110th congress s 2881 cruise ship waste streams cruise ships generate num ber of waste streams that can result in discharges to the marine environment including sewage graywater hazardous wastes oily bilge water ballast water and solid waste they also emit air pollutants to the air and water these wastes if not properly treat ed and disposed of can be significant source of pathogens nutrients and toxic substances with the potential to threaten human health and damage quatic life it is important however to keep these discharges in some perspective because cruise ships represent small although highly visible portion of the entire intern ational shipping industry and the waste streams described here are not unique to cruise ships however particular types of wastes such as sewage graywater and so lid waste may be of greater concern for cruise ships relative to other seagoing vessels because of the large numbers ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs4 10 the ocean conservancy cruise control report on how cruise ships

blackwater is sewage wastewater from toilets and medical facilities which can contain harmful bacteria pat hogens diseases viruses intestinal parasites and harmful nutrients discharges of untreated or inadequately treated sewage can cause bacterial and viral contamin ation of fisheries and she llfish beds producing risks to public health nutrients in sewage ch as nitrogen and phosphorous promote excessive algal growth which consumes oxygen in the water and can lead to fish kills and destruction of othe r aquatic life large crui ship 3000 passengers and crew generates an estimated 15000 to 30000 gallons per day of blackwater waste10 graywater is wastewater from the sinks showers galleys laundry and cleaning activities aboard ship it can contain variety of pollutant substances including fecal coliform bacteria detergents oil and grease metals organics petroleum hydrocarbons nutrients food wa ste and medical and dental waste sampling done by epa and the state of aska found that untreated graywater from cruise ships can contain pollutants at variab strengths and that it can contain levels of fecal coliform bacteria several times greater than is typically found in untreated domestic wastewater11 graywater has potential to cause adverse environmental effects because of concentrations of nutrients and other oxygendemanding materials in particular graywater is typically the largest source of liquid waste generated by cruise ships 9095 of the total estimates of graywater range from 30 to 85 gallons per day per person or 90000 to 255000 gallons per day for 3000person cruise ship12 solid waste generated on ship includes gla ss paper cardboard aluminum and steel cans and plastics it can be either nonhazardous or hazar dous in nature solid waste that enters the ocean may become ma rine debris and it can then pose threat to marine organisms humans coastal co mmunities and industrie s that utilize marine waters cruise ships typically manage solid waste by combination of source reduction waste minimization nd recycling however as much as 75 of solid waste is incinerated on board and the ash ty pically is discharged at sea although some is landed ashore for disposal or recy cling marine mammals fish sea turtles and birds can be injured or killed from entanglement with plastics and other solid waste that may be released or disposed off of cruise ships on average each cruise ship passenger generates at least two pounds of nonhaza rdous solid waste per dayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs5 13 the center for environmental leadership in business

up for discharge overboard when garbage must be offloaded for example b ecause glass and aluminum ca nnot be incinerated cruise ships can put strain on port recepti on facilities which are rarely adequate to the task of serving large passenger vessel especially at nonnorth american ports16 cruise ships produce hazardous wastes from number of onboard activities and processes including photo processing drycleaning and equipment cleaning types of waste include discarded and expi red chemicals medical waste batteries fluorescent lights and spent paints and th inners among others these materials contain wide range of substances such as hydrocarbons chlorinated hydrocarbons heavy metals paint waste solvents fl uorescent and mercury vapor light bulbs various types of batteries and unused or outdated pharmaceuticals although the quantities of hazardous waste generated on cruise ships ar small their toxicity to sensitive marine organisms can be signifi cant without careful management these wastes can find their way into graywater bilge water or the solid waste stream on ship oil often leaks from engine and machinery spaces or from engine maintenance activities and mixes with water in the bilge the lowest part of the hull of the ship oil gasoline and byproducts from the biological breakdown of petroleum products can harm fish and wild life and pose threats to human health if ingested oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various sublethal chronic effects bilge water also may contain solid wast and pollutants containing high amounts of oxygendemanding materi oil and other chemicals typical large cruise ship will generate an average of 8 metric tons of oily bilge water for each 24 hours of operation17 to maintain ship stability and eliminate potentially hazardous conditions from oil vapors in these areas the bilge spaces need to be flushed and periodically pumped dry however before bilge can be cleared out and the water

faulty or is deliberately bypassed untreated oily bilg water could be disc harged directly into the ocean where it can damage marine life number of cruise lines have been charged with environmental violations related to this issue in recent years cruise ships large tankers and bulk cargo carriers use tremendous amount of ballast water to stabilize the vessel during transport ballast water is often taken on in the coastal waters in one region after ships discharge wastewater or unload cargo and discharged at the next port of call wherever more cargo is loaded which reduces the need for compensating ballast thus it is essential to the proper functioning of ships especially cargo ships because the water that is taken in compensates for changes in the ships weight as cargo is loaded or unloaded and as fuel and supplies are consumed however ba llast water discharge typica lly contains variety of biological materials including plants anima ls viruses and bacteria these materials often include nonnative nuisance exotic species that can cause extensive ecological and economic damage to aqua tic ecosystems ballast water discharges are believed to be the leading source of invasive species in us marine waters thus posing public health and environmental risks as well as significant economic cost to industries such as water and power utilities commercial and recreational fisheries agriculture and tourism18 studies suggest that the economic cost just from introduction of pest mollusks zebra mussels the asian clam and others to us aquatic ecosystems is more than 6 billion per year19 these problems are not limited to cruise ships but there is little cruiseindustry specific data on the issue and further study is needed to determine cruise ships role in the overall problem of in troduction of nonnative species by vessels air pollution from cruise ships is generated by diesel engines that burn high sulfur content fuel producing sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and particulate matter in addition to carbon monoxide carbon dioxid and hydrocarbons diesel exhaust has been classified by epa as likely human carcinogen epa recognizes that these emissions from marine diesel engines contribute to ozone and carbon monoxide nonattainment ie failure to meet air qual ity standards as we ll as adverse health effects associated with ambient concentrations of particulate matter and visibility haze acid deposition and eutrophica tion and nitrophication of water20 p estimates that large marine diesel engine s accounted for about 16 of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions and 28 of mob ile source particulate emissions in the united states in 2000 contributions of ma rine diesel engines can be higher on portspecific basis httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs7 21 ibid pp 9751 9756

environmental pressure s on maritime vessels recently has come from states and localities as they assess the contribution of commercial marine vessels to regional air quality problems when ships are docked in port for instance large marine diesel engines are believed to contribute 7 of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions in baton rougenew orleans ships can also have significant impact in areas without large commercial ts they contribute about 37 of total area nitrogen oxide emissions in the santa barbara area and that percentage is expected to increase to 61 by the year 201521 again there is little cruiseindustry specific data on this issue they comprise only small fraction of the world shipping fleet but cruise ship emissions may exert significant impacts on local scale in specific coastal areas that ar visited repeatedly shipboa rd incinerators also burn large volumes of garbage plastics and other waste producing ash that must be disposed of incinerators may release toxic emissions as well applicable laws and regulations the several waste streams ge nerated by cruise ships are governed by number of international protocols nd us domestic laws regula tions and standards which are described in this section but there is single law or regula tion moreover there are overlaps in some areas of coverage gaps in other areas and differences in geographic jurisdiction based on pplicable terms and definitions international legal regime the international maritime organization imo body of the united nations sets international maritime vessel safety and marine pollution standards it consists of representatives from 152 ma jor maritime nations including the united states the imo implements the 1973 international conve ntion for the prevention of pollution from ships as modified by the protoc ol of 1978 known as marpol 7378 cruise ships flagged under countries that are si gnatories to marpol are subject to its requirements regardless of wh ere they sail and member nations are responsible for vessels registered under th eir respective nationalities22 six annexes of the convention cover the various sources of pollution from ships and provide an overarching framework for in ternational objectives but they are not sufficient alone to protect the marine environment from wa ste discharges without ratification and implementation by sovereign states annex i deals with regulations for the prevention of pollution by oil annex ii details the discharge crite ria and measures for the control of pollution by noxious liquid substances carried in

nitrogen oxide and otheremissions from marine vessel oper ations and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozonedepleting substances in order for imo standards to be binding they must first be ratified by total number of member countries whose combined gross tonnage represents at least 50 of the worlds gross tonnage process that can be lengthy all si x have been ratified by the requisite number of nations the mo st recent is annex vi which took effect in may 2005 the united states has ratified annexes i ii iii and v and the us senate also has acceded to the treaty ratifying annex vi the united states has taken action regarding annex iv the c ountry where ship is registered flag state is responsible for certifying the ships compliance with marpols pollution prevention standards imo also has estab lished large number of other conventions addressing issues such as ballast wate r management and the international safety management code with guidelines for passenger safety nd pollution prevention each signatory nation is responsible for enacting domestic laws to implement the convention and effectively pledges to comply with the convention annexes and related laws of other nations in the united states the act to prevent pollution from ships apps 33 usc 19051915 impleme nts the provisions of marpol and the annexes to which the united states is party the most recent us action concerning marpol occurred in april 2006 when the senate approved annex vi which regulates air pollution treaty do c 1087 exec rept 10913 following that approval in march 2007 the house approved legislation to implement the standards in annex vi hr 802 through regulations to be promulgated by epa in consultation with the us coast guard in july 2008 congress gave final approval to an amended version of hr 802 diffe rent from the provision approved by the house in march 2007 president bush signed the bill on july 21 pl 110280 negotiations to strengthen marpol anne x vi also are underway and the united states has participated in these international discussions 23 apps applies to all usflagged ships anywhere in the world and to all foreign flagged vessels operating in na vigable waters of the united states or while at port under us jurisdiction the coast guard s primary responsibility to prescribe and enforce regulations necessary to implement apps in these waters the regulatory mechanism established in apps to implement marpol is separate and distinct from the clean water act and othe r federal environmental lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs9 24 2000 gao report pp 1921one of the difficulties in implementing marpol arises from the very international nature of maritime shipping the c ountry that the ship visits can conduct its own examination to verify ships compliance with international standards and can detain the ship if it fi nds significant noncompliance under the provisions of the convention the united stat can take direct enforcement action under us laws against foreignflagged ships when pollution discharge incidents occur within us jurisdiction when incidents occur outside us jurisdiction or jurisdiction cannot be determined the united states re fers cases to flag states in accordance with marpol the 2000 gao report documented that these procedures require substa ntial coordination between the coast guard the state department and other flag st ates and that even when referrals have been made the response rate from flag states has been poor24 domestic laws and regulations in the united states several federal agen cies have some jurisdiction over cruise ships in us waters but one agency is responsible for or coordinates all of the relevant government functions the u s coast guard and epa have principal regulatory and standardsetting responsib ilities and the depar tment of justice prosecutes violations of fede ral laws in addition the partment of state represents the united states at meetings of the imo and in international treaty negotiations and is responsible for pursuing foreignflag violations other federal agencies have limited roles and responsibilities for example the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa depar tment of commerce works with the coast guard and epa to report on the effect s of marine debris the animal and plant health inspection service aphis is res ponsible for ensuring quarantine inspection and disposal of foodcontaminated garbag these aphis responsibilities are part of the department of homeland security in some cases states and localities have responsibilities as well this section describes us laws and regulations that apply to cruise ship discharges sewage the federal water pollution control act or clean water act cwa is the principal us law concerned with limiting polluting activity in the nations streams lakes estu aries and coastal waters the acts primary mechanism for controlling pollutant discharges is the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes program authorized in section 402 in accordance with the npdes program pollutant discharges fro m point sources term that includes vessels are prohibited unless permit has been obtained while sewage is defined as pollutant under the act sewage from cr uise ships and other vessels is exempt from this statutory definition and is theref ore exempt from the re quirement to obtain an npdes permit further epa regulations implementing the npdes permit program provide that discharges incident to the normal opera tion of vessels are excluded from regulation and thus from permit requirements 40 cfr 1223a however 2006 federal court ruling could result in changes to these regulations that would remove the current permitting exemption see discussion of ballast water on page 14httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs10 25 2000 gao report pp 3435 13marine sanitation devices section 312 of the clean water act seeks to address this gap by prohibiting the dumping of untreated or inadequately treated sewage from vessels into the navigable waters of the united states defined in the act as within 3 miles of shore cruise ships are subject to this prohibition it is implemented jointly by epa and the co ast guard under section 312 commercial and recreational vessels with installed toilets are required to have marine sanitation devices msds which are designed to pr event the discharge of untreated sewage epa is responsible for developing perfo rmance standards for msds and the coast guard is responsible for msd design nd operation regulations and for certifying msd compliance with the epa rules msds are designed either to hold sewage for shorebased disposal or to treat sewage prior to discharge beyond 3 miles raw sewage can be discharged the coast guard regulations cover thr ee types of msds 33 cfr part 159 large vessels including cruise ships use either type ii or type iii msds in type ii msds the waste is either chemically or biologically treated prior to discharge and must meet limits of more than 200 fecal coliform per 100 milliliters and more than 150 milligrams per liter of suspended solids type iii msds store wastes and do not treat them the waste is pumped out later and treated in an onshore system or discharged outside us waters type i msds use chemicals to disinfect the raw sewage prior to discharge and must meet performance standard for fecal coliform bacteria of not greater than 1000 per 100 milliliters and visible floating solids type i msds are generally only found on r ecreational vessels or others under 65 feet in length the regulations which have not been revised since 1976 do not require ship operators to sample monitor or report on their effluent discharges critics point out number of deficiencies with this regulatory structure as it affects cruise ships and ot her large vessels first th msd regulations only cover discharges of bacterial contaminants nd suspended solids while the npdes permit program for other point sources typically regulates many more pollutants such as chemicals pesticides heavy metals oil and grease that may be released by cruise ships as well as landbased sources sec ond sources subject to npdes permits must comply with sampling monitoring recor dkeeping and reporting requirements which do not exist in the msd rules in addition the coast guard responsible for inspecting cruise ships and other vessels for compliance with the msd rule s has been heavily criticized for poor enforcement of section 312 requirements in its 2000 report the gao said that coast guard inspectors rarely have time during scheduled ship examinations to inspect sewage treatment equipment or filter systems to see if they are working properly and filtering out potentially harmful conta minants gao reported that number of factors limit the ability of coast guard inspectors to detect violations of environmental law and rules including the inspectors focus on safety the large size of cruise ship limited time and staff for inspections and the lack of an element of surprise concerning inspections25 the coast guard carries out wide range of responsibilities that encompass both homel and security ports waterways and coastal security defense readiness drug and migrant interdic tion and nonhomelandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs11 26 the homeland security act of 2002 pl

since the september 11 terrorist attacks on the united states the coast guard has focused more of its resources on homeland security activities26 one likely result is that less of the coast guards time and attention are available for vessel inspections for msd or other environmental compliance annex iv of marpol was drafted to re gulate sewage discharges from vessels it has entered into force internationally and would apply to cruise ships that are flagged in ratifying countries but because the united states s not ratified annex iv it is not mandatory that ships follow it when in us waters however its requirements are minimal even compared with us rules for msds annex iv requires that vessels be equi pped with certified sewage treatment system or holding tank but it prescribes specific perform ance standards within three miles of shore annex iv requires that sewage disc harges be treated by certified msd prior to discharge between three and 12 miles from shore sewage discharges must be treated by less than maceration or ch lorination sewage discharges beyond 12 miles from shore are unrestricted vessels are permitted to meet alternative less stringent requirements when they are in

less stringent than those for large quantity generators generating more than 1000 kilograms per month and it is unclear whether cruise ships are classified as large or small generators of hazardous waste moreover some cruise companies argue that they generate less than 100 kilograms per month and therefore should be classified in third category as conditionally exempt smallquantity generators

permits citizen suits to enforce the law the legislation included citizen suit provisions there was further action on this legislation air pollution the clean air act 42 usc 7401 et seq is the principal federal law that addresses air quality concerns it requires epa to set healthbased standards for ambient air quality sets standards for the achievement of those standards and sets nationa l emission standards for large and ubiquitous sources of air pollution including mobile sources cr uise ships emissions were not regulated until february 2003 at that time epa pr omulgated emission standards for new marine diesel engines on large vessels ca lled category 3 marine engines such as container ships tankers bulk carriers and cr uise ships flagged or registered in the united states36

discussions to strengthen th requirements of annex vi considerations of geographic jurisdiction the various laws and regulations described here apply to different geographic areas depending on the terminology used for example the clean water act treats navigable waters the contiguous zone and the ocean as distinct entities the term navigable waters is defined to mean the waters of the united states including the territorial seas 33 usc 13627 in turn the territorial s eas are defined in that act as extending distance of 3 miles seaward from the base line 33 usc 13628 the baseline generally means the land or shore in 1988 president reagan signed proclamation proc 5928 december 27 1988 54 federal register 777 providing that the territorial sea of the united states extends to 12 nautical miles from the us baseline however that proclamation d effect on the geographic reach of the clean water acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs18 41 for an explanation of these terms httpencyclopediathefreedictionarycom statute20milethe contiguous zone is defined in the cwa to mean the entire zone established by the united states under article 24 of the convention of the territorial sea and the contiguous zone 33 usc 13629 th at convention define s contiguous zone as extending from the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured to not beyond 12 miles in 1999 president clint on signed proclamation proc 7219 of august 2 1999 64 federal register 48701 giving us authorities the right to enforce customs immigration or sanitary ws at sea within 24 nautical miles from the baseline doubling the trad itional 12mile width of the contiguous zone as with the 1988 presidential proclama tion this proclamation did not amend any statutory definitions as general ma tter presidential proclama tion cannot amend statute thus for purposes of the clean water act the territorial sea remains 3 miles wide and the contiguous zone extends from 3 to 12 miles under cercla navigable waters means waters of the united states including the territorial seas 42 usc 960115 and that law incorporates the clean water acts definiti ons of territorial seas and contiguous zone 42 usc 960130 the cwa defines the ocean as any tion of the high seas beyond the contiguous z one 33 usc 136210 in contrast the mprsa defines cean waters as the open seas lying seaward be yond the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured as provided for in the convention of the territorial sea and the contiguous zone 33 usc 1402b limits of jurisdiction are important because they define the areas where specific laws and rules apply for example the clean water act msd standards apply to sewage discharges from vessels into or upon the navigable waters and section 402 npdes permits are required for point source discharges excluding vessels into the navigable waters section 311 of the cw as amended by the oil pollution act addresses discharges of oil or hazardous substances into or upon the navigable waters of the united states or the waters of th contiguous zone provisions of the act to prevent pollution from ships apps 33 usc 19011 915 concerning discharges of oil and noxious substances apply to na vigable waters other provisions of that same act concerning garbage and plastics apply to navigable waters or the eez but the term navigable waters is not fined in apps the mprsa regulates ocean dumping within the area extending 12 nautical miles seaward from the baseline and regulates transport of material by usflagged vessels for dumping into ocean waters further complicating jurisdictional considerations is the fact that the clean water act refers to these distances from shore in terms of miles without other qualification which is generally interpreted to mean an international mile or statute mile apps the mprsa and the two presidential proclamations refer to distances in terms of nautical miles from the baseline these two measures are not identical nautical mile is unit of distance used primarily at sea and in aviation it equals 6080 feet and is 15 longer than an international or statute mile41httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs19 42

ship pollution has received significant attention after the state experienced threefold increase in the number of cruise ship passengers visits during the 1990s42 concern by alaska natives and other groups over impacts of cruise ship pollution on marine resources began to increase in one prominent example of environmental violations in july 1999 royal caribbean cruise lines entered federal

chemicals the company admitted to fleetwide practice of discharging oilcontaminated bilge water the alaska penalties were part of larger 18 milli on total federal plea agreement involving environmental violations in multiple locations including florida new york and california public concern about the royal caribbean violations led the state to initiate program in december 1999 to identify crui ship waste streams voluntary sampling of large cruise ships in 2000 indi cated that waste treatment systems on most ships did not function well and discharges greatly exceeded applicable us coast guard standards for type ii msds fecal coliform levels sampled during that period averaged 128 million colonies per 100 millilite rs in blackwater and 12 million in graywater far in excess of the coast gu ard standard of 200 fecal coliforms per 100 milliliters federal legislation concurrent with growing regional interest in these problems attention to the alaska issues led to passage of

30 mgl of total suspended solids and total residual chlorine concentrations not to exceed 10 mgl the legislation requires sampling data collection and recordkeeping by vessel operators to facilitate coast guard oversight and enforcement regulations to implement the federal law were issued by the us coast guard in july 2001 and became effective immediately upon publication44 the regulations stipulate minimum sampling and testing procedures and provide for administrative and criminal penalties for violations of the law as provided in the legislation pursuant to title iv epa carried out

turbine engines and ballast water management for elimination of nonnative species environmenta l groups commend industry for voluntarily adopting improved management practices but also believe that enforceable standards are preferable to voluntary standa rds matter how well intentioned48 the iccl joined with the environmen tal group conservation international ci to form the ocean conservation and t ourism alliance to work on number of issues in december 2003 they nnounced conservation efforts in four areas to protect biodiversity in coastal areas improving technology for wastewater management aboard cruise ships working with local governments to protect the natural and cultural assets of cruise destinations raising passenger and crew awareness and support of critical conser vation issues and educating vendors to lessen the environmental imp acts of products from cruise ship suppliers because twothirds of the top cruise destinations in the world are located in the caribbean and mediterranean two important biodivers ity regions in march 2006 iccl and ci announced joint initiative to develop ma p integrating sensitive marine areas into cruise line navigational charts with the goal of protecting critical marine and coastal ecosystems in may 2004 royal caribbean cruises ltd announced plans to retrofit all vessels in its 29ship fleet with advan ced wastewater treatment technology by 2008 becoming the first cruise line to commit to doing so completely the company had been the focus of efforts by the envir onmental group oceana to pledge to adopt measures that will protect th ocean environment and that could serve as model for others in the cruise ship industry in part because of the companys efforts to alter its practices following federal enforcement actions in the 1990s for environmental violations that resulted in rccl paying criminal fines that totaled 27 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs24 49 epa white paper p 16 50 assessment of impacts in alaska p 12 51 us commission on ocean policy an ocean blueprint for the 21st century september 2004 p 243 issues for congress concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for congress in three broad areas adequacy of laws and regulations research needs and oversight and enforcement of existing programs and requirements attention to these issues is relatively recent and more assessment is needed of existing conditions and whether current steps public and private are ade quate bringing the issues to national priority sufficient to obtain resources that will address the problems is challenge laws and regulations key issue is whether the several existing us laws international protocols and standards state activities and industry initiatives described in this report ade quately address mana gement of cruise ship pollution or whether legislative changes are needed to fill in gaps remedy exclusions or strengthen current requirements as epa noted in its 2000 white paper certain cruise ship waste streams such as il and solid waste are regulated under comprehensive set of laws and regulations but others such as graywater are excluded or treated in ways that appear to leave gaps in coverage49 graywater is one particular area of interest since investigations such as sampling by state of alaska officials have found substa ntial contamination of cruise ship graywater from fecal coliform bacteria heavy metals and dissolved plastics state officials were surprised that graywater from ships galley and sink waste streams tested higher for fecal coliform than did the ships sewage lines50 one view advocating strengthened requirements came from the us commissi on on ocean policy in its 2004 final report the commission advocated clear uniform requirements for controlling the discharge of wastewater from large pa ssenger vessels as well as consistent interpretation and enforcement of those re quirements it recommended that congress establish new statutory re gime that should include uniform discharge standards and waste management procedures thorough recordkeeping requirements to track the waste management process required sampling testing and mon itoring by vessel operators using uniform protocols flexibility and incentives to encourage industry investment ininnovative treatment technologies 51 proposal reflecting some of these cepts the clean cruise ship act was introduced in the 109th congress as s 793 durbi n and hr 1636 farr but congress did not act on either bill the bills were freestanding legislation that would not have amended any current law nor ratified annex iv of marpol the legislation would have prohib ited cruise vessels entering us port from discharging sewage graywater or bilge water into waters of the united states including the great lakes except in compliance with prescribed effluent limits and managementhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs25 standards it further would have direct ed epa and the coast guard to promulgate effluent limits for sewage and graywater discharges from cruise vessels that were less stringent than the more restrictive standards under the existing federal alaska cruise ship law described above it would have requi red cruise ships to treat wastewater wherever they operate and au thorized broadened federal enforcement authority including inspection sampling and testing environmental advocates supported this legislation industry groups argued that it targeted an industry that represents only small percentage of th worlds ships and that environmental standards of the industry including voluntary practices already meet or exceed current international and us regulations similar legisl ation was introduced in the 110th congress s 2881 and hr 6434 as noted above some states have passe d legislation to regulate cruise ship discharges if this statelevel activity in creases congress could see need to develop federal legislation that w ould harmonize differences in the states approaches another issue for congress is the status of epas efforts to manage or regulate cruise ship wastes as discussed prev iously in 2000 congress authorized epa to issue standards for sewage and graywate r discharges from large cruise ships operating in alaska the agency has been collecting information and assessing the need for additional standards beyond thos provided in pl 106554 but has not yet proposed any rules in december 2007 epa re leased draft cruise ship discharge assessment report that builds on the 2000 white paper and partially responds to the 2000 petition by bluewater netw ork and other groups that seek to force epa to address cruise ship pollution see page 2 the draft repor t examines five cruise ship waste streams sewage graywater oily bilge water solid waste and hazardous waste and discusses how the waste stream s are managed and current actions by the federal government to address the waste st reams however while the draft report summarizes available information it does not include recommendations or options to address management of cruise ship wastes fina l report expected at the end of 2008 could include such alternatives other related issues of interest c ould include harmonizing the differences presented in us laws for key jurisdictional terms as they apply to cruise ships and other types of vessels providing single definition of cruise ship which is defined variously in federal and state laws and rules with respect to gross tonnage of ships number of passengers carried presence of overnight passenger accommodations or primary purpose of the vessel or requiring updating of exis ting regulations to reflect improved technology such as the msd rules that were issued in 1976 research several areas of research might help improve understanding of the quantities of waste generated by cruise ships impacts of discharges and emissions and the potential for new control technol ogies in the 2007 draft cruise ship discharge assessment report epa stated th at it is evaluating technologies for the treatment of sewage and graywater in cluding some now used for landbasedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs26 52 epa draft cruise

commission on ocean policy noted in its 2004 final report that research can help identify the degree of harm represented by vessel pollution and can assist in prioritizin g limited resources to address the most significant threats the commission identified several directions for research by the coast guard epa noaa and other appropriate entities on the fates and impacts of vessel pollution53 processes that govern the transport of pollutants in the marine environment small passenger ve ssel practices including the impacts of stationary discharges disposal options for concentrated sludge resulting from advancedsewage treatment on rge passenger vessels cumulative impacts of commercial and recreational vessel pollution on particularly sensitive ecosystems such as coastal areas with low tidal exchange and coral reef systems impacts of vessel air emissions pa rticularly in ports and inland waterways where the surrounding ar ea is already having difficulty meeting air quality standards oversight and enforcement the 2000 gao report documented and epas 2000 cruise ship white paper ac knowledged that existing laws and regulations may not be adequa tely enforced or implement ed gao said there is need for monitoring of the discharges from cruise ships in order to evaluate the effectiveness of current st andards and management gao also said that increased federal oversight of cruise ships by the coast guard and other agencies is needed concerning maintenance and operation of pollution preven tion equipment falsifying of oil record books which are required fo r compliance with marpol and analysis of records to verify proper offloading of garbage and oily sludge to onshore disposal facilities54 the coast guard has primary enforcement responsibility for many of the federal programs concerning cruise ship polluti on key oversight and enforcement issue is the adequacy of the coast guards re sources to support its multiple homeland and nonhomeland security missions the res ource question as it relates to vessel inspections was raised even before the ptember 11 terrorist attacks in the gaos 2000 report the same questi on has been raised since then in light of the coast guards expanded responsibilities for homel and security and resulting shift in operations again by the gao and others55 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32450crs27 55 continued results achieved needs to be
