lived groups that siphon members and resources from their organizations of origin indicators of new groups viability would very likely include charismatic leader ship capable of drawing new members from broader spectrum of the extrem ist movement and of sustaining their involvement with well articulated agenda new groups led or significantly populated by military veterans could very likely
