of 1997 an analysis of hr 2493 summary this report analyzes most of the provi sions of hr 2493 wh ich addresses the grazing programs of the bureau of land management blm and the forest service fs the bill was sponsored by rep bob smith chairman of the house agriculture committee and others and was reported by that committee on september 24 1997 and was reported by the house resources committee on october 8 and october 22 1997 both committees amended the bill and it was further ame nded before passage by the house on october 30 1997 the bill is considerably shorter than was legislation in the 104th congress and earlier in the 105th and ddresses primarily monitori ng cooperative management plans and grazing fees under the b ill monitoring would be conducted according to regional or state criteria and protocols selected by th secretary concerned the secretary of the interior for blm lands and the secretary of agriculture for fs lands could not accept data from monitoring that was not conducted either in accordance with such protocols or by persons w ho are among the groups listed cooperative management plans would be made available to qualifying permittees and could allow greater flexibility as to grazing practices the principal change that would be made by the bill is that new grazing fee formula would be enacted applicable to the grazing programs of both blm and fs but not applicable to the national grassl ands which are also managed by the fs the new formula would be based primarily on 12year gross beef cattle production values and be tied to shortterm treasury bill rates for the past 12 years thereby making the fees more stable and less responsive to yearly fluctuations in beef prices than the current formula the bill also would count seven sheep or goats as one animal unit month aum rather than the current five thereby allowing more of such animals to graze for the same fee the bill does not establish minimum payment many definitions were eliminated from the bill some of these related to aspects of the nature of the grazing privilege that currently are being litigated and were controversial for this reason the bill also does not address many issues that proved to be controversial in the 104th congress such as water rights application of the national environmental policy act in the grazing context appeals access across private lands or ownership of range impr ovements some provisions are ambiguous in certain respects and this report discusses possible interpretationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9840contents background 1 hr 2493 provisions 3 g n r l3

department of the interior and the forest service fs in the department of agriculture have generated contr oversy over the last several years1 new range management regulations for the lands managed by the blm went into effect in august 1995 even before that effective date legislation was introduced to modify statutorily some of the provisions containe d in the regulations s 852 in the 104th congress comprehensively ddressed blm grazing and s 1459 in that congress addressed both fs and blm grazing and w ould have made the grazing programs of the fs and blm more consistent2 the 105th congress is again considering legislation that would alter grazing on fede ral fs and blm lands and would establish new grazing fee formula hr 2493 sponsored by rep bob smith chairman of the house agriculture committee was reported by house ag riculture committee on september 24 19973 and by the house resources committee on october 8 and again on october 22 19974 both committees amended the bill the bill was further amended and passed the house on october 30 1997 by vote of 242182 this report analyzes most of the provi sions of hr 2493 as it was received in the senate the report also

the two agencies and the lands they manage comprehensive grazing program was au thorized by the taylor grazing act of 1934 tga for the public lands now ma naged by blm initially the program was administered by the grazing service until the duties of the grazing service were merged with those of the general land office when blm was created in 1946 before enactment of the tga the public lands remaining in federal ownership were being grazed freely by all with the tacit license of the government by and large these lands were too arid to be suitabl for agriculture and as result of the communal use many rangelands were overgrazed eroded and otherwise in poor condition it was believed that sy stem under which permittee would have exclusive rights to graze an allotted ar ea would both improve range conditions and protect individual ranchers the tga tablished such system implementing regulations known as the range code were promulgated beginning in 1938 current blm grazing regulations are found in 43 cfr part 4100 there was little additional legislation on blm range management until enactment of the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma5 title iv of flpma addresses range management and applies both to lands managed by the blm and to lands in national forests although flpma repealed many previous statutes related to the public lands the tga was left in effect in 1978 congress enacted the public rangelands improveme nt act pria which also covers both blm and fs lands but specifically excludes the national grasslands which will be discussed later6 there is less statutory guidance with respect to grazing management by the fs than is true for blm although the original statute7 governing management of the forest reserves did not expressly mention grazing that act authorized the secretary of agriculture to regulate the occupancy nd use of the forests and grazing has been allowed and regulated in the forest reserves since the early twentieth century fees have been charged since 1906 grazing on the national forests was recognized and ratified in later enactments the grangerthye act of 1950 authorized th secretary to regulate grazing on the national forests and other lands administered by him and to issue permits for the grazing of livestock for periods not exceeding ten years8 this act also states that nothing in the act shall be construed as limiting or restricting any right title or interest of the united states in any land or resources the multipleuse sustained yield act of 19609 stated that the national forest s shall be

and administration which will best serve the purposes of landconservation and landu tilization program and the president is authorized to transfer such pr operty to such agencies query whether this authority validly included specifying that different law would apply to the exclusion of bj however court faced with the question now might uphold the actions because of the breadth of discretion granted in the bj act and the decades of congressional acquiescencerecreation range timber watershed and wildlife and fish purposes emphasis added but did not provide additional details on range ma nagement as noted above both flpma and pria applied both to lands managed by blm and the lands within national forests pria expressly ex cluded the national grasslands from its coverage10 both agencies administer some lands that were acquired by the federal government under the bankheadjones farm tenant act bj11 most of the bj lands managed by the fs are administratively designated as national grasslands in 1974 congress included the national gr asslands within the national forest system to be managed as one integral system with the national forests12 yet the national grasslands also maintain their identity as bj lands are currently subject both to the laws governing the national fore st system and to the bj act and have special regulations applicable to them13 as result of series of executive orders most of blms bj lands were administratively included within grazing districts managed under the taylor grazing act nd the federal land po licy and management act14 blm does not have additi onal regulations related to the bj lands it manages hr 2493 provisions general as discussed both the fs and bl m manage grazing programs as part of their overall management there are many similarities between the programs but each is managed under different laws and each of the two agencies have somewhat different missions and instituti onal histories hr 2493 attempts to bring about more consistent management of the grazing programs of the two agencies however some of the bill provisions that address scope and applicability are ambiguous especially as to the national grasslands and as to whether changes beyond grazing are intendedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9840crs4 section 2 of the bill limits the applicability of the act stating among other things that nothing in the act should be construed to affect grazing in any unit of the national forest system managed as national grassland by the secretary of agriculture under the bankheadjones farm tenant act 7 usc 1010 et seq as noted above the national grasslands currently are part of the national forest system the exclusion of the national gr asslands from application of anything in the act related to grazing is difficult to interpret since some of the provisions of the act would also address gene ral management concerns nd therefore otherwise would usually apply to the national grasslands section 3 directs that the secretaries of agriculture and of the interior provide for consistent and coordinated ad ministration of livestock grazing and management of federal lands consistent with the laws governing such lands emphasis added section 3 appears to address both administration of livestock grazing and management of federal lands generally ye t in light of the emphasis of the rest of the bill it could also be intended to re fer only to grazing administration if on the other hand the provision is to be read lite rally and general ma nagement as well as grazing administration is included then reading sections 2 and 3 together might mean that nothing in the act related to grazing is meant to apply to the national grasslands but anything in the act that is more general such as the direction for consistency of manageme nt generally does other aspects of the bill relating to the national grasslands also are ambiguous section 101 states that title i applies to th management of graz ing on national forest system lands managed under enumerated st atutes that do not include the bankhead jones act section 102 goes on to define national forest system in that title as having the meaning it does in 16 usc 1609a except that it does not include the national grasslands this approach to controlling the applicability of the bill in part by excluding national grasslands from the definition of the national forest system term that is otherwise define d in law could produce uncertainty as to when and in exactly what ways the national grasslands are to be subject to what provisions the national grasslands curre ntly are included within the national forest system for purposes of planning and management consistent with bj act and are to be managed as one integral system with national forests it could be argued that the definition of national forest system in the bill would not alter this basic posture because the definition is changed to exclude the grasslands only for purposes of the provisions of title i therefore the new provisions of title i on monitoring of grazing allotments fees c ooperative allotment management plans etc would not apply to the national grasslands see the more detailed discussion of fees later in this report the national grasslands have been treated separately in the past having been excluded for example from the range provisions of title iv of flpma and from pria and the grazing fee formula it contai ned the same fees have nonetheless been applied to certain of the national grasslands administratively on the other hand the national grasslands ar currently regarded as s ubject to the same planning requirements as are grazing lands within national forests the bill defines land and resource management plans and uses that rm in several instances but the national grasslands would not be subject to thes provisions or to those on monitoring or cooperative management plans if enacted the issue would arise as to how the newhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9840crs5 provisions are to relate to current di rection in 16 usc 1609 to manage the national forests and national grasslands as one integral system the tension between having the national gr asslands be part of the national forest system for some purposes but not for others ma produce problems of interpretation section 101b states that the act applies to blm lands including those blm lands managed under the bj act secti on 3 directs that to the maximum extent practicable the secretary of agriculture and the secretary of the interior shall provide for consistent and coordinated administration of livestock grazing and management of federa l lands as defined in section 102 consistent with the laws governing such lands this seems to result in direction for more consistent grazing management by the two agencies regardless of the type of lands involved except that the national grasslands woul d not be subject to the ne w statutory guidance monitoring the bill as passed by the house contains provisions on monitoring on federal lands within grazin g allotments section 103 directed that monitoring be performed only by qualified persons from the specified groups which are 1 federal state and cal government personnel 2 grazing permittees and lessees 3 professional consultants retained by the united states or permittee or lessee as passed there is expr ess requirement that the persons actually performing monitoring be approved by the relevant secretary as had been required in the bill as reported perhaps the secretar ies could impose such require ment as part of general regulations on monitoring in general or regulations on what constitutes qualified persons absent such approval because permittees or consulta nts retained by them are statutorily approved generally to c onduct monitoring arguably the federal managers could be put in the position of ving to use or contest possibly unreliable monitoring data under subsection b monitoring w ould be conducted according to regional or state criteria and protocols selected by the secretary concerned it is not clear whether state criteria refers to criteria veloped by states or to criteria developed by the secretaries on statewide basis if criteria developed by states is the intended meaning it is not clear what range of discretion the secretaries might have to modify those monitoring criteria and protocols also the relationship of the new monitoring requirements to manage ment decisions is not clear to what extent could managers make decisions for example to reduce ac tive use based on conditions developing in any one grazing season subsection c2 states that the secretary concerned shall not accept monitoring data that does not meet the requirements of subsection or b this use of or rather than and may be interpreted to mean that either monitoring conducted in accordance with the protocols or monitoring conducted by persons within the categories listed under subsecti on can and possibly must be accepted if this is the intended reading permittees could submit monitoring data regardless of whether it conformed to the protocols and arguably the secretary might have to accept it httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9840crs6 subsection d requires reasonable notice of monitoring to affected permittees including prior notice to the extent pr acticable of not less than 48 hours it is not clear how the monitoring re quirements which require that the data collected from such monitoring shall be used to evaluate changes and management action on resources over time relate to th ability of federa l managers to take prompt action if circumstances in any one year warrant eg to reduce active use in drought year arguably the authority of the managers to do so is independent of the monitoring requirements but congre ss might wish to clarify this point subleasing section 104 addresses subleasing nd simply states that permittee may not enter into an agreement with another person to allow grazing on the federal lands covered by the grazing permit or lease by livestock that are neither owned nor controlled by the person issued the grazing permit or lease this language is similar to that in current 43 cfr 41307a other provisions on subleasing were dropped from the bill before passage these would have authoriz ed the secretary concerned to approve subleasing under listed circumstances including hardship instances under cooperative agreement or if permit is issued to grazing association whose members have exclusive rights to graze livestock on the federal lands allotted to the grazing associati on other provisions removed from the bill would have allowed livestock owned by certain relatives to graze without that grazing being considered as subleasing another eliminated provision would have mandated transfer of per mit to new person controlling all or part of the base property some questioned any statut ory expansion of subleasing and these provisions were dropped in favor of current regulations as they might be affected by ongoing litigation another provision would have encouraged the use of coordinated resource management practices under c ooperative management agreements and exempted such practices and agreements from the federal advisory committee act cooperative allotment management plans section 105 addresses cooperative allotment management plans although this is longer defined term in the bill as passed 105 allows agreements between permittee or group of qualified grazing permittees and fede ral personnel such th at outcomebased standards rather than prescriptive terms and conditions will govern grazing activities in specified geographic area qualified permittee is one who has met or exceeded forage and rangeland goals in applicable land use plans and in that persons grazing permit or lease for the pr evious fiveyear period agreements under the section would be required to contain measurable performance goals and all laws that apply to allotment management plans and grazing permits would continue to apply to these agreements presumably the goals and provisions of these agreements would be derived from these ws this section appears to allow for greater flexibility of management for qualifying permittees one point could be noted about the c ooperative allotment management plans the last sentence of 105a states at the request of qualif ied grazing permittee or lessee the secretary concerned shall consider including such written agreement in an allotment management plan or grazing permit or lease this language may have been intended to mean that per mittee could request an agreement under the section and if one is executed it shall be part of an allotment management plan or grazing permit however the current syntax is such that the sentence could be readhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9840crs7 1536 c f r 22252 16eg 1102 of the north american free trad agreement requires party to the agreement to treat foreign investors less fa vorably than it treats its own investors with respect the establishment acquisition expansion management conduct operation and sale or other disposition of inve stment higher fees would ppear to affect the management and operation of grazing by foreign individual or corporation with foreign shareholders continuedas meaning agreements under the section could be execute d and may at the request of permittee be made part of an allotment management plan or grazing permit grazing fees major aspect of the bill as passed is that 106 would provide new grazing fee formula grazing f ee formula had been provided by the public rangeland improvement ac t of 1978 pria but expired in 1985 the pria formula was extended and minimum f ee of 135 per animal unit month aum was established by executive order 12548 and has remained applicab to date an aum is currently defined as the amount of forage needed to sustain one animal unit for one month an animal unit is currently defined as one cow and calf one horse or five sheep or goats the pria formula reflects changes in private grazing rates the price of beef cattle and the costs of livestock production the national grasslands were not subject to pria nd eo 12548 applied only to the same lands as did pria by administrative action the fees that were applied in the national forests were also applied to national grasslands in california idaho and oregon by regulation grazing fees for the nationa l grasslands are to be established under concepts and principles similar to those for the national forests and land utilization projects which are the rest of the lands managed by the fs under the bankhead jones act15 however for the rest of the national grasslands modified pria formula is used and certain credits are allowed the new formula in hr 2493 would be ba sed primarily on hist orical 12year gross beef cattle production values including pr oduction costs and revenues and tied to shortterm treasury bill rates for the past 12 years making it more stable and less dependent on yearly fluctuations in beef prices than the pria formula the bill also would count seven sheep or goats as one aum rather than the current five thereby allowing more of such animals to graze for the same fee there is minimum payment established under the bill amendments to charge fees comparable to those on stateowned grazing lands to charge higher fees for larger producers and to strike the pr ovision allowing seven sheep or goats to be counted for billin g purposes were defeated however an amendment to charge foreign grazers diffe rent fees was adopte d section 106a2 provides that in the case of grazing permit or lease held or controlled in whole or in part by foreign corporation or foreign i ndividual the fee shall be the higher of either the average grazing fee charged by the state in which the grazing lands lie for grazing on state lands or the average grazing fee charged for grazing on private lands in the relevant state this calculation is almost certain to result in higher fees it is not clear how extensive foreign participa tion in federal grazing is and hence how much grazing this provision would likely ffect the provision ma violate the terms of nafta and other trade agreements of the united states16httpwikileaksorgwikicrs9840crs8 16continued 17public lands council v babbitt 929 f supp 1436 d wyo 1996 this case is currently on appeal the district court struck down the new blm regulations that separated grazing preference priority to receive permit from permitted use actual aums allowed on an allotment finding that the secretary failed to adequately safeguard adjudicated grazing preferences and that the regulations lacked reasoned basis in this regard eliminated provisions several provisions were eliminated from hr 2493 before passage by the house because these provisions addressed issues that might come up again as the bill is considered in the senate some of them are discussed here definitions past proposals for changing definitions related to grazing have proven controversial in part because some perceive the pr oposals as changing current law or as making applicable to one agencys grazing program elements of the other agencys program that are viewed as objectionable some definitions in hr 1493 proved c ontroversial and were removed from the bill before passage by the house but may be reconsidered by the senate allotment had been defined as an area of federal land subject to an adjudicated or apportioned grazing preference that is appurtenant to commensurate base property this definition rais ed several issues it used language relevant to grazing administered by the blm under the taylor grazing act and woul d have made that language applicable to grazing administered by the fs depending on how the courts ultimately decide issu addressing the nature of grazing preference under the tga an issue currently being litigated17 because of the consistency requirement in 3 the proposed definition might have produced changes in the nature of fs grazing absent the definition change 3 might otherwise necessitate some changes in fs grazing to make that agencys grazing consistent with that of blm to the extent consistent with the laws govern ing such lands however new enacted definitions would be new w applicable to both fs an d blm lands and therefore arguably more changes to fs administra tion could have been possible and possibly mandated as consistent with the laws governing both agencys lands this result could be desirable or not depe nding on ones point of view the definition of allotment eliminated before passage also would have stated that the federal lands in an allotment w ould be appurtenant to commensurate base property base property is nonfederal property that is used as the basis under the tga for determining that an applicant for grazing permit may be entitled to preference for grazing permit the eliminated definition of base property also would have referred to the federal allo tment being appurtena nt to private base property some argued that using the term appurtenant would lend support to assertions that grazing permit is more than mere privilege or license but rather being more in the nature of right thereby making adjustments in grazing permits and active use more difficult to achieve and possibly resulting in compensation being owed when the federal managers made such changes the tga states expressly thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9840crs9 1843 usc 315bissuance of grazing permit shall not create any right title interest or estate in or to the lands18 blacks law dictionary 6th ed indicates that the terms appurtenance and appurtenant connote relationship of two things one of which is subservient to the other one thing that is incident to the other which is the principal however the examples given in blacks to illustrate the concept are property interests rights of way easements etc and this is the most common way in which the terms are used even if the terms can be used in connection with things that are not property interests the fact that the terms usually are used in that context could be seen as connoting greater status for grazing privileges also it would be more correct to say that grazing preference might be appurtenant to base property rather than federal lands themselves being appurtenant si nce lands cannot be appurtenant to other lands in any event these are terms currently used only in the tga the new statutory language would also be applicable to fs grazing permits another definition dropped during consideration was consultati on cooperation and coordination that was defined as engaging in good faith efforts to fully communicate and provide for mutually supported action to achieve mutually agreed purpose there was some concern that this language could potentially give veto power over federal decisions especia lly in those situations where only grazing permittees would be inter acting with federal manage rs as for example in 103 which would have referred to terms and conditions of grazing permits arrived at by the authorized officer in consultati on cooperation and coor dination with the permittee or lessee the eliminated term coordinated resource management would have been defined as voluntary manage ment activities that involve consultation cooperation and coordination of fs or bl m managers with affected state or federal agencies private land owners and user s of federal lands the use of the phrase involving mutually agreed upon actions and purpos appears quite ppropriate when non federal lands and activ ities are involved but the same objection to the potential for veto power with respect to users of the federal lands could be raised the eliminated term c ooperative management agr eement would have been defined as an agreement between the secretary and permittee that would be consistent with and incorporate by refere nce relevant provisions of existing land use plans but would allow flexibility bey ond the limits of an llotment management plan or grazing permit or leas see 105 of the bill as passed resource advisory councils the provisions in earlier versions of hr 2493 that related to the resource advisory c ouncils racs were also removed from the bill racs were established under the ne w department of the interior grazing regulations applicable to blm lands including them in the bill would have made the councils applicable to fs lands as well the rac provisions in hr 2493 differed from current regulations in several respects under hr 2493 as reported rac by simple majority vote could seek secretarial review of instances where it felt its advice on blm decision was arbitrarily disregarded the prospect of secretarial review could be daunting to range managers and other decisionmakers facing thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs9840crs10 opposition of relevant rac on issues u nder current regulations rac may only seek secretarial review upon the nimous vote of its members in addition before the rac provisi ons were dropped hr 2493 required racs to include balanced and broad re presentation of va rious interest groups similar to those mentioned under current regula tions but with some differences for example the reference to environmental par ticipants was to repres entatives of local environmental organizations thereby arguab ly precluding representatives of national environmental groups from par ticipating on rac the re also was requirement that rac members be local residents also the members would not have been grouped as they are under current regulations and the voting provisions of the bill would have made the racs function less as consensus bodi than is true under the regulations current regulations stipulate that rac membership be divided into three general groupings 1 grazing pe rmittees and commercial user groups 2 environmental recreational archeological and historical groups and 3 tribal state or local elected officials state natural resources managers academicians and the affected public at large under each of the three models for racs available under the regulations actions may be taken by the rac unless the majority of the representatives of each of the three groups concurs this structure protects the viewpoint of each of the three categories of members as orig inally written in hr 2493 all voting would have been by simple majority vote lesse ning the protection for minority points of view this diffe rence in rac decisionmaking could have resulted in very different outcomes the bill as passed is silent on many issu that proved controversial in the 104th congress such as water rights application of the national environmental policy act in the grazing context appeals access to federal lands across private lands and ownership of range improvements
