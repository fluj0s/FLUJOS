contained fijs dear sir on friday july 8 1977 approximately 150 agents of fee federal bureau of investigation simultaneously raided the offices of the church of scientology in angeles and washington d c the purported reason for the breakin was the justice departments allegations thai certain government agencies had been eavesdropped upn and files froih their offices copied factually the fbi raid consisted ofagents using sledge hammers crow bars and buzz saws entering among other places sleeping quarters and occupied showers in an attempt to seize approximately iso documents the fbi left with over 200000 documents legal remedies have been commenced by the church the most recent being 7 8 million dollar suit seeking dis fromeach and every agent tafeng part in the raid many more such suits are oejllg planned the raid was characterized by an fbi agent as the most brutal search and seizure ive ever seen or been involved inm daniel sheelxan jesuit chairman of the civil rights task force of fee washington interretigious staff council points out that the raid is one more stage of an escalating confrontation which is devel oping between the american church community and investigative agencies of the federal executive department11 i it is the view of many civil rights groups and individuals that the actions taken by the fbi constituted an inexcusable violation of constitutional rights the raid was as well merely culmination of years of illegal actions taken by govern ment intelligence agencies against religious groups and individuals violations of constitutional rights by intelligence and executive branch agen cies must cease now the raid on our church can mark turning point in history wherein congress finally states weve had enough and begins effective reform of such agencies nonprofit corporation in the usa registered in th _ jetof columbia1 2 scjthe church of scientology has been active for years in the area of social reform our activities have included exposure of psychiatric abuse of mental patients the returning of care and dignity to the elderly prevention and handling of drug abuse reverting the skyrocketing crime rate and engaging in governmen tal reform our work continues in these and other areas despite fbi actions congress has been aware of and sensitive to the intelligence agency issues raised over the past few years the high point publicitywise was of course watergate it must be confronted by yourself right now that many of the same abuses of watergate have not decreased at ail the opposite is true cia secret druggings and use of psychiatric techniques such as lobotomies and electrocon vulsive therapy on unsuspecting citizens is one recent example attorney general bells recent proposals to extend legal surveillance and taps to persons who have not committed crime is another these abuses go way back certainly the fbis treatment 3f martin luther king is one of the most disgraceful incidents in american history fbi coottiskpro revelations and ijeral spying by the cia and nba are others consider also the sss of the internal revenue service person has to be blind ignorant or downright evil to not perceive the implica tions through the freedom of information act foia the church of scientology has discovered that we like other socially active churches have been the victim of mail covers surveillance wire taps agents provocateurs and variety of false and misleading but intentionally placed news stories to remedy this the church has filed 750 mittiotfjawsujjt against various governmental agencies seeking to expose such activities our unprecedented use of foi has uncovered incredible information and ridiculous false reports about scientology there are currently twentyfive law suits pending because many agencies will not comply to various requests by the church to release files on scientology to us the church of scientology is known well to the justice department who have instructed their lawyers in reference to scientology cases to come back with your shield held high or on your shield the justice department has had us customs seize our mail correspon dence which included legal strategy relative to foi this was done under the guise of looking for pornography the mail was passed on to the us attorneys handling our cases recently churchsponsored commission turned over to congress report on bolivian interpol agents trafficking in cocaine names were included the justice department it was hoped would investigate and find the various connec tions within the us their answer was to raid our churchm 3 exposures done thus far of illegal activities by justice and other agencies has only shown the tip of the iceberg very thorough investigation must take place immediately into the justice department and fbi harassment of religious groups and abusive foi practices i j you should agree that this investigation is necessary or would like more information please

all vhat type of incriminating documents against the fbi could the church of scientology have the fbi is run by hunan beings not gods and humans do err at times as human being and citizen i am asking you to call for an investigation into the fbis antd church activities i think that an honest and correct investigation of the fbi will surprise people as did he watergate iny sincerely the founding

july 8 1977 approximately 150 agents of the federal bureau of investigation simultaneously raided ie offices of the church of scientology in angeles and washington jd c twk purported reason for the breakin wa the justice departments allegations that certain government agencies had beet eavesdropped11 upon and files from their offices copied factually the fbi raid consisted of ents using sledge hammers crow bars and bias saws entering among other placest sleeping quarters and occupied showers in an attempt to seize approximately 150 documents the fbi left with over 200000 documents legal remedies have been commenced by the church the most recent being 78million dollar suit seeking damages from each and every agent taking fsrfc in tfye raid many more such suits ate being planned tjhe raid was characterized byan fbi agerii as the most brutal search at seizure ive ever seen or been involved in daniel sheehan jesuit chairman f the civil rights task force of the washington interreligious staff council points out that the raid is one more stage of an escalating confrontation which is devel oping between the american church community and investigative agencies of the federal executive department1 itis the view of many civil rights groups and individuals that the actions taken by the fbi constituted an inexcusable violation of constituational rights the raid was as well merely culmination of years of illegal actions taken by govern ment intelligence agencies against religious groups and individuals violations of constitutional rights by intelligence and executive branch agen cies must cease now the raid on our church can mark turning point in history wherein congress finally states weve had enough and begins effective reform of such agencies moilnmfif rnmnm 2 the church of scientology has been active for years in the area of social reform our activities have included exposure of psychiatric abuse of mental patients the returning of care and dignity to the elderly t prevention and handling of drug abuse reverting the skyrocketing crime rate and engaging in governmen tal reform our work continues in these and other areas despite fbi actions congress has been aware of and sensitive to the intelligence agency raised over the past few years the high point publicitywise was of issues watergatecour it must be confronted by yourself sight now that many of the same abuses of watergate have not decreased at all the opposite is true cia secret druggings and use pf psychiatric techniques such as lobotomies and electrocoja vulsive therapy on unsuspecting citizens is one recent example attorney cjener bells recent proposals to extend legal surveillance and taps to persons who have not committed crime is another these abuses go way back certainly the fbis treatment of martin luther king is one of the most disgraceful incidents ic american history fbiointelpro revelations and internal spying by the cia and nsa are others consider also the msss of the internal revenue service person has to be blind ignorant or downright evil to not perceive the implica tions through the freedom of information act foia the church of scientology has discovered that we like other socially active churches have been the victim of mail covers surveillance wireiaps agents provocateurs and varietyof false an misleading but intentionally placed news stories to remedy this the church has filed 50 million lawsuit against various governmental agencies seeking to expose swh activities i our unprecedented use foi has uncovered incredible information and ridiculous false reports about scientology there are currently twentyfive law suits pending because many agencies will not comply to various requests by the church to release files on scientology to us the church of scientology is known well to the justice department who have instructed their lawyers in reference to scientology cases to come back with your shield held high or on your shield the justice department has had us customs seize our mail correspon dence which included legal strategy relative to foi this was done under the gui of looking for pornography the mail was passed on to the us attorneys handling our cases recently churchsponsored commission turned over to congress repo on bolivian interpoi agents trafficking in cocaine nameswere included the justice department it was hoped would investigate and find the various connec tions within the us their answer was to raid our church 3 exposures done thus far of illegal activities by justice and other agencies has only shown the tip of the iceberg very thorough investigation must take place immediately into the justice department and fbi harassment of religious groups and abusive foi practices if

were turned over to the iit s which then made the assessment and levied upon cash that had been seized along with the wagering records in subsequent stale criminal proceedings against respondent the warrant was held to be defective and the seized items were ordered returned following an independent determination i that the warrant was unconstitutional the district court quashed the assessment as being based upon evideoce procured in violation of the fourth amendment and granted judgment for respondent in determining whether to extend the exclusionary rule to civil procecdirij the court in jams adopted the balancing approach of united stales v calandra 44 us 338 194 the task before the court was to balance the likely icterrcnt effect of extending the exclusionary rule to civil proceedings against the cost to society of excluding tbe eyideqe cognizant of the tuiles substantial cost to society interest in law enforcement and the absence of empirical evidence of the hules deterrent effect the court carefully examined the possible added deterrence stemming from an extension of the exclusionary rule to this situation it found that exclusion of this evidence from both federal and state criminal prosefiitswis was substantial punishment and concluded that exclusion from federal civil proceedings of evidence unlawfully seized by state criminal enforcement officer has not been shown to have sufficient likelihood of deterring the conduct of the state police so lhat it outweighs the societal costs imposed by the exclusion v 2 z 4 5 6 7 8 9 xo 31 18 13 ii 15 16 1 18 19 20 21 2z 23 24 25 2g 2v 20in response to the argument that prior cases have held that the exchsioia rule does apply to civil proceedings the court distinguished situation involvin search by one sovereign and use by another intersovercign from the situation of search and use by the same sovereign intrasovereign the j i marginal increase in deterrent effect in the inlersovereign situation is so j i attenuated according to the court that it is outweighed by the clear societal costs therefore the court declined to further extend the exclusionary rule to civil prcceedisigjs in the intersovetseijgg situation although janis does not directly control this case because it involved thei intersovereign situation if does furaisji the analytical approach for resolving i this case clearly the teaching of janis is that in determining whether or not i the exclusionary rule applies to civil proceedings court must balance the j costs to society gi the likely increase in deterrence of police misconduct the suprcpse cmart has never resolved this balancing question in the inta j sovereign situation as is here presented while numerous federal cases have licidei the question of the

the full and complete investigation of possible mal feasance on the other hand the likelihood of increased deterrence is minimal as the court of appeals recognized the judicially created remedy was

evidence in subse quent civil proceeding will encourage fbi agents to draft search warrants more narrowly to avoid the problem which judge bryant detected the court has concluded that in this casethe

september 1977 hidear sir last july 8th the federal bureau of investigation raided the angeles jand washington offices of the church of scientology allegedly looking for stolen documents the government claimed that the church sent staff members into government agencies to copy documents that we were unable to obtain under the freedom of infornaiob act foia the documents that were confiscated by the fbi were foia documents which disclosed that th government had infiltrated the church under cover and the raid itself was ruled illegal and unconstitutional and the government was ordeted to return the documents currently the justice department is carrying on an inquisition using grand jury to obtain evidence for the allegations mentioned above one of our ministers the reverend arthur mreis who ust happened to be the first person present at the angeles office dor leg the raid was served with john doe subpoena maren minister and also publisher of the churchs newspaper exercised his first amendment rights before the grand jury and refused to give testimony or be part of the witch hunt that has been going on against our religion for over 35 days recently as last ditch attempt to have rev maren break down he was placed in solitary confinement the reason given was his oa protection yet when the press began to put pressure on the justice epartmett fey making inquiries into the confinewjisfc he was immediately moved to regular cell for over 25 years church has been the victim of false reports through out government files harassment false arrests electronic surveillance and infiltration we have recently released publication entitled the american inquisitionwhih outlines some of these tactics the publication is compilation of sample documents obtafeed under the freedom of information act from government files on the church the booklet itself shows pattern of haras snent uhat is unmistakable this publication is described in detail in the second of two enclosed sditorials by james kilpatrick the first is in addition to an excellent article 4 very fair description of the events of the raid0 2 we have only guessed why 130 fbi agents would raid nonviolent group with sledge hammers crowbars and buzz saws ripping apart files and knocking down doors in the largest fbi raid to date in the united states we have been setting legal precedents under foia and have obtained an affidavit that the justice department has ordered its lawyers when fighting scientology eases to come back with your shields held high or dead on them we uncovered massive drug smuggling ring in government that involves gjfjlnterpol and two days prior to the raid broke the story over the national wires fwe have published the irs papers compilation of 200 documents which the f firs attempted to keep secret and wewere placed oa the irs enemies list has early as 1959 we publicly attacked mental health bill that would permit police to arrest and send people indiscriminately to mental institutioiis in alaska and we mentioned then vice president nixons name as supporter within two days of this expose secret service agents came to the church in washingtonand threatened us never to use nixosas name again in publication i have also enclosed recent article by mary mcgrory of the washington another example of editorial reaction following the rai we have only been able to guess so far why the current ral3 and grand jury attack has occurred we would greatly appreciate it if you would write to attorney general bell on our behalf ahd ask mm

sledgehammers and crowbars they broke into filing cabinets and safes and harassed church ministers by denying them access to areas being searched by misquoting the law rooms where married couples were sleeping were entered occupied showers were entered one church member was injured when struck on the forehead with clipboard by an agent within hours church ministers were holding press conferences planning the long involved legal strategy that would inevitably follow and seeking court restraining order to prevent any further illegal destruction of church property in the weeks that followed the work began to pay off within two weeks of the raid federal judge in washington dc ruled that the raids were illegal as they were based on an illegally broad search warrant and ordered all materials seized by the fbi during the raid in washington dc impounded pending appeal on august 8th exactly one month after the raid federal judge in angeles ruled that the dc decision applied to the angeles raid the church meanwhile has filed two soils against the fbi one for 78 million for the angeles raids and one for 1 million for the dc raid this incident is one in long series of attempts by government agencies to suppress and harass the church of scientology documentation of this fact was pub lished in church publication entitled the american inquisition the church has had suit pending against the fbi and other government agencies for 750 million charging conspiracy and harassment based on long years oi experience in dealing with these government agencies the nazi mentality of

not only guaranteed under the constitution of the united states of america but is vital to the survival of any freedomloving people as revivals of religious values are the only factor that has brought man out of the dark ages the great civilizations of this planet have had in their culture an inherent acknowledgement of spiritual values attempts to deny these values have been recognized to be the last dying spasms of doomed culture the church of scientology believes that man is basically good and that an acknowledgement of spiritual values is vital for the survival of race it is towards these

scientology the governments current battle with the church of scientology seems to have developed from case of bureaucratic shortsighted ness the mistrust between the two parties dates back to when the irs was trying to decide whether scientology was really religion or not finding the answer to this perplexing question seems to have required commitment of agents time and money from the ir and the fbi more extensive than that for many communist terror groups fighting back the scientologists apparently undertook their alleged scheme to infiltrate the government to find oat just what it was they were thinking about them flws led to the recent fbi raid on scientology headquarters to get back allegedly stolen government documents on the sect whatever us the cientotogists may have broken in

accused of brainwashing howeve that charge has beehurled againstso many different sects even those that most people would consider traditional that it has ceased to have any real meaning many ugly rumors have been associated with the scieatofogists but we adhere to the concept that person is innocent until proven guilty there ate too many people willing to believe the worst about anyone who is different to put much credence on unproven allegations the constitution makes clear that the government has rote in passing value judgments on the truth or falsehood of any system of beliefs the province of the taw is actions not belief or motivation if scientologists break the law then they must suffer the conse quences but the government should be prevented from using the instruments of the law to punish group because it is different we feel the government has overreacted in this case 14 friday july 15 1977victorvfhe california daily pressscientology church seeks social reform by mike

scientology are not asked to believe anything claims hubbard the basic fundamental beginning in scientology means taking the communication course which is suppose to teach students how to confront how to remain in present time for long periods and how to avoid mental traps persons entering scientology are given spiritual counselor for guidance the different levels of sciousness proceed from class

denied church attorneys requests for an order blocking the confiscation of church documents scientology is religion that almost seems to take pride in being attacked one church spokesman explained

members dianetics presdeitoioy the development of scientology goes back to the early life of lafayette ronald hubbard who is best known for being writer philosopher and founder of dianetics and however scientologists eagerly point out that hub bard was universal man and an expert photographer glider pilot navigator and ships captain horticulturist and engineer hubbard claims that he first conceived of dianetics in 1930 when he began to explore thrmifld influenced by the religious writings of the vedic hymns the holy books of the hmdu hubfewd began to develop the principles of dianetics which means through the soul hubbard calls dianeticj the first fully precise science of the mind he also hashed that the world before dtaneftcs had never known precision mental science k the turning point in dianetics was in 1938 when hub bard says i discovered tftat the common denominator of all existence was survival hubbard claims that the end product of dianetics u well happy hfgb iq human being and provides the route from aberrated for aberrated and im human to well happy high q human being hubbard goes on to say that physical illness aches pains continual exhaustion body malfunctions are creating or held in an unchanging state by the mind this is called psychosomatic psychospirit somaticbody il lness it has been known about fora century but there has never been positive remedy

this is not new in 1963 toe federal government perpetrated similar raid on the founding church in washington dc carting off several tons of religious materiats the church fought that bittte for ten long years in the courts and finally won the case with the government returning all seized materials since then the church has employed the freedom or information act to force further disclosure of governmental hanassment and false information circulated by federal officials and have found shocking false reports at every step the government ms responded wttft kazi mentality and this latest tactic proves to the church beyond reasonable doubt hat the govenmfertt is teniftafrnd it resorting to toe fina frantic at tempts to prevent toe ultimate dis closures both toe church and the

able to find in mabcovers and other means the fbi has not permitted the chruch to xerox copies of materials they took however church obser vers indicate that fbi is on fishing expedition in fact they have taken church documents and documentsobtained by toe church under toe freedom of information act the history and tactics of the fbi are becoming painfully known to the american public and this latest ges tapo raid shows there has been reform in government dirt tricks they have in effect proven to the church that toe churchs research it correct that there is massive international narcotics cartel here tofore unrevealed which is operating with the knowledge and consent of highly placed governmental officials both here and abroad who will go to any means and use any tactics to pre vent its disclosure that secret car tel is behind the heroine and cocaine snuggling in this country and ex tends into toe highest ranks of toe french judicial and police systems thus it is coincidence that the church of scientology in france was raided last year during that probe the church is not talking about few dishonest cops the church is talking about an operation that is being rn with the blessing of french offkjtls and toe cooperation of american officials in washington from whence toe orders for this raid caffle the raid of the church is in keeping with toe criminal mentality of the government and the church is now tededicating itself to the fight not only for religious liberty out to expose those who are seeking to turn this country into police state the past history of toe church in vigorous government reform and the 750 million dollar suit the church has against the vs govern ment for conspiracy filed several months ago it certainly motive enough tor the us government to use whatever reasons they could create to get toe churchs informa tion and legal documents the church is naturally akin imme diate legal action 17 i decatur 111 july 30 1977 scientology raid rightly condemnedfederal agents botched another job ts district judge william 8 bryant has ruled that government raids on church 6f scientology offices in washington and angeles were illegal what itte fit sought was in formation about whether the church had infiltrated federal agencies and filched files rather than limiting their search to appropriate documents government agents grabbed everything in sight judge bryant told the government to return everything to the churc saying the warrant itself was illegal because it was drawn toobroadly there is good reason for judge bryants rukng rhich stems from the fourth amendment baa on unreasonable search andseizure of property the government for in stance might suspect you of engaging in illegal activities search warrant must specify both probable cause of your criminal intent and be precise about evidence related to those chines actually in your physical eyidettce or documents specified in the waftant can be legally taken government agents have authority to seize other items simply because they look in teresting otherwise ordinary people could be left vulnerable to given epefjehce th the h government the fraeqers of tbe constitution had toslions like this in mind thej wrote t fourth amendment they wanted sharp limits put on the right of government agents to invade the private affairs of peo plejudge bryants decision therefore is well founded in constitutional theory and case law interpreting that section of the constitution the government may appeal judge bryants ruling although reversal seems unlikely an inquiry by congress or the justice department into the circumstances of the raid is very much in order those who authorized the taid should be subjected to disciplinary measures particularly if judge bryants ruling is anoed to stand tftese procedural violations give government agencies the appearance of violating the very laws their agents are sworn to uphold on more practical level it sharply educes the prospects of presetting people and organizations for actual viola tions of the law which or so most people understand is the primary mission of law forcement agencies 18 july 31 1977 washington early

would get its doors smashed down by federal agents what is this church all about what are its motivation resources and religious mission tjie church was founded in 1954 by l ron hubbard phuosopftef who used to write science fiction it grew to be the largest of fie burgeoning american religious cults during the 1960s the cjturchs ideals are based on social science developed in the 1940s by hubbard he called it dianet ics from the greek meaning through the mind go the late 1940s hobbard wrote several books based on the subject including dianeucs the modern sci ence of mental health the church claims it has sold more than 15 rattuon copies pianettes is tossed m the premise that mental and physical health coatdbe achieved through the mind of sbdivf dual using special counseling techniques hubbard research in the held led him to the religious belief that man fca basieallv good spiritual being whose mind anf body can be saved only by the individual spirit this is the principle on which hubbard founded the church 73 churches 160 missions scientology literally the study of howto know has grown to include ft separately incorporated churches and 160 missions worldwide of those 24 churches and 98 missions are in the united states the majority of the cljurchs activities though espe cially those in the public eye apparently are lacking in religious motivation most of its resources are devoted to jeemingly secular projects the church is engaged in three areas of activity traditional religious activities such as sunday services weddings and funerals recruiting customers for various moneyraising activities such as selling books instruction and counsel ing in the primarily secular study of dianetics and acientology 19 continued social reform projects such as lobbying state and federal governments and legislatures investigating leged social injustices and using lawsuits to fight what scientologists perceive to be federal violations of dvil liberties washington gatherings tiny some church officials describe the sunday ministra tions as being closer to lectures than services at the founding church in washington the sunday gathering is in small roonrabout 20 feet square the religious aspect of scientology church spokesmen say centers on hubbatds belief that the spirit aftne may save or heal the body as stated in the creed hubbard developed unlike christian scientists who reject modern medi tine in favor of faithhealing scientologists believe healing power comes from the individual rather than supreme being although the fehurch acknowledges supreme being referred to as god the author of the universe1 or the cause it does not dictate dcgtya as to forms of worship the origin or destination ef souls the source of life or many other traditional religious concerns in this respect scientology is similar to eastern religions such asbuddhism whose doctrines emphasize the knowledge and experience of die individual most western felons are founded on the wili or power of supreme being other foiths not excluded because he church does not deaf in traditional elig ious dogma ft allows the unusual opportunity fet ite members simultaneously to hold rjttffltetshipand be liefs in other more orthodox churches the religious activities of the church remain largely unseen by the public because few of its reported four million followers are involved in clearly religious endeav ors and because such endeavors are secondary to more secular activities m the church most of the church staff and space are devoted to recruiting and moneyraising activities church recruiting procedures include television adver tising featuring public figures like former san francisco 49ers quarterback john brodie and free personality tests distributed on street corners and college campuses during recent recruiting efforts at church mission in dallas for example religious claims were made the only services offered were described as secular classes and counseling in dianetics that would according to the staff strengthen weaknesses discovered in toe personali ty evaluation the church is nearly 100 per cent funded by fees for instruction and counseling services offered at the missions and churches charges for counseling called auditing or processing by the church range from about fssto about 75 per tour for minimum 13 noun

completes any advanced church course for arfee of 155 to nearly u300 depending on the course nearly ail church activities are funded by these chargescalled donations and much of the money is spent on socialreform efforts investigations into alleged government abuses and legal battles with gov ernment agencies these activities constitute the third main area of church operation they are the side of the church most visible the public eye and they are the reason for the doorsmashing raid by the federal agents the churchsactmst role in pushing soda and govern ment reforms dates back to the late w50s and began as an offshoot of hubbards dianetics theory in those early years the church of scientologys efforts and comments on social reform were stilt clearly related to its doctrine it was primarily interested in mental health treatment as related to dianetics which includes the philosophy that mental illness can be overcome by the mindof the individual with special counseling confrontation in 195 according to spokesmen for the church it first ran foul of the government 1959 wnen it objected to vice president richard nelfs apparent support of mental treatment by involuntary confinement of persons deter mined by police to be unbalanced after voicing its objection church spokesmen say the church was visited by secret service agents and told to simply knock it off s staff members were pushed round press officer for the secret service said it has files on the incident he said that visit may have occurred but that nobody was pushed around because we dont operate that way with that incident the church began its relationship with the federal government on the wrong foot since then the church has become mere and more involved in issues less related to its doctrine after the nixon incident the church asserts it was infiltrated by an undercover agent of the pood and drug administration fda who pretended to be parisnoner 20 continuedlego unionaccording to fda officials and to documents provided by the church that infiltration consisted of as fda inspector who enrolled in 150 course at the academy of scientology in washington his contact with the church lasted only

established procedure that is being followed by the federal prosecutors which is virtually identical to the old star chamber or inquisition procedure which was developed by the catholic church and finally taken over by the british government just beforethe pilgrims left england because of the violations of their religious rights in various parts of the country they are attempting to use the power of sub poena to draw in lawabiding citizens and to demand from them alt infor mation they might have that is of value to the federal prosecutors the federal prosecutors are taking this information and putting it into their computer banks and they are keeping dossiers on everybody from the civilrights movement to any other type of movement that the federal prosecu tors feel they want to have informa tion about q how h this particularly ap plicable to fiie church the latent move on the part of the federal prosecutors is to move into the church communities and to attempt to extract from high church officials any and all information they have that might be of value to the federat prosecutor some of these areas are specific attempts to find outafeout the internal structure of the hispawc cdffiknunity early this year lumber of people who worked up in the national council of churchs of fices and also is the national episco pal offices were contacted by fbi agents and ordered to

of the church groups for the last five years and copies of ait of the travel vouchers and lists of all of the places any of the church membefs had gone in the last five years now this was viewed as abso lute anathema by the church people and they refused to go along with this so the federal prosecutors had them thrown into prison this is the rebirth of the inquisition q dont tie prosecutors have need for information to prosecute criminals actually were talking about people who have mere suspicion thata case might exist they do net have probable cause to believe that any particular crime has been commit ted the 4th amendment to the united states constitution states that people cannot be arrested they can not have their homes searched they cannot forcefully be required to di vulge confidential information about their papers until such time as the federal prosecutors have probable cause to believe that crime has feeea committed now thats an ex traordinarily important safeguard that has been put into the constitu tion what is happening now is that the federal prosecutors are starting to arrest people and drag them in front of federal grand juries on mere suspicion that some type of offense inay have been committed now that is total violation of the most funda mental standards of fairness that have been enshrined in the united states constitution thats the real nature of the problem its not that they believe crime has been com mitted with any legitimate basis and re just trying to investigate it father theyre trying to find crimes q why is it churches are now becoming particular target the reason is that the churches over the last decade or more since the civil eights movement and since vatican ii especially under pope john xxiii have become much much more active in attempting to reacfe out to the poor and the op pressed people in attempts to assist these people in obtaining justice be cause of this new effort on the part of the church in the areas of social jus tice the federat prosecutors have come to believe that we have now established confidential relationships with number of these people who are the outcasts of the established society and it is these people that the federal prosecutors want to know bout and they believe that the churches will act as an intermediary and will be willing to give up this continued 26 ft thewishington starjoc t

has come forth aggressively to defend the right of this recognized church minister to refuse to answer these questions 0 could this lead to the abuse by churches that prowem arises of course with any one of the constitutional rights if the citizens have right of v privacy in their homes its always possible that that could be abused that people could do illegal things in the internal rooms of their ownhomes and it might be very difficult for federal prosecutors to find that out the same thing is true with re spect to priestpenitent relationships to the catholic church if in fact priest chose to

suits by the controversial church all of the doors were busted through even after we told them we would give them keys church spokesman said they opened files and safe the spokesman estimated several thou sand documents were taken vs dist court judge william bryant ruled that the fbi unconstitutionally seized the documents but stayed his order that they be returned to the church until the government appealed ft appealed his order last week the raid was prompted by 33page affidavit given law enforcement officials by former church member which accused church members of engaging in illegal burglaries of the us courthouse in washington and said church offi cials and numbers were attempting to infiltrate the government to steal documents relating to the church federal grand jury is investigating the church and one officialthe rev arthur maren has spent 17 days in jail on contempt of court charges for failing to answer questions as the courts have judged that the raid was illegal we feel that it is not ok for these government employes to commit criminal acts and not have to account for them church spokesman said the raid deprived us of our constitutional rights and

particular need it is encaged in trying to pro tect us from the church of scientol ogy apparently because it is there the church has always excited the unfriendly interest of the govern ment nobody is entirely sere why what started the fda the first federal agency to enlist in the 20year crusade was dianetic device called anemeter which scien tologists believe helps clear the soul of painful past experiences as macbeth said to cleanse the stuff dbosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the soul whatever their beliefs the scien tologists are tough in practice they strike back when the feds start push ing them around the fbi may have met its match the fbi acquires documents about them they acquire documents about the fbi the present engagement is over whether they get them by fair means the freedom of information act which they ctoiira or foul xs reptrtlous entry as the r 31 is charg ing thats moans to which the bu reau has resorted itself in times past now the scientologists have picked up another f3i tricsc or so says the f3i they have infiltrated the f3i and the bureau ioes not believe that turnbou is fair play the fbi apparently doesnt even know how many of the emen

sledgehammers federal judge who is obviously insensitive to the scientology men ace said that the raid was illegal and that the papers had to be given back so it may have been desperation that was speaking when justice partment attorney declared that the agents had read enough of the docu ments to find out that the fbi is being soied on from within youd think they had enough papers at the j

of the members in the future note his intention to interview employers in pinellas county ill the future as he has ia the past it is also obvious that mr mcniff sought tojfxt the church anf its members in an odious light by indicating that wandamartin and junjphillips were members of the churched were being investigated for criminal conduct he has proof that these individuals are or were
