j herz richard rimkunas julie stone and karen tritz domestic social policy division hurricane katrina medicaid issues summary medicaid is jointly financed by the federal and state governments but each state designs and administers its own version of the program under broad federal guidelines the complexity of medicaid can present an enormous challenge in meeting the needs of hurricane katrinas victims especially when evacuees cross state lines state variation in eligibility covered services and the reimbursement and delivery of services is the rule rather than the exception furthermore although medicaid is targeted at individuals with low income not all of the poor are eligible and not all those covered are poor as federalstate program that helps to finance health care services for people with limited resources medicaid is an obvious avenue of quick response for support of victims in the aftermath of disaster the programs federal budgetary status as mandatory spending means that federal funding is available to support coverage for all people who meet the programs eligibility criteria without the need for supplemental appropriation however the ability of medicaid to respond to disaster in terms of the numbers and types of people who can rely on it for health care support may depend on number of factors including congressional action to modify statutory provisions eg the level of federal medicaid reimbursement offered to states the secretary of health and human services ability to waive certain program requirements administratively eg regarding eligibility and benefits and actions of the states each of whom operates its own unique medicaid program within federal guidelines this report which will be updated as events warrant discusses the following medicaids rules on eligibility benefits and financing in the context of current questions and issues raised by hurricane katrina recent state actions in response to medicaid issues raised by the hurricane

the program under broad federal guidelines the complexity of medicaid can present an enormous challenge in meeting the needs of hurricane katrinas victims especially when evacuees cross state lines state variation in eligibility covered services and the reimbursement and delivery of services is the rule rather than the exception furthermore although medicaid is targeted at individuals with low income not all of the poor are eligible and not all those covered are poor while some of the federal rules governing medicaid are flexible enough to allow states to act without federal intervention in the wake of hurricane katrina certain issues raised by the disaster may be addressed only through administrative or legislative action by the federal government on the administrative front the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms has developed voluntary medicaid waiver option to address some of the hurricanerelated eligibility and benefit issues raised in this report on the legislative front congressional action may be required if enhanced federal reimbursement is to be provided to states for medicaid costs incurred as result of hurricane katrina congress may also consider the desirability of uniform treatment of hurricane victims across states rather than relying on participation in the waiver program developed by cms number of bills that would provide hurricane katrina medicaid and schip relief have been introduced this report begins with discussion of medicaids rules on eligibility benefits and financing in the context of current questions and issues raised by hurricane katrina many of which could arise in the wake of other emergency situations eg hurricane rita it then provides information on recent actions taken by states discusses federal medicaid waiver authority and describes current federal legislation dealing with medicaid and hurricane relief efforts medicaid eligibility and access background in general to qualify for medicaid coverage an individual must meet both categorical and financial eligibility requirements categorical eligibility requirements relate to the age or characteristics of an individual categories of individuals that may qualify for medicaid generally include aged persons 65 and over certain crs2 persons with disabilities children and their parents and pregnant women in addition within federal guidelines states set functional requirements for individuals seeking medicaidcovered longterm care services financial requirements govern the amount of income and assets that categorically eligible individuals may have and still qualify for medicaid as well as how these amounts are calculated eg whether portion of earned income or the value of car may be disregarded the specific income and asset limitations that apply to particular group are determined through combination of federal requirements and state options consequently different standards apply to different groups and the standards themselves may vary considerably among states individuals who do not meet categorical eligibility requirements eg nonelderly adults who are not disabled and do not have children generally cannot qualify for medicaid coverage even if they are poor however as discussed later in this report section 1115 waivers which allow the secretary of health and human services hhs to waive certain statutory medicaid requirements for purposes of conducting research and demonstration projects provide exceptions to these eligibility rules for states that have obtained an approved waiver issues raised by hurricane katrina people who are currently eligible for their states medicaid program may face difficulty accessing health care services if they have lost their medicaid cards and other identification or have been evacuated from their home state in addition to creating problems for those who are current medicaid enrollees the large losses of hurricane katrinas victims may also swell the numbers of people who are financially eligible for medicaid either in their home state or in the state to which they have been evacuated residency current federal medicaid rules governing residency help in understanding which program is the right one for evacuees to appeal to if they believe they are medicaid eligible state medicaid programs are required to provide coverage to all state residents who are otherwise eligible for medicaid an individual is generally considered resident of state if he or she is living in it with the intention of remaining there permanently or indefinitely eligibility may not be denied because an individual has not resided in the state for specified period or because the individual is temporarily absent from the state state is also prohibited from denying coverage to an individual who satisfies residency rules but who did not establish residence in the state before entering medical institution for currently enrolled medicaid recipients who have been displaced from their home state the home state is required under certain circumstances to pay for covered services ie covered under the home states medicaid program furnished in another state to the same extent that it would pay for services furnished within its boundaries and may opt to pay for outofstate services under other circumstances see the payment and financing section of this report for additional information however the medicaid recipient must find an outofstate provider willing to accept medicaid payment from the home state as well as enroll or otherwise enter into an agreement crs3 with the home states medicaid program as condition of receiving that payment and not all providers may be willing to do so regardless of whether they are enrolled in medicaid in their home state displaced individuals might wish to be considered residents of the state to which they have evacuated either to obtain medicaid coverage in the case of those who were not previously eligible or to facilitate access to care in the case of those who were eligible for medicaid in their home state but are having difficulty finding provider that will accept their outofstate coverage if an individual meets the residency requirements described above and is otherwise eligible for medicaid in the state to which they have evacuated coverage cannot be denied however it should be noted that the eligibility and benefit rules of an individuals host state may be different than the rules of his or her home state income and asset documentation in general federal law stipulates few documentation requirements for medicaid applicants state policies on this issue vary based on the eligibility group but considerable amount of documentation may be required to determine whether an individual meets financial eligibility requirements for medicaid1 although states have flexibility to collect income and asset information through selfdeclaration alone they also have the ability to require supporting documentation federal law does require states to have an income and eligibility verification system ievs but states are not required to verify income and assets through the ievs for every medicaid recipient and may conduct these verifications after enrollment under these systems state medicaid agencies use information from number of federal and state sources to verify financial eligibility including state wage information maintained by the state wage income collection agency swica and information on net earnings from self employment wages and retirement benefits maintained by the social security administration ssa lookback period for financial eligibility for evacuees who may have lost their homes and other assets and are now without jobs will requirements related to the period over which income is examined for the purpose of determining medicaid eligibility prevent medicaid funds from being used to meet their needs here again federal laws and regulations stipulate few rules for the lookback period used to determine an individuals financial eligibility for medicaid leaving states with great deal of flexibility2 for many eligibility groups federal regulations require that states use income counting methods that are more restrictive than method used under the most closely related cash welfare program3 such methods 1 for example individuals applying for certain medicaidcovered longterm care services must provide financial records for up to fiveyear lookback period these requirements are outlined in section 1917c1a of the social security act 2 major exception to this rule is for individuals applying for certain medicaidcovered longterm care services in which case up to five years of financial records may be examined 3 traditionally eligibility for medicaid was linked to the receipt of cash welfare payments continued crs4 can be less restrictive at states option for certain other groups such as the medically needy generally people who become eligible for medicaid in part because they spend considerable amounts of their income on medical care the budget period can be longer than six months again states have the flexibility to shorten such budget accounting periods people who do not meet current eligibility requirements as previously noted medicaid eligibility is limited by two primary types of current law restrictions financial and categorical individuals qualify for medicaid by having income and assets that fall below certain thresholds and by falling into particular groups or categories of individuals in general those categories include the elderly people with disabilities dependent children parents of dependent children and pregnant women could exceptions to these categorical restrictions be made for people impacted by the katrina disaster many states have used section 1115 medicaid waivers discussed later in this report to allow categorical eligibility requirements to be waived many states have also exercised options that allow them to liberalize eligibility without the use of waiver such as the option to disregard certain amounts of income or assets for particular groups medicaid benefits background medicaids basic benefit rules require all states to provide certain mandatory services listed in federal statute examples of services that are mandatory for most groups of medicaid recipients include 1 inpatient and outpatient hospital services 2 federally qualified health center fqhc services 3 lab and xray services 4 physician services 5 certain nurse practitioner services 6 pregnancyrelated services including postpartum care 7 early and periodic screening diagnosis and treatment epsdt for children under age 21 8 nursing facility care for persons age 21 and over and 9 home health care for persons entitled to nursing facility care the statute also lists additional services that are considered optional that is available to recipients if states choose to include them in their state medicaid plans some of these optional benefits are specific items such as eyeglasses and prosthetic devices other benefits are defined as classes of medical providers whose array of services are considered to be medicaid covered benefits eg psychologists nursing facility care for persons under age 21 intermediate care facility services for individuals with mental retardation icfsmr still others include wide range of types of medical care and services eg physical therapy prescribed drugs personal care services private duty nursing hospice clinic services and rehabilitation in addition to the above general rules regarding mandatory and optional benefits medicaid statute specifies special benefits or special rules regarding certain benefits 3 continued while this is longer true for all coverage groups many income and asset counting rules are still linked to those used under existing or former cash welfare programs crs5 for targeted groups of individuals for example for children under the age of 21 epsdt guarantees access to all federally coverable services that are necessary to correct or ameliorate identified defects physical and mental illnesses and other conditions states are required to provide otherwise optional services to medicaid child even if that service is not listed in the state medicaid plan thus children in any state can receive eyeglasses through medicaid for example while adults living in the same state may not have any or limited access to this optional benefit medicaid is also an important financing mechanism for longterm care ltc ltc services refer to wide range of supportive and health services generally provided on an ongoing basis for persons who have limitations in functioning because of disability or chronic condition medicaidcovered nursing facility nf and icfmr services are generally categorized as institutional services because individuals reside in and receive health care services in specific type of certified facility other medicaidcovered ltc services eg personal care home health care are categorized as home and communitybased care because individuals generally receive these services in the community eg in their homes or apartments states also have the option of requesting permission from the federal government to provide other home and communitybased services for individuals who would otherwise need the level of care in an institution these other services may be offered as supplement to or instead of those optional services available through the state plan this option is referred to as home and communitybased services hcbs waiver authorized under section 1915c of the social security act unlike services offered as part of the state medicaid plan the hcbs waiver allows states to limit the number of individuals served and to offer the services on lessthanstatewide basis these waivers include broad range of services such as case management services homemakerhome health aide services personal care services adult day health services habilitation services respite care home modifications and homedelivered meals issues raised by hurricane katrina variation in benefit coverage across states because each state designs and administers its own medicaid program under broad federal rules coverage of benefits varies from state to state among the five states initially declared to have public health emergencies due to hurricane katrina alabama florida louisiana mississippi and texas certain optional services4 are covered in all of these states eg hospice care icfmr prescribed drugs prosthetic devices and transportation other optional services are not covered by all of these states 4 information on benefit coverage is taken from us department of health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services medicaid ataglance 2003 publication cms1102403 hereafter cited as cms medicaid ataglance 2003 these data are based on review of approved state medicaid plans and waivers as of september 30 2003 crs6 eg physical therapy emergency hospital services in noncertified hospitals5 care for the elderly in institutions for mental disease imd eyeglasses and basic dental care in addition to choosing the menu of optional services they will provide states define the specific parameters eg amount duration and scope of each mandatory and optional service covered under the state medicaid plan within broad federal guidelines thus even for mandatory benefits there will be variations in the breadth of coverage from state to state there has been discussion about the potentially substantial mental health needs of survivors of hurricane katrina in both home and host states6 wide range of inpatient and outpatient mental health services may be provided through several mandatory and optional benefits under medicaid however even among states that cover specific benefit eg psychologist services services in mental health clinics other mental health rehabilitation and stabilization services there may be interstate variations in the amount duration and scope of such covered benefits in the wake of hurricane katrina questions have been raised about which states benefit package will apply to individuals who have been displaced from their home state for example if 16yearold medicaid recipient from louisiana relocates to texas because of hurricane katrina and needs inpatient psychiatric services will he be able to obtain this care given that the texas medicaid program does not cover this benefit while louisianas medicaid program does7 the answer to this question is currently unclear as discussed in the payment and financing section of this report if medicaid recipient is evacuated to another state the home state is obligated under certain circumstances to pay for covered services ie covered by the home state that are provided outofstate however the medicaid recipient must find provider who is willing to accept the home states medicaid coverage which may be difficult as discussed earlier in the medicaid eligibility and access section of this report there is also residency question for people who have been displaced if medicaid recipient or any other individual has intention of returning to their home state will they now be considered resident of their host state which may offer different benefit package than their home state for medicaid purposes 5 includes care that is necessary to prevent the death or serious impairment of the health of recipient and because of the threat to life or health necessitates the use of the most accessible hospital that is equipped to provide these services even if that hospital does not meet the conditions of participation in medicare or the definition of mandatory inpatient and outpatient services under medicaid 6 for example hhs substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa has awarded 600000 in emergency grants to four states to meet mental health assessment and crisis counseling needs see httpwwwsamhsagovnewsnewsreleases050913_hhshtm 7 cms medicaid ataglance 2003 crs7 access to longterm care services individuals eligible for medicaidcovered ltc services generally have significant physical or mental impairments that often require 24hour supervision and assistance with activities of daily living eg eating and drinking using the toilet getting in and out of bed medicaid covers longterm care services in both institutional eg nursing homes and icfsmr and home and communitybased settings eg home care adult day care transportation personal attendant care for certain individuals because ltc recipients are highly dependent upon paid direct care staff also referred to as paraprofessionals such as certified nursing assistants in nursing homes and home health aides providing range of services to beneficiaries in their homes access to such care will be critical in the locations to which these individuals are evacuated unfortunately many states are experiencing difficulties in attracting and retaining sufficient supply of paraprofessionals to meet the growing demand for longterm care services in all settings even in the absence of disaster such as hurricane katrina furthermore many medicaid beneficiaries with longterm care needs obtain assistance from unpaid caregivers such as spouses relatives or neighbors such assistance often enables these individuals to remain at home or in community setting helping to reduce reliance on medicaidcovered ltc institutions the death or displacement of paid and unpaid caregivers may lead more evacuees to go without needed assistance or to seek services from medicaidcovered institutions in both home and host states further straining stafftoresident ratios in institutions another factor to consider is the impact on access to home and community based services posed by the movement of hcbs waiver recipients across states it remains unclear whether persons enrolled in hcbs waivers in their home states will be able to enroll in similar waiver programs in their host states first enrollment in waiver programs is dependent upon person having access to housing in the community it is unclear whether communitybased housing will be available to evacuees with longterm care needs second many states already have waiting lists for waiver enrollment slots as result host states might request federal approval to lift their enrollment caps to cover evacuees and may need to renegotiate cost neutrality agreements with the secretary8 third each hcbs waiver covers different set of services and is targeted toward distinct population as result persons eligible for waiver services in their home state may find that they are either ineligible for waiver services in their host state or that the services offered do not meet their needs if appropriate communitybased alternatives are available will these evacuees then be placed in host state institutions costsharing finally while costsharing is not widely applied under medicaid state policies may also be an issue for hurricane katrina survivors who remain in their home states as well as those that relocate to other states this issue 8 section 1915c of the social security act constrains states to budget neutrality test in defining which services they cover under the hcbs waiver program specifically the statute requires that the average per capita medicaid expenditures estimated by the state in any fiscal year for waiver enrollees can not exceed the amount medicaid would have paid if the individuals were residing in an institution crs8 is particularly relevant to some of the working people with disabilities who pay substantial premiums for medicaid coverage will home states continue to require costsharing for instate evacuees will host states require outofstate evacuees to comply with participation and pointofservice costsharing requirements applicable to instate medicaid recipients or will the home state costsharing requirements if any apply instead payment and financing background the medicaid program is jointly financed by the federal government and the states states incur medicaid expenditures by reimbursing providers for the covered care and services they provide to medicaid recipients and by administering their medicaid programs eg conducting eligibility determinations processing claims enrolling providers in compliance with federal requirements each quarter states submit accounting statements detailing their medicaid expenditures to the federal government and are reimbursed at the applicable federal rate the federal medical assistance percentage fmap is the rate at which states are reimbursed for most medicaid service expenditures the fmap is based on formula that provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita incomes relative to the national average and vice versa it has statutory minimum of 50 and maximum of 83 the federal reimbursement rate for administrative expenditures does not vary by state and is generally 50 but certain administrative functions receive enhanced usually 75 reimbursement issues raised by hurricane katrina increased costs resulting from increased enrollment states affected by hurricane katrina including both those that have taken in large numbers of individuals displaced by it and those whose own population may be struggling financially in the aftermath are concerned about the possibility of surge in medicaid program enrollment and some advocate that enhanced federal reimbursement should be made available for medicaid costs associated with serving hurricane victims legislative change may be required to provide such enhanced reimbursement because the secretary of hhs does not have the authority to waive provisions of federal medicaid law that govern payments to states via the fmap and other federal medicaid reimbursement rates eg those that apply to administrative functions9 as described above the fmap is used to reimburse states for most of their medicaid service expenditures current statutory exceptions to the fmap include family planning services and supplies reimbursed at 90 services that are received 9 section 1903 of the social security act governs payments to states for medicaid see the discussion of federal waiver authority later in this report for more information on provisions of medicaid law that can and cannot be waived administratively crs9 through an indian health service ihs facility reimbursed at 100 and services provided to targeted lowincome children enrolled in medicaid who qualify through state childrens health insurance program schip provisions reimbursed at an enhanced fmap that varies by state and may range from 65 to 85 subject to the availability of funds from states federal schip allotment in addition to experiencing an increase in expenditures for medical care states may also see an increase in administrative costs associated with performing eligibility determinations for hurricane victims in the past temporary increases in federal reimbursement separate from the permanent enhancements available for specified administrative functions such as the 100 reimbursement provided for operating an immigration status verification system have been authorized by congress to assist states with administrative costs for example 500 million federal fund was made available beginning in 1997 and continuing until exhausted to provide states with enhanced federal reimbursement for administrative expenditures attributable to eligibility determinations that would not have been made were it not for the implementation of the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program10 payments for outofstate care under federal law regulations promulgated by the secretary of hhs dictate the extent to which states must furnish medicaid assistance to state residents who are absent from the state11 under these regulations state must pay for services furnished in another state to the same extent that it would pay for services furnished within its boundaries if the services are furnished to recipient who is resident of the state and any of the following conditions is met medical services are needed because of medical emergency medical services are needed and the recipients health would be endangered if he were required to travel to his state of residence the state determines on the basis of medical advice that the needed medical services or necessary supplementary resources are more readily available in the other state or it is general practice for recipients in particular locality to use medical resources in another state the regulations also require states to establish procedures to facilitate the furnishing of medical services to individuals who are present in one state but eligible for medicaid in another in cases where medicaid recipient seeks outofstate care not related to medical emergency the home state may typically require prior authorization of the care the home state may also require the outofstate provider to enroll or otherwise enter into an agreement with its medicaid program as condition of receiving payment in the case of bordering states where recipients commonly cross state lines to seek care states often have agreements in place to facilitate the provision and payment of medicaid services 10 section 1931h of the social security act 11 section 1902a16 of the social security act and 42 cfr 43152 crs10 for medicaid recipients who were displaced from their home state by hurricane katrina nothing under federal law would prevent the home state from paying for all covered services ie covered under the home states medicaid program that are provided to recipients while they are in another state at minimum the home state must pay if any of the conditions listed above are met however the medicaid recipient must find an outofstate provider willing to accept medicaid payment from the home state and not all providers may be willing to do so12 in addition since an individual may be considered resident of the state to which they have evacuated he or she may be subject to the eligibility rules of that states medicaid program see the medicaid eligibility and access section of this report for more information on residency state and federal responses states operate their medicaid programs in the context of federal rules while some of these rules are flexible enough to allow states to act without federal intervention in the wake of hurricane katrina certain issues raised by the disaster may be addressed only through administrative or legislative action by the federal government for example although states have great deal of flexibility in setting eligibility and benefit rules they are generally required to apply these rules equally to all applicants and recipients to ensure that they meet federal medicaid requirements governing statewideness and comparability of benefits if state wants to modify these rules substantially eg by allowing coverage of childless adults who ordinarily could not qualify for medicaid or apply special rules to select group of individuals eg allowing medicaid coverage for all hurricane victims who meet categorical eligibility requirements by disregarding their income federal permission in the form of waiver granted by the secretary of hhs would generally be required although states are not obligated to participate in the section 1115 waiver arrangement being offered by the federal government in response to hurricane katrina described later in this report several have opted to do so as discussed earlier congressional action may be required if enhanced reimbursement is to be provided to states for medicaid costs incurred as result of hurricane katrina congress may also wish to consider the desirability of uniform treatment of hurricane victims across states 12 for example barbara coulter edwards the ohio medicaid director has reportedly indicated that her agency had received calls from hurricane victims who had found shelter in ohio but were turned away by health care providers unwilling to accept outofstate medicaid cards see httpwwwnytimescom20050907nationalnationalspecial06cndwelfarehtmlei50 70en247ac2ca27b8a7beex1126756800adxnnl1emceta1adxnnlx1126181 605mqkqpzfajorbtyfxjxs0g crs11 recent state actions number of states have expressed desire for explicit federal guidance on medicaid issues raised by hurricane katrina13 although the situation is evolving at the federal level both administratively and legislatively examples of state actions reported thus far include the following14 in the wake of the storm louisiana began providing temporary medicaid cards to medicaid recipients who lost their cards in the hurricane and allowing recipients who have left their homes because of hurricane katrina to access medicaid services without any prior authorization requirements in or out of state from any medical provider that is willing to accept louisiana medicaid as payment an emergency procedure was put in place to expedite provider enrollment for purposes of receiving medicaid payment and the state was making medicaid staff members available at the family assistance centers being set up by the federal emergency management agency fema and at many shelters across the state to help those affected by hurricane katrina fill out forms to get health coverage because of the severe statewide impact of hurricane katrina all of louisiana medicaids staff is being called upon to sign up those who have been devastated by the hurricane and need health coverage and all people who currently have coverage through the states schip or medicaid program will have their renewal dates extended by six months15 louisiana also requested permission from cms to cancel as yet unpaid premiums for individuals enrolled in buyin program for working persons with disabilities through december 2005 in response cms has granted waiver of these premium payments for 120 days16 currently the state has hurricane katrina medicaid program to help people affected by the storm by offering them temporary nocost health coverage although the state indicates that this program is not an expansion of medicaid the following are differences between hurricane katrina medicaid and regular medicaid in louisiana coverage is temporary coverage will not be renewed selfdeclaration of disability is accepted selfdeclaration 13 for example see kaiser commission on

authority to conduct research and demonstration projects under several programs authorized in the social security act specifically section 1115 authorizes the secretary to waive certain statutory requirements for conducting research and demonstration projects that further the goals of titles xix medicaid and xxi schip under section 1115 the secretary may waive any medicaid requirements contained in section 1902 including but not limited to what is known as freedom of choice of provider comparability and statewideness22 states must submit proposals outlining terms and conditions for proposed waivers to cms for approval before implementing these programs whether large or small reforms section 1115 waiver programs have resulted in significant changes for medicaid recipients nationwide and serve as precedent for federal and state officials who wish to make temporary changes to the medicaid program in response to the unique circumstances resulting from the devastation of natural or other disaster in recent years there has been increased interest among states and the federal government in the section 1115 waiver authority as means to restructure medicaid coverage control costs and increase state flexibility under current law states may obtain waivers that allow them to provide services to individuals not traditionally eligible for medicaid cover nonmedicaid services limit benefit packages for certain groups adapt their programs to the special needs of particular geographic areas or groups of recipients or accomplish policy goal such as to temporarily provide medicaid assistance in the aftermath of disaster among other purposes following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks for example new york requested and received approval for section 1115

to choose their medical care providers comparability refers to requirement that services be comparable in amount duration and scope for all persons in each eligibility group statewideness refers to the requirement that states provide services on state wide basis rather than in only portion of the state for schip specific sections or requirements are cited as waivable section 2107e2a of schip statute simply states that section 1115 of the social security act pertaining to research and demonstration waivers applies to title xxi crs14 residents of new york city to receive four months of coverage if they met the eligibility requirements of the medicaid or family health plus program and they applied for drm between september 11 2001 and january 31 2002 for more detail on this temporary waiver program see discussion below while section 1115 is explicit about provisions in medicaid law that may be waived in conducting research and demonstration projects number of other provisions in medicaid law and regulations specify limitations or restrictions on how state may operate waiver program for example one provision restricts states from establishing waivers that fail to provide all mandatory services to the mandatory povertyrelated groups of pregnant women and children another provision specifies restrictions on costsharing imposed under section 1115 waivers other features of the section 1115 waiver authority that may be relevant in using this authority to respond to disasters include federal reimbursement for section 1115 demonstrations approved section 1115 waivers are deemed to be part of states medicaid or schip state plan for purposes of federal reimbursement project costs associated with waiver programs are subject to that states fmap23 changes to these financing arrangements even under section 1115 waiver would require congressional action financing and budget neutrality unlike regular medicaid cms waiver guidance specifies that costs associated with waiver programs must be budget neutral to the federal government over the life of the waiver program to meet the budget neutrality test estimated spending under the waiver cannot exceed the estimated cost of the states existing medicaid program under current law program requirements an exception to this guidance on budget neutrality was made by the secretary for the section 1115 waiver granted to new york after september 11 2001 cms approved an allotment neutrality test described below for new yorks disaster relief medicaid section 1115 waiver program by contrast the secretary eliminated all tests of budget and allotment neutrality in the recent approvals of section 1115 emergency medicaid waivers financing and allotment neutrality under the schip program different budget neutrality standard applies states must meet an allotment neutrality test where combined federal expenditures for the states regular schip program and for the states schip demonstration program are capped at the states individual schip allotment this policy limits federal spending to the capped allotment levels any additional financial resources for schip would require congressional action 23 section 1903 describes the conditions under which federal financial participation is available section 1115a2 stipulates that expenditures under waiver are eligible for matching under section 1903 the same federal reimbursement rules apply to schip waiver projects as with schip state plan expenditures schip section 1115 waiver programs are reimbursed at an enhanced federal matching rate crs15 relationship of medicaidschip demonstration waivers to other statutes section 1115 waiver projects may interact with other program rules outside of the social security act for example employersponsored health insurance as described by the employee retirement income security act erisa or alien eligibility as contained in immigration law in cases like these the secretary does not have the authority to waive provisions in these other statutes24 program guidance the secretary can develop policies that influence the content of demonstration projects and prescribe approval criteria in three ways 1 by promulgating program rules and regulations25 2 through the publication of program guidance eg the waiver program must meet budget neutrality test26 and 3 waiver policy may also be implicitly shaped by the programs that have been approved eg cms approval of new yorks disaster relief medicaid legislative action may be required if congress chooses to further shape the secretarys authority over the content of the demonstration programs dictate specific section 1115 waiver approval criteria or otherwise limit the secretarys waiver authority precedent for emergencyrelated section 1115 waivers new yorks disaster relief medicaid program federal and state officials have looked to new yorks section 1115 disaster relief medicaid program as precedent for the secretary of hhs to use the authority under section 1115 of the social security act to respond to emergency situations details on eligibility criteria benefit packages provider agreements financing arrangements and other issues outlined in the terms and conditions of new yorks temporary waiver program provide an example of how this state used the flexibility under section 1115 to address specific health care needs in the wake of an emergency situation following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 new york requested and received approval for section 1115 waiver known as disaster relief medicaid the drm program allowed most medicaid applicants who were residents of new york city to receive four months of coverage if they met the eligibility requirements of the medicaid or family health plus fhp program and they applied for drm 24 for example states may not provide benefits to qualified aliens as part of section 1115 eligibility expansion without adhering to the fiveyear ban on alien access to federal assistance as required by the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 104193 25 program rules and regulations that meet specified rulemaking criteria are legally binding to date cms has not shaped section 1115 waiverrelated policy through program rules and regulations 26 unlike program rules and regulations program guidance is not legally binding rather program guidance provides framework for the process by which states may obtain approvals and the principles under which states may operate their programs program guidance contains authoritative interpretation and clarification of statutory and regulatory requirements to date the secretary only used guidance through public notices in the federal register as well as technical guidance distributed to state health officials and hhs regional officers or posted on the cms website to shape section 1115 waiver policy crs16 between september 11 2001 and january 31 2002 the fhp program is separate section 1115 waiver that had been approved by cms and was scheduled to be implemented in october 2001 fhp significantly expanded medicaid eligibility to certain groups for example the income standard for childless adults went from about 50 to 100 of the federal poverty level27 medicaid applicants who did not receive coverage under the drm program included those who were pregnant had disability or required institutional services eg nursing facility these individuals were processed through the traditional medicaid application process28 this separate process for certain groups is not described in february 2003 lawsuit which states that the drm program was the only medicaid program available to new york city medicaid applicants between september 2001 and january 200229 the drm program also extended eligibility for current medicaid beneficiaries residing in new york city and westchester county who were scheduled to have their medicaid eligibility annual recertification these individuals were permitted to receive coverage for one year without the annual recertification normally required by medicaid law30 the waiver also included temporary eligibility for children under schip if they had applied or were enrolled with health plans that had operations in new york city that were disrupted by the world trade center attacks new schip applicants received four months of schip eligibility and individuals who were already in period of presumptive eligibility that was scheduled to end september 30 2001 received an additional two months of eligibility similar to the medicaid provisions above schip enrollees in new york city who were scheduled to have an annual re certification were allowed to continue with schip coverage for one year the secretary of hhs announced tentative approval of the drm program in september 19 2001 press release approval of the temporary modifications to new yorks schip program were provided via email and through discussions with senior staff at cms on september 16 2002 cms articulated the agreement with new york in an award letter and terms and conditions cms awarded final approval for the drm section 1115

requirements did apply31 the september 11 attacks significantly hampered the state medicaid agencys ability to process medicaid eligibility records in new york city the presumptive eligibility process established by the drm program was intended to facilitate enrollment of new applicants into medicaid applicants for the drm program were required to fill out onepage application for the program prove who they were and attest to their income and resources individuals did not have to be direct victims of the world trade center attacks to receive services individuals who qualified for the drm program received temporary medicaid authorization form that allowed them to access medicaid services services provided under the drm program included all feeforservice benefits provided to non institutionalized medicaid beneficiaries in addition to the four months of additional coverage it also allowed individuals several additional months of eligibility to provide sufficient time for an individual to complete standard medicaid application form32 the waiver ended in january 2003 if person was denied medicaid coverage at the end of the drm period under the new york waiver drm recipients were not entitled to continuation of drm benefits while their request for fair hearing was pending suit was brought by drm recipients alleging that the lack of continuing medicaid benefits constituted violation of the due process clause of the united states constitution the us district court for the eastern district of new york issued preliminary injunction affirmed by the us court of appeals for the 2nd circuit ordering the new york state medicaid agency to continue drm benefits to all recipients who received notice of decision terminating their benefits until fair hearing decision was reached while the court did not decide this case on its merits it is an indication that while the secretary has the authority to waive provisions in section 1902 for section 1115 waiver project the secretarys authority may be limited by constitutional considerations an estimated 342000 beneficiaries enrolled in the drm program and funding for the drm waiver was estimated at 670 million over the waiver period33 generally new york receives federal reimbursement for 50 of its medicaid service expenditures new york requested that fema cover the nonfederal share of medicaid

second mechanism currently available to allow the secretary of hhs to make immediate program changes in response to an emergency situation however the authority is limited to geographic areas directly impacted by the emergency created under the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act pl 107188 section 1135 of the social security act authorizes the secretary to temporarily waive federal conditions of participation and other certification requirements for any entity that furnishes health care items or services to medicare medicaid or schip recipients in an emergency area defined as geographical area in which there exists an emergency or major disaster declared by the president and public health emergency declared by the secretary of hhs during such an emergency it authorizes the secretary to waive participation state licensing as long as equivalent licensure from another state is held and there is exclusion from practicing in that state or any state in the emergency area and preapproval requirements for physicians and other practitioners sanctions for failing to meet requirements for emergency transfers between hospitals sanctions for physician selfreferral and limitations on payments for health care and services furnished to individuals enrolled in medicare advantage ma plans when services are provided outside the plan in addition section 1135 requires the secretary to provide congress with certification and written notice at least two days prior to exercising this waiver authority it provides for the waiver authority to continue for 60 days and permits the secretary to extend the waiver period finally the law requires the secretary within one year after the end of the emergency to provide congress with an evaluation of this approach and recommendations for improvements under this waiver authority current waiver activity related to hurricane katrina the secretary of hhs has exercised both the section 1115 waiver authority and the section 1135 waiver authority to make needed changes to health care programs so they are better able to accommodate the emergency health care needs of hurricane katrina survivors below is brief description of the information that is currently available regarding each of these waiver actions section 1115 waivers on september 9 2005 cms announced emergency policies that it had adopted to address the health care needs of hurricane katrina survivors35 specifically cms noted that president bush had announced that special evacuee status would be granted to individuals impacted by hurricane katrina and that evacuees would be allowed to apply for several federal programs 35 centers for medicare and medicaid services cms takes emergency steps to ease health care access to katrina evacuees sept 9 2005 available at httpwwwcmshhsgovmediapressreleaseaspcounter1551 crs19 including medicaid and schip without having to verify their income or employment status cms also noted that an application template was being developed to assist states in obtaining emergency medicaid and schip section 1115 waivers to provide temporary eligibility for evacuees on september 15 2005 texas became the first of 17 states to obtain approval for section 1115 waiver based on the emergency application template developed by cms these waivers are referred to as being part of multistate demonstration project to date similar waivers have also been approved for alabama arkansas california the district of columbia florida georgia idaho indiana louisiana maryland mississippi nevada ohio puerto rico south carolina and tennessee36 all of the waivers granted thus far create temporary eligibility period not to exceed five months37 during which certain hurricane katrina evacuees will be granted access to medicaid and schip state plan38 services in the host state ie the state that has been granted an emergency section 1115 waiver based on simplified eligibility criteria for various groups children and their parents pregnant women individuals with disabilities etc under the alabama district of columbia idaho louisiana nevada puerto rico and texas waivers evacuees are exempt from medicaid and schip costsharing requirements medicaid and schip cost sharing requirements will be imposed under the remaining waiver programs in each of arkansas california florida indiana georgia maryland ohio south carolina tennessee and mississippi39 in addition to creating temporary eligibility for evacuees under the host states medicaid or schip state plan waivers for eight out of the 17 states alabama arkansas georgia louisiana mississippi south carolina tennessee and texas also create an uncompensated care pool in seven of the eight states whose waivers create an uncompensated care pool alabama georgia louisiana mississippi south carolina tennessee and texas the pool may be used through january 31 2006 to augment medicaid and schip state plan services for evacuees eg provide 36 centers for medicare and medicaid services approved katrina 1115 waiver documents available at httpnewcmshhsgovemergency02_hurricanesasp 37 the duration of ohios hurricane katrina relief waiver program is unique in that the program will operate for the fourmonth period between september 1 2005 and december 31 2005 all of the other emergency waiver programs will operate for the fivemonth period between september 1 2005 and january 31 2006 38 in order for state to receive federal medicaid or schip reimbursement it must have in effect medicaid or schip state plan approved by the secretary of hhs that meets requirements set forth in federal statute and regulations if state wants to change how its program operates eg by adjusting eligibility levels or benefit coverage or if congress modifies requirement eg adds new mandatory eligibility group the state must submit for approval state plan amendment describing the change as described earlier section 1115 waivers which allow states to operate their medicaid and schip programs outside of normal federal rules are deemed to be part of the medicaid or schip state plan for purposes of federal reimbursement 39 providers will be responsible for collecting beneficiary cost sharing under the florida georgia indiana maryland south carolina and tennessee emergency waiver programs crs20 services not covered under the state plan and pay for hcbs waiver services not otherwise covered in the host state40 in all eight of the states whose waivers create an uncompensated care pool funds from the pool may be used to reimburse providers that incur uncompensated care costs for uninsured evacuees who do not qualify for medicaid or schip in the host state states with an uncompensated care pool must consider alternative methods for providing coverage to uninsured evacuees including through premium assistance for private insurance and other insurance pools and report to cms on the feasibility of adopting such alternative methods in general the section 1115 waivers define an evacuee as an individual who 1 is resident of an emergency area defined as geographic area or region in which the president has declared disaster following hurricane katrina specifically targeting counties and parishes designated by fema as requiring individual assistance 2 has been displaced from his or her home by the emergency 3 is not considered nonqualified alien 4 meets the definition of the new temporary eligibility population the new temporary eligibility population includes children under age 19 with income up to and including 200 fpl pregnant women from louisiana and mississippi with income up to and including 185 fpl pregnant women from alabama with income up to and including 133 fpl individuals with disabilities with income up to and including 300 of the supplemental security income ssi benefit rate lowincome medicare recipients with income up to and including 100 fpl lowincome individuals in need of longterm care with income up to and including 300 ssi and lowincome parents of children under age 19 with family income up to and including 100 fpl for the purposes of determining waiver program eligibility evacuees may self attest to displacement income and immigration status but individuals must cooperate in demonstrating evacuee and eligibility status the waiver documents note that the standard medicaid and schip funding process will be used during the waiver period however states will not be required to meet medicaid budget or schip allotment neutrality tests under the waivers hhs justified dropping the neutrality requirements because cms officials argue individuals participating in the waiver are presumed to be eligible for medicaid or schip in their respective home states and therefore costs to the federal government would have otherwise been incurred and allowable it is unclear how this argument applies in the case of states whose waivers establish an uncompensated care pool that 40 costs of services provided to evacuees will not be counted against any other section 1115 and 1915b or c waivers the state may have including hcbs waiver slots crs21 may be used to pay for costs associated with uninsured evacuees who otherwise do not qualify for medicaid or schip41 for section 1115 demonstration waivers budget neutrality has meant that demonstration projects do not increase federal spending over what would have been spent under current law program requirements42 for most section 1115 waivers the federal and state governments negotiate budget neutrality spending cap beyond which the federal government has fiscal responsibility because the budget neutrality requirement is construct of waiver guidance that has been added administratively and is not statutory requirement the secretary may decide that it will not apply to particular waiver financing under the emergency medicaid waivers on september 16 2005 the director of cms and medicaid state officials in each of louisiana mississippi and alabama signed memorandum of understanding mou whereby home states agreed to pay the nonfederal share of costs for medically necessary treatment provided to evacuees while they are residing in host state43 subsequently at least two states with hurricane katrina section 1115 waivers have indicated that they expect to receive 100 federal funding for services provided through the waivers44 while the waiver documents from cms do not indicate how this would be accomplished during an october 25 2005 the senate committee on finance 41 there is precedent among existing statewide demonstration waivers to expand health insurance to new groups of uninsured individuals within the confines of the budget neutrality requirement for example in past waiver approvals cms allowed states to achieve savings to meet their budget neutrality test by redirecting medicaid disproportionate share hospital dsh payments which are used to compensate hospitals for the cost of treating uninsured individuals to cover the costs of expansion eligibles under the waiver demonstration project massachusetts masshealth demonstration is an example of state that generated cost savings in this way 42 current law program requirements may include hypothetical program expansions allowable under current law eg groups of eligibles services or payments which could have been but were not previously covered or provided as well as program terminations eg the elimination of states medically needy program 43 state of louisiana department of health and hospitals lettermemorandum

emergency medicaid waiver services would be the responsibility of the home state in addition the budget reconciliation conference report ie s 1932 hrept 109362 contains funds for hurricane katrina medicaid and schip relief if enacted the conference agreement would appropriate 2 billion in addition to any funds made available for the national disaster medical system under the department of

section 1115 project for certain costs associated with their disaster relief medicaid and schip waiver programs for more details on this and other legislative action on this issue see the section titled current federal legislation that appears later in this report as discussed earlier the secretary of hhs does not have the authority to waive provisions of federal medicaid law governing the fmap and other federal medicaid reimbursement rates eg those that apply to administrative functions under section 1903 of the social security act and each state is responsible for paying the non federal share of any medicaid costs it incurs46 if ndms funds and if enacted funds made available through the budget reconciliation conference agreement are insufficient to cover the costs associated with state claims submitted under the uncompensated care pools it is unclear whether additional steps may be taken by the secretary to allow the home states to finance their state shares of expenditures for evacuees in other ways 45 the national disaster medical system ndms was established in hhs in 1984 to provide medical and ancillary services when disaster overwhelms local emergency

to medicaid beneficiaries and then seek federal reimbursement must pay providers in this situation applicability of the secretarys waiver authority to other disaster situations in general the disaster relief areas and time periods defined in the secretarys september 2005 waiver actions are aimed at providing targeted relief to individuals and states affected by hurricane katrina as result the relief may not apply to individuals and states affected by other emergency situations eg hurricane rita however in response to crisis situation the secretary may relax provider rules under the section

limited to medicaidrelated provisions52 in general the disaster relief areas and time periods specified in the bills are aimed at providing targeted relief to 1 individuals and states or areas within states directly affected by hurricane katrina and 2 states that have taken in individuals displaced by the storm as result the relief may not apply to individuals and states affected by other

bipartisan bills crs26 house proposals hr 3671 green status referred to house committee on energy and commerce this proposal would authorize the secretary of hhs to provide 100 of the federal medical assistance percentage fmap for displaced medicaid recipients receiving medical assistance outside their state of residence due to declared public health emergency hr 3698 dingell status referred to house committees on energy and commerce ways and means this proposal would allow states to receive 100 federal funding for the medicaid expenditures for individuals who are katrina survivors as described by the proposal and for any individual who is in directly impacted state ie alabama louisiana and mississippi states may also receive 100 federal funding for administrative costs related to covering katrina survivors states that choose to cover katrina survivors would not be allowed to establish income or asset tests or state residency or other categorical requirements states must also use simplified application process that would allow individuals to attest that they qualify as katrina survivor individuals would be penalized for knowingly falsely attesting to their status as survivor this provision would remain in effect during the disaster relief period from august 29 2005 through september 30 2006 in addition the proposal would hold all states harmless for any scheduled reduction in states fmap rate for fy2006 if states fmap rate for fy2006 is less than it was for fy2005 the fy2005 fmap rate shall apply the proposal would also affect the scheduled changes to medicaid related to the medicare prescription drug benefit effective january 1 2006 first the proposal would suspend until january 2007 the requirement for certain states to pay the federal government portion of what the medicaid program would have spent on prescription drugs for those dually eligible for medicaid and medicare this provision would only apply to states directly impacted by hurricane katrina and those states that have received significant influx of katrina survivors the provision would also change federal law to allow state medicaid programs to pay for prescription drugs for part d eligible individual who is also katrina survivor these changes related to the medicare prescription drug benefit can be ended if the secretary determines after consulting with the state that individuals can be effectively transferred to medicare for their prescription drug coverage without discontinuing an individuals drug coverage hr 3708 johnson status referred to house committees on energy and commerce transportation and infrastructure this proposal would require hhs to dedicate 10 of any hurricane katrina disaster relief funds for mental health services to victims and first responders these crs27 funds would also be available to cover the state share of medicaid or schip costs for victims of or first responders to hurricane katrina hr 3735 davis status referred to house

defined by the bill regardless of their place of residence hr 3952 gingrey status referred to house committees on energy and commerce ways and means budget government reform and transportation and infrastructure this proposal is similar to s 1716 in that it would establish disaster relief medicaid drm coverage provide additional federal medicaid funding for covering services for katrina survivors and residents of major disaster parishes and counties require the secretary to submit plan for transitioning drug coverage for medicaremedicaid dual eligibles in affected areas from medicaid to medicare part d and expand the section 1135 waiver authority however the proposal differs from s 1716 in several areas specifically the proposal would require katrina survivors to be eligible for medicaid based on the criteria used in their state of residence during the week of august 28 2005 s 1716 establishes an income standard of the either 100 of fpl 200 of fpl for certain groups or the
