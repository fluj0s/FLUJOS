auctions buyer purchases multiple objects from private parties at price set by the last accepted bid the government has used reverse auctions since the revolutionary war designing efficient reverse dutch auctions may present some tradeoffs between enhancing competition among bidders and overpaying for assets relative to their quality careful auction design however can help minimize these problems auctions are especially useful for selling assets whose value to potential owners is unknown to the seller reverse aucti ons are useful when buyer does not know what value sellers place on assets auction results could clarify the market value of troubled assets the price discovery proper ties of auctions coul d stimulate trading by reducing private traders uncertainty about the value of troubled assets reverse auction progra m essentially swaps treas ury securities for troubled mortgagebacked securities if treasury securities are exchanged for troubled assets at prices close to those assets current market prices costs to the taxpayer would be minimized financial institutions however may gain some liquidity but might not receive much additional capital some ec onomists have argued that other means of injecting capital into the financial sector such as purchases of preferred stock or capital injections balanced by equity warrants ie options to claim an equity stake might be better strategy since passa ge of eesa the us treasury has been working to design methods to inject capita l into firms and restore market liquidity the heterogeneity of troubled assets ma present challenges to the treasury auction program the reverse dutch auctions would need to be adapted to buy highly diverse and relatively smallvolume secur ities in way that minimizes risks of trading manipulation reverse dutch au ctions may be vulne rable to adverse selection meaning that the average credit quality of submitted assets of given type may be systematically worse than the average credit quality of all assets of that type auction mechanisms might be designed that could mitigate these problems recent academic research in auction theo ry and in experimental economics has examined

common use large research literature in economic theory and expe rimental economics examines how different types of auctions work on the one hand welldesigned auctions can provide an expeditious and efficient method for selling or acquiring objects on the other hand poorly designed auctions ve caused governments to forego large amounts of revenue moreover poorly desi gned auctions may increase the likelihood that valuable resources are allocated to buyers who value those resources less than others source of inefficiency3 in particular auc tions suitable for some applications may be unsuite d for other applications the american government has used reve rse auctions since robert morris who headed the treasury department used them to procure supplies for troops in the revolutionary war4 in recent decades the treasury department has used auctions to sell federal securities5 over time the federal government has gained valuable experience in conducting and designing au ctions which has reduced costs and increased revenues compared to other methods httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34707crs3 6 discussion with governme nt official sept 26 2008current us treasury auctions which use multiunit dutch auction mechanism to sell securities have apparently provided starting point for administration proposals to buy troubled assets via reverse dutch auctions because the reverse dutch auction proce ss would in approximate mirror fashion resemble treasury auctions of government securities to primary dealers key market participants could quickly familiarize themselves with new bidding procedures those administering treasury reverse auc tions however recognize that differences between treasury securities and troubled assets have consequences for auction design6 designing reverse dutch auctions may present some tradeoffs between enhancing competition among bidders and overpaying for assets relative to their quality careful auction design however can help minimize these problemsfigure 1 hypothetical reverse dutch auction suppose government agency wished to purchase 1000 desktop computers of given specification potential sellers would submit seal ed bids with price and number of units the agency would then sort bids by price in ascending order the agency would accept bids starting with the lower price and tinuing until units offered in bids reached 1000

the agency would also accept crash computers bid for 500 units because its bid price was the second lowest finally the agency would buy 100 computers from macrohard inc to reach the total of 1000 computers because macrohard was the last successful bidder all computers would be bought at unit price of 510 hal systems would sell computers to the agency some may wonder why the government ag ency would not force firms to sell computers at their bid prices which might seem to save the agency money such strategy would probably be unsuccessful in saving m oney because firms would change their bidding strategies if they knew that they would have to sell at their bid prices in particular sellers would tend to shade their bids upwards which might raise costs to the agency specific rules and operation details for reverse dutch auctions used by governments and private firms have varied some central banks use multipleprice or payyourbid auctions to sell securities others use unifo rmprice

treasury reverse du tch auctions remain unspecified the us treasury would probabl announce that it wished to buy given amount of mortgagerelated securities mbss of specific types or issues for given auction bidders would then list securities they wish to sell and specify prices the treasury would then buy the securities listed at th lowest prices until the specified amount was reached the price offered by the last successful bidder would then be paid to all successful bidders quality differences of troubled assets presents challenges for auctions the diversity or heterogeneity of troubled assets may present challenges to the treasury auction program the mortgagebacked securitization process was intended to create marketable assets with credit characteristics that could be readily assessed by credit agencies and buyers credit ratin g agencies claimed that the rating process sorted assetbacked securities and other assets into categories with essentially homogenous profiles all assets of sp ecific type receiving given rating were supposed to embody essentially similar risk characteristics confidence in the credit rating process has deteriorated over the past two years however credit rating agencies accord ing to the securities and exchange commission sec struggled to keep up with more complex types of securities and had difficulty assessing risks embedded in subprime mortgagebacked assets in addition according to the sec none of the ra ting agencies examined had specific written procedures for rating residential mbss and collateralized debt obligations8 thus some buyers may doubt that credit ra tings represent true gauge of asset quality tightened market liquidity in capital markets since august 2007 may stem in part from potential buyers uncertainty about the credit quality of mbss and other assets buyers may worry that sellers could have incentives to sell assets with difficulttodetect risks before ssets without such hidden hazards similar problems may occur with reverse dutch auctions used to buy troubled assets typical treasury auction sells large volume of identical government securities whose characteris tics are well understood th reverse dutch auctions used by the treasury would need to be ad apted to buy highly diverse and relatively smallvolume securities w hose characteristics may not be well understood by manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34707crs5 9 most treasury issues are generally sized in th tens of billions of dollars range although cash management and other concerns may lead to smaller issues us department of treasury treasury bulletin various issues structured product issues ie asset or mortgagebacked securities or collateralized default obligations cdos are generally sized in the hundreds of m illions of dollars range and are often divided into half dozen or so tranches tranche comes from the french verb tranchez meaning to slice or to carve 10 the bond market association and american securitization forum note that each product sector is distinct based on issuers in vestors origination servicing and collateral management trading and pricing systems and type and volume of available

security issue while enormous relative to single housing mortgage is small when compared to the size of typical treasury security issue and individual tranches slices of mbss are smaller still9 different mbss and related structured finance assets are very dive rse although their structures and pricing follow some general principles10 thus selling treasury securities is like selling commodity steel buying mortgagebacked securities is like buying used cars if the treasury were to run large numbe r of narrowly defined reverse auctions it would be more difficult to prevent certain types of market manipulation11 for example bidder who gains control of large proportion of an issue might exert influence on auction outcomes but if wider variety of securities or assets were allowed in the same aucti on which would sharpen comp etition sellers may have an incentive to submit bids for those assets with hidden flaws reverse dutch auctions may therefore be vulnerable to adverse selection meaning that the average credit quality of submitted assets of given type may be systematically worse than the average credit quality of all assets of that type in addition if assets sub mitted to an auction were on average worse than other assets of given type then auction prices mig ht be biased downwards some empirical research has found that adverse selec tion problems can lower prices on ebay auctions12 if reverse auctions for troubled assets generated downwardly biased prices that could affect va luations of assets held by other firms through markto market accounting requirements thus downward bias in auction prices due to adverse selection could affect the market value or even solvency of some firms whether or not they participated in auctions moreover managing portfolio bought

average quality of all assets of given category to the extent that treasury overpays for assets relative to their quality due to adverse selection costs to the taxpayer rise whether this effect presents significant financial risk to the taxpayer is difficult to determine before the revers dutch auctions have been running for some time auction mechanisms however might be designed that could mitigate these adverse selection problems13 analysts close to government auction design discussions have outlined design in which several similar securities could be listed for an auction14 price offsets or handicaps could be applied relative to benchmark security for instance an auction might encompass specified set of mbss underwritten by the same investment bank in the sa month bids offering specific mbs issue with higher averag default rate on the underlying mortgages would be reduced by an offset calculated using financial asset pricing model other auction mechanisms might also mitigate these problems for example firm could be required to let the government select an asset randomly from all of its holdings of specific type of asset if its bid were successful or participating firms could be required to post performance bond th at could be used to compensate the government if firms assets sold in auctions turned out to be systematically worse than average15 charles plott pioneer in aucti on design has designed and tested reverse dutch auction that was able to mitigate adverse selection concerns in another context16 adverse selection and firms asset holdings uncertainty about the composition of firms holdings could be an additional source of adverse selection in the administration of the troubl ed asset relief program some claim that financial institutions have avoided offering to sell large amounts of subprime and other troubled assets out of concern for th institutions reputation other market participants might infer that wouldbe seller has large inve ntory of subprime and other troubled assets and thus may be risky counterparty17 that inference could adversely affect potential sellers stock price and its ability to raise capital

troubled asset relief progra m tarp including bidding in treasury reverse auctions with financial weakness then firms might be less willing to participate reputational issues in the view of many financial experts have discouraged some firms from participating in certain federal government or federal reserve programs for example in recent years some have viewed firms using the federal reserves di scount window as desperate19 the federal reserve term auction facility taf in the view of some was designed to provide liquidity to firms while avoiding the stigma that some might perceive to be associated with the discount window20 us treasury however has stre ssed that tarp is not targeted at failing firms but instead is designed to attract broad participation among financial institutions21 the effectiveness of the reverse au ction asset purchas program could be reduced if reputational issues caused some firms to forego participation in tarp factors that reduce the number of active bi dders in an auction can decrease expected revenues and can dampen competition among bidders the choice of how auction results are released and how much detail is disclosed may affect firms willingness to submit bids for example if firms believe that market analysts can observe or infer from announced auction results that th firm holds large inventories of troubled assets then that firm may become reluctan t to participate in the auction designing treasury reverse auctions for troubled asse ts and associated announcements of results to avoid any such possible reputational effects may enhance firms willingness to participate sequencing issues the order or sequencing in which reve rse securities auctions take place may affect the results of auctions first the initial reverse auctions might

design and testing of auction mechanisms however can minimize such problems second if the treasury interventions in financial markets do start to unfreeze credit markets as intended then asset prices will change bidders anticipation that asset prices will rise after the initial auctions or because of other types of government interv ention could induce bidders to submit fewer assets in earlier auctions third sequencing may raise operational issues because of the large num ber of asset types and because of the intrinsic complexity of some mortgagerelated securities will auctions unlock credit markets the september 20 2008 treas ury proposal suggested that reverse auctions would play central role in restoring liquidity to credit markets it argued that auctions could help stabilize asset and credit markets in two ways first firms with illiquid assets would sell them at prices determined by competitive process which would supply firms with liquid proceeds of t hose sales second auction results could provide pricing benchmarks that might stimulate trading in other assets some believe that this could improve liquidity conditions in credit markets others however are skeptical22 the reverse auction progra m essentially swaps treas ury securities for troubled mortgagebacked securities if the prices at which treasury securities are exchanged for troubled assets are close to current market prices for those assets then financial institutions may gain liquidity but might not receive much additional capital what prices the troubled mortgagerelate d assets will sell at is therefore key question merrill lynch fo r example sold large stake of senior mortgage related collateralized default obligations cdos to l one star funds private capital fund for about 22 cents on the

rises measured as the cost of overnight interbank borrowing relative to comparable treasury rates highly leveraged financial institutions may come under additional pressure to sell assets thus leveraging nd falling asset prices may create selfreinforcing spiral to the extent that buying assets via reverse auction process might strengthen the link between assets and their underlying values more normal market conditions might be restored but others argue that the low prices of troubled assets reflect their intrinsic valu and that previous prices were above those jus tified by fundamentals26 federal reserve chairman ben bernanke spoke of hold to maturity valuations of assets which would seem to imply that prices above current market levels might be paid27 while paying abovemarket prices for assets would inject capital into financial institutions it would also increase the costs and risks to taxpayers how auctions could be designed to ensure hold to maturity valuations of assets is unclear one economist with knowledge of au ction design discussions has said that reverse auctions would be designed in hardnosed manner to minimize taxpayer costs but if current asset prices accura tely reflect fundament value and if the treasury reverse auctions are run efficiently comparatively little capital would be injected into the financial sector while this would minimize costs and risks to taxpayers such an auction program might provide limited s upport for financial institutions some economists have argued that other means of injecting capital into the financial sector such as purchases of pr eferred stock or capita l injections balanced by equity warrants ie options to claim an equity stake might be better strategy28 on october 8 2008 the us treasury empha sized that eesa gives it authority to directly inject capital into firms nd is developing strategies to do so29 asset purchases and direct capital injecti ons may have differe nt implications for affected firms proceeds of asset purchases would presumably be counted as trading profits which firms can use without rest riction capital injections howeverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34707crs10 generally provide firms with fi nancial resources that are s ubject to restrictions for example capital injections might provide the us treasury with the right to demand management changes or equity warrants treasury purchases of preferred equity shares would probably commit firms to make regular specified payments back to the treasury proceeds from asset purchases however might be available for dividends executive compensation reducing debt or other purposes costs and risks to taxpayers federal interventions to restore more normal conditions to financial markets would provide substantial bene fits to those connected to the financial sector either directly or indirectly of course some ma receive greater benefits than others from resuscitation of the financ ial sector largescale federal intervention could impose substantial costs and risks on taxp ayers and federal pr ogram beneficiaries although the scale and nature of t hose costs and risks may depend on how interventions are structured and administered if treasury reverse auctions were c onducted in hardnosed and efficient manner direct costs to taxpayers and beneficiaries could be minimized furthermore the federal government might well eventually sell assets for more than their purchase price such auctions how ever might supply little extra capital to the financial sector and thus may fail to achieve normalization of market conditions other measures such as debtequity swaps purchases of preferred stock or trading stock warrants for capital injections might present the taxpayer with greater financial risks but might also be better suited to addressing current financial conditions auction design auctions in recent years have been used to address wide range of policy issues auctions may capture higher revenues for governments and can allocate scarce resources more efficiently than traditi onal methods different policy issues however may require different types of auctions to ach ieve reasonable results to provide basis for evaluating the reverse auction mechanisms that may be used in tarp this section discusses potential problems that may arise in using auctions and how those problems can be minimized by careful design of auction mechanisms singleunit auctions the most common auction mechanisms used to sell single items are the first price sealedbid auction the english or ascendingprice openbid auction and the dutch or descendingprice auction in th firstprice sealedbid auction bidders submit bids to the seller who then selects the highest bid when selling an item or the lowest bid when buying an item in th english or ascendingprice auction bidders announce prices that must ex ceed previous prices by set amount the last bidder to remain receives the object at her last announced price in flower markets in amsterdam and other trading centers in th netherlands bidders watch price clock that starts at high price and descends at constant rate the first bidder to press ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34707crs11 30 for details see httpwwwfloranlenaboutflorahollandauctioningpages defaultaspx 31 fallingprice auctions were invented to avoid napoleonicera taxes on risingprice auctions 32 rational here only means that bidder has in ternally consistent preferences and is self interested so that the bidder can com pute bids that best achieve her ends 33 bidders here are assumed to keep the object and cannot resell it in technical terms values are private and independent when va lues are linked or common results can differ 34 when the value of objects are linked such as when an auctioned object will be resold some of these equivalences may not hold for example in an english auction among wholesalers bidders may learn about an objects resale value in retail markets through the bids of others in that case the equivalence of an english auction to secondprice sealed bid auction would not hold 35 for example in ebay auctions informed bi dders often use sniping strategies in which bids are submitted seconds before the auction closes this prevents less informed bidders from gleaning information from the bidding behavior of an informed bidder for details see continuedbutton buys the lot of flowers at the price indicated on the price clock30 similar descendingprice mechanisms are called dutch auctions31 why are treasury auctions called dutch auctions t r s u r auctions for government securities which use sealedbid rules are often described as dutch auctions even though they do not use descendi ngprice mechanism as in flower auctions treasury securities auctions however are strategically equivalent to particular descendingprice dut ch auction an auction mechanism is strategically equivalent to another auction mechanism when bidders incentives the identity of the winner and the final sale price are the same for both some auction rules however may be opera tionally easier to carry out for example bidders can mail in responses for sealedbid auction while english auctions require bidders or their agents to gather in the same place descendingprice dutch auction unde r certain conditions is strategically equivalent to sealedbid firstprice auction rationa l bidder calculates what the item for sale is worth to her32 if bidder bid her value however she would make zero gain in firstprice auction because the price paid would exactly match the items value to her ra tional bidder therefore shades her bid downwards trading off larger gain value minus price paid if she wins the auction against the possibility that she would lose the item by lowering her bid33 the same calculation applies to both the sealedbi d firstprice auction and to the descendingprice auction so the two auctions may be considered strategically equivalent an english ascendingbid is strategica lly equivalent to secondpr ice sealedbid auction when bidders know what the object up fo r auction is worth to them34 imperfect information common values and the winners curse when bidders have imperfect information bout the value of an item an english or ascendingbid auction may force betteri nformed bidders to reveal valuable information to less well informed bidders35 for example the value of an antiquehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34707crs12 35 continued httpwwwesnipecom 36 john h kagel and dan levin common

work cambridge 2004 ch 3may depend on who made it how rare it is and on who owned it before knowledgeable bidder who may know more about an items valu will attempt to use bidding strategies that conceal private information the value to bidders of some auctioned items may be linked for example the value one energy company places on an ffshore continental shelf ocs lease that would allow exploration and extraction of oil and gas will correlate to the value other energy companies place on the same lease different companies might have strengths and weaknesses in explorati on and extraction techniques so the value of the lease will not be the same to each company any company that got the lease however would sell oil and gas on the same world markets auctions that sell items whose value to bidders is correlated are called commonvalue auctions bidders in commonvalue auction may ve different indica tions of an items value for example many energy compan ies may have private information about the geological structures of areas covered by an ocs lease company holding an ocs lease in nearby area that had run seismic tests might have more precise information about those geological struct ures and thus would have more precise estimate of the value of the ocs lease up for auction when bidders have imperfect signals of value bidders with overly optimistic signals are likely to win auctions such bidders however will suffer losses because the true value of the item is less than their optimistic estimate this is the winners curse such auction winners would have b een better off losing sophisticated bidders in commonvalue auctions shade their bids downward to account for the winners curse sophisticated aucti on designers release as much information as possible about an items value so that revenues are not reduced by bidders who shade their bids downwards36 that is bidders with better in formation bid more aggressively revenue equivalence certain auction mechan isms as noted above are functionally equivalent to cer tain other auctions run us ing different rules the auctions discussed above dut ch english firstprice and secondprice sealed bid in theory deliver the same profits to bidders and the same revenues to sellers moreover any independent private value au ction that awards the item to the highest bidders and attracts the same pool of participants also in theory provides the same profits to bidders and the same revenues to sellers37 this result known as the revenue equivalence theorem implies that to affect expected revenues requires changing who participates in an auction for example minimum bid rules can raise expected revenue but may lower an auc tions economic efficiency experimentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34707crs13

auction theory to work cambridge 2004 ch 5research has found that some expected au ction equivalences hold while others do not38 experimental testing of revenue equivalence of auction mechanisms is an active research area multipleunit auctions auctions in which multiple units are sold simultaneously are more complex than singleunit auctions computing optimal bidding strategies in multipleunit auctions may be complex and difficult designing multipleunit auctions so that government revenue is maximized and so that scarce resources are likely to be assigned to those who value them the most can be challengin g the federal government however has successfully used complex multiunit auctions to allocate electromagnetic spectrum for wireless communicati on and related uses manipulation and dema ndreduction strategies b i d d r s i n s m situations can benefit by strategically withdrawing bids on some items in order to lower prices on other items39 the logic of this strategy is analogous to standard monopoly or olig opoly pricing mode ls monopolist or firm with some market power can raise profits by reducing output below the level that would prevail in competitive market just as entry by new competitors can reduce the market power of existing firms auction designs that encourage many bidders to participate can limit the effect of demand reduction strategies complementarities auctions that sell complementary goods can be extraordinarily complex40 items are considered comp lements when groups of items are more valuable than the sum of individual items for example takeoff rights from specific airport that government might auction off will be more valuable if the airline can obtain landing rights at different airport federal communications commission auctions of electromagnetic spectrum involve complementarities because license in one geographic area may be more valuable to telecommunications firm that holds license in an adjacent area complementarities among tr oubled assets may complicate current reverse auctions implemented as part of tarp for instance some assets backed by sub prime loans were often linked to collateralized default obligationscdos which provided something akin to insurance to inve stors holding those assets in that case the asset backed by pool of subprime loans and the associated cdo would share strong complementarity which could ffect behavior in reverse auction dutch auctions with multiple units the us treasury as noted above uses multiunit dutch auction mechanism to sell government securities to

uniformprice auctions update of the treasury experience us treasury study oct 1998dealers the federal government and some corporations have used reverse dutch auctions for some procurements treas ury auction mechanisms can under certain circumstances be vulnerabl to manipulations related to the demandreduction strategies discussed above41 the us treasury and many entities that use auctions however have developed thods designed to detect or mitigate manipulation strategies uniformprice vs individual price auctions in some multipleunit auctions such as dutch auctions all succe ssful bidders pay the same price such auctions are called uniformprice auctions in other auctions such as firstprice auctions in which successful bidders pay their bids different bidders pay different prices for identical items such auctions are often called discriminatory or multiple price auctions 2002 international m onetary fund report found that 10 of 18 advanced industrial countries surveyed used uniformprice auctions and 15 of 18 used multipleprice auctions42 the us treasury claims that uniformprice auction raises slightly mo re revenue than multiplep rice auction because it reduces winners
