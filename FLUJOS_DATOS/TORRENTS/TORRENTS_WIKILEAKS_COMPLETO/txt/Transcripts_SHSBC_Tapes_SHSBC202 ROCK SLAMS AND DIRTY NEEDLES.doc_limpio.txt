rock slams and dirty needles lecture given on 14 august 1962 thank you well here we are saint hill special briefing course audience fourteen fourteenth fourteen it isnt audience yes it is how did you get into the 14th when im in the 16th audience bit of comm lag fourteen august ad 12 lecture one this is on 3gagoals writing and finding goals first and foremost there is the detailed theory which could go back of this once upon time there was thetan and he couldnt go forward and he couldnt go backwards and he had to stay there and he mustnt stay there and at that point he got overwhelmed and received further orders to evacuate and then further orders to advance and then orders to stay there and having done all this he then caught the barrage the barrage came in from in front you see and he was putting out barrage himself in front and this would have been all right except his own artillery started to lay shells into his position at which moment he again decided he had better evacuate but he couldnt carry the orders out and there he is to this dayrock slamming the mechanical importance of rock slam is based something on that its cant go cant come cant stay cant be mustnt be you see its all that and it in short is highly charged agitation originally on the 20th acc when i was doing assessment on peoples goals this manifestation during this assessment was so strong they called it the rock slam and actually at that time you used to go down this chain to find the rock that is how you get the word rock slam now in finding goals here during 61 and 62 so far we have had new manifestation that was not particularly known or understood and that was dirty needle and dirty needle is only little tiny persistent rock slam that is all dirty needle is so ive been spending the last week or so on very hard study of rock slamsvery very hard study and gratuitously there dropped into my lap criminal of the first order with record and so forth who i knewmind you i integrated this data after the interrogation andbut i knew it within this span and areathat the fellow was guilty of tremendous overt he had been stealing everybody blind left and right and the overts were particularly against and i was able to see rock slam turn on and off on this one fact and it was very interesting and of course he was trapped too and it was not goals manifestation it was simply this fellow was guilty of everything under the sun and i had big rock slams and little rock slams and all kinds of rock slamsthe dominant one about seveneighths of dial wide and i found out something very interesting about rock slams that you can appear to clear missed withhold off of somebody with great big rock slam and have it dirty as can be the needle just isnt registering right when youve got somebody with that large an overt you can miss withholds you can do all sorts of things because the concentration is on the rock slam and the concentration is not on the auditor and it takes superlative tr 1 to get by this and make needle register at all you understand this rock slam has been rock slamming like mad and now it isnt rock slamming and you ask him if you missed withhold and you get clean read have you missed withhold man ohho youve just missed all the crimes in the book see have i missed withhold and you get perfectly clean read thats quite interesting isnt it well i was able through various fortuitous circumstances after this interrogation to actually run down the fact that this person was guilty without any slightest doubts i found other corroborative evidence you see and i began to understand this needle better i began to understand this lot better as matter of fact i got all the dope necessary to prove it utterly and completely but as far as your interest is concerned well this opened up new horizon because i didnt have just big rock slams i had little rock slams and i had dirty needles and i had all kinds of things here it was most fantastic pyrotechnic array of this and that you ever heard of well this was quite interesting and its terribly interesting to you because for the first time it dawned upon that rock slam is an overt therefore dirty needle is an overt now you chase these things around in prepchecking and you go round and round and round and round and round with these things and you usually can find series of overts that clear them off the needle you can usually find this the auditor or scientology or something like this you can fool around with it and actually get some current life overts that will clean the needle and then you go back soaring on down the goals list and the next thing you know you flub you make little mistake you passed by goal without cleaning all the somatic off of it which is very hot goal you do your tiger drill poorly and youve got bzzzbzzzbzzzbzzzbzzz and you go down goal after goal and this rock slam keeps turning onwell you missed the one that turned it on you see you didnt catch that so youthe next goal to it starts persistently rock slamming andand you get down four or five goals for it and the doggone thing sounds like buzzer alarm system going off see its really fanning the air youve missed one well the point is this thats little rock slam see its missed withhold but the mechanics of failed to reveal are simply the still point which follows the confusion youve still got the stable datum and the confusion the confusion comes first and it holds the stable datum in place you find somebody with stuck picture dont audit the stuck picture find the confusion that preceded the stuck picture and the stuck picture will blow its quite interesting you got somebody there lookingthis is actually old data im giving you this is from back lastover year ago on this course its been around for quite while but the stuck picture is there gorgeously and this fellow was looking at telescope and it just continues to sit there and you can hammer it and you can pound it and you can do this and that its quite wonderful that you can address it directly and ask him to take responsibility for that picture and something will probably happen with the picture now thats quite remarkable but of course what is an overt but an irresponsibility an overt is an irresponsibility therefore by taking some responsibility for the stuck picture you can make this picture move thats the only button that will make the picture moveone of these really stuck pictures see its just what part of that picture could you be responsible for all right but if you really want to blow that thing off the trackby the way dont monkey with these things this is all experimental data im giving you if you stop in an auditing session as some auditors were doing last year before we grabbed them by the nape of the neck and hauled them out of the auditing chair and squirted seltzer water through their ears few times they would just see stuck picture you know and theyd stick in the sessionjust total q and see and theyd right away start handling this stuck picture you know oh this is marvelous session would go to pieces in balloon theyyou know they qanda with stuck picture so theyve stuck the session there well if you want to get rid of that thingthis is still just background music you see because you dontitll all come off in due course and you got business monkeying with it but if you were to look just bit earlier than that maybe minutes earlier than the picture occurredits right close to itit isnt 15 years before the picture its more like 15 minutes you know when you get that sort of thing and youll find confusion there and then if you just picked the overts the guy committed out of the confusion why the stuck picture will go sometimes its enough just to locate the confusion you see and it goes in other words confusion is followed by still stills do not exist without prior confusions except in the case of goals postulate there must have been prior confusion for still yet you wonder why cultures in various nations have settled down and are so fixed and so rigid well its very simple those cultures are that way because they have prior confusions and theyre stuck now if you want to really lay in culture see if youre up track someplace and youre giddy enough to create new civilization someplace or another and you want it to stick roman you knowthe romans really made their postulates stick manwhy you just make the whole confounded cottonpicking area so confoundedly confused that nobody can find which way is up and then make the people commit an awful lot of overts and then suddenly settle in still series of mores and customs theyll stick theyll stick thats how legendary figure such as quetzalcoatl can suddenly walk in on barbaric and murderous scene and put out all of the rules of warfare see and rules of agriculture and so forth and have those things go floating right on up the trackjust totally stuck see get the idea the situation must have been terribly confused with lot of overts in it before you got this stuck situation you can settle your mind to that now that is one of these very large very important scientological truths if you dont know that one in auditing sometime you wont know what the dickens youre looking at and its piece of understanding you should have now you know very well that this fellow committed whole lot of overts of some kind or another and sooner or later hes going to hang up in still and well he went around and all he did was kick people he used his left foot and he kicked people and he kicked people and he kicked people and he kicked people and he kicked people and he now has paralyzed left foot see well there was lot of motion see and lot of confusion and then it suddenly settled down and he decided he was guilty or something like that and there it is thats the chronic somatic youre trying to handle see this fellow walks in and says i understand youre scientologist and like all other doctors why youre supposed to cure things and you say all right youre knuckleheaded that day you got up on the wrong side of the bed and youre just plain stupid you see and in your effort to please why you say all right ill fix up your lumbosis you see well man hes been stabbing people in the lumbosis for an awful long time and it has happened often and frequently and so forth and you still could move around his lumbosis somewhat but if you tried to do this in the absence of pulling overts you wouldnt get anyplace you could cut it out which is what the doctors do its still got the engram but now its in an alcohol jar and the guy now has somatics where it was marvelous but this is back of all illness all chronic states these principles they are what makes chronic states chronic now an aberration of human being or miller moth or man from mars or total foreign alien personality such as governmental figuresthese fellows have aberrations and prior to those aberrations there were confusions and overtsand the business of settling the confusion with an overt which is the modus operandi of our existing cultures here on earth you always settle the confusion with the overt you know guy disturbs the peace they throw him in jail eventually the society will get more and more stuck in an aberration which they begin to mistake for culture oddly enough culturewell lets not say culture lets say politics or political formis an aberration caused by the collective overts of the citizenry and you actually could forecast very accurately the next political government or political form of any nation by an examination of the overts of the individual because the next government they elect they will try to make those overts legal so you just figure out what the most common denominator of overtsinteresting game you could sit around and fool around with this and you come up with some of the darnedest answersyou just examine what is the most common overt and then realize that the eventual culture will be one based on the legalization of that overt for instance thethey try to lessen the overt one way or the other by freezing something into line they lessen an overt by freezing into place motivator and theres all kinds of mechanisms involved in this but the general law is is you just figure out what the collective overt is and the next political form will be one which legalizes that overt ill give you an example criminal has to come to the conclusion that property belongs to nobody there is such thing as private property hes got to come to that conclusion see otherwise he would be guilty of so many overts he couldnt live with himself what was the crime rate of russia before the 1917 revolution yeah man it was big it was heavy and the russki legalized theft by saying there is property see see thats the ideal criminal political form im not anticommunism as if i was talking to couple of communists now i could fry their hair i dont say i havent in the past ive converted communists to royalists and so forth because in the form of politics you see it is only opinion and aberration there is wisdom if you could figure out that the overt in any state which has become socialized state must have been weakness it must be of an omitted participationa weakness see because now all of sudden theyve legalized weakness they pay it weakness is now paid do you get the examples audience mmhm well this is aberration on the third dynamic well this has an awful lot to do with clearing every once in while ill run into phenomenon and stumble over it and fall over it and bump my head over it and bung my toes up on it and ruin my shins on it and try to get around it one way or the other and so forth and as time goes onif i were brighter you see wed be much further aheadbut it takes certain amount you see of falling on my face over this phenomenon to finally recognize that we dont have to avoid itwe can use it that is usually what happens you see we can use that in our business but you have to know quite bit about one of these things to be able to use one and frankly we really never used the rock slam to amount to anything except little bit on the 20th but then i couldnt give you packaged word that described the rock slam so therefore it was to that degree useless any auditor whos been auditing for little while with modern technique knows when hes running middle rudiments now you see that little needle buzzbzzzbzzz and you dont bother to say have you invalidated it or anything you doyou skip your tiger drill right straight to failed to reveal you got failed to reveal sitting right in front of your face so you skip your tiger drill to failed to reveal and you pick it uppowpowpowpowpow and then thats clean and then you go back to your tiger drill again see and its senseless trying to pick up an invalidation to read through bzzzbzzzbzzz when this is obviously failed to reveal dont you see in other words this little tiny dirty needle is manifestation of failed to reveal now failed to reveal must have been preceded by an overt and i dont ask you to vary your tiger drill or your middle rudiments and delete failed to reveal and substitute overt in its place because theres very little to gain there is very little gain there you start picking up overtspooey youre using too strong weapon see he only had to pick up the failed to reveal you see and youll get the missed withhold phenomenon remedied and other things will remedy you see at the same time but you should realize that while youre picking up failed to reveal youre just skimming the top of the pot see if that thing is going to go bzzzbzzzbzzz theres an overt under it and ordinarily you dont pick up the overt you dont bother with it and your tiger drill is quite successful up to the moment you run into chronic and continuous rock slam or dirty needle and at that point that gets very desperate and ow has been shoved into the lineup to remedy this and ow will work as long as you get your question answered but will not work if you dont get your questions answered or if the pc is doing something else with the auditing question dont qanda with the pc and stick him up on the track by demanding that he answer the question more precisely give himyou the answer you wanthes answering it technically right use clearing the auditing command question after question after question after question but keep giving him the question and getting the answers dont you see keep him in communication clear the auditing command every time inspect the meter see if he did something else you knowharass him and he finally heaccept his answers but harass him oh well you say have you done anything to your mother and he said well i flew aiii flew kite in world war ii well you say well i dont see quite how that answers the auditing command well it didnt she asked not to isnt your face red see so you can only do certain amount of clearing up of the question but now youre getting silly answers like this why on subsequent things you clear the auditing command better thats how you handle that situation do you understand that his answer technically fulfills this but it isnt what you want and youll find out if hes doing something else keep clearing the auditing command with himnot while he is doing the command but after he has answered it and you okayed it and everything now clear the auditing command with him again ask if hes doing anything else if he did anything else besides just that or if hes trying to solve something with that answer you know get in there and pitch little bit and you all of sudden find out that hes doing fantastic things with this auditing question thats the reason ow doesnt work for you when it doesnt work you either hang up and arc break the pc to pieces by never accepting the first answer see or you collapse afterwards and just accept anything because you couldnt get it straight well the happy medium between these two things you see is to run ow and hes giving you technically acceptable answers well keep clearing the auditing command use that as your routine between answers keep clearing the auditing command clearing the auditing command i did it once for an hour one night and achieved some fantastic result pc says all of sudden what they werent answering the auditing command they were trying to solve problem with the auditing command and they were only giving answers that fitted into the problem and then looked each time to see whether or not the problem had been solved which it had not of coursebecause the pc had never answered the auditing question got the pc to answer the auditing question and everything was fine but theyou use clearing the auditing command between questions you got that as mechanism all right thats why you have ow and it isnt necessary to go into lots of overts and that sort of thing just when youre running failed to reveal you know thats perfectly valid just fine because youre after all running with whisk broom theres reason to get tenton bulldozer in there and start plowing up the whole tenacre field see you will the moment you start for overts if midruds consisted of have you committed any overts haha on this goal have you committed any overts where are we going to wind up well were on that question now two and half hours and that isnt the purpose of the tiger drill but asking if theres anything he failed to reveal why well get it reading so it serves the purpose dont you see but you shouldnt forget that underneath that bzzzbzzzbzzz there is an overt all right so criminality has served us well and because there it was quite obvious that integrating this against all the other data i had that i was not looking at rock slam on the goals chain i was just looking at godawful overt which the individual was sitting across from saying he had never committed and the evidence existed not only had he committed it but he had committed dozen others like it see this bird had his heels planted in the middle of the road and the harder he planted his heels the harder that thing slammed so you should have seen couple of nights ago because you see this was needle manifestation not thatdont draw the inference that everybody who has rock slams is criminal this was just this interesting phenomenon that here was the source of rock slam and it was characterized by overt and this suddenly fell into the line and said isnt this nice and sweet and i wonder whether or not i can turn one on at will and sunday night in an auditing session i did the unforgivable you know the unforgivable your pc is listing away beautifully and all of sudden you see free needle turn on you know you say hey hey hey free needle i got it do you want to see it free needle haha you know busts the whole session up you know well i did sunday night this was too excitingon slambecause i found out i could turn on slam at will on goals chain and right away some iron doors opened actually it didnt disturb the pc at all the pc was excited as i was because they knew they were going right for their goal and besides the pc was insession you can do lot of things if somebodys in session and you ought to try it some time isnt that mean isnt that mean woke you up anyway anyway weve had 3ga just as given last weekunderstand this nowis totally workable and will move right on out and do the job you understand that you list enough goals youll get the charge off and so forth now our problem is just doing it faster and doing clearing faster and this is not necessarily even an improvement on 3ga this is just some way to find some goals understand what i am telling you and this framework this is just ways to find goals see id probably give you dozens and dozens of these in the next two or three four or five years you know youll be sitting there and youve gotten it down to where finding goal is sure cure at eight hours you see suddenly look at yourself youll be sitting there and youll suddenly get bulletin you know and itll sayyou put the emeter on the left side of you you see and just to the right side and you can cut it down to four hours and you have to interrupt this lengthy goalsfinding activity that youre engaged in you see to do it shorter you can count on something like that happening and this is one of those things because the reason i tell you this is because we have already cleared first goal clear who had wild rock slam you follow now as listing was being completed wild rock slam was on the needle every now and then in other words goals had been picked off the top of the gpm and here we had situation you see where somebody went clear and free needle and so forth on the second goal we undoubtedly would have gotten second goal and there possibly would have been some rock slam residual there you see and we got third goal and we still had some rock slam dont you see and gradually it would have petered out and so forth now what im intrigued about is while all of you are sitting around smugly whose name didnt appear on the list there while youre feeling comfortable about this let tell you this horrible fact is you can turn it on on any pc knowing these details because right up to this moment you thought i was talking about specialized case im not talking about specialized caseim talking about you and because were monkeying around with this last night and we turned one on at will on mebang you know what it is you can turn it on dont you see its an overt its an overt channel this guy has got himself caught in the front lines with bunch of overts and hes sitting in ridge which has got enough confusion and enough overt behind it that he couldnt move anyplace so there he is see that and wouldnt you like goals process which might do as follows which might omit the first two or three goals and leave you with only four or five you see wouldnt that be interesting male voice oh yeah just cut off the first three and make it much faster to find those first thethe first goal and just bypass some big chunks of gpm which will just blow off wouldnt that be nice well thats the speedup which i have in mind here i find this very fascinating weve already run people found perfectly valid goals and run people to free needle and found out they had rock slamming needle underlying the free needle you overlist beyond this free needle waysfifteen twenty minutes something like thatand you had firing rock slam turn on every now and then well of course this pc was going right on down the goals chain well we already see that the track is laid out in cycles cycle is series of lives or types of lives associated and allied and withhighly variable in its time element it could be trillion years it could be billion years it could be hundred thousand it could be sixty thousand its just the fellow starts in on this brandnew endeavor to him and he goes on through to the end where its so dead and so buried and so gone that he wont admit to any part of it and he doesnt even stay in that corner of the universe you understand thats cycle well now actually what starts cycle is prime postulate that is not particularly influenced by any earlier experience or postulate he starts himself out with new goal which is not solution to his problems but new game and then hell swish up the track quite ways going on this and itll finallyfinally the steam will leak out of the boiler and he eventually lays that aside and he finds himself taking interest in life and doing nothing and getting place and in trouble and he hasnt got any ability to get into trouble with see you know it takes certain amount of ability to get into trouble see and hes finally gone down through the bottom and hes lying around now listening to brahms you see life is hopeless you know and hes reading modern literature and hes pretty well washed out well actually he goes on out through the bottom and while out through the bottom why he finds himself sitting out on cloud 9 realizes hes been there for quite while something like this and he didnt report back to the area for new body or anything like that he feels quite perked up you know he perks upup to two or three grasshopper power and he says ii think ill get back in the game lets see now what would be good game to never have anything anyplace yeahnot even could figure my way out of that and off he goes on new cycle you get the idea every other postulate he makes after that cycle is involved with this basic postulate and he gets inthen theyre really solutions to problems caused by the basic postulate so he goes tearing along for sixty thousand or another trillion or something like that it all depends on how good it is we someday will probably have scale up on the wall this postulate will carry you this many thousand years you know but anyhow thatsthats the way it goes well now thats cycle well now those are pieces of gpm actually however they have an interrelationship even though the thetan thinks they do not it is of interest to clean up the earliest one you can get your paws on in other words bypass some of them and youll find out the later cycles then are very easy to knock off sometimes you might find they might even knock off just by inspection because hes less powerful in making his postulate each time you see thats dwindling spiral type of action all right then theoretically is itit is of interest to reach as far back on the track as you can for goal that is still reconcilable with the pcs reality on it and his ability to run it those are the monitoring factors now of course you get that if goal will firejust take it this way if you can get goal to rocket read you can list it that is your guiding principle you can get one to fire and fire and fireall cleaned up you see its all tigered to pieces everything is off of it and its rocket reading every time you say it and everything is going along fine now then that goal shouldif it is kept clean during listing and is listed properly and if the lines are kept clean and are firingthat goal should list through to free needle which means the vanishment of great chunks of gpm dont you see then you have to go and find yourself new goal and if youve gotfind one now that rocket reads after its been all cleaned up why you can list that one out oh this is sequence youre actually reaching further and further and further and further back now if you were to come forward and find later goal that would be the easiest thing you ever did see its easyitd be easy to isolate or locate these things and it is of interest to find the earliest goal that you can lay your paws on that is real to the pc and if its real to the pc it fires just repeating what i just said well weirdly enough thetan never gets so messed up that he fails to leave out flag he gets buried in the cemetery but he usually has tombstone you want to know in early work this was particularly useful the key engram of the persons current life still had piece of picture and the pc would go back and forth past this picture and you ask him sometimeyou ask him have you got any very innocent pictures there you got any pictures that dont mean anything very much and well theresyes theres one here of my grandfathers rocking chair haha thats all its just an empty rocking chair i see that quite often sometimes grandfather has been in it but the more hes gone across it grandfather has been less in itnow isnt in it at all its just an empty chair well you go and explore this and you can actually take off and run it as an engram if you can get the fellow to face up to any part of it and the next thing you know the darnedest roman arena turns up around there and itll be key engram on this lifetime in other words he left little flag flying out here of an empty rocking chair and actually theres an automobile accident and couple of operations and funeral and so forth that hes forgotten all about he doesnt know anything about these these have just slipped his mind but he did leave rocking chair sitting there i think its quite remarkable thetan nearly always does this hes always got rocking chair or little flag or now and then he sees small inscription on something that isnt there see its just little memory tab that sticks out of the reactive bank youll find this thing in many of its manifestations and the goal has rock slam left on it key goal has rock slam on it now i dont say that you cant find goal which is later on the track closer to present time than that and prove it out and clean it dont you see because weve done it and then find an earlier goal and prove it out and list it to clear you see and then so forth nor do i say that you could do this on every person because we havent done it on every person there are lot of people who havent been cleared in this world you might like to read the papers sometime if you need any proof of that and the generality here however is that youre liable to run into somebody whos just got such rock slamming needle or such dirty dirty needle all the time all the time all the time that you cant prepcheck them you know you cant find any handle to prepcheck with and you cant find any handle to assess with and you couldnt do tiger drill on them and so forth well itd be very doubtful if you would ever find goal on that person very doubtful itd take long time to sec check prepcheck them out to point where the needle is readable funny part of it is the needle will probably at once collapse inback into it the rock slam and the pattern the second you hit the goals list because weve never had any trouble with this except when we were monkeying with goals isnt that interesting audience mmm yeah mmhm and every time you start monkeying with goals you have dirty needles persistent dirty needles you have rock slams you have this and that and man yes its associated with goal phenomena and now you recognize that that pattern is failed to reveal but how about the big pattern he doesnt know what hes failing to reveal you sometimes can pull series of overts on the big pattern against certain thing like an auditor and itll turn off you can fool around with somebodys goals list and find every rock slamming item on the goals list write those few down pull common denominator off test it several different ways and then ask him if he has an overt against that lately he gives it to you and the rock slam turns off you get that as method of turning off rock slam but its an overt on certain target one of the most fruitful ways of finding what that target is is to have nulled several hundred goals on the pc and found that some of them rock slammed take those goals write them down on little separate listit isnt that theyre inand look at their subject matter and then just sort out their subject matter until it makes sense test it little bit you know overts on this all of sudden youll be able to turn on the rock slam at will but this oddity gets in your road subject one turned on rock slam easily and well but it wore out almost at once subject two that you selected turned on rock slam and it wore out you knew you had it you see and then it was gone it didnt do it anymore subject threeand it turned on rock slam and then it was gone too and then subject four and subject four turns on rock slam and it goes on every time you got rock slam you use subject four and it turns it off every time you know it works like charm and this button isnt wearing out why did others wear out because they were just locks on the main button and very little bit of auditing cleaned them off the chain youll sometimes find somebodys goal was dialwide rock slamming and it turned out not to be his goal and you found another goal and it was dialwide rock slamming and that turned out to be not his goal and then you got another goal and it was dialwide rock slamming where the hell whats happening see well its just that they werent but the charge is associated with them in other words the charge can trickle up the line and attach itself to different things which are allied in subject matter its like tree at first any branch of the tree looks like the trunk if youre examining it blindfolded and youll eventually find the trunk yeah you take ahold of limb of tree and supposing you were examining merely the top of the tree and the limbs of the tree and you had sense of up or down and you wouldnt know where the top of this tree was theyd all feel about the same actually well the test would be that when you finally got hold of the top of the tree that button didnt wear out yeah but you dont feel too cocky just because you get something to rock slam madly because just about the time you turn the meter around to show the pc or rush out of the auditing room without calling break to find an instructor to say look look look you know youll get back the subjects probably worn out by that time and then you have to bunt around little bit to find the allied subject that turns it on i mean this charge that is imparted to associated subjectsrelated subjectsis about the only thing that gets in your road going back down this track because youre happily climbing down branch of the tree and you say we sure are getting near the trunk and then the branch peters out and never goes near the trunk theres rock slam and there was bridge and nothing little man popped out of the emeter and says go to the left this is oneway street you know directions are given you but out of all this potpourri if you followed it down by doing goals list and finding each type of goal that rock slammed and then tested all of those out youve got system but its very laborious system which would peter out all the time now scientology has number of basic truths in it there are lots of fundamentals around and instead of hunt and punch you can always go find yourself hat full of fundamentals and shove them into the works you see and everything goes off afterwardsand youve got some fundamentals called the dynamics and the goals chain begins with an overt on dynamics it doesnt happen to be an intentional overt it just happens that the goal happens to be in the woof and warp of life hellish overt against part of one of the dynamics now you see lets say there are eight dynamics and each one has hundred branches i know youthey have far fewer in their exact divisions but you get pc rattling off of how many parts there are to fifth dynamic you ought to listen to him sometime you see now hes really stuck on the fifth my godtheres trees and theres grasses and theres shrubs and theres flowers and then you have to get botany textbook you see and then that gives you all the types of trees all the types of shrubs and all the types of flowersthe families thereunto the climatic differences thereof see and then theres mice and psychology isnt totally lost you know theres still authorities on mice and you say well to you rodent you see this would be one part of the fifth dynamic well in actual fact why you should just start reading the catalog of the number of types of mice there are you know let alone rats so itd actually get pretty broad dont you see well you got all of these parts of lifeall of its various ramifications and forms all branching out from your eight dynamics you see you get an almost infinite variety of life out of these eight dynamics but you can go back to these eight dynamics and anybody who has made postulate may have been in agreement with totally associated with everything fine with seven of the dynamics and 799 parts of the remaining dynamic but its still going to be one hell of an overt against at least one of the parts of one of the dynamics you can count on that its going to be an overt because life you see is built in many frames and varieties of postulates and youre going to have some part of life that is going to be assaulted by any postulate thetan makes were going to saywell im going to give you crude example the fellow says to be tragedian thats what im going to be im going to be tragedian thatthats going to be my next cycle see thats fine but some other knuckleduster has said to make everybody happy those two goals are going to collide see somebody else making everybodys got to be happy you see and this fellows tragedian and this is terrific collision dont you see well actually its not postulate against postulate that youre particularly worried about youre worried about postulates against parts of life and youve got yourself and youve got the two divisions of the second dynamic and you got groups and you got species and youve got the fifth dynamic see and the remaining species and you got the sixth which is the physical universe including forms and youve got the seventh which is spirits and the eighth which is supreme beings et etc thats getting pretty wild here dont you see and you say im going to help people and this is an overt against god which is designed only to help people dont you see youre going to help people youre going to cut his throat in other words see theres all kinds of crossplays theres reason to go into it you yourself have in your banks several hundred thousand excellent examples so you can use this rock slam to find the goals channel by doing the following by taking the eight dynamics andassessing them to find which one has rock slam on it dirty needle which one gives up dirty needle now if we cant get dirty needle just by inspection we can always cause one by asking him to think of overts against and pick out the dirtiest biggest needle we get you have to be clever to ask that question without missing withholds all right think of committing overts against yourself and think of committing overtssexual overts or against sexagainst sex is betterits all against youre going to get one of these things to rock slam thats for sure either it was rock slamming just when you read over the list and you just picked it up like that or you had to work on it little bit harder and make something rock slam and pick that see well if youve got that you kind of want to prove it out you kind of want aboutto ask about it has he ever committed any overts get him to tell you few you know and so on now what would represent that dynamic to the pc this is list that you get lets say you got third dynamic now what would represent that dynamic to the pc you understand what im giving you here is not set pattern this is merely an exploratory experimental process but what would represent that third dynamic to him you know and he gives you this and he gives you that and he gives you the other thing well he might get fiveyou might get fifty items but you sit there and do yourself little assessment by elimination is the way you do your prehav scale see but youre looking for the rock slam but you dont care if that list doesnt rock slam you merely want to find the hottest point of that list you understand you just want the hot point of the list if it doesnt rock slam we wont worry about it at this particular time were just going to find something hot and that list may stand out totally independent and it may have on the third dynamic it might have something like governments see thats hot maybe it rock slams maybe it doesnt rock slam we couldnt care itbut it certainly was the hottest button if it is the hottest button then its the only one on the list thattheres nothing else on the list that is rock slamming you understand the way rock slam is used toin that particular little dirty needle bzzzt its the only one that will now weits very simple we take our pen in hand we spread out our legal length 13 inch by 8 paper we put down at the top of this the date and the pcs name and then we write this sentence what goal might you have that would be an overt against government question mark number 1 use arabic numerals and the proof of this pudding is whether or not that needle starts falling off the pin if that needle goes crashcrash after little while you want anyyou write down any pain the pc has or any sen and if that needles going crashcrashcrash on this list you just keep going as long as that needles going crashcrashcrash got it but if that tone arm is moving well hahahaha got good tone arm motion and everything is going along here lovely and that rock slam is narrowing and finally gets down to little dirty needle and that finally disappears on your listingwhen tone arm needle not so much the tone arm but certainly the needle is longer caroming around just because youre listing goals and your needles got nice and quiet if youre lucky the pcs goal is on that list you wrote aint that interesting its like doing crossword puzzle thats interesting now i said if youre lucky i hope this doesnt happen to you that you get the rock slam and get nothing but sen and stuck needle you got rock slam but you got sen and stuck needle you missed some place something is wrong here somewhere because the rock slam will very shortly disappear and you will realize at this time that youve gone to the end of branch not to the endtop of the tree and youve gone down and it petered out and that isnt so and the best way to handle thatthe best way to handle that is just do yourself brandnew dynamic assessment and do the whole process all over again now actually youre not looking at lengthy process this does not take long to do if you think it takes session to do dynamic assessment it doesnt it takes ordinarily seven or eight minutes to do complete dynamic assessment with the part theres trouble with this see its not hard job its very simple action old dynamic assessment is done by change of characteristic now if youve been unfortunate and this rock slam just peters out you want to know whether its going or not just make another test ask for overts against other dynamics and if you turn on rock slam again why i dont know whether you ought to do the list where it ran out or do new list on it but its the length of time you will i think learn the dwindling rock slam youll realize that you are taking the charge off by goals listing whereas the rock slam just didntit was on and just disappeared and you dont see it anymore see well if youve got list by dwindling rock slam you of course are taking the charge off of that rock slam now you make the guy do 850 goals you do anything else with list that hadyou have been told for 3ga your list is already this discharged whenby the time you do this thing you dont spend any time much listing on him or straightening him out you just look for the rock slam you got that thats the auditor action you still want 850 goals from this pc what do you do with the 850 goals well you put them aside carefully and do nothing with them you want that little short list that went on down to the bottom of the rock slam thats theoretically the way it would work see that leaves you with handful of goals to null now if the fellows goal isnt on that you either have missed meter read which of course you will never do after you leave here you may do it here but you will never do it when you have left here you miss meter read or that goal for some reason or otherwell you didnt have it straight or it was the wrong dynamic or the thing panned outsomething went wrong on the thing still just repeat the operation and get yourself another short list and see if the goals on that that is fairly catchascatchcan economical way of doing it oddly enough youll probably have the pc wheezing sneezing squeezing and saying god goshwhat do you know you know thats this kind of reaction taking place and hell tell you exactly why this goal is the right goal and you get cognitional actions if you do it withouttheres cognition on any case i would be suspicious of it if the pc wasnt genning in on why you had to have this type of goal i would be suspicious of it pcs just writing them all down on long grind well you probably are running down the branch of the tree your rock slam isnt narrowing itll eventually just disappear and itll leave you list full of sen that will be the way it is all right well theres the experimental use of the rock slam in the discovery of goal now perhaps on some pcs youd have to use this system absolutely but on most pcs the way this is predicted it would bypass maybe the first two three goals that you would have to find on the ease and list so you see this shortens up goals it shortens up clearing if it works properly as you do it and work with it and run into problems i will undoubtedly have other things to refine concerning it but for the moment thats the way it is thank you very much
