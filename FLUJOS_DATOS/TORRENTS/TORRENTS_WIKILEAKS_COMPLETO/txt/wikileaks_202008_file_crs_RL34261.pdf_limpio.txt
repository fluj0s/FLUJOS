policy toward neighboring countries summary russian oil and natural gas industries ar increasingly important players in the global energy market particular ly in europe and eurasia another trend has been the increasing concentration of these industries in the hands of the russian government this latter phenomenon has been accompan ied by an increasingly authoritarian political system in which former intelligence officers play key roles russian firms have tried to purchase controlling stake in pipelines ports storage facilities and other ke energy assets of the count ries of central and eastern europe they need these assets to tran sport energy supplies to lucrative western european markets as well as to secure greater control over the domestic markets of the countries of the region in several cas where assets were sold to nonrussian firms russian firms cut off energy supplies to the facilities russia has also tried to build new pipelines to circumvent infrastru cture that it does not control another objective russia has pursued has been to eliminate the energy subsidies former soviet republics have received since the fall of the soviet union including by raising the price these countries pay for na tural gas to world market prices it is not completely clear whether the pursuit of russian foreign policy objectives is the primary explanation for the actions of its energy firms few would disagree in principle that the elimination of subsidies to postsoviet countries is sound business decision even if questions ve been raised about the timing of such moves even the pursuit of multiple pipelines can be portrayed as business decision on the other hand many countries of the region are concerned that russia may use their energy dependency to interfere in their domestic affairs or to force them to make foreign policy concessions countries of th region also fear that by controlling energy infrastructure in their c ountries russian energy firms are able to manipulate the internal political situation by favoring certain local businessmen and politicians administration officials have repeatedly criticized what they view as russian efforts to use its energy supplies as political weapon and have urged european countries to reduce their dependence on ru ssian energy the united states has strongly advocated the building of mu ltiple pipelines from central asia and azerbaijan to europe memb ers of congress have also expressed concern about the impact on european countries of their pendence on russian energy in the first session of the 110th

central importance to the countries concerned other energy issues such as russias nuclear power industry as well as electricity and coal expor ts are not dealt with in this report russian energy policy toward neighboring countries introduction in recent years members of congress administration officials and analysts have noted the dependence of many eur opean countries on russian energy they have expressed concern that russia is using this energy dependence as part of larger effort to limit the sovereignt and prowestern orientation of vul nerable neighboring countries such as ukraine moldova and georgia in addition to bolstering the sovereignty of these countries the united states has also had vital interest in keeping strong ties with nato and eu member states some observers believe that these relations could be harmed in the long term if many of these states became too dependent on russian energy at present the european union depends on russia for 44 of its natural gas needs and 18 of its oil1 however this figure conceals the fact that this dependence is unequally distributed some eu countri many of them in central and eastern europe are dependent on russia for most or all of the oil and natural gas they consume for example the baltic states are entirely dependent on russia for natural gas noneu countries bordering russ ia are also overwhelmingly or entirely dependent on russian oil and natural gas2 this report begins with brief discussi on of the russian oil and gas industries including their efforts to purchase energy infrastructure in central and eastern europe and reduce energy subsidies to neighborin g countries second section deals with the impact of recent russian energy policy on neighboring countries all of them formerly part of the soviet union facto or jure and all heavily dependent on russian energy imports many of these c ountries are concerned about what they see as russian efforts to manipulate that dependency to achieve political goals final section deals with us efforts to promote the energy security of these countries and on congresss response to the issue3httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34261crs2 russias oil and gas industries and russian foreign policy russian oil and natural gas industries ar increasingly important players in the global energy market particularly in eu rope and eurasia russia possesses over 30 of world natural gas reserves and at leas t 10 of global oil reserves another key trend has been the increasing concentrati on of these industries in the hands of the russian government this latter phenomenon has been accompanied by an increasingly authoritarian political system under the tight control of president vladimir putin former officer of the soviet kgb intelligence service both the leadership of russian oil and gas firms and the russian government are dominated by former members of the russian intelligence service now called the federal security service fsb or are personally close to putin or both for example the head of the state oil company rosneft is igor sechin putins deputy chief of staff and formerly from the fsb the head of th russian oil pipeline monopoly transneft is former fsb officer who served with putin in east germany in the 1970s key posts at the statecontrolled natural ga s monopoly gazprom are staffed by former kgbfsb men in late 2007 putin designated first deputy prime minist er dmitri medvedev whose functions included overseeing gazp rom as his successor medvedev was elected president of russia in march 2008 in vote viewed by many observers as not free and fair medvedev although close putin associate is not former fsb officer putin has said he will accept th post of prime minister after medvedev takes office in may there has been speculation and uncertainty in russia over what impact the succession will have on the leadership of russias stateowned energy firms the personal and political fortunes of russias leaders are tied to the energy firms as russias economic revival is in small part due to the massive revenues generated by energy exports in period of high global energy prices however many experts believe that the russian leaderships stateoriented approach may be counterproductive for russia in the long run as output growth in russian oil and gas fields is stagnating despite rising inte rnational demand they say russias oil and gas industries will likely need foreign inve stment and expertise more efficient management as well as less gove rnment regulation and taxation gazprom since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 the rgest firm in russia has been the statecontrolled natural gas m onopoly gazprom the russian government holds just over 50 of its shares it has monopoly on gas pipelines in russia it controls nearly 90 of russian gas pr oduction and over quarter of the worlds reserves of natural gas its impact within russia is even more significant it is the single largest contributor to the russian governments budget providing about 25 of tax receipts it also controls banks i ndustrial holdings farm s and media outlets gazprom has been useful domestically to russian leaders it provides 76 of its production at loss at prices 1520 of those in europe to russian companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34261crs3 4 eia country brief russia april 2007 fro m the eia website h ttp

often cannot or will not pay thereby helping to ease social pressures in exchange for subsidizing russian domestic consumers gazprom receives virtual monopoly on exports to ri cher customers abroad twothirds of gazproms revenue comes from european cu stomers many experts say gazprom needs to substantially increase domestic prices for gas if it is ever to become viable business russia has agreed to gradually increase some domestic gas prices to bring them closer to world market levels by 2011 the move was taken in response to eu criticisms of the price subsidy in negotiations over russias entry into the world trade organzation wto4 gazproms key current gas fields are in decline its infrastructure is aging and substantial investment will be needed just to maintain current nearly stagnant production levels most foreign observe rs believe gazprom could use foreign investment to provide exper tise and capital in late 2005 russia abolished the ring fence that barred foreigners from owning gazprom shares current foreign ownership of gazprom shares is modest the largest foreign investor is the german firm eon with 6 stake5 however gazproms actions in other areas appear to point toward more state control and not toward more foreign investment for example in 2006 gazprom bought out half of the intere st of shell and other foreig n companies in the sakhalin2 gas field project at very low price af ter the russian government found alleged environmental problems in sh ells management of the project in june 2007 the russianbritish tnkbp oil firm was forced to sell its kovytka gas field in siberia cheaply to gazprom after gazprom refuse d to approve an export route for the gas russia has also announced that it would velop its shtokman field in the arctic without internati onal participation russian oil companies in the 1990s the russian government did not have large stake in russian oil production the major oil companies were controlled by politically wellconnected businessmen dubbed oligarchs this policy changed in 2003 when mikhail khodorkovsky head of the gi ant yukos oil firm was rrested on tax evasion and other charges however most observers believe that the real reason for the arrest was that president putin believed khodor kovsky was showing unacceptable signs of political independence from the kremlin yukos was hit with government claims for back taxes and declared bankrupt in 2004 its key oil field asse ts were bought very cheaply by the russian stateowned oil firm rosneft the yukos affair is not the only example of this trend in 2005 ga zprom bought another major oil company sibneft from oligarch roman abramovich at cutrate price the firm is now called gazprom neft the russian govern ment now controls over 30 of russias oil production6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34261crs4 6 continued 2005 d06 7 russneft ordeal places premium on loyalty oxford analytica august 2 2007in 2006 putin said that the state would not take control of additional russian oil companies however the strengthenin g of state control over the industry may be conducted by other means the russian g overnment has placed pressure on foreign oil companies to sell their stakes in lucrative russian oil fields to russian state firms the nonstate oil firms that remain such as lukoil are careful to retain close connections to russian political leaders in order to retain control of their businesses for example in july 2007 after more than year of harassment by russian prosecutors and tax authorities mikhail gutseriyev the head of the modestlysized russian oil firm russneft announced that he would sell his stake to oleg deripaska powerful businessman with close ties with the kremlin7 in march 2008 russian government agencies announced they were investigating the second largest russian il firm tnkbp on suspicion of violations of taxation and environmen tal laws two russian tnkbp employees are under investigation by the fsb for industrial pionage tnkbp was formed jointly by tyumen oil company and british petroleum bp in 2003 with each holding 50 share observers have speculated on the reas ons for the investigations part of the reason may be deteriorating relations be tween great britain and russia over the assassination of former fsb officer eksandr litvinenko in london and other issues they may also be the product of kremlin infighting associated with the russian presidential transition some observe rs believe that the investigations could be prelude to takeover of the russia n half of the partnership by gazprom rosneft or others closely associated with the russian government some speculate that part or all of bps shares in company could also be targeted despite increasing direct and indirect state control russian oil firms continue to seek ties to foreign oil companies provided that they are satisfied with minority stake conocophillips has 10 share in lukoil the italian firm eni has 20 stake in gazprom neft stateowned ro sneft floated shares on the london stock exchange in 2006 bp the malaysia stat firm petronas and chinas ncpc bought shares accounting for 75 of rosnefts total capital in addition to increasing control over oil production the government controls russias oil and refined produc t pipelines through the state firm transneft this monopoly gives the russian government verage against russian private firms foreign investors and foreign countries if needed for example transneft is the largest shareholder in the caspian pipeline consortium cpc the cpc pipeline carries oil from kazakhstan to the russian port of novorossiysk on the black sea this gives russia near monopoly on the transport of kazakh oil destined for western markets other members incl ude exxonmobil and

exploiting dependency or just good business through its energy firms moscow has pursued several objectives in recent years russia has tried to purchase controlling stake in pipelines ports storage facilities and other key energy assets of the countries of central and eastern europe russia needs these assets to transport energy supplies to western european markets as well as to secure greater control over th domestic markets of the countries of the region in several cases where energy in frastructure was sold to nonrussian firms russia cut off energy supplies to the facilities russian firms have recently attempted to buy energy infrastructure in western european countries provoking unease in the eu the eu has pressed russia to open up its pipelines to western firms and to provide stronger protections for foreign investment in russias energy sector russia has flatly rejected eu demands that it ratify the 1994 energy charter treaty which enshrines these principles eu efforts to include the key components of the energy charter into new russiaeu partnership and cooperation agreement p ca have also been stymied the eu commission has proposed new eu energy policy that would prohibit energy producing companies from owning distribution networks it would also bar foreign companies from investing in eu distributi on networks unless th at country permitted such investment in its own networks russia has strongly criticized the commission proposal eu countries have also been concerne d about russian actions to coordinate export policy with other natura l gasproducing countries such as algeria evoking the specter of cartel or gas opec russi has also hinted that the bulk of russian energy exports could be provided to china instead of europe in the future once new pipelines to asia are completed howeve r it is unclear whether the eu can adopt an effective common policy on the russian energy question central and eastern european countries within the eu want th eu to take stronger stance against dependence on russia for energy but energy companies and other influential voices in countries such as german and italy are reluctant to upset moscow on the issue9 facing difficulties in securing control of energy infrastructure in central and eastern europe russia has tried to bypa ss countries in the region entirely where possible it is expanding the use of the baltic pipeline system and its oil terminal at the port of primorsk and reducing the use of oil terminals in the baltic states such as butinge in lithuania and ventspils in latvia in addition

2007 gazprom and the italia n firm eni signed an agreement to build south stream gas pipeline that would run from russia to turkey through the balkans with branches to austria and italy bulgaria serbia and hungary have also signed on to the project in febr uary russia hopes to complete south stream in 2013 south stream would bypass bela rus ukraine poland and other central european countries another possible project is yamaleur ope 2 this longproposed pipeline which would parallel currentlyoperatin g one would run through belarus and poland bypassing ukraine the pipeline is unlikely to be built as the russian government and gazprom have rejected belarusian proposals to reactivate the yamaleurope 2 plans however if negp does not come to fruition it is at least possible the yamaleurope 2 plan could be reactivated by seeking range of transit routes th rough the region russia may be trying to reduce the leverage that transit countries including those in central and eastern europe have in negotiations with russian energy firms experts note that the capacity of these new routes if built would likely outstrip russias capacity to produce oil and gas to fill them allowi ng russia to allocate scarce production to favored transit countries russia may also be trying to reduce the attractiveness of other routes for oil and gas pipelines from azerbaijan and central asia to europe and asia that would bypass russia10 another objective russia has pursued has been to eliminate the energy subsidies former soviet republics have received ce the fall of the soviet union including by gradually raising the price these count ries pay for natural gas to world market prices11 these actions may be seen as paralleling the reduction of subsidies to russian domestic consumers however russi has also used the withdrawal of price subsidies and the unpaid energy debts of countries in the region as leverage to try to secure key energy infrastru cture in those countries it is not completely clear whether the pursuit of russian foreign policy objectives is the primary explanation for the actions of its energy firms few would disagree in principle that the elimination of subsidies to posts oviet countries is sound business decision even if questions ve been raised about the timing of such moves in support of their actions russian leaders point to the fact that russian

cen tral and eastern europe are concerned that russia may use their energy dependency to interfere in their domestic affairs or force them to make foreign policy concessions gazproms recent increases in energy prices to georgia and ukraine came after elections brought to power pro western leaders in what were termed respectively the rose and orange revolutions in reference to their campaign symbols analysts have asserted that russian leaders feared socalled color revolutions elsewhere in the former soviet countries that could reduce russias influe nce and even perhaps threaten russias own increasingly authoritarian regime c ountries of the region also fear that by controlling energy infrastructure in their c ountries russia is able to manipulate the internal political situation by favoring certain local businessmen with participation in local business ventures of gazprom or other russian energy firms these businessmen are in position to assume powerful political role themselves or bribe politicians to do moscows bidding12 critics of russian policy say moscows motives become even clearer when viewed in the context of other actions to apply pressure to neighboring states for example moldovas economy has been riously harmed by wine import ban russia has imposed ostensibly for health reasons georgia has been hurt by russian immigration restrictions and wine ban bo th countries have also faced problems with russian support for breakaway regi ons on their territories nato and eu member estonia suffered reduction in transit traffic from russia as well as cyberattacks that may have been instigated by russia in the wake of controversy over the removal of sovietera military statue from estonias capital in april 2007 while moscow is often charged with using energy policy to pursue foreign policy goals it may also at times use foreign policy issues to benefit its energy firms in january 2008 the russian natural gas monopoly gazprom reached an agreement with serbia to buy nis the serbian national oil company at what some observers believed to be belowmarket price ga zprom may have been able to achieve this in part due to serbian prime minist er vojislav

natural gas reserv of its own ukraine is dependent upon russia for most of its il and natural gas both from russias own oil and natural gas fields and from ru ssiancontrolled pipelines from ukraines suppliers in central asia especially ga s from turkmenistan in 2004 these imports account for 80 of ukraines oil consumption and 78 of its natural gas consumption natural gas accounts for lf of ukraines energy usage most ukrainian homes are heated by natural gas ukraines steel and other heavy industries which play key role in ukrain exports are highly inefficient users of energy however ukraines vulnerability to russian pressure has been mitigated by the fact that the main oil and natural gas pipelines to central and western europe transit its territory ukraine owns the sections of the pipelines that run through its territory as well as large gas storage fac ilities ukraine has received transit fees from gazprom paid partly in gas and partly in cash seventyeight percent of russias gas exports pass through ukraine13 energy issues have played key role in russianukrainian relations since the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 russi an firms supplied energy to ukraine at prices far below market rates in the early 1990s these firms cut off supplies to ukraine at times due to unpaid energy debt s energy sales ve been conducted by nontransparent intermediary institutions offering the elites of both countries opportunities to profit until recently ukrainian foreign policy tried to strike balance between improving ties with the west including nominal support for euroatlantic integration while not offending mosc ow however in early 2005 viktor yushchenko was elected president of ukra ine overcoming the previous regimes attempts at electoral fraud in what was termed the orange revolution russian leaders who had strongly backed his opponent prime minister viktor yanukovych reacted angrily to yushchenkos victory yushchenko ukraines first clearly pro western

russias cutoff of natural gas to ukraine context and implications by bernard gelb jim nichol and steven woehrelgazprom resumed gas deliveries on janua ry 2 two days later the russian government and gazprom reached an agr eement with ukraine for ensuring gas supplies to ukraine the agreement called for gas to be purchased by ukraine through an intermediary firm rosukrenerg this firm pays for gas from central asia at price lower than market levels and adds gas from russia at market prices and provides it to ukraine at an average price of 95 per tcm the agreement also provides for higher transit fee payments to ukraine now entirely in cash rather than partly in gas perhaps more troubling for ukraine the accord called for the creation of ukrgazenergo joint venture between rosukrenergo and the ukrainian state controlled gas firm naftogaz that grants the former access to onehalf of ukraines domestic market ukraines intelligence service reportedly believes the owners of rosukrenergo are using their control over energy supplies to secure ownership of energy intensive industries such as fertilizer plants and titanium plant14 naftogaz has teetered on the verge of bankruptcy in part because ukrgazenergo has been allocated more solvent customers in the industrial sector while naftogaz has been left mainly with less welloff residential consumers some analysts are concerned about po ssible involvement of organized crime groups in rosukrenergo as well as corrupt links with russian and ukrainian officials the us justice department has reportedly investigated the firm15 nominally gazprom owns 50 of rosukr energo ukrainian businessman dimitry firtash owns 45 and another ukrainian businessman owns 5 in 2005 ukranian prime minister yuliya tymoshenko who was an important player in the natural gas industry in the 1990s called for the elimina tion of rosukrenergo as middleman she was dismissed by yu shchenko in september 2005 in move that some observers believed was aimed in part at appeasing ga zprom and its supporters within the ukrainian government yanukovychs party won ukraines marc h 2006 parliamentary elections and yanukovych once again become prime minist er gazproms discussions with the yanukovych government in late 2006 went more smoothly than those of the previous year in 2007 russia and ukraine agreed on moderate increase in the natural gas price the two sides agreed to gradually increase the price of russian natural gas to ukraine over the next five years until it reaches the world market price some observers have seen gazproms toug h attitude toward ukraine in the 2005 negotiations and its relatively benign st ance in 2006 as evidence that russia has manipulated the gas issue to undermin yushchenko in september 2007

ukraine if ukraine did not pay outstanding debts to gazprom by the nd of the month gazprom officials hinted that ukraines energy debts could be solved if it turned over shares in the gas pipeline system to gazprom as payment however the crisis was resolved when the ukrainian government agreed to provide gas in ukrainian storage facilities as payment gazprom and the outgoing yanukovych

ukrgazenergo from ukraines gas market in january 2008 prime minister tymoshenko took first step in this direc tion by sharply reducing the amount of gas ukrgazenergo can sell to ukrainian consumers the role of middlemen in the ukrainian gas market may also be reduced by market forces rosukrenergos profits are based on selling cheap central asian gas at higher prices to ukraine in march 2008

reached agreement on march 5 and supplies were re stored on march 12 the two sides agreed to eliminate ukrgazenergo from the domestic gas trade but gave gazprom direct access to the most lucrative part of ukraines domestic market supplies to large enterprises the agreement said the fate of rosukrenergo would be determined by future negotiations however tymoshe nko appeared dissatisfied with parts of the accord she remains determined to eliminat rosukrenergo as soon as possible the ukrainian government made significant unilateral changes to the agreement including barring rosukrenergo from the pr ofitable practice of reexporting central asian gas from ukraine to other markets gazprom has said that ukraine will have to pay european prices for its gas in 2009 as result of gazproms agreement with central asian c ountries to pay full price for their supplies this would cause the price ukraine pays for gas to more than double next year dealing heavy shoc k to ukraines economy

mazeikiai includes large refinery the butinge maritime terminal and pipeline it is the larges t enterprise in lithuania accounting for about 10 of lithuanias gdp nd provides vitallyneeded ta x revenue in 1999 the us firm williams international bought large stake in mazeikiai and also received the operating rights in response the russian oil firm lukoil which supplied the oil to the refinery slowed deliveries to trickle making mazeikiai unpr ofitable this led williams which had fina ncial problems of its own to sell its stake to yukos in 2002 under yukos the refinery became profitabl again however when yukos later fell afoul of russian author ities and was driven into bankruptcy yukos attempted to sell its stake in mazeikiai the polish oil firm pkn orlen agreed to buy out yukos despite an effort by the russian governmentcontrolled oil company rosneft to purchase the refinery at the end of july 2006 the russian governmentowned oil transport company transneft announced that the part of the druzhba oil pipeline that supplies mazeikiai was temporarily shutting down for repairs following an oil leak transneft later said that it would not re open the pipeline due to its unprofitability transneft has blocked lithua nias efforts to secure supplies from kazakhstan through transnefts pipelines critics charged that once again russia was manipulating energy supplies to punish lithuania for seek ing to diversify ownership in its energy sector21 another example of russian company using its control over energy supplies in an effort to strongarm baltic c ountry into handing over key infrastructure occurred in january 2003 the russiangovern ment controlled tran sneft oil pipeline company cut off all oil shipments to the latvian oil terminal at the port of ventspils after having decreased shipments in late 2002 the move was large blow to latvia as ventspils has been important to latvia s economy transneft diverted the oil shipments to its own baltic pipeline system and the russian port of primorsk which it controls transneft claims that there is demand for using ventspils claim viewed with skepticism by outside observers most saw the move as power play by transneft to secure controlling share of the firm ventspils nafta which operates the oil terminal22 estonia has also felt the effects of russi an pressure on its energy supply on may 2

in addition to receiving cheap natural gas belarus has also benefitted from inexpensive and dutyfree cr ude oil supplies that are processed at belarusian refineries belarus then sold the bulk of these refined products to eu countries at hefty profit in janua ry 2007 russia moved to sharply reduce this subsidy to the belarusian economy russia imposed tariff on oil exports to belarus belarus retaliated by increasing transit fees for russian oil supplies to western europe when russia refused to pay belarus cut off oil supplies to western european countries ange ring their governments belarus and russia ended the crisis by agreeing that belarus would raise its export duty on crude and refi ned oil products to western europe to match that imposed by russia russia would then exempt belarus from most of the new russian oil export duty perhaps most significantly belarus agreed to hand over to russia 70 of the proceeds that it receive s from its exports of refined oil products to the western market this figure will be gradually increased to 85 in 2009 the drop in s upport from moscow has caused lukashenko to cut some government spending and to look to western banks for loans24

oil and natural gas fields as current ones decline over the next decade this may provide an opening for the united states and other countries to persua russia to liberalize its energy sector russias current control of central asian supplies has allowed it to postpone the massive investments needed to exploit remote areas of its own territory such as eastern siberia the arctic and the far east however this may change due to increasing worldwide demand for energy and the diversification of export routes by central asian countries on the other nd the current statist system has provided
