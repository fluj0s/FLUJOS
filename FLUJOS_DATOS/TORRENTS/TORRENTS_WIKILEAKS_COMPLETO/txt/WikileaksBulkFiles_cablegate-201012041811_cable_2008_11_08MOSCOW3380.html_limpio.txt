oil traders pipeline exports to europe still opaque seaborne trade more commercial ref moscow 2880 b moscow 2632 classified by econ mc eric t schultz for reasons 14 bd summary 1 c the oil trading business in russia has long been opaque benefiting politically connected firms such as the secretive oil trading firm gunvor contacts tell us however that the business has lately become more transparent because seaborne trade is now largely conducted via commercial tenders and terms they caution however that pipeline exports to europe remain problematic xxxxxxxxxxx for instance told us he believes the recent supply reduction to the czech republic ref was politically coordinated to the extent that shift toward greater transparency has taken hold it is another example of the role of international commerce and finance in forcing russian businesses to behave commercially end summary russian oil trading opaque 2 sbu oil traders at major western companies explained to us recently that the market for physical oil trades is very developed globally and has two segments one is comprised of major international oil companies who trade oil largely to optimize their own global operations to ensure the right amounts of oil are transferred to the right facilities at the lowest cost the other is comprised of companies such as glencore vitol and others who serve as intermediaries simply trying to make money buying and selling oil using their marketing shipping or risk tolerance advantage 3 c according to these experts oil trading in russia has had reputation for secretive deals involving intermediary companies with unknown owners and beneficiaries oil exports from stateowned or stateinfluenced oil companies have reportedly been funneled through favored oil traders potentially yielding billions of dollars of profits for these companies of particular note in the russian oil trading business is the swiss firm gunvor the company is rumored to be one of putins sources of undisclosed wealth and is owned by gennady timchenko who is rumored to be former kgb colleague of putins 4 c xxxxxxxxxxx estimates that gunvor may control up to 50 of total russian oil exports he and his lawyer told us recently that it is impossible to know the extent of gunvors penetration of the market however because the companies involved refuse to disclose this information note gunvor claims in its glossy but uninformative brochure that it handles third of russias seaborne oil exports end note as xxxxxxxxxxx has discovered verifiable information on the volumes and terms of oil trades is very difficult to come by but becoming more commercial 5 c managers at two western oil companies however explained to us recently that oil trading in russia has taken welcome turn toward greater transparency thanks to open tenders for seaborne exports xxxxxxxxxxx told us in recent meeting that oil trading via russian seaports is now in his view completely commercial xxxxxxxxxxx explained that during the last year and especially since medvedevs inauguration there has been deliberate and successful push by the state to ensure transparency and commercial terms for most of the oil exported from russia via ports 6 cxxxxxxxxxxx claimed his view is not just conjecture he said it comes directly from hard numbers and evidence that he sees from his participation in tenders by rosneft lukoil and other major russian oil companies he said that while moscow 00003380 002 of 003 gunvor rose based on the administrative support of the gor the government came to realize it could longer promote gunvor at the expense of for example stateowned rosneft and gazpromneft xxxxxxxxxxx said he believes the trend toward greater transparency in seaborne exports will continue xxxxxxxxxxx 7 c xxxxxxxxxxx painted similar picture of oil trading in russia calling seaborne trade open and transparent he added that domestic trading while depending on middlemen is now also largely commercial xxxxxxxxxxx told us the russian oil trading market is among the most difficult in the world but that it also offers good opportunities and that xxxxxxxxxxx has built healthy business here he said he has seen great changes in the 1 12 years he has been in his current job and suggested that much of the change has come as result of the governments push for greater transparency in the economy as whole he added that he believes this push has largely been driven by the financing needs of the stateowned companies 8 c xxxxxxxxxxx was less impressed by the degree of transparency in the business even for seaborne oil exports he told us recently that while there are more open tenders and more participants for seaborne exports the same firms seem to often win he suggested that favored firms may get inside information and second chance to bid xxxxxxxxxxx agreed however that there has been trend toward greater transparency but cautioned that it is far from an open and commercial market he highlighted rosneft as company that has evolved toward greater transparency and surgutneftegaz another reported source of putins illicit wealth as company that has not pipeline exports to europe still problem 9 c all three company representatives noted however that the trend toward greater transparency stops with seaborne trade they all said russian oil exports to europe through pipelines especially through the southern druzhba pipeline is still very opaque business xxxxxxxxxxx said pipeline exports in general are inherently more political than exports from ports and that the trade through southern druzhba is so opaque that one knows who is getting what xxxxxxxxxxx said many in the business wonder what goes on between buyers and sellers along that route 10 c as an example xxxxxxxxxxx specifically cited the recent oil supply reductions from russia to the czech republic ref he said that despite claims by officials that middlemen were the problem he did not believe that to be the case he said producers generally offer their oil using formulas that include some premium on top of base price depending on the export market he explained that just prior to the supply reduction to the czech republic where shell has stake in refinery all producers demanded the exact same premium 125 per barrel which he said was 4 to 5 times the previous figure for that route he believed this price increase was coordinated and resulted in the rerouting of oil exports away from the czech republic 11 c xxxxxxxxxxx said that in the case of the czech republic the refineries involved had access to other supplies but that there was indeed an additional cost associated with obtaining alternate supplies he said similar demands for higher premiums have occurred with regard to deliveries to german refinery partly owned by shell but that the refinery had more limited access to alternatives in such cases xxxxxxxxxxx explained managers have to decide whether to run refineries at suboptimal levels or pay the higher costs 12 c xxxxxxxxxxx also noted that oil exports to hungary by transneft decree must go through certain intermediary gunvor which adds one dollar to each barrel he said in competitive market by contrast an oil trader might add anywhere from five to 20 cents maximum to the price of barrel of oil comment moscow 00003380 003 of 003 13 c oil traders play an important role in the market helping provide liquidity and optimizing the operations of oil refiners and producers however while it appears that the gor has realized that the more transparent and commercial the trading business the better it is for russias oil sector it unfortunately has not decided to apply this realization uniformly greed corruption and geopolitical concerns still trump efficiency especially with regard to certain export routes to europe and with regard to certain connected oil traders such as gunvor end comment beyrle
