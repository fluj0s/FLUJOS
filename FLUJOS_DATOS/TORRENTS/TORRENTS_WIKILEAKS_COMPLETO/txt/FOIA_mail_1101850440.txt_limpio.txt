from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to martin todd mtoddgeoguclacuk subject re nerc application date tue nov 30 163400 2004 martin in response to nadias message and our talk consider the following as regards title and objectives title the precedence of ecological responses to 20th century climate changes in arctic lakes and trees suggested objectives we will quantify how the changes in 20th century arctic climate including mean and variability are reflected in recent and past lake sediment records we will determine the response of lake ecosystem parameters and the relationships with specific climatic controls we will define the character of variability in different natural archives contained in dated sediments reaching back over 2000 years we will generate wellcalibrated highresolution decadal to centennial time scales estimates of past summer climate variability over this time in western arctic siberia we will compare the lake sediment data with evidence of treegrowth and associated summer climate changes based on selected updating of an extensive existing network of chronologies including long subfossil series extending back more than 4000 years in yamal and taimyr these data with perfect interannual dating accuracy will be reprocessed to provide summer temperatures specifically representative of annual decadal and centennial timescales we will determine for the first time the extent to which the independent proxybased summer climate histories concur or disagree and explore the extent to which they demonstrate the precedence of recent 20th century climate trends in multimillennial context by comparing this evidence with the output of stateoftheart gcm experiments simulating climate changes in the arctic over the last 500 to 1000 years we will explore the degree to which recent changes in arctic lakes and treegrowth rates are attributable to anthropogenic as opposed to natural climate changes at 1355 30112004 you wrote hi keith the submission deadline for the nerc grant with viv jones is imminent shes getting in bit of panic i wonder whether you have some text already prepared to describe the details of the echog experiments i could get the information but will have to dig in the lierature i was hpoing you would have summary paragraph from the sop documantaton similar to the one we have written about the hadcm3 exp thnaks martin martin todd university lecturer department of geography ucl university college london 26 bedford way london wc1 8hr email mtoddgeoguclacuk professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 1httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa references 1 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa
