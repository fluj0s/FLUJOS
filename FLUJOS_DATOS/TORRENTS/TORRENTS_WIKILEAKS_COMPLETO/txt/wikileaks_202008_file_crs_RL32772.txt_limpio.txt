procedures in the 109th congress on the first day of the 109th congress the house agreed to hres 5 which made several rules changes affecting floor proceedings following wellestablished practice hres 5 provided for the rules of the previous congress to be the rules of the new congress but with set of amendments five substantive changes to the standing rules of the house will affect the transaction of business on the floor in the 109th congress sixth change created new procedures to determine quorum in the house in the case of catastrophic event1 rules changes affecting regular floor procedure motion to send bills to conference hres 5 amends clause 2a of rule xi to facilitate the process for sending bill to conference committee under the new subparagraph committee can change its rules to grant its chair the general authority to make the motion necessary to send bill to conference before the rules change committee could not grant the chair blanket authority to make the motion to go to conference for all measures reported by the committee instead it was necessary for committee usually at the end of markup when measure was ordered reported to move that the chair be authorized to offer such motions as may be necessary to secure conference with the senate on the specified measure in order to send bill to conference the house must agree either to motion to disagree to senate amendments and request or agree to conference or motion to insist on house amendments and request or agree to conference house rule xxii clause 1 states that these motions are only privileged if offered by direction of the committees of jurisdiction2 if chair does not have this authority from the committee then to go to conference the chair must secure either unanimous consent 1 the resolution agreed to by the house hres 5 also changed the rules affecting the house committee system these changes including the creation of permanent committee on homeland security are identified in crs report rs22018 committee system rules changes in the house 109th congress by judy schneider changes affecting the congressional budget process are discussed in crs report rs22021 house rules changes affecting the congressional budget process in the 109th congress h res 5 by bill heniff jr changes to the rules of conduct and the procedures of the committee on standards of official conduct are described in crs report rs22034 house ethics rules changes for the 109th congress by mildred amer the resolution also made technical and grammatical changes to the house rules that are not described in this report 2 the motion is privileged at the discretion of the speaker if offered by direction of the primary committee and of all reporting committees that had initial referral of the proposition house rule xxii clause 1 crs2 on the house floor or the house must adopt special rule reported by the committee on rules suspension of the rules on wednesdays hres 5 amended house rule xv clause 1a to allow the speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules on wednesdays 3 previously house rules only granted this authority to the speaker on mondays and tuesdays4 this change codified the increasingly common practice of adding certain wednesdays as suspension days in the 108th and several preceding congresses wednesday was added as suspension day on an ad hoc basis by unanimous consent special rule or standing order5 entertaining motions to suspend the rules on wednesdays has helped the house to better manage the growing number of measures considered under suspension procedures in the 108th congress 924 measures were brought up under suspension compared to 685 measures brought up under suspension in the 107th congress6 furthermore in recent congresses fewer motions to suspend the rules have been entertained on mondays this practice may reflect broader trends in how the house schedules legislative business7 repeal of the corrections calendar hres 5 amended the house rules in several places to remove all mention of the corrections calendar procedural device created in the 104th congress to expedite the consideration of legislation that corrected or eliminated ambiguous laws and regulations under the former procedures that were described in clause 6 of rule xv the speaker could place measures reported by committees on the corrections calendar the measures could be called up for consideration on the second and fourth tuesdays of each month debate on bills called from the corrections calendar was limited to 3 for more information on suspension of the rules see crs report rl32474 suspension of the rules in the house of representatives by thomas p carr 4 according to the rule the speaker may also entertain motions to suspend the rules during the last six days of session in contemporary practice however it is difficult to know when the last six days of session begin adjournment resolutions usually are not approved until very shortly before the adjournment takes place the house sometimes agrees to special rules near the end of session that make motions to suspend the rules privileged for the remainder of the session 5 at the start of the 108th congress the house agreed to standing order that allowed the speaker to entertain motions to suspend the rules on wednesdays through apr 9 2003 on apr 30 2003 the house agreed by unanimous consent to continue to grant this authority to the speaker through june 25 2003 congressional record daily edition apr 30 2003 p h3532 on june 26 2003 the house agreed to resolution hres 297 stating that the speaker could entertain motions to suspend the rules on wednesdays for the remainder of the 108th congress 6 crs report 97901 suspension of the rules in the house measure sponsorship by party by thomas p carr 7 for more information on the house schedule see crs report rl30825 house schedule recent practices and proposed options by richard s beth crs3 one hour8 the only amendments in order were those authorized by the primary committee of jurisdiction or those offered by the chair or designee one motion to recommit with or without amendatory instructions was also in order passage of measures called from the corrections calendar required threefifths vote the procedure was used with some frequency during the 104th congress but its use declined markedly in succeeding congresses twentyone bills were considered from the corrections calendar in the 104th congress but in the three subsequent congresses 105th107th total of eight bills were considered using the procedure bills were considered from the corrections calendar in the 108th congress house leaders concluded that the purpose of the corrections calendar could be more easily achieved through the use of other procedures for the consideration of legislation such as unanimous consent or suspension of the rules9 reference to the senate in debate hres 5 amends rule xvii clause 1b to allow references to the senate and senators during debate while directing members as always to keep remarks relevant to the subject under debate and to avoid personality hres 5 strikes the paragraphs in the rule that described the kinds of senate references that were previously allowed according to house leaders the change will expand the permissible references to the senate but still maintain the traditions of dignity and decorum in proceedings10 the speaker will continue to call members to order who violate this house rule for almost 200 years the house strictly interpreted british parliamentary custom and did not allow members of the house to refer in debate to senate actions or senators or to the senate at all except in general neutral and factual way11 one reason behind the prohibition was the principle that two chambers of bicameral legislature should make decisions independently of each other without referring to arguments made in the other body the other reason was that the prohibition would minimize disputes or misunderstandings between the chambers12 in the late 1980s the house loosened the prohibition against references to the senate that had been established by precedent13 1987 amendment to house rules 8 under the rule the previous question was ordered automatically on the bill and any amendments after one hour of debate 9 congressional record daily

actions if they were matter of public record and to refer to the sponsorship or status of bills resolutions and amendments in the senate in 1989 the house further expanded permissible references to allow members to provide factual descriptions of senate action or inaction on measure before the house and to quote senate proceedings relevant to the creation of legislative history establishing the meaning of measure before the house house rules however still prohibited characterizations of senate action or inaction and references to individual senators quotations from senate proceedings that would not be relevant to the legislative history of measure then under debate were also prohibited authority to postpone and cluster votes since 1979 house rules have granted the speaker the authority to postpone certain electronic votes clause 8 of rule xx allows the speaker to schedule votes on some questions at convenient time within the next two legislative days postponing votes on questions so that series of electronic votes can be taken backtoback is generally considered to be convenient for all members the rule furthermore allows the speaker to shorten the length of electronic votes if several votes are postponed then after the first vote is held open for the minimum 15 minutes required by house rules the speaker can reduce the time for all subsequent votes to 5 minutes each since the adoption of the original rule allowing the speaker to postpone certain votes the house has amended the rule several times to include votes on additional questions14 this most recent revision adds three questions to the list of questions that can be postponed agreeing to motion to reconsider agreeing to motion to lay on the table motion to reconsider and agreeing to an amendment reported from the committee of the whole the three questions added to the list of votes that can be postponed are rarely settled by recorded vote and therefore the speaker will have few opportunities to postpone them one motion to reconsider the vote on final passage of the bill and in fact on most questions decided in the house can be made by member on the 13 continued daily edition jan 3 1989 p h7 14 the original rule included only the question of passing bills or resolutions or agreeing to conference reports in the 97th congress the house added the question of agreeing to motion to suspend the rules and on ordering the previous question on special rules in the 98th congress the rule was changed to allow the speaker to schedule vote on the question of agreeing to the speakers approval of the journal later in the legislative day in the 101st congress the question of agreeing to motion to instruct house conferees if they failed to report was added and in the 106th congress the house added the question of agreeing to an initial motion to instruct conferees in the 104th congress the house expanded the list to include vote ordering the previous question on all the questions that are susceptible of postponement house manual sec 1030 p 808 crs5 prevailing side of the question15 the motion is rarely made instead it is routinely laid on the table without objection the house also does not often vote electronically on amendments reported from the committee of the whole most major measures are considered in the committee of the whole and most amendments are offered debated and voted on in the committee of the whole16 since the committee of the whole is technically committee of the house any amendments that are agreed to are reported to the full house and since only the house has the authority to actually amend the bill the amendments must be voted on again generally all amendments agreed to in the committee of the whole are agreed to bloc by voice vote after the committee of the whole reports to the house member could however demand separate vote on any amendment voting second time on all the amendments could potentially be timeconsuming the rules change will allow the speaker to schedule electronic votes on these amendments if demanded at later time in the legislative schedule quorum in the case of catastrophic circumstances article i section 5 clause 1 of the constitution states that majority of each house shall constitute quorum to do business quorum has long been defined as majority of the whole number of the house and the whole number of the house has long been viewed as the number of members elected sworn and living whenever the death resignation disqualification or expulsion of member results in vacancy the whole number of the house is adjusted17 in the event of catastrophe however it may not be immediately known whether member is alive or dead thereby making it impossible to adjust the whole number of members furthermore if member is incapacitated but living or unharmed but unable to attend the proceedings of the house he or she would still count toward the whole number used to determine quorum missing injured and stranded members are still elected sworn and living if many such members are affected and the congress needs to act this situation could prove problematic because it may be impossible to establish quorum 15 house rule xix clause 3 provides the opportunity to offer the motion to reconsider the motion can only be made in the house not in the committee of the whole furthermore it is only in order the same day as the vote or on the day after the vote for more information see house manual sec 1003 pp 783788 and crs report rl32207 commonly used motions and requests in the house of representatives by betsy palmer 16 for more information on the amending process in the house of representatives including discussion of the process after the committee of the whole rises and reports see crs report 98995 the amending process in the house of representatives by christopher m davis and stanley bach 17 this longstanding practice was codified in house rule xx clause 5c in the 108th congress hres 5 of the 109th congress also amended the rules to include the long standing definition of whole number of the house the number of representatives chosen sworn and living whose membership in the house has not been terminated by resignation or action of the house crs6 in order to address this issue the house modified clause 5 of rule xx to prepare for catastrophic event that leaves large number of members missing incapacitated or incapable of attending the proceedings of the house the addition to the rule establishes method for establishing provisional quorum in the case of catastrophic event this new method does not provide new means for determining the whole number of the house on the contrary it is method to be used provisionally until quorum can be constituted by majority of the whole number of the house under the new rule if the house is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstance then quorum shall be majority of the provisional number of the house steps required to establish the house is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstance the rule requires four steps to be taken in order and without intervening adjournment to establish that the house is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstances only after the steps described below are taken will quorum be determined based on the provisional number of the house majority of members present may terminate the proceedings by adopting the motion to adjourn first dispose of motion to compel the attendance of absent members if the absence of quorum is demonstrated18 then under house rule dating back to 1789 member can make motion to compel the attendance of absent members this motion described in house rule xx clause 5a must first be disposed of either favorably or unfavorably before any other steps are taken to establish that the house is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstances19 the motion to compel the attendance of absent members requires majority vote for adoption and that majority must comprise at least 15 members20 if the motion is adopted then the call of the house occurs through members presenting themselves perhaps after receiving notification from the sergeantatarms and having their presence recorded by the clerk21 if the motion is not adopted either because it failed to garner support from majority of members present or because the majority supporting it is fewer than 15 members then the motion is still 18 the failure of the house to comply with the constitutional quorum requirement is demonstrated if majority of the whole number of the house does not respond to quorum call or call of the house or do not participate in record vote for more information see crs report 98988 voting and quorum procedures in the house of representatives by stanley bach 19 sectionbysection summary of h res 5 adopting house rules for the 109th congress congressional record daily edition jan 4 2005 p h13 20 this motion is in order even if the absence of quorum has been demonstrated article i section 5 clause 1 of the constitution states that in the absence of quorum smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members in such manner and under such penalties as each house may provide 21 under the modern practice the call to compel attendance of absent members rarely occurs but for an example of proceedings see congressional record daily edition nov 2 1987 p h9459 crs7 considered disposed of and the other steps necessary to establish that the house is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstances can occur second conduct 72hour call of the house that does not produce quorum after disposing of the motion to compel the attendance of absent members the house must have call or series of calls of the house over period of 72 hours excluding time spent in recess22 the call could be the one that was ordered by adoption of the motion to compel the attendance of absent members the speaker23 could also entertain motion for call of the house under clause 7b of rule xx however ordered if the call failed to produce quorum based on the existing whole number of the house after 72 hours then the call could be closed and additional steps to establish that the house is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstances could be taken third the speaker must receive catastrophic quorum failure report and announce its contents to the house after the call of the house is closed the speaker with the majority and minority leader can then receive from the sergeantatarms or his designee catastrophic quorum failure report that states the house cannot establish quorum because of catastrophic circumstances such as an attack or natural disaster according to the rule catastrophic quorum failure report must contain the number of known vacancies list of former representatives whose seats are vacant this list would include any known dead representatives as well as any representatives who resigned or who were removed by action of the house if their seats had not yet been filled list of representatives considered incapacitated list of representatives not incapacitated but still incapable of attending the proceedings of the house and list of representatives not accounted for the sergeantatarms is directed by the new rule to prepare the report in consultation with the attending physician to the congress or his designee the clerk of the house or his designee and public health and law enforcement officials the speaker after consultation with the two party leaders is required to announce the content of the report to the house this announcement is not subject to appeal 22 under some conditions house rules grant the speaker the authority to declare recess clause 12b of rule i states to suspend the business of the house when notified of an imminent threat to its safety the speaker may declare an emergency recess subject to the call of the chair clause 12 also authorizes the speaker to declare recess when question is pending before the house 23 in catastrophic circumstances the person exercising the authorities of the office of speaker might not be an elected speaker or speaker pro tempore he or she might be speaker pro tempore appointed under clause 8a or clause 8b1 of rule i or acting under clause 8b3 of rule i crs8 fourth conduct 24hour call of the house that does not produce quorum even after the speakers announcement the house is not considered to be without quorum due to catastrophic circumstances until the completion of second extended call of the house this call of the house can be ordered under the procedures described in clause 5a of rule xx or by motion for the call under clause 7b this second call of the house or series of calls could be closed after 24 hours excluding the time spent in recess if it did not produce majority of the whole number of the house the provisional number of the house if all four of these steps are completed then the house has established that it is without quorum due to catastrophic circumstances quorum for conducting business can then be determined based on the provisional number of the house the number of members who respond to the 24hour call of the house will be the provisional number of the house and majority of the provisional number will constitute quorum for doing business if members arrive after the call of the house the provisional number is increased accordingly if any member counted under the 24hour call of the house to determine the provisional number later ceases to be representative due to death resignation or action by the house then the provisional number of the house would also be reduced accordingly24 the catastrophic quorum failure report must be updated each legislative day in other words it must be updated each time the house reconvenes after an adjournment the speaker is required to make these updates available to the house if at any time sufficient number of members arrive to constitute quorum of the whole number of the house then the provisional number would longer be in effect constitutionality of the provisional quorum some members expressed concern that the catastrophic quorum rule was unconstitutional when hres 5 was called up for consideration representative made constitutional point of order the speaker declined to entertain the constitutional point of order citing numerous earlier precedents barring the speaker from ruling on the constitutionality of pending proposal25 instead typically the house determines for itself the constitutionality of proposition either by voting to consider it or voting to adopt it the representative then raised the question of consideration and the house by vote of 224192 agreed to consider hres 5 and the provisions in it dealing with the new quorum procedure thereafter hres 5 was agreed to by vote of 220195 whether an attempt will be made to challenge in court the constitutionality of the rule 24 according to the new rule if the house is conducting business with provisional quorum then it cannot expel representative who is not incapacitated but is otherwise incapable of attending the proceedings of the house rule xx clause 5c6 25 congressional record daily edition jan 4 2005 p h10 the speaker cited the numerous precedents in house manual sec 628 p 341 and specifically asher c hinds hinds precedents of the house of representatives of the united states washington gpo 1907 vol ii sec 1255 pp 805807 and secs 13181320 pp 873874 crs9 is not yet certain neither is it certain that member has legal standing to bring such suit without the new quorum rule ever having been implemented26 26 for more information on the issue of catastrophic loss of members of congress see crs report
