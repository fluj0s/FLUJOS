14 b d c key points the amir of qatar urged the us in his february 14 meeting with senator john kerry dma to do everything in its power to find lasting solution to the israelipalestinian conflict the amir said the best way to begin is by moving first on the syrian track in qatars view now is the time to reach out to damascus the syrian government can help arab extremists make tough choices but only if the us whose involvement is essential demonstrates to syria early on willingness to address the return of the golan heights and supports turkeys mediation efforts between israel and syria according to the amir hamas will accept the 1967 border with israel but will not say it publicly so as to lose popular palestinian support the egyptians goal according to the amir is to stay in the game and maintain their relationship with the us which is built around brokering regional peace for as long as possible the amir recommended that the us and qatar establish small bilateral committee to discuss how to advance regional peace qatar can help move hamas because qatar does not play in their internal politics that does not mean qatar shares hamas ideology stressed the amir on iran the amir said president ahmadinejad is strong because he is uncorrupted the amir also advised the us to continue ts efforts to open dialogue with the iranian ladership end key points 1 c senator joh kerry dma the chairman of the senate foreig relations committeesfrc joined by ambassadorpe chief and sfrc staff member dr jonah blank met february 14 with the amir of qatar hamad bn khalifa thani the meeting took place at waba palace the residence of the amir and the amir began the meeting by pointing out that the comfortable chairs on which the us party was seated were made in syria importance of the syrian track 2 c this opening led senator kerry to remark that he had held great discussions with syrias president bashar alasad when he met him in damascus some months ago the amir said president asad is committed to big change but lebanese prime minister hariris death and complications resulting from syrias alleged involvement in it had brought about complications for asad the amir added that bashar is still young and can grow 3 c senator kerry said he took away from his visit to damascus that asad wants change the amir added that the syrian president also wants peace with israel and that the arrival of us ambassador in damascus would help in this regard senator kerry said he had wanted us ambassador in syria year ago but agreed that the naming of an ambassador is positive development 4 c the amir cautioned that the syrians will not accept everything the us proposes stressing that the israeli occupation of the golan heights continues and that the return of this land to syria is paramount for damascus the amir observed that the syrians have lost confidence in the us and that the israelis now have the upper hand in the region because of the support of the united states the israeli leaders need to represent the people of israel who themselves do not trust arabs the amir said this is understandable and we cant blame them because the israelis have been under threat for long time 5 c what has changed continued the amir is that arabs for sure now want two states israel and palestine when you consider that many in the region perceive that hizballah drove israel out of lebanon and hamas kicked them at least initially out of the small piece of land called gaza it is actually surprising that the israelis still want peace the region however is still far away from peace concluded the amir 6 c senator kerry responded that in his long experience with the region it was not unusual for people to take positions adverse to their own interests yasser arafat went from living as terrorist in tunisia to signing an agreement with israel on the white house lawn the transformation of arafat is an example of how actors in the region need to take risks if we are to move forward in advancing regional peace turning the conversation back to syria chairman kerry pointed out that syrias facilitation of arms to hizballah and its turning blind eye to missile upgrades in lebanon do not represent risktaking in the promotion of peace 7 c the amir pointed out that any progress toward regional peace had come about due to american involvement he implied that it would take us intervention on the syrianisraeli track to address these issues and asked senator kerry what he would have damascus do 8 c the chairman responded that president asad needs to make bolder move and take risks he observed that if the syrian president wants peace and economic development for his country he needs to be more statesmanlike which would in turn help israeli prime minister netanyahu engage him 9 c the amir agreed with senator kerrys assessment of asads aims and said he is ready for peace but asked if the israelis are ready would israel accept to resume turkeys mediation between syria and israel would the us play role in advancing the syria track 10 c if we can get abu mazen back to the negotiating table we can engage on border issues including israels borders with syria advised senator kerry abu mazen right now is not strong enough though to make necessary compromises with israel because the palestinian people have wanted him to stick to his guns on settlement freeze and the goldstone report the chairman added that netanyahu also needs to compromise and work the return of the golan heights into formula for peace 11 c the amir encouraged the us to work the golan heights issue first he stressed that syrians are very different from iranians in mentality and said the syrians turned to iran for support only because they had nowhere else to go now is the time the amir told senator kerry to reach out to damascus parameters for discussion 12 c senator kerry responded that the us is prepared to play strong role in bringing about peace in the region president obama said the chairman understands that he personally must engage and do so strongly the senator told the amir that in his speech to the usislamic forum the previous evening the senator had focused on former president clintons parameters for peace and the 2002 arab league peace initiative now said the senator is the time to put those back on the table and resume talking with the us acting as legitimate agent of peace chairman kerry told the amir he is convinced that we can see great progress in the coming year by moving swiftly from proximity talks to direct talks between the parties and ending with final status discussions 13 c to be successful continued senator kerry we must begin by agreeing at the outset the amount of land each side israelis and palestinians will obtain in the end and use that understanding to draw the borders if both sides make good compromises we can address the settlement issues in the context of giving something up so that the borders when drawn contain the agreedupon amounts of land for both sides the amir agreed with the senators assessment and complimented president obama for being the first us president to take on the middle east conflict in the first year of his term 14 c continuing the presentation of his ideas on the parameters of peace between israel and the palestinians senator kerry noted that one of the biggest problems for israel is the potential return of 56 million palestinian refugees the parties broached the return issue in discussions at taba and agreed that the right of palestinian return would be subject to later negotiation pointed out the chairman if we can proceed from that point on the right of return the senator believes there is an artful way to frame the negotiations on borders land swaps and jerusalem as shared capital 15 c any negotiation has its limits added senator kerry and we know for the palestinians that control of alaqsa mosque and the establishment of some kind of capital for the palestinians in east jerusalem are not negotiable for the israelis the senator continued israels character as jewish state is not open for negotiation the nonmilitarization of an eventual palestinian state and its borders can nonetheless be resolved through negotiation 16 c the amir underscored that abu mazen needs arab support to make the above happen hamas for sure he said will accept the 1967 border but will not say it publicly so as to lose popular palestinian support dealing with the extremists 17 c senator kerry told the amir he knew qatar could help the us but asked how we deal with those who advocate violence the amir said the short answer is to work the syrian track which means pushing for israels return of the golan heights to syria the amir said return of the golan is important not just to syria but also to hizballah and iran the us must bear in mind that mishaal leader of hamas based in damascus has drawn the conclusion that the oslo accords were bad for arafat he lost the support of his own people and died living under israeli siege the syrians can help mishaal and others make tough choices but only if the us demonstrates to syria early on willingness to address the golan senator kerry responded that the us would accept legitimate discussion of the golan heights 18 c what is more said the amir the us needs to support turkeys mediation between israel and syria it is important that the us encourage israel to understand that that resolving the status of the golan heights is very important to the united states 19 c senator kerry asked the amir if hamas is under pressure given the circumstances in gaza the amir answered by saying that hamas needs iranian support he added that the biggest misconception in the region is that the syrians who host hamas leaders in damascus go to iran because they like the iranians this is wrong syria goes to those who will not shun them role of egypt 20 c returning to the pressure hamas is facing senator kerry observed that economic development in the west bank is taking place but not in gaza the palestinian reconciliation that would make possible developmental assistance in gaza has not happened the egyptians have not delivered said senator kerry 21 c the amir said the egyptians goal is to stay in the game and maintain their relationship with the us which is built around brokering middle east peace for as long as possible according to the amir fatah and hamas agreed on memorandum of understanding but the egyptians wanted it changed the amir remarked that he has feeling he knows which capital cairo is the source of reports that gaza is under pressure he said the economic pressure in gaza on families is not what it was he offered as an example that qatar charity recently offered family in gaza 500 usd but the family declined the gift saying its members had enough to get by and suggested another family that was in more dire need of assistance the amir said the notion that family would turn down money is new 22 c the amir told senator kerry that everyone knows egypt has problem with the muslim brotherhood okay we understand but egypt should not expect the world to take external actions that would help it internally 23 c asked his advice for president obama the amir recommended the establishment of small usqatar committee to discuss how to proceed qatar is close to hamas emphasized the amir because we dont play in their internal politics that does not mean we share their ideology or do not disagree with them i can remember many arguments with them hamas on the 1967 border with israel the amir noted that he had mediated with hamas previously at the us request namely when he urged hamas at the previous administrations request to participate in palestinian elections 24 c returning to the leadership of hamas senator kerry asked the amir for his insights into how the leadership with leaders sitting in both gaza and syria makes decisions the amir said the impression that mishaal sits in damascus and others take orders from him is wrong several key players within hamas are involved in decisions they have differences over policy but the bottom line is that they all want the palestinians to take their rights from israel iran 25 c senator kerry observed that the international community is moving toward imposing additional economic sanctions on iran understanding and respecting that qatar needs to balance its relationships with regional powers including iran the chairman asked the amir for his perspective on where we are going on iran 26 c the amir answered by affirming that his first obligation is to defend the interests of qatar due to the natural gas field iran shares with qatar qatar will not provoke fight with iran he added that in the history of the two countries iran has not bothered us that said the amir noted that iran is an important country in the middle east he faulted the us for making the mistake of speaking up for protesters after the disputed iranian presidential elections 27 c the iranian regime is strong continued the amir because president ahmadinejad is uncorrupted that is the secret to his success khatami is also not corrupted but as reformer he is in weak position rafsanjani on the other hand is corrupt 28 c senator kerry lamented that every communication the current administration has attempted to the government of iran has gone back channel and been met with response there have been nonus initiatives too again success the chairman observed that the iranians are scared to talk the supreme ayatollah had met with russian president putin but seems not inclined to meet with other political leaders our instinct is that we need to find way to talk to him 29 c your instinct is right replied the amir the us needs to talk directly with senior iranian officials the amir then asked what if i talk to the iranian president what would you have say 30 c senator kerry responded the us seeks serious discussion and sought to create new foundation for relationship based on irans nonconfrontational compliance with iaea requirements and other mutual interests those interests include dealing with drugrunning the taliban and illicit trade the chairman told the amir he feared that iran still thinks it is dealing with the 1953 america that tried to overthrow the iranian government 31 c the amir responded that you cannot blame them for having that attitude and senator kerry agreed adding that the us has very different posture in the postcold war world of today iran has ambitions i know this from other regional leaders said the senator these are the first words that come out of their mouths 32 c iran wants to be big power agreed the amir but what sort he reminded senator kerry the us should not forget that iranians are persian and the us needs to approach them in that framework 33 c senator kerry stressed that the us would love to have that dialogue the us respects iranian civilization talent art culture etc it is crazy to continue on this collision course the region needs schools and jobs emphasized the chairman not another war the amir agreed that demographics are big worry not just for the countries in the region but for the us too 34 c many scientific and technological transformations are underway noted the senator but iran misinterprets the road to being great power and the degree to which the international community is concerned about irans acquisition of nuclear weapons we are at fork in the road and iran must choose between confrontation or building partnerships if the latter we can open up new opportunities for cooperation in the sciences technology education robotics energy and other ongoing transformations 35 c going back to the speech he had delivered in doha the previous evening senator kerry told the amir that 17 former us secretaries of state and defense had come out in favor of eliminating nuclear weapons every stop closer to realizing that goal is sign of progress but one believes iranian nukes get us closer to that goal 36 c senator kerry reported that leaders of regional arab countries tell they want nuclear weapons if the iranians have them the amir responded that he did not believe they were serious but are saying this to put additional pressure on iran 37 c the chairman noted that the disputed iranian presidential elections may have derailed us efforts to have serious dialogue with tehran the amir agreed offering that the israelis are also using irans quest for nuclear weapons as diversion from settling matters with the palestinians the historical backdrop of arabpersian relations does not help the amir added final thoughts 38 c the amir advised the us to continue trying to open dialogue with the iranian leadership he also told senator kerry the us needs to tell the israelis they are causing the us to lose the hearts and minds of muslims there was time such as during the suez canal crisis when the arabs loved the americans and disliked the british and french he said 39 c senator kerry asked the amir how the us goes about changing its reputation the amir said first and foremost the us must do everything in its power to find lasting solution to the israelipalestinian conflict and the best way to begin is by moving first on the syrian track 40 c the chairman of the sfrc said he expects genuine effort by the president this year on an agreement and expressed his hope that iranian issues would not complicate matters the amir agreed adding that china likes the distraction for the us as its forces fight in iraq and afghanistan 41 c senator kerry concurred noting that china is lending the us money and expanding its influence at us expense he added that he ran against president george w bush saying the war with iraq was the wrong war in the wrong place and time 42 c the amir closed the meeting by offering that based on 30 years of experience with the iranians they will give you 100 words trust only one of the 100 43 u codel kerry has cleared this message lebaron
