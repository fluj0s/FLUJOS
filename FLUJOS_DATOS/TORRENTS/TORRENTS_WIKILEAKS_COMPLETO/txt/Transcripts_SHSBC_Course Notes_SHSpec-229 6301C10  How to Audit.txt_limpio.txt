6301c10 shspec229 how to audit for years we have had the problem of finding some pc who even when run on proper processes tears up the neighborhood this is the problem of the missed withhold that is all it is the biggest missed withhold you can have is the missing answer to the auditing question he didnt give you the answer he didnt put the item on the list this is such big missed withhold that if you always got it right you could virtually omit pulling missed withholds but you cant totally omit pulling missed withholds heres why among the manifestations of missed withholds are dopeoff and boiloff dopeoff and boiloff are only caused by missed withholds not by anaten contained in gpms anaten is contained in list but only acts on the pc when there is an actual nearlyfoundout in pt you have to keep the little missed withholds cleaned up because they are the ones that make the pc groggy and dopey not the missing items it is pt nearlyfoundout that makes the pc go under on an item or list it doesnt happen just from the list r212 pulls withholds by the carload on track if you miss package it is giant missed withhold and screaming arc break but if you see pc go even slightly groggy dopey slumping down and shutting his eyes etc on nulling pull up right there and get the nearlyfoundouts you are after regular pttype missed withholds because missing item on list doesnt give the same dopeoff symptom having missed an item will give this other phenomenon body see hcob 3may62 arc breaks missed withholds for the fifteen signs of missed withholds the expected behavior of the pc during l and n and receiving or thinking of items is wide awake though the pc could have his eyes closed this is terribly important during nulling when you are depending on the item rockslamming it wont happen if the pc is anaten meters dont rockslam when the pc is anaten meter will tick but you cant depend on it rockslamming when there is insufficient attention present to charge up an item the same is true for rocket reads in goal checkouts boiloff anaten etc were discovered in 1952 to be flow running too long in one direction missed withhold is restrained flow any effort to outflow by pc who has missed withhold is blocked and only causes further inflow the pc has stuck flow if the pc has missed withhold hes inflowed as far as he can go and hes very very prone to boiloff he is holding back flow so he gets stuck flow very quickly sometimes missed withhold from out of session is keyed in by withhold in session then the pc boils off in this case you have to run the outofsession missed withhold that is why missed withhold stays in as random rudiment it gets you out of more trouble than it gets you into if you broaden the missed withhold question to include the track then you will get the restimulated ones too for instance you might ask in the past week has withhold been missed do this when you cant wake the pc not all missed withholds are on the second dynamic if you start steering missed withholds by dynamics you will start more incomplete lists keep the question general the nearlyfoundout is lefthand button suppressortype button which doesnt necessarily read on the meter if you pull session missed withhold but the pc goes dopey fifteen minutes later prepcheck the nearlyfoundout button with or without time limiter left hand buttons are those that prevent things from reading eg suppress fail to reveal anxious about careful of nearly found out right hand buttons make things read eg mistake been made suggested decided protested invalidated protested follows on the heels of nearlyfoundout thus it is point where left and right hand buttons meet in coaudit watch for dopeoff and put in the random rud yourself dont try to get students to do it take for granted that it is something out of session that keyed in you can use is there anything we nearly found out about you the we limits the question or get the student to run the random rudiment muzzled and repetitive until the pc looks desperate and about to arc break then go back to listing which model session should one use as much as necessary more model session has these elements 1 adjust the pcs chair 2 get can squeeze 3 give the rfactor for the session 4 give tone 40 start of session 5 find out if the session has started for the pc 6 have the pc set goals for life and livingness and the session what you do next depends on whether you are going to list or null today dont worry about ruds in listing session who cares what the needle is doing dirty needle can best be cleaned up by listing the dirty needle is probably being caused by thoughts about doing the list if the list is complete the pcs list will be clean in this case it is noauditing to do anything other than to null the list take chance on betweensessions outruds only get worried if the pc starts to boiloff get off missed withholds if possible if it is not possible the list is incomplete so extend it in listing session get goals set and go right into listing that is more effective in cleaning up the needle and having the pc in session then anything else if the pc wont sit there and list that is different if the pc stops listing it is either suppress or inval forget the rest of the ruds take any items the pc gives you on these buttons put them on the list and go right back into listing that was the purpose of the rud after all at the end of the session discuss where you and the pc have gotten to and where in general you are going close off the body of the session then check endruds at sensitivity 64 get the pc out of the auditing environment with in this session was the run all right get your question answered but dont grind the pc to death check protest if this looks necessary refer to scientology 88008 it talks about thetan in the physical universe all the thetan is doing is stacking himself up against the physical universe and batting around like bluebottle fly in cage if you want to free the pc from the session ask if the room was ok then you have got the thetan and the physical universe straightened up if the pc starts inventing answers or seems nerved up it is probably missed withhold you wont do anything about it then get can squeeze asking about whether the run was all right usually gets his havingness back up but if he is down on havingness dont work over ruds run some havingness for few commands to restore the can squeeze not to run the bank the best havingness processes are 1 feel that _______ 2 touch that _______ 3 notice that _______ only use few commands not more than twelve this is also good way to get the pc back in session then take up session goals not life and livingness goals take down whatever gains the pc mentions get asksay answer question if he has one dont start handling what comes up you are ending session dont press for more give the pc tone 40 end of session and have him tell you that you are longer auditing him give him an altered visual aspect also to keep him from going on running his case look more cheerful and natural ask for cigarette or something this is routine 2 model session using more than this minimum can get you into trouble for nulling session you can show the pc the list and ask for any major thoughts that he has had about it this practice lets the pc get off outruds on the list then you dont have to ask for them if the pc gets agitated in routine 2 session the first thing to assume is that there is something wrong with the routine 2 if the pc gets selfauditish or interrupts to get his ruds in just give cheery acknowledgment and go on dont let the pc obscure reads while listing if you are nulling just go down the list going bark bark bark if the needle gets dirty dont assume that it is outruds it is more likely that the list is wrong way to or from wrong source especially if your nulling was too brisk to give the pc time to think even more likely than the above is that the item is not on the list if list is incomplete pc wont register protest on the meter when you ask for more items even if he is protesting verbally you could also list for pages beyond where the list was complete then the needle can go dirty on protest but all other crimes fall short of not completing the list r321 requires more midruds than routine 2 see p 371 above for r321 as soon as you have ptps out of the road the case is ready for r321 find his goals nice as you please it is safer for an expert auditor to do goals on case than to do routine 2 an inexpert auditor is safer with routine 2 the list in pt who or what are you upset about would probably run more easily on pc simply in the form who or what does present time consist of cf expanded dianetics pt environment list this is the basic model but you could use who or what are you in contact with in pt on missed withholds realize that you can list whichever area is of most interest to the pc if you pick the wrong one of the three session life and livingness parts of existence to do first it can react like missed withhold make sure you get the universe where the problem lies
