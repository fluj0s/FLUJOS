14th october 2008 minister for national security and provincial adminstration harambee house nairobi chairman parliamentary committee on security parliament buildings nairobi commissioner of police vigilance house nairobi dear sir re report dubbed veil of impunity executions disappearances who is guilty the above captioned refers the oscar foundation has investi gated and made interrogation into circumstances leading to the killings and mysterious disappearances of men and women between july 2002 and september 2008 during these periods over 8000 of enforced disappearance arbitrary rrest extrajudicial execution cases were documented between january 2008 and september 2008 this year oscar foundation has documented 384 cases of enforced disappearance or execution perpetuated by law enforcem ent agencies in kenya the executions were systematic and wi despread and target certain population for extermination it is worth noting t hat the enforced disappearances occurred after the police initiated an execution squad code named kwekwe swahili word meaning weed therefore from t he inception the squad was systematically commissioned to weed out their target with both impunity and tribal bias with all intent to exterminating them fr om the face of the earth recognizing that under principles of international w it is upon governments to investigate when patterns of disappearanc are committed by law enforcement agents the pattern of systematic and wi despread abductions that continue to occur amount to crimes against humanity under both domestic and international laws the failure of the government to in vestigate and prosec ute the perpetrators regardless of their status and standing in society and government constitute culture of state inst itutionalized impunity further under international law neither head of st ate prime minister nor responsible government officials enjoy im munity from criminal prosecution for crimes against humanity the declaration on enforced disappearance reaffirms this principle known as universal jurisdicti on providing that all states should take any lawful and appropriate ac tion available to bring to justice persons presumed responsible for acts of enforced disa ppearance who are found to be in their jurisdiction or under their control it is upon this premise that the osca r foundation commenced investigation where of several theorie s emerged on the ground t hat calls for further investigation these include 1 theory one the merger of national development party and kanu to new kanu in 2001 formed the first scheme to exterminat young people from central kenya the then minister for stat in charge of internal security julius sunkuli in 2002 outlawed all vigilante groups therefore triggeri ng genesis of execution by law enforcement agents 2 theory two the police theory the police force main tains that there are two factions within the mungiki an d that they are at war agains t rival factions the mungiki adherents are killing rival members in co ld blood so asserts the police 3 theory three the kikuyu elite it is widely believed t hat the kikuyu elite comprising of rich prominent figures from central kenya want to maintain the status quo and are perceived to have launched war agains t the youths in central kenya who are agitating for land reforms and political clout the fact that the killings intensified in the period preceding the 2007 elections clearly demonstrates that the it was well orchestrated by the powerful and ghty from the same community knowing that the president the ministers in charge of internal security defence justice and cons titutional affairs and the leader of official opposition were all from the kikuyu ethnic community how could they not intervene to save their kinsfolk from execution what did they know regarding the said executi on and enforced disappearance this scenario begs to illustrate that t he rural home of the then minister for state in charge of internal security john michuki was attacked by gunmen and an assistant chief killed during t he attack prompting crackdown of youths leading to planned executions and enforced disappearances of persons mostly from the kikuyu ethnic background 4 theory four another theory revolves on the fact that the police recruitment is district based rendering the rift valley province nyanza and other areas that were hostile to the kikuyus large share of recruits in the police force subsequent the odm campaigners had managed to balkanize the whole country against one tribe it was 41 tribes against one that is all kenyans versus the kikuyu this gave way for rogue officers to kill with impunity and tribal bias it is worth noting that former commissi oners of police phil emon abongo and edwin nyaseda were in the odm camp 5 theory five the last theoryfactor is based on suse of funds donated by development partners in the fight against terror t he diplomatic communities funded the government to fight vig ilantes especially the m ungiki whose members had transformed the outfit into politic party and gone an extra mile in converting religion to islam the po lice continue misusing donor funds by creating many executing squads ie kwekwe scorpion flying squad etc despite having an antiterror police unit today the community policing have failed drastically it is on these premises that we ask the following questions 1 who was responsible for these heinous acts 2 who is accountable for the per formance of these atrocities 3 why were the innocent lives lost the oscar foundation wishes to call upon the police to issue an official statement and open inquiries into the enfo rced disappearance an d executions of innocent kenyans on allegati ons of being associates of the mungiki sect within the next 24 hours of the date of this lette r failure to instit ute the inquiry oscar foundation will petition the united nations to send in team of investigators to probe these incidences and prosecute the culp rits accordingly in the international criminal court this report is easily accessible at wwwoscarfoundorg and is embargoed until the 15th october 2008 to afford the government an opportunity to release press statement and give the poli ce an opportunity to make formal inquiry into the executions and enforced disappearance the oscar foundation looks forward to eing justice done to all suspects of these crimes against humanity yours faithfully kamau kingara executive director cc 1 all media houses 2 allmembers of parliament 3 all development partners
