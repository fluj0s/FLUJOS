when faced with the unusual do the usual lecture given on 7 march 1963 they say rhirrhip you ever hear of those well work it out rank has its responsibilities rank has its privileges amongst my privileges i dont rank being late anywayanyway this is what this is the 7th of march ah theres going to be some people in z unit that wish this lecture never took place anyway the 7th of march ad 13 our lucky year sarcasm intended and saint hill special briefing course lecture were going to take up this evening the subject of when faced with the unusual do the usual this is hard lesson to learn some of the people that have never learned this include psychiatry thats why they never got anyplace and hear now the more unusual the situation the more usual the remedy dont go qingandaing thats one thing you must not do just because the situation is desperateis reason you should become desperate just because the situation is unusual is reason you should become unusual now by george when you look it over you will see that every desperate remedy that has ever been developed by man stemmed from the fact that the practitioner simply qed and aed with the patient its gotten to the point in psychiatry where when the patient goes crazy the psychiatrist goes crazy thats the way of it so forth theyre always talking about they dont have enough psychiatrists they should add to the line they dont have enough psychiatrists out of padded cells they have supply of psychiatrists thats always being eaten up now nobodys running down psychiatry im just telling you why they cant make people sane its matter of theyre faced with the unusual so they do the unusual and theyve always done the unusual you go in and you say this fellows practicing freudian analysis yes he practices freudian analysis but he practices the jungian twist on adlers work as represented by karen horney only he does it bit different i remember one psychiatrist i interviewed these poor guys man they really need auditing and well probably have that job one of these days anyhow the guy told he was horney man i was very interested in his being horney man and i said well good i see you have book there by karen horney ihave you ever read it and he said and i said have you ever read any books by karen horney he said i said well what type of analysis do you do and he says horney this same poor fellow was running up and down corridor one day and he says youve got to give permission to electric shock that patient youve got to give permission to electricyouve got to got to got to give permission to electric shock i said whats the matter whats the matter whats the matter she wont eat all right i said well will she eat if you electric shock her well i say well why do you want to electric shock her well youve got to and i said well whatnow just minute what happens to these people when you dont electric shock them oh they get out of here three weeks before they do when you do electric shock them he said if youre doing research you should keep records like that we have all the records i can show you i can show you we keep records if you dont electric shock the patients here they get out three weeks earlier i dont know little further sounding out i find out he wasnt even supposed to be curing them all he was doinghe was supposed to be electric shocking them now lookahere these fellowsthese fellows need help and one of these days theyre going to get our helpunlike the ama they forfeited all the help theyre ever going to get but learn something from this please learn something from this every time something happened they did something else equally unusual and they were faced with plenty of unusuality and they kept on doing the unusual now look there might at one time or another have been technology known as psychiatry see there might have been one nobody would be able to trace what it is now and its certainly not being effective i know theyre using their ineffectiveness right now to take about sixteen billion dollars off the us government in order to build more institutions to hold more people that they cant heal there are more people insane today than there ever were before the psychiatrists themselves say this psychiatrists also say that they dont know anything about what they should do to these people they also say that they should be continued to be permitted to do it which i dont think is reasonable well have to help them out someday too now lookahere if every time in some technique that youre doing on pc every time you see something that looks very unusual to you if you go on and do something as unusual youre going to have that pc wrapped around more telephone poles than there are youre not going to make any clears thats the penalty you will pay for it just like that you will not make any clearsnone im telling you im not kidding the reason i was late for this lecture is mary sue and i were going over the auditor reports andshed gone over the auditor reports she was going over these cases with shes getting to be the expert these days on 3m shes cocky you know shes up there way beyond any auditor in the business here she is one of these oldtime hdas you see and shes way out in front she probably has more experience now on 3m than any auditor anyplace oh andprobablyshe does have shes found somewhere close to hundreda hundred ris by 3m shes also found lot of goals not on just one case shes found them on lots of cases she knows what shes talking about and some of the things shes found going on here are quite interesting one case going down the line everythings working out all right more or less on this pc hes going along okay let say its going along in spite of and they go back to check out an item that was found earlier and the pc suddenly says iheres goal here i dont want this on the list but you know heres goal i donanduh the auditor put it down on the list it was an item rather and he says i dont want that on the list thats goal so they put it over here they dont go on trying to find the item that they were looking for they mess around with it its firing earlier and late so everybody present all say well give this goal you just found prepcheck what whats that the pcs goal fired at the beginning of session goals still firing pc comes up with another goal auditor sees that it rocket reads while hes calling the item and he says what are you thinking about because the fire is early or late pc says oh im thinking about that other goal whatll we do about it well well prepcheck the other goal look you could do this too you could not only prepcheck the other goal you could run goal oppose list on it and then abandon that halfway and not find any item on it oh yeah you could and then you could go on down the line and decide his 212 needed repairing and you could repair that and then you could give him problems intensive one way or the other and then you could run couple of engrams too but that isnt what youre supposed to be doing youre here finding an item find it thats all well whats this so he thought of goal so it rocket read so put it down in the auditors report what else nobodys seen any blowdown of this old goal its still rocket reading youre going to abandon the goal and get off on another goal well the clue of it is is every goal that this pcs ever had has rocket read you give him goals they rocket read whats all this what would you do thing like that for to pc youre in the middle of finding an ri well find it and then find another ri and find another ri so the pc says hes just had cognition that his grandmother laid eggs well dont run an engram of his grandmother laying eggs find some more ris now let tell you something we just had goal found in new york we just had goal found in new york i dont know who quite found or checked out the goal that ran little bit of the end of the of the line but one of the staff members there received problems intensive went free needle on it they did couple of 212 items and his goal popped up and there it was tough huh tough difficult very difficult you know who did the auditing nineyearold boy in the academy its interesting isnt it now nothing shows up an auditornothing shows up an auditor like fantastically precise process you recognize the trouble isnt with the process today its fantastically precise and the more precise the process the more you figurefigure on it well the goofier its going to get you understand the situation this is one of these situations whereby there is the process taped taped taped actually the rr always comes up with the same frequency the same phenomena are always present there it is there it is there it is you do this you do that you do that theres variation on this the only variation you put there is by going stoneblind and not watching the thing or running goals that dont fire and things like this you run into trouble those are all unusual circumstances they shouldnt exist now im going to talk with some of the auditors who have been doing some of this auditing and i wish allen would go back to the back of the room there and on the gray phone and dial 05 dial 05 wait for the dial tone and dial 05 and thatll phone here and then well have little conversation were getting very stylish on the radio these days you know wevei dont know ii havent had an accurate report on it but i think that radio broadcast went off just fine the other night in new york i know i had cable the following morning that thanked for my intervention it wasnt matter of intervening it was making sure my orders were carried out and i dont know how many hours weve been on the air now old johnny and other people getting on the air theyre doing good job too theyre doing good job too hello how are you allen terrible situation here that puts you on the on the tape and so forth this particular way but you know i was looking over harold dufords case here all right you got fifteen ris found and youve now run into rocket reads isnt that right thats great how do you suppose that happened whats your idea of it well yeah we know that but what do you think happened he says he goofed somewhere thatsthats we know that what dowhat do you think happened come on come on come onyou must have some idea of what happened allen dont be coy dont dont be coy just because youre talking to every central organization in the world right now iim not trying to make you nervous allen your professional reputation isnt at stake yet youre not out of z unit come on what do you think is wrong failed to complete one all right let read you the finding on this he has been instructed to check over the line plot is that right and pick up the item that was listed wrong way to or an incomplete list did you dig it well what instructions did you get you got instructions to check over the line plotgo on yeah all right go on you found items reading you got nothing on this item huh did you list it the same way to you did the daythe way before oh you did huh was it rocket reading it was just dirty read well thats very interesting youve had fifteen ris off this case dontyou think one of these items back there is backwards but you didnt think about that did you allen now when you went over this list when you went over this line plot what did you do allen howd you go over it howd you check them over he checked over every item gave brief tiger drill on each item and then what happened you found one ticking yeah all right yeah uhhuh yeah right yeah it was just dirty read on this line plot and you went over it again today you did yesterday and went over it and it didnt tick when the instructor was there so you went over it all again today and it did tick all right go on dirty read incomplete list so uhhuh you didnt get this idea of something being backwards did you all right now did you did you get the goal to fire oh the goal hasnt fired well thats interesting when was the goal last at the clear read oh hes never been at the clear read throughout these whole fifteen items huh where is he usually at 70 hes around about 40 or 45 and never moves away from there it did drop close to the clear read at some point when was that all right an individualist and how long ago was that how many items ago six items ago and it dropped to clear read and of course you get the goal to fire every session before you start listing or anything dont you oh you dont ohhhh oh well when was the last time you saw this goal fire or did you just bail out of the airplane without parachute last friday how many items ago was that the friday before you saw it fire in other words youve seen it fire before an individualist but havent seen it fire since is that right it was after how much did it fire very slight well what is firea tick quarter of an inch and that was an individualist yeah well it was after the individualist you saw this goal fire quarter of an inch before or after youre sure it was after he found an individualist not 100 percent sure well the only way you can wrap somebody around telephone pole like this is run into gpm without goal otherwise it all goes off according to hoyle looks like to you missed step 15 somehow or another but because the pcs rudiments are out and everything is all jammed up and the goal hasnt been cleared it looks to like you just got yourself beautiful case here of having run off over the edge thats the only thing it looks like to now you go any further over that youre going to turn off the pcs rr and there where you be youll not only be hunting youll have hell of time man well whats his next goal whats the goal of the next gpm youre fifteen items down the lineyou should be in sight of it ah he said today his goal was to be prime cause did it rocket read he never said it yeah what did it do he did what just roughed the needle up well here you go the only thing i know that could happen like this is your gpm went clear several items ago exactly at the point of what probably an individualist you saw it blow down to clear read and then you went tearing right on down the line into the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one and the next one and your rocket reads have been getting smaller and smaller ever since an individualist havent they yeah why dont you find the pcs goal unwrap him from the telephone pole and get the show on the road huh all right youll find it very easy to find his goal by the wayvery very easy to find his goal you just have to find where the other goal finished and then take the goal for the items afterwards and when you give good prepchecksif you give good prepcheck now allenany time you give good prepcheck on that sort of thing youll have your needle free enough and the rudiments are in enough so that you get the free needle phenomena all rightyeah yeah its fact as you go by it but youre dealing with 3m man and the only thing i know that can lock tone arm up that highand have goal reading and items found and everything closing downthe shades of night are falling actually the only thing thatll turn back on the rr is he hits dead on his goal he probably already knows what it is and youll find out youve gone several items by it there is number of items in gpm see constant number do you know there can be only two items in gpm hmhm thats grim isnt it all right well im sure youll get ahold of it and dont think im scolding you and this wont damage your reputation theyll say well hes good auditor ron kept giving him hell until he finally could audit okay allen bye now all right i hope you got that now did you its interesting isnt it its not very mysterious i dont think its mysterious of course you could say that theyou never did have the pcs goal that would be pretty desperate but i dont think pc could go on having an rr that long without it shutting off if you didnt have his goal somewhere up the line he finished offsomewhere up the line six seven eight items ten items something like that that was the end of that gpm only he didnt get his free needle phenomena he didnt see his blowdown he didnt see all these things happen because apparently perhaps his rudiments werent in enough for him to notice it and hes not seen it before so he might not even have known what it was and he said yes well it did on an individualist blowdown get down to clear read that was probably it every item hes gone since that point from there on has been an item in the direction of disaster oh hes got these items they are the items of the next goal everything is fine it wont kill the pc but undoubtedly since gpms dont act in several different ways hes just gone past the second goal thats all now how he managed it i dont know but hell get the pc back on the road again hell get goal and itll turn on again its quite interesting though that you can shut the whole thing right offjust like that rocket reads nothing bangoff meter frozen up here at 50 wont move nothing gone what well you went through one gpm and landed in another gpm and if you werent alert you didnt see the free needle and you didnt see the blowdown the free needle may only last for three and half seconds and if youre not lookaccustomed to looking at meter while the pc is cogniting youd never see the rocket reading blowdown thats all i can think of would have occurred that ever since that time the needle has been getting smaller and smaller and the reads smaller and smaller and now theyre gone well the only thing i know of can happen is you jammed the second goal i know ive got experience on it its happened to you overrun one of these gpms into the next line youre in trouble all right lets see wheres another goof on this wheres another goof on reviewing the list oh ill just read you this next one this isnt too bad maybe ill take this up maybe ill take it up with the auditor seventeen ris have been found thats pretty good huh seventeen of them right down in to that goal but the auditor may have goofed at the last reliable rr found as he abandoned the list and on reviewing the list i mary sue note that he failed to check two items marked with an rr question mark about twentyeight items from the end of the list and i see markings around the last rr to indicate that he has checked these and hes abandoned the list well i dont know we probably would better let the boy speak for himself dick go to the back of the room there and ring up 05 now listen let tell you something about list you could do wrong way to on which you see few or none reads and have item on the list but thats very very unusual any list has an item on it complete or not complete you see the item doesnt appear after youve completed the list it was on it actually the definition of complete list is one item reading dont you see just one hiya dick sorry take some time here i dont mean to scold you dick youve probably run into something here thats over your head let let tell you something youre running into one here that auditors just keep running into and running into and running into and that is they abandon lists before they check over and under and on and so forth in other words they dont examine the whole list you dont casually abandon list you understand what you dowhat you do is check your last rock slamming item on the list it shouldnt read check the next to the last rr it shouldnt read check the last rr it should read all right now youve giventold the pc each time that it did or didnt and if youve checked that last rr it didnt read but its the last rr were dealing with terrific mathematical precision its the last rr on the list and if you were on the ball on listing youd know which one was the last rr to list you see all right now what you do then if that last rr doesnt list as it occasionally does you go over it and under it but this is not source list so its down there toward the end of the list isnt it now you dont take these lists that oppose rocketreliable itemsyou dont take these lists you know and just say well it can be any place on the list because it never is its always the last on the list the last rr on the list see if that last rr doesnt read you read one above one below two above two below thats items you see if you havent got it then and your next to the last rocket reading item didnt read then its obvious that the read is not any earlier on the list right so the read must be somewhere from two above or three above to the end of your list right so you just go on down that one by one if that kind of situation happens and you just go down one by one and you see any kind of needle tick or anything of the sort like that give it brief tiger drill and youll find your rr but dont ever abandon one of these lists now youre seventeen items deep and youre liable to be running into trouble here where is this tone arm running well your case is in wonderful shape you must be doing an awful good job watch for that blowdown though man is that goal reading at the beginning of every session all right but it is reading and you do check it at the beginning of every session all right now dont fool with this one that things going to blow down to 30 that needles going to go briefly loose and youre into the next bank here before you know it youre in danger zone right now you know got it yeah all right for god sakes take it i i tell you theres one thing you always take off pc goal yeah okay good enough dick youll make it with this one you and ifis the needle pretty loose what yeah his tone arms been well upwell below yeah about five items ago he had blowdown of that character haha hahow do you know youre not into the second gpm yeah he couldnt quite fithe couldnt quite fita couple of items ago he couldnt quite fit one to the goal man youre in the next gpm already get out of there just get his goal get it all polished up and keep on going youll have nice big rocket reads and everythingll be fine okay all right dick youre not doing too bad you would haveyou would have drowned in another about three items you would have said wheres the mans rocket read wheres his goal wheres this wheres it where where then you would have been saying mary sue the pcs rocket read is shut off okay dick bye now all right now you see consistently and continually on these reports we find auditors are not checking the list thoroughly you understand there are two types of list theres source list and there is an ri oppose list now an ri oppose list is always the same if your item was listed right way to its the last rr on the listbang every timejust like that but if that last thing doesnt rr the pc could have been thinking another item while he listed an item dont you see and it could have been slightly above and below so you always go over and under on these ri oppose lists over and under one over and under two not two ris or two rses you knowbut just items if thats not it just lets make sure there in that zone from the nexttothelast rractually if you want to be awfully safe its from the nexttothelast rr to the end of the list the item is there someplace thats matter of about thirty items so you have to read them down take the one that dirty reads prepcheck it and youll find your item but you have to be awfully wrong to find item do you know that the only time you ever find item on listyouve got to get this through your heads this is routine 2 routine 3the only time you ever find an item onno item on listthe only time you ever find item on the list is when the items already been found then you willif the items already been found youre joining two lists but the pc will put the found item on the listand if its already been opposed someplace else it wont fire you understand that but that doesnt mean that just because some item thats already been found goes on the list that you wont find an item on the list you understand because pcs habitually are putting their old gpm items on the new lists they just do that they say that also fits see but dont easily abandon list see just dont do that now source list of course is something else and in both routine 2 and routine 3 you will find your source lists are consistently and continually difficult who ever said source list wasnt difficult well who ever said it wasnt difficult to make clear its easy to follow directions but its miracle that you can do it now look all youre doing is producing every time you produce clear miracle the like of which has never been seen before on earth so you want to do it easy all right im trying to make it ill cooperate with you im trying to trying to make it so youll do it very easily theres doubt about this im not being uncooperative in this but you cooperate with and whenwhen i tell you its the last rr on the list and if it isnt you go over and under until you find that thingwhy do it dont 90 off abandoning lists now look consistently heres case after case this same thing is being done with source list is something different you check over those rocket reads on source list youve also got to check over the rses on source list and here we find the most heinous crime of all terrible the auditor has already gone to ta motion and gone heri assume fifty beyond the last rs on the list and couldnt find the item on the list so is continuing the list you cant do that how can you find item on source list you tell theres always an item on source list the only thing can be wrong with source list is there are too many items firing on the source list youre trying to cut it down to one well its on that list someplace thats all dont go continuing the list not on goal oppose what do you mean you cant find an item on the list thats impossible it would mean the whole gpm had already been cleared and therefore why are you auditing it youre going to find an item on goal oppose list when you find item on the list why continue it item is going to appear on it magically because there is an item on it all the time havent you realized that that read is moving down that list as the pc lists the read moves right down that list just as nice as you ever saw its always on the list or its wrong list or wrong goal but youre not accustomed yet to checking over and under thesethese rocket reads now thats as elementary thing as that there is read on the list youre not accustomed to checking them the read is there there it is there are goofy things going on i wont particularly go into these things but they are all kind of wild departures from the situation it says you read over and under well if it says you read over and under you read over and under theres reason to do something else so the item youre getting from the pc looks kind of shaky you know youre not getting your rocket reads in the right place and you say to the pc are you thinking about something else yes he says im thinking about the goal to catch catfish now you what are you going to do then what are you going to do huh youre going to dump this rithe thing thats going to make him clearand pick up this goal oh he says hes thinking about the goal all right write it down over here and say i got that i got that now were going right on with this ri and check that ri out thats the business youre on look dont disperse and this business of overlisting because theres item on the list is utterly silly theres always an item on the list the trouble is with list there are too many items on the list thats always the trouble with listtoo many items on the list and you pick up the wrong item youve got to null these source lists man youve got to null them all the way down you cant go monkeying around with those things if you dont know what rred you dont immediately pick up an rr bang bang off the source list and find out that nothing else is rring on the source list youve got to null the lot dont fool with it and as far asas far as pc is concernedas far as pc is concerned he isnt different hes not different he talks different he talks with different accent he talks this way he talks that way some are slow to give items some are fast to give items its all the same bank or he wouldnt be here in this time strata at this time you understand so what are you doing looking for differences now your willingness to persist on case is something i congratulate you on i think its remarkable i congratulate you on your persistence on case but do you know that persisting on case because you dont know what else to do is doing the unusual look what are youwhat are youwhat are you trying to do with gpm huh what are you trying to do with one youre trying to run it out well you say youre trying to find ris now if you go on the basis that all you have to do to clear somebody is to find ris youre going to get in real trouble because that isnt what youre trying to do youre trying to find ris in order to knock out gpm well what built the gpm goal built the gpm so therefore youve got to knock out ris aligned to certain definite goal somebodys going to make too much out of this because they always align automatically to the goalbut youre going to findyoure finding ris aligned to certain goal which results in the disappearance of the gpm and thats all there is to that thats all well what ifyouve done it what if you did it weve apparently got two cases here at saint hill right this minute who were saint hill clears and two auditors have very happily passed up full honors because i would have shaken them by the paw and given them sendoff to end all sendoffs you see first one on 3m see on the course see i think that would be terrific see i made it some time ago i had the same trouble the auditor plunged on through only i was very alert and i said that has went fortunately i labeled my items when i came up the track very exactly i labeled them very very carefully but the auditor who made the first saint hill special briefing course student clear on 3m might have been dick or it might have been allen and thats why i had these two gentlemen on the telephone tonight but unfortunately instead of being able to congratulate them for having made the firsti dont know which one did it you see we could probably compare the auditors reports or something like that and we might be able to find it which one really drags the honors but the reason i had them on is to see if either one of them would claim the honor isnt that nasty instead of that you heard them apologetically protesting im sorry ive done wrong ron ill do better in the future and so forth yeah this was just expected of course but the point im making here is that these two guys either one of them had the honor of making the first 3m clear on this course there are other clears have been made on the course but by other processes and they passed it up we cant give them the honor now because they never reported it now youre witnesses youre witnesses i called them up you saw right on the phone here i called them up i talked to them you know and you know what was waiting for them you know what was waiting for them class iv with honors and theyd be lucky now to get class iii i think but anyhow theyll probably do better than that but if either one of them had said hey ron you know i was auditing this afternoon i suddenly found outi suddenly found out that wed left the other goal and it was all run out and it didnt read anymore and it by the way it continues to tick the old goal continues to tick youve actually got to prepcheck the lot sometimes to get it out unless its closed out you understand and the fellow all he had to sayall allen had to say was hey ron you know i was checking over the case this afternoon and i accidentally happened to read the february 22nd bulletin and it was lying there and i didnt have anything to do and i happened to read it and i noticed that last friday or i think friday week ago i had blowdown to 30 from normally hightonearmed pc and so forth and i checked it out today and i found i couldnt find the old goal the pc gave an old new goal its rocket reading ii may not have been able to prepcheck one out and straighten him out but ive made firstgoal clear what do you know pc wont feel very good unless its prepchecked out its all right to avoid it at this particular stand its just an interim state of making the pc feel better or dick could have said say ron you know pcs been worrying worrying the last few days but by golly this afternoon i figured out what happened i1 looked i saw this bulletin you know it was lying there and it was in red ink on white paper and and i picked it up and i was checking into it you know and so forth and there was another bulletin there and it said something about clear test and so on so i just for fun ran down goal oppose on the old goal you know and nothing read and nothing read and the pc gave his new goal and apparently last week some time we had firstgoal clear and i would have saidi would have said well dick class iv with honors yes well we can all look back on our trackwe can all look back on our track and recall what might have beenwhat might have been that doesnt mean these boys arent doing job theyre doing perfectly good job but i had to have witnesses i had to have witnesses here to the effect that they could have made claim and so forth i just had dispatch from suzie im sorry but allenallen doesnt havehave any luck these days hes only getting clear i suppose thats lucky but heres long report on allens case now this is wonderful example in doing the unusual now nineteen items have been found and the auditors gone back to the first ri found on the goal oppose list which was barren planets and while listing on it the pc put item to be alone on list and then told the auditor to remove it and when the auditor tried to check the last rr on the list item barren planets pc began to rr priorly and latently on item and the auditor asked what was happening and the pc said he was thinking of the goal to be alone and the auditor consulted with fred and fred did not check up the item found but told the auditor to do brief mid rud prepcheck on the goal to be certain and it had only needle agitation on it and i checked with the auditor and the auditor has seen free needle or on goal to be certain or on any item list off the goal to be certain nor has there been any constant rrrr you mean the blowdown by rr phenomena and yesterday and today at the start of the session the goal to be certain was rring and i told the auditor to get them from barren planets and continue on more items there are several possibilities here that this and that and the other thing and the other thing and the other thing well ill tell you what it is allen went clear and nobody noticed see it happened to you know i was firstgoal clear and for just time enough to eat few peanuts and drink cocacola but i was smart enough to recognize it and the auditor was smart enough to notice and so we had third candidate and so forthwe had third candidate on this pedro get on the phone get on the phone and call at 05 would you do that pedro come on pedro come on im waiting everybodys waiting do you realize every central organization in the world is waiting for you to get there we are hello pedro pedro i just wanted to tell you because you didnt report to firstgoal clear i wont be able to give you class iv with honors for it either youyou reported possibility of one you did when did you report it you did you reported possibility of it on your auditors report today you hadnt seen the blowdown or the rock slam you hadnt seen the rocket read blowdown oh well its awful murky in the chapel in there sometimes voice on phone yeah there wasnt one you dont think there was one voice on phone i know for sure that as far as when the preclear was on the meter there wasnt one and you took this as possibility but you didnt check it out is that right voice on phone what happened was this umwe re uh redid the whole line plot yeah voice on phone this morning yeah voice on phone you see at the beginning of the session right voice on phone so after we had done it redid the whole line plot this morning at the beginning of the session and after youd done it voice on phone after wed done it i checked the goal before i started listing and you checked the goal before you started listing voice on phone yes the goal didnt read and it didnt read voice on phone yes i gave it light prepcheck uhhuh voice on phone still didnt read uhhuh voice on phone uh and as the case had been difficult before and rocket reads had been vanishing mary sue had said that there was possibility of items being represented and all the rest and i had good rocket reading item too yeah voice on phone i just went on without the goal reading you went on without the goal reading voice on phone yes i went on with what i had rocket reading to oppose yeah yeah voice on phone now in opposing that the preclear just said to i thought of the goal to be alone all right and while you were doing this opposing the next one the pc thought of this goal voice on phone yeah and then i supposed all right now is that an item on the list yeah voice on phone and he said its not yeah voice on phone so i said all right now who or what oppose barren planets which was the item thatuh was opposed yeah voice on phone and carried on from there not taking any notice of the goal took notice of the goal voice on phone just said all right all right ive got it here that you thought of it but now carry on listing all right whatd you put on your auditors report about clear voice on phone i mean uh one minute boy hes trying to talk his way out of this one all right go on pedro voice on phone thats all right ill manage it yeah youyouvery good huh go on pedro voice on phone after that when the list went twentyfive items on top of the last rr and all the rest of it and the list was left to be checked till the last item so uh the last item did not check the last item didnt check huh voice on phone yeah and we checked around it all the rest of it two up two down and there wasnt anything there uhhuh voice on phone so uh after we had this checked that wasnt by the wayjust for the record here that wasnt continuing rr spiral staircase that was an item hed grabbed off an old goal oppose list which

and i mentioned to fred what had happened about the goal yeah voice on phone and fred said all right you carry on with your list get your item out of this list and then well have to check the goal yeah yeah yeah you have to check the goal go on voice on phone which was what we did yeah voice on phone and on checking the last item on the second time uhuh after having added to the list and

you had opposed it voice on phone yes yes and it all blew up in smoke voice on phone wait minute then heyou wontyou wont make it pedro but go ahead voice on phone yeah i will and i was checking this item yeah youre checking the item yeah all right thats all right thats fine yeah fine fine its all right yeah im still waiting to find out if you put on your auditors report that your pc was firstgoal clear thats what im waiting for voice on phone well i didnt observe it yeah all right voice on phone but then there was this possibility and that his old goal wasnt reading anymore his old goal wasnt reading anymore yeah well then youyou passed up the class iv with honors im sorry pedro im sorry pedro i dont know anybody i would rather have seen get it really thats all right but clean him up tomorrow youll find out you too have shot several items beyond the vanishment of the old goal youveyoure several items beyond it and there for some little time your pc has not quite been able to fit the old goal to the new items you were finding yeah he wasnt able to fit that in all right all right maybemaybe so maybe so too bad pedro anyway thats the way it is okay pedro good night now well there we are there we are tonight i could announce to you and can announce to you that three firstgoal clears have been made on the saint hill special briefing course in the last week or so and because everybody was being unusual nobody noticed it now what i want you to do now on those auditors is letslets dust up this old goal and lets get bit of prepcheck intomorrows prepcheck day anywayand get the old goal cleaned up and sparked off except everybody but duford now we dont want duford getting pushed around any on anything we simplywhoits hishes the one thats losing the yeah yeah its duford hes got his rocket read almost squeezed out hes gone that far beyond the first gpm so what hes got to do isjust spend your whole time tomorrow in getting harolds goal the soonerthe quicker and when youve got his goal and got him going why you can clean up the old gpm sometime or otherwe dont care when because youre many items deep and youll turn off his rr if you dont find that goal in hurry all right so this is sort of like this the road now is so easy and it is so straight that an auditor going down it doesnt even notice when hes gone by the milepost but keeps on going half gpm before the vanishing of rrs and the difficulty of the case and the high tone arm alerts to him that he has already made firstgoal clear and never gotten any plaudits for it of any kind whatsoever youll find this is quite ordinary but please for gosh sakes realize it and to the three i talked to tonight my deepest condolences and in actual fact my heartiest congratulations in spite of the fact that i had to tell you about it without even examining your pcs thank you very much good night
