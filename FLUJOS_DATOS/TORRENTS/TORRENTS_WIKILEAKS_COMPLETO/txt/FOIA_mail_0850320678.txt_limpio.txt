from tim carter timcarterfmifi to dvinerueaacuk david viner climate impacts link project subject eclat 2 date wed 11 dec 1996 111118 0200 cc mhulmeueaacuk dear davidmike thanks for sending the eclat 2 proposal first let say that i support the idea of continued role for activities coordinating and facilitating the provision of climate change information for ec impacts research and other related research and policy eclat 2 is one way of achieving this but the fact that it is concerted action initiative imposes some limitations the major limitation is that cais are not supposed to involve original research they are networking activities with view on forging research links and developing new research projects in my view there is need for number of targetted research activities on scenario development that might be covered by the themes of the workshops you are suggesting in eclat 2 but which would be best served by some dedicated research projects it really isnt satisfactory to wait until the end of eclat 2 before embarking on research many of the key topics are already known and although research may be proceeding in some of these areas especially in downscaling techniques scenario development techniques etc what is still lacking is coordination across europe in the selection and application of climate change scenarios in impact assessment in my view there are two areas in sore need of targetted research 1 project to analyse all available information from gcms and historical data which will provide some uncertainty bounds on the anticipated future climate in europe by region for use in policy as well as in impacts assessment such project should involve gcm groups interpreting the gcm outputs scenario developers who can apply methods of generalising across lot of gcm predictions and emissions scenarios etc and few impact analysts who can advise on suitable scenarios for use in variety of applications entry level or basic scenarios 2 project to develop guidelines for impact analysts on the application of climate change and related scenarios in european impact assessments this work would need to be linked closely to any coordinated entrylevel scenarios selected for use in ec projects however unless you have project proposal in the pipeline at cru i dont think there is now time to develop new proposal to meet the 15 january deadline comments on the draft document 1 it is unclear to how figure 1 relates to the text the arrows are not well differentiated in the fax version i have and the boxes are not explained 2 similarly figure 2 is also misleading it implies that there is large transfer of information from the cc modelling community to the cc impacts community but surely the whole function of the eclat would be to act as filter in this transfer note that the title of the figure should be revised 3 please remove the reference to eclair there is such name this was light hearted emailed suggestion for eclat 2 not for martins ca which doesnt have name to my knowledge 4 in the suggested steering committee i would strengthen the representation of the impacts community this could be done by time horizon eg one hydrologist to cover range of time periods from subdaily to century scale one forester or soils expert for the long term one agriculture person for the medium term maybe i could represent this community desertificationerosionfire risk person for short to medium term andor an integrated assessment person perhaps three or four persons you should try to avoid the group being dominated by gcmlers do all gcm groups have to be represented you might ask ib troen if there would be any opportunity to obtain ec funding before the fifth framework call for proposals for targetted research topic if this was strongly and urgently recommended by task group workshop might there be special funding from dg xi enrich or the environment agency best wishes tim dr timothy carter affiliation agricultural research centre of finland postal address co finnish meteorological institute box 503 fin00101 helsinki finland tel 358919294125 fax 358919294129 email timcarterfmifi
