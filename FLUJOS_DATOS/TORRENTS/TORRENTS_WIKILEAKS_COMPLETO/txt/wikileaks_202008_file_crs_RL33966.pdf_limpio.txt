offenders some question whether the justice system is dealing with this population appropriat ely since the late 1960s the juvenile justice system has undergone significant modifications resulting from us supreme court decisions changes in federal and state law and the growing belief that juveniles were increasingly involved in more serious and violent crimes consequently at both the federal and states levels the juvenile justice system has shifted from mostly rehabilitative system to more punitive one with serious ramifications for juvenile offenders despite this shift juveniles are generally not afforded the panoply of rights afforded to adult criminal defendants the us constitution requires that juveniles receive many of the features of an adult criminal trial including notice of charges right to counsel privilege against selfincrimination right to confrontation and crossexamination proof beyond reasonable doubt and double jeopardy however in mckeiver v pennsylvania the court held that juveniles do not have fundamental right to jury trial during adjudicatory proceedings the sixth amendment explicitly guarantees the right to an impartial jury trial in criminal prosecutions in duncan v louisiana the us supreme court held that this right is fundamental and guaranteed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment however the court has since limited its holding in duncan to adult defendants by stating that the right to jury trial is not constitutionally required for juveniles in juvenile court proceedings some argue that because the court has determined that jury trials ar not constitutionally required for juvenile adjudications courts should not treat or consider juvenile adjudications in subsequent criminal proceedings in addition some argue that the use of nonjury juvenile adjudications in subsequent criminal proceedings violates due process guarantees because juvenile justice and adult criminal proceedings are fundamentally different has the juvenile justice system changed in such manner that the supreme court should revisit the question of jury trials in juvenile adjudications are the procedural safeguards in the juvenile justice system sufficient to ensure their reliable use for sentence enhancement purposes in adult criminal proceedings to help address these questions this report provides brief background on the purpose of the juvenile system and discusses procedural due process protections provided by the court for juveniles during adjudicatory hearings it also discusses the courts emphasis on the jurys role in criminal proceedings and will be updated as events warrant

g343g561s attention continues to focus on juvenile offenders some question the way in which they are treated in the us criminal justice system since the late 1960s the juvenile justice system has undergone significant modifications as result of united states supreme court decisions changes in federal and state law and the growing perception that juveniles were increasingly involved in more serious and violent crimes1 as result federal and state juvenile justice systems have focused less on rehabilitation and more on punishment which may have significant ramifications for juvenile offenders once they reach adulthood for example recidivist statutes such as the armed career criminal act acca 2 impose mandatory minimums based on prior convictions including juvenile adjudications3 as such adult criminal defendants are exposed to longer terms of imprisonment based on prior juvenile misconduct despite this shift in focus to one more closely resembling the adult criminal justice system juvenile offenders are not generally afforded the full panoply of rights provided to adult criminal defendants

county illinois in 1899 marked the first statewide implementation of separate judicial framework whose sole concern was the problems and misconduct of children the juvenile court was designed to be more than court for children the underlying theory behind separate juvenile court system was that the state has duty to assume custodial and protective role over individuals who cannot act in their own best interest 4 as such the separate system for juvenile offenders was predicated on the notion of rehabilitation not punishment retribution or incapacitation because the juvenile court focused on protection rather than punishment the juvenile proceeding was conceptualized as civil proceeding not criminal one with none of the trappings of an adversarial proceeding5 by the mid20th century questions arose regarding the fairness and efficacy of the juvenile justice system and its ability to effectively rehabilitate young offenders concerns that the differences between the adult and juvenile systems were illusory prompted the need to preserve the legal rights of children adjudicated in the juvenile justice system6 as such state courts began to expand the legal rights of juvenile offenders the emerging focus on juveniles rights in the state 1 the focus of this report is on juvenile offenders adjudi cated delinquent within the juvenile justice system and not juvenile offenders

four landmark cases kent v united states 7 in re gault 8 in re winship 9 and mckeiver v pennsylvania 10 through these cases the court left an indelible mark on the juvenile justice system by restricting the discretion of juvenile court judges and enumerating the constitutional rights retained by juveniles during adjudication these decisions resulted in hybrid juvenile justice system that renders some of the procedural rights afforded to adult criminal defendants some argue that this hybrid system blurs the historical distinction between the juvenile justice and adult criminal systems

states 11 in kent the court reviewed district of columbia case in which the petitioner challenged the validity of the juvenile courts decision to waive jurisdiction over him on the ground that the procedure used by the court in reaching its decision constituted denial of due process of law the us supreme court held that the waiver of jurisdiction was critically important stage in the juvenile process and mu st be attended by minimum requirements of due process and fair treatment required by the fourteenth amendment 12 in reaching its decision the court expressed concern that the noncriminal nature of the juvenile proceeding was an invitation to procedural arbitrariness13 including broad judicial factfinding 7 383 us 541 1966 8 387 us 1 1967 9 397 us 358 1970 10 403 us 528

g345g561g11g151g561g155g142g561g9g138g158g149g157 g561 in in re gault 14 the court held that the informal procedures of juvenile courts amount to denial of juveniles fundamental due process rights15 although the court recognized that juvenile courts were attempting to help juveniles it reasoned that this worthy purpose failed to justify informal procedure particularly when juveniles liberty was threatened16 after thorough examination of the history of the juvenile court system the court reiterated much of the criticism it raised in kent specifically expressing concern about the juvenile courts informality and the broad discretion of its judges 17 to ensure that juveniles receive the essentials of fair treatment during an adjudicatory hearing the court found that juveniles were entitled to certain due process rights afforded to adult criminal defendants under the us constitution18 these rights include the right to reasonable notice of the charges the right to counsel the right to confrontation and the right against selfincrimination 19 g11g151g561g155g142g561g25g146g151g156g145g146g153g561 in in re winship the court continued to expand the rights of juveniles by holding that the state must show proof beyond reasonable doubt to adjudicate minor as delinquent for an act that would be crime if committed by an adult20 the state of new york charged samuel winship with delinquency for stealing 112 from womans pocketbook in furniture store21 having already established that juvenile proceedings must conform to due process and fair treatment the court considered single issue whether due process and fair treatment require state to demonstrate proof beyond reasonable doubt to hold juvenile accountable for committing an adult criminal act 22 although new york juvenile court found winship to be delinquent under statute that required the state to show guilt merely by preponderance of the evidence the court reversed emphasizing that criminal charges have always re quired higher burden of persuasion than civil 14 387 us 1 1967 the police took gerald gault age 15 into custody for allegedly making lewd and obscene phone call to neighbor neither of his parents received notice that the police had taken gault into custody gaults mother learned that her was in custody only when she returned home from work and sent her other to look for him gaults brother learned from friends that gault was in custody when gaults mother picked him up at the detention home an officer told her that there would be hearing the following day at the hearing the accuser was not present the judge did not swear in anyone and the court did not make record of the proceeding at subsequent hearing the judge found gault to be juvenile delinquent and committed him to an industrial school until the age of 21 because state law did not allow gault to appeal the decision he filed habeas corpus petition 15 id at 3031 16 id at 2627 17 id at 1718 calling the juvenile courts constitutional and th eoretical bases debatable and stating that in practice the results are unsatisfactory further the court asserted that principle and procedure cannot be substituted by

g346g561cases23 the court expressly held that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he or she is charged24 finding that juveniles are constitutionally entitled to the reasonable doubt standard the court stated the same considerations that demand extreme caution in factfinding to protect the innocent adult apply as well to the innocent child25 the court rejected the states argument that the delinquency adjudication is civil proceeding that did not require due process protections calling this argument the civil label of convenience26 g15g140g13g142g146g159g142g155g561g159g495g561g18g142g151g151g156g162g149g159g138g151g146g138g561 by 1970 the supreme court had ruled that the due process notion of fundamental fairness entitled juveniles to various procedural protections in juvenile court however in mckeiver v pennsylvania 27 the court held that juveniles do not have fundamental right to jury trial when being adjudicated in the juvenile justice system28 mckeive r was consolidation of three similar appeals involving minors adjudicated delinquent in juvenile court by judges who had rejected their requests for jury to serve as factfinder at their hearing29 the court narrowed the issue presented to whether the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment ensured the right to trial by jury in the adjudicative phase of juvenile court delinquency proceeding30 after reviewing its previous juvenile court jurisprudence the court first considered whether the right to jury was automatically guaranteed to minors by the sixth and fourteenth amendments 31 although it had never expressly characterized juvenile court proceedings as criminal prosecutions within the meaning and reach of the sixth amendment the court reiterated that the juvenile court system reflected many of the adult criminal courts punitive aspects32 however plurality of the court rejected the argument that adjudicatory proceedings were substantively similar to criminal trials33 reasoning that jury trial was only constitutionally 23 id at 36163 stating that the reasonable doubt standard has always been assumed to be the requisite standard of proof in criminal cases and that there has been ubiquitous adoption of this standard by the states 24 id at 364 expressing that the reasonable doubt standard is indispensable as safeguard against convictions resting on factual error and to maintain the communitys respect and confidence in the criminal law system 25 id at 365 26 id at 36566 rejecting the civil nature argument as untenable after gault and discarding the argument that incorporating due process rights in juvenile proceeding would necessarily equate deli nquency adjudication with criminal conviction destroy the confidentiality of the proceeding formalize the proceeding and delay the adjudicatory process 27 403 us 528 1971 28 id at 545 29 id at 53438 30 id at 541 stating that the court would limit its analysis to whether the fundamental fairness standard of due process required juveniles the right to elect jury in delinquency proceedings 31 id at 540 stating that the sixth amendment guarantees the right to an impartial jury in all criminal prosecutions under federal law and the fourteenth amendment compels states to grant jury trial in state courts if one is held in federal court 32 id at 541 33 id at 54142 arguing that an adjudication mirrored criminal trial because the petition charged violation of the penal code in language similar to an indictment juveniles were detained in facilities similar to adult prisons prior to their hearings defense counsel and the prosecution conducted

g347g561required if due process required factfinding by jury34 in support of its conclusion that jury is unnecessary for fair factfinding the plurality noted that equity cases workmens compensation cases probate matters deportation cases and military trials among others had been traditionally decided by judges without juries35 in reaching its decision the court expressed doubt as to whether imposing such right would improve the factfinding ability of juvenile courts in addition the court reasoned that imposing such right would jeopardize the unique nature of the juvenile system and blur the distinctions between juvenile court and adult criminal court36 to do so would make the juvenile system obsolete the pl uralitys holding signaled the courts return to the more paternalistic approach it had rejected in its previous opinions and marked the end of the era of expansion of procedural rights in juvenile adjudications37

host of questions that may warrant reexamination of the issue first some are likely to argue that the increasingly punitive nature of cases adjudicated in the juvenile justice system calls into question the validity of the courts reasoning underlying its holding in mckeiver that juveniles are not entitled to the right to jury trial 38 when the court decided mckeiver it did so to maintain the civil and rehabilitative nature of the juvenile justice system39 at the time of the decision juvenile adjudication hearings were closed to the public the system was informal and the records of the juvenile adjudications were confidential and not relied on in criminal prosecutions40 currently some juvenile adjudication hearings are open to the public the system is more formal and adversarial and juvenile adjudications are frequently used in criminal prosecutions for sentence continued delinquency adjudication amounted to criminal conviction 34 id at 545 refraining from holding that all rights constitutionally ensured to adult criminal defendants extend to minors and noting that the gault and winship courts incorporated the right to notice counsel confrontation cross examination and reasonable doubt standard of proof because those rights were considered essential to adequate fact finding and therefore required by due process 35 id at 543 acknowledging the benefits of jury but finding that defendant may be treated as fairly by judge alone as he or she would be by jury 36 id at 547 the court reasoned that the noncriminal juvenile justice system in place provided certain rehabilitative benefits to juveniles the court concluded that granting juveniles the right to jury trial would threaten these rehabilitative benefits to juveniles by creating delay imposing formality forcing juvenile courts to be more adversarial and possibly even resulting in public trials 37 because mckeiver held that juveniles are not constitutionally guaranteed the right to jury some states

g348g561enhancement41 from their perspective the civil and rehabilitative nature of the juvenile justice system has shifted to more punitive one which more closely resembles the adult criminal justice system central to the mckeiver s holding was the courts conclusion that juries were not essential to accurate factfinding however this premise may be called into question in light of the courts reemphasis on the importance of jury in series of cases the us supreme court has recognized and emphasized the important role that juries play in criminal proceedings in duncan v louisiana 42 the us supreme court held that the right to jury trial is fundamental and guaranteed by due process in williams v florida 43 the court reaffirmed that the purpose of the jury trial is to prevent oppression by the government44 the us supreme court recognized the superiority of group decisionmaki ng over individual judgments in ballew v georgia 45 which defined the constitutional minimum number of jurors that state must empanel in criminal prosecution in ballew the court relying on empirical data found that jury composed of less than six members was less likely to foster effective group deliberation and more likely to lead to inaccurate factfinding and incorrect application of the communitys common sense to the facts in addition the court concluded that smaller panel could increase the risk of convicting an innocent person more recently the court has stressed the constitutional necessity of juries rather than judges making factual determinations upon which sentences are based46 the courts reasoning in ballew and subsequent cases regarding factfinding by juries during sentencing may call into question the courts conclusion in mckeiver that jury would not improve the fact finding ability and fairness of juvenile courts47 an argument can also be made that the absence of jury trial in the adjudicatory process could lead to inequities in other criminal proceedings for example recidivist statutes such as the 41 for example the armed career criminal act acca requires imposition of minimum 15year term of imprisonment for unlawful possession of firearm in violation of 18 usc 922g by an individual with three prior serious drug or violent felony convictions congress defined the term conviction to include finding that person has committed an act of juvenile delinquency involving violent felony 18 usc 924e2c 42 391 us 145 1968 43 399 us 78 1970holding that the constitutional guarantee of jury trial does not require that jury membership be fixed at 12 44 399 us at 100 stating that providing an accused with the right to be tried by jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant biased or eccentric judge 45 435 us 223 23239 1978 stating that when individual and group decisionmaking were compared in social scientific studies it was seen that groups performed better b ecause prejudices of individuals were frequently counterbalanced and objectivity resulted groups exhibited selfcriticism b ecause juries frequently face complex problems laden with value choices these benefits are important in particular the counterbalancing of various biases is critical to the accurate application of the common sense of the community to the facts of any given case 46 see jones v united states

terms of imprisonment based on prior juvenile misconduct some state and lower federal courts have found that equating juvenile adjudications with conviction as predicate offense for the purposes of state recidivism statutes subverts the civil nature of the juvenile adjudication to an extent that makes it fundamentally unfair and thus violative of due process50 one way to remedy the perceived inequities in using nonjury juvenile adjudication as sentence enhancements critics of the current system maintain might be to grant juveniles right to jury trial during adjudicatory hearings
