medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 table of contents 5emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 important this is the first draft set of the emergency medical dispatch section of the cards project as with any medical product or device these protocols are only offered as suggestion you should consult with your local medical director state regulatory office or other regulating body before using any of these protocols they come with guarantee as to the soundnessquality or accuracy of the protocols the cards are based on the recommendations of the united states national highway traffic safety administration several different formats were studied in the creation of these card sets and what we felt were the best ideas being incorporated into this set1 however this is not set in stone unlike other emd protocol card sets you can modify these to meet the needs of your agency this emd protocol set is released under the creative common license under the license for this protocol set you can modify the protocols create as many copies as you like and share the protocols with others you are not allowed to sell them you should make sure that the open ises project is noted as the original author of the protocols if you modify them you should also note that as well using the cards in this book the cards in this book are designed to be printed out on color printer using 85 x 11inch paper the paper is then folded in half and placed into flip card holder when in use the cards are read from top to bottom with the key questions being asked first then the proper dispatch code red or yellow followed by prearrival instructions to be given to the caller there are call taker prompts to reinforce certain actions and short dispatch guide these cards are presented as guide to help your agency get started in providing emd services your agency must decide what questions to maintain what questions to change your agency must decide how you wish to respond based on the answers you receive from the caller if you have any comments or suggestions concerning this card set please drop us line and let us know our goal is to make the cards project useful to as many psaps as possible we can only do that through your help 1the new jersey office of telecommunications httpwwwstatenjus911traininghtml emd card set httpwwwstatenjus9112006emdguidecardpdf was major

academy of emergency dispatch httpwwwemergencydispatchorg and the association of publicsafety communications officials httpwwwapcointlorg provided additional information used in the development of this card set 6emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 introduction the following guide on emergency medical dispatch emd is designed as an introduction to this combination of ems and emergency dispatch emergency medical dispatch is more than just reading cards and simply downloading this set of cards alone is not adequate to implement an emd program these cards are just the beginning this manual will review some of the common components of successful emd program this book was created by reviewing numerous sources of information related to emd we are grateful to the many agencies state and local that have made their material available like the card set we have adapted what we believe are the best practices from all of these varied programs the other area that you should be aware of as you move forward to creating your own emd program is the rules regulations and laws that apply to your specific jurisdiction you should research what is required for your area you may find that there are few if any regulations concerning emd you may find that there are broad based state requirements but nothing at the local level you must comply with your local laws when instituting an emd program you may find that you need to craft your own emd legislation 7emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 emd program components there are some common components in every emd program these components are necessary to create successful program we will highlight these components below and explain little about each of them emd protocols the emd protocol are probably the most visible component of any emd program it is the part the everyone seems to focus on first the bulk of this book is dedicated to bringing you set of emd protocols the protocols should be reviewed by your call takers your ems folks and your medical director you need to make sure that these protocols comply with your local regulations in the end they must be approved by your medical director before they can be used in call taking situation emd training you simply cant put up set of protocols and expect your call takers to use them without any training there is more to using the emd protocols than simply reading questions from card your call takers need to understand why they are using the cards what types of situations they can expect when using the cards and how the emd protocols fit in with the overall health care system it is often forgotten that many people enter the health care system through their local ems agency as call takers you open the door to their entry into the system continuing dispatch education once you train the call takers in the skill of emergency medical dispatching you have only started the process like the emt paramedic nurse and physician on going education is must for the emergency medical dispatcher as well medicine changes and so does the need to keep up with these changes cqi standards how do you as the director of psap know that the protocols are being followed can you be sure that the protocols are being followed the same way at 100am and at 100pm for care providers the most common form of review is retrospective chart review looking at what the provider has written indicating how they treated the patient similar process is conducted with the emd protocols it is retrospective review of the emergency call for help it should also not be understated that the cqi process should always be looking at how the system is performing and how the system can be changed to bring about improvement fortunately using system like cards 911 you can make any changes to the system you wish as an open source product you have the freedom to try new ideas new protocols new techniques and not worry about violating anyones license policies procedures program can function without the proper policies and procedures in place the same is true for any emd program you should consider the policies necessary for the smooth implementation of the program medical direction any emd program is at its core collection of medical protocols when dealing with medicine medical oversight by physician is an absolute necessity your medical director should review the protocols the instructions and all of the components of the emd program during this review process you should also make sure program meets all the requirements rules and regulations of your local jurisdiction ultimately your medical director has to authorize the use of the emd protocols 8emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 records management when you begin your emd program you also need to make sure you have good records management system in place local state andor federal regulations may dictate how long you need to keep your records on file if you dont have good records management system in place now is the time to get one up and running lot of information is going to be created by any emd program you will need to secure this information and have it available in the event of legal discovery etc 9emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 card design there are four basic designs used in the cards emd set each style is designed for specific purpose the current card styles are all callers incident cards instruction sequential cards instruction flow chart cards we will look at each type of card and the specific role each style of card will play in the set all callers the first type is the all callers card it contains nine questions that every caller should be asked the first two questions where is your emergency and what is the phone number you are calling from need to have the answers confirmed this is very important in case the caller becomes disconnected question 3 shows the very first jump link if the caller indicates that the emergency is motor vehicle collision mvc the call taker should jump to card t10 which is the mvc card if you are using the tickets version of the card set you will notice that the card name t10 mvc is underlined and in blue as seen in the graphic on the right if you click on any of the underlined items the card set will go automatically to that particular card the tickets card set works exactly like web page utilizing hyperlinks question 4 has the very first condition statement the question is asking how many people are hurt followed by the conditional statement if not obvious if the caller has already told you the number of people injured for example we have 6 people burned at the gas station or my mother is very sick then the question does not need to be asked as call taker if there is any doubt in your mind as to how many people may be injured always the caller the question you will see other types of conditional statements in the card set the most common are if yes or if in reference to previously asked question if we look at question 8 on card c6 we see the question reads does the person have medic alert tag if the caller answers yes then the conditional statement directly underneath would be asked if yes what does it say when all nine questions on the card have been asked you should be able to switch to the next type of card which is incident card 10 emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 incident cards there are four different groups of incident cards the are divided as follows c critical care events green banner h hazardous incidents orange banner m medical incidents blue banner t traumatic incidents dark red banner these cards ask specific questions related to the incident if at any time the call taker realizes they should be on different card the caller says something the clarifies the incident the call taker should jump to that card always use the card that best fits the perceived emergency the incident cards are used to determine the severity of the incident to get the right equipment and personnel route to the scene and to offer aid instructions to the caller so that they can begin providing care prior to the first responders arriving on the scene the cards are designed to flow from top to bottom you select the card that best fits the emergency the caller described during the all callers interrogation the card is identified by letter number and color key questions then you proceed to ask caller all of the key questions the number and types of questions will vary depending on the type of incident it is important that all of the questions be asked exactly as written regardless of who writes the questions the answers are used to determine the type of dispatch dispatch there are two categories of dispatch code red and code yellow code red incidents are generally the higher priority incidents and would require advanced life support intervention code yellow incidents are typically the lower priority incidents and generally require on basic life support interventions it is important that all of the key questions are asked so that you can properly determine which dispatch category to classify the incident 11 emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 prearrival instructions the second card in the set begins with the prearrival instructions pais at the top depending on the nature and severity of the incident you may have to go straight to the instruction cards such as the cpr instructions specified in item 1 above most of the instructions are basic information to help the caller prepare for the arrival of the emergency responders call taker prompts at the bottom of the card is section marked call taker prompts this area will contain information for the call taker andor dispatcher to consider while using the specific card in our example on the previous page it reminds the call taker that agonal respirations are ineffective breaths that occur after cardiac arrest if the caller is describing breathing that appears to be agonal the call taker can use that information to better guide the caller in providing care and dispatching the proper units dispatcher short report the dispatcher short report is an outline of the information that should be relayed to responding units the list contains basic information about the patient and the incident this type of information will help the responding units better prepare for the patient note it is ultimately the agencys responsibility how they use the emd cards the agency can modify the cards in any way that they choose they can change any of the key questions the prearrival instructions the dispatch report or the call taker prompts further the agency needs to determine what type of response they will send on every incident these cards are merely guidelines always follow the guidance of your local medical direction 12emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 instructional cards the instruction cards are designed to help the caller give life saving aid in the minutes before help arrives these cards are different from the prearrival instructions the instruction cards are used for critical care events such as cardiac arrest choking and child birth sequential cards there are two styles of instruction cards the first style is sequential the cards are sectioned off into blocks and the blocks are numbered in ordered the call taker would start with block one and continue through each block in order this style of card is used for the aed and bleeding control flow chart the second style of instructional card is the flow chart in the flow chart the call taker gives the caller an instruction if they can comply they follow the yes line and if they cant they follow the line this allows instructions to be given that are flexible to meet the current situation like the sequential cards the call taker should make sure that the caller has completed the instructions in the current section before proceeding to the next section 13 emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 creating your own emd cards there are two components involved in creating your own emd cards the medicinal logic behind the questions asked the actual creation of the cards and the tools used we will begin by discussing the logic behind the cards and the types of things to consider as you create your own emd cards card categories one of the first things to consider when creating your own emd cards is how to categorize them all callers will go through an initial screening process in this set it is called the all callers interrogation card this card helps you ascertain the location of the incident and any immediate life threatening conditions it also acts as form of initial triage the categories are important in conducting the initial triage during the phone interview the categories help get you quickly to the card within the category that best matches the incident the caller is describing the nhtsa emd managers guide talks about the two major types of medical categories individual chief complaints traumatic incident types the guide also talks about subset call time life critical events2 the cards 911 emd project uses similar categories the critical care events are the equivalent to the time life critical events the traumatic incidents are the same the medical incident is the equivalent of the individual chief complaint we have added an additional category called hazardous incidents critical care events these are the cards in the green section critical care events are those incidents where time is of the essence medical care needs to be given immediately in order to effect positive outcome these cards include cardiac arrest choking drowning electrocution childbirth unconscious with each of these cards there is typically need to deliver instructions to the caller the critical care instructions are located on the yellow instruction section these instructions are given until the first responders arrive on the scene when creatingmodifying these critical care event cards you need to consider how it will impact the instruction cards these two sets of cards work together to create seamless effort to discern the nature of the emergency and then to provide life saving instructions to the caller until help arrives traumatic incidents there are ten traumatic incident cards in this set these protocols are used when someone is injured there are two instruction cards that may be used in conjunction with this section trauma airway control bleeding control most of the time you will simply want the caller to make sure the injured person is not moved and additional injuries occur most trauma incidents make it 2emd program implementation and administration managers guide nhtsa 31 august 1995 page a3 14emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 when creatingmodifying these cards you need to consider what information is needed to determine what is the cause of the injury and what equipment should be sent is the trauma related to criminal action law enforcement involvement or hazardous environment perhaps structure collapse medical incidents medical incidents are perhaps the most common request for 911 here the type of calls for assistance run the range from the proverbial stubbed toe to the person having chest pain it is also not uncommon for person to have combination of medical conditions there may also be problems with misunderstanding of common medical terms when creating medical incident card be aware of what you are trying to find out is difference between two medical conditions important enough that it will affect the type of unitresponse that is sent to the patient hazardous incidents these are incidents that tend to deal with probability that multiple patients will be encountered there is also the probability that the responders will be facing much greater degree of hazard to themselves these calls may overlap with other trauma related incidents keep in mind the idea behind hazardous cards is that the incident will most likely effect more than just the immediate patient it may also involve more than primary medical response critical care instructions the critical care instructions are given when there is an event that requires immediate care to be rendered these are often high stress situations they are typically being given to someone who has little to medical training and they did not want to learn to perform the skill today the good news is that most life saving techniques are very simple to perform when creating critical care instructions it is important to break the skill down to very small simple steps make sure the call taker is telling the caller to do primarily one thing at time the caller may have to put the phone down and move to where the patient is located you dont want them to have to remember too many things or they will forget everything 15emergency medical dispatch guide cards draft version 0262 sample authorization none of the emd cards should be used until they have been reviewed by the appropriate medical authority many jurisdictions consider emd call taking questions and instructions as medical protocols being considered medical protocols they need to be approved by physician this activity will typically be performed by your local agencies medical director some jurisdictions may require approval not just at the agency level but may require authorizationapproval at the local or state level below is sample authorization statement that you can use on the emd card set 16emergency medical dispatch card protocol authorization
