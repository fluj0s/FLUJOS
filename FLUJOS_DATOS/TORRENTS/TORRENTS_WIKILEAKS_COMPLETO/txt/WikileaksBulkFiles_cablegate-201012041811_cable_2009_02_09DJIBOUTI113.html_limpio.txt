classified by eric wong dcm us department of state us embassy djibouti reason 14d 1 c summary us security firm blackwater worldwide bw has received permission from the government of djibouti to operate an armed ship from the port of djibouti to protect commercial shipping from pirates off the coast of somalia blackwaters usflagged ship is expected to arrive in early march and will have crew of 33 amcits including three 6man armed teams who will operate in continuous shifts the djiboutian navy will secure blackwaters weapons ie 50caliber machine guns while ashore in djibouti blackwater does not intend to take any pirates into custody but will use lethal force against pirates if necessary it is developing an sop that is currently under legal review and will be shared with the usg blackwaters counterpiracy operation does not have any clients yet but blackwater expects business to develop following public launch in djibouti in march with godj officials end summary 2 c on feb 8 exfso robert emmett downey blackwater worldwides development manager for africa provided the following update to amb swan dcm and bob patterson tdy from embassy nairobi hassan said khairehtriplehatted as djiboutis national security advisor head of the securityintelligence service and director of president guellehs military officehas given bw permission to operate its armed ship in djibouti bw met with hassan said on feb 7 following an earlier meeting in washdc between bws ceo erik prince and cofer black with djiboutian amb to the us robleh olhaye this is the only such arrangement so far that bw has made with host government in the region but bw will likely engage oman and kenya in the future eg in the event of mechanical malfunction the only facilities capable of repairing bws ship are located in mombasa within the usg bw has briefed africom centcom and embassy nairobi officials b bws ship is the mcarthur usflagged 183foot exnoaa vessel while it has landing space for two helicopters it will have an unarmed uav but helicopters which bw considers too expensive the ship will be armed with 50caliber machine guns and is able to protect 3ship convoy the djiboutian navy will secure bws weapons once ashore and will inspect bws weapons lockers according to downey bws business concepthaving its armed ship escort other ships requiring protectionis consistent with recent imoindustry recommendations discouraging the carriage of firearms or the presence of embarked armed security teams aboard commercial ships themselves eg see reftel on the 85th session of the imo maritime safety committee the mcarthur will dock in djibouti for 3672 hours every 30 days to replenish its stores according to downey bw is the only such firm with its own ship c all personnel on bws ship will be us citizens comprising 15 crew and 18 armed security personnel three 6man teams who will operate in continuous 8hour shifts these 33 operators will rotate every 60 days for medical contingencies bw has arrangedthrough its local agent in djibouti inchcape londonbased international shipper with numerous business activities in djiboutiaccess to bouffard the french military hospital in djibouti the mcarthur will arrive in djibouti in early march after transitting gilbraltar and acaba jordan bw ceo erik prince plans to travel to dj for its public launch d downey underscored bws emphasis on compliance with us laws including defense trade controls bw has vp for export compliance and depends on the usg dod for contracts bws ship the mcarthur will have video cameras to record bw counterpiracy activities bw has intention of taking any pirates into custody while the french have previously put pirates ashore in puntland downey said bw had plans to do so either in somalia or kenya noting that kenyas bilateral puc agreements with the usg and hmg were governmenttogovernment bw will share its sop with embassies djibouti and nairobi once approved sop is currently under legal review as there is precedent for paramilitary operation in purely commercial environment while asserting that international maritime law allows the use of lethal force against pirates bw djibouti 00000113 002 of 002 also recognizes the need to respect international humanitarian obligations of concern for example is whether bw would be responsible for assisting injured pirates if doing so endangered bws ability to protect its clients f bws local agent in djibouti is inchcape bruno pardigon general manager of the newly formed djibouti maritime security services dmss will provide bw with license following completion of an mou with dmss downey was unsure whether dmss was parastatal or quasigovernment agency of the godj comment pardigon is favorably known to the embassy as frenchdjiboutian businessman and marine conservationist who runs diving operation in djibouti while downey will remain in djibouti until march 2009 bw has plans now to establish an office in djibouti g while protection is estimated to cost less than 200000 per trip bws djibouti operation has contracts yet for clients downey commented that the shipping industry may assess that piracy is declining only 3 ships were pirated in january 2009 there are at least 4 foreign naval vessels currently docked in djibouti conducting counterpiracy operations and the eus operation atalanta is providing military escort of ships 3 u comment djiboutis decision to permit blackwater to begin counterpiracy operations follows ongoing godj efforts aimed at addressing the piracy threat djibouti recently hosted an imo conference on somali piracy that inter alia recommended djibouti serve as center for maritime training numerous foreign military counterpiracy operations are based in djiboutiinvolving units from spain france the uk the netherlands and other eu members japan septel and korea are also considering military deployments to djibouti to support counterpiracy efforts djibouti is founding member of the contact group on piracy off the coast of somalia cgpcs and has offered to host the groups planned counterpiracy coordination cell 4 c comment continued blackwaters presence in djibouti would make it one of the largest us businesses operating in the country as the host of the only us military base in africa as well as country with extensive commercial port facilities djibouti has commercial interest in supporting foreign investors including us contractors blackwater executives seek to involve both djiboutian and usg principals in highprofile march 2009 launch post would appreciate departments guidance on the appropriate level of engagement with blackwater while also fulfilling the usgs commercial advocacy responsibilities to support us firms end comment swan
