of insurance janice rubin american law division baird webel government and finance division april 6 2007 abstract identical bipartisan bills s 618 and hr 1081 that would eliminate the current mccarranferguson act antitrust exemption for the business of insurance in force since 1945 have been introduced in the 110th congress their impact if enacted is unclear they would each amend 15 usc 1012b to make the antitrust laws and the federal trade commission act fcta as it relates to unfair methods of competition speciÔ¨Åcally applicable to such business the fcta as it relates to areas other than unfair competitionemphasis added would however continue to apply to the business of insurance to the extent that it is not regulated by state law due largely to the importance of information sharing to insurers the insurance industry in the past has cooperated in variety of ways including sharing loss information jointly developing policy forms and rates operating residual market mechanisms and participating in state guaranty funds some forms of cooperation particularly joint rate making and mandatory advisory rates have already been curtailed because of antitrust concerns other forms of industry cooperation however might be considered illegal under federal antitrust laws if s 618 or hr 1081 were to become law the precise impact of these bills on the insurance industry would depend critically on future court decisions in particular the cooperation that insurance companies currently undertake might be judged legally permissible under the state action doctrine before this area of law would be settled however it would arguably involve numerous lawsuitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22639g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

sponsorship of senators specter lott reid and landrieu he did so by first noting that the insurance industry has operated largely beyond the reach of federal antitrust laws for more than six decades concerned by the manner in which insurers operating in the gulf coast region have been interpreting their policy related responsibilities he stated that if there ever was there is longer any justification to exempt the insurance industry from federal government oversight 1 hr 1081 an identical bill was introduced on the same day by representative defazio with similar bipartisan co sponsorship representatives taylor melancon alexander and jones of north carolina the bills have been referred to their respective judiciary committees with the house bill also being referred to the committees on energy and commerce and financial services for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned currently 15 usc 1012b declares that the antitrust laws shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law since virtually all states regulate the insurance industry the effect is to immunize the business of insurance from application of the federal antitrust laws both bills would remove the to the extent language so that the federal antitrust laws would be applicable to the business of insurance 2 the single exception to the blanket application of federal antitrust law to the business of insurance is however that both bills would specify that the federal trade commission ftc act3 as it relates to areas other than unfair methods of competition4 would continue to be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law5 both measures would delete 15 usc 1013 in which the 79th congress 1 made the antitrust laws inapplicable to the business of insurance until june 30 1948 but 2 specified at the same 1 153 c ong rec s2045 feb 15 2007 2 although as is discussed in crs report rl33683 courts narrow mccarranfer guson antitrust exemption for business of insurance viability of sta action doctrine as an alternative by janice rubin removal might not be fatal to the industry it is also noted here that th antitrust modernization commission amc created by congress in the amc act of 2002 pl 107233 amended by pl 1106 while not specifically recommending the repeal of mccarranferguson did however in its final april 2007 report to congress characterize the exemption as questionable at 351 the commission recommended with respect to all immunities th at congress consult with the ftc and the antitrust division of the department of ju stice about whether the conduct at issue could subject the actors to antitrust liability and the likely competitive effects of the existing or proposed immunity and that congress require proponents of an immunity to submit evidence showing that consumer welfare achieved through competition has less value than the goal promoted by the im munity and the immunity is the least restrictive means to achieve that goal at 21 the amc website which includes the entire report can be found at httpwwwamcgov 3 the ftc act is codified at 15 usc 41 et seq section 5 15 usc 45 contains the commissions unfairness jurisdiction 4 section 2a1b of each bill emphasis added 5 it is noted that the bills insertions as prescribed woul d result in runon sentence as there is punctuation specified between the first insertion as it relates to unfa ir methods of competition presumably ending with the business of insurance and the sec ond which makes the ftc act as it relates to areas other than unfair methods of competition applicable to the business of insurance to the ex tent that such business is not regulated by state law it is further noted that it might be preferable to not retain the phrase that after june 30 1948 as the bills are currently drafted the new provision would read that after june 30 1948 the antitrust laws and the federal trade commission act as it relates to unfair methods of competition shall be applicable to the business of insurance from that date to the date of enactment of any proposed change the antitrust laws were in fact not applicable to the business of insurance w

many industries have an economic incentive to cooperate in ways such as creating cartels or pricefixing that could result in general inefficiency and ultimately harm to the consumer this possible consumer harm is one of the underlying reasons for the antitrust laws due to the specific economics of the insurance industry however cooperation among insurers may very well result in greater efficiencies and possibly lower prices for consumers insurance depends critically on insurers possessing large quantity of information to allow them to judge and price risks accurately in theoretical world of perfect information and competition every consumer would pay premium that covered his risk and the resulting overall amount paid by consumers would be the lowest possible amount that would cover the aggregate losses to the group as whole if insurers can pool their information the resulting rates can more accurately reflect risk and thus be lower for consumers as whole although some individual consumers may 6 section 2a2 of each bill if the antitrust laws are fully pplicable to the business of insurance there would be need for boycott exception 7 section 2b of each bill 15 usc

information sharing as they do not have large volume of information of their own to analyze the theoretically perfect world however assumes competition between insurers that would serve to reduce premium rates too much cooperation between insurers could dampen this competition reducing the consumer benefit that comes from allowing insurers to share information insurer cooperation and information sharing revolves around advisory organizations also known as ratings bureaus9 some form of these organizations has existed for nearly as long as insurance has existed in the united states at their most basic form they gather data from the various insurers aggregate and analyze this data and provide the aggregated data back to the insurers for use in setting future rates in practice they have done and continue to do good deal more than this historically rating bureaus formulated final rates that insurers might charge for particular policies and in some cases required participating insurers to use the bureaus suggested rates having central organization create insurance rates whether mandatory or not raised serious antitrust concerns by the early 1990s the main advisory organizations had ceased publishing fully formed rates advisory organizations continue however to collect aggregate and analyze data providing not only historical loss data but also estimates of future loss data and future insurer expense data some maintain that this estimation of future data known as trending raises similar antitrust concerns as the creation of final rates 10 another primary activity of advisory organizations is the creation and filing of insurance policy forms insurance policy forms are complex legal documents and as controversies over insurance coverage for new yorks world trade center and for buildings damaged in katrina have shown many millions of dollars may ride on the interpretation of handful of words joint creation of these forms allows for the sharing of the legal tale nt needed to create the forms and some would argue promotes comparison shopping by consum ers by reducing the confusion that could result from multiple policy forms being offered by different companies since the states generally require the filing of policy forms for state approval using jointly created form that has already been filed with the states significantly reduces the regulatory burden on single insurer the uniformity of policy forms however also may reduce consumer choice if one were shopping for particular policy feature that was not part of the standard form it might be impossible or very costly to find an insurance policy that would meet this particular need further industry cooperation both through the ad visory organizations and other statecreated mechanisms occurs in state residual market mechanisms and state guaranty funds residual market mechanisms are often created to insure availability of insurance that is legally mandated such as workers compensation or auto insurance while such mechanisms differ significantly between states they may have advisory organizations administering them or require some other joint action by insurers such as splitting up highrisk insureds who are unable to find insurance in the regular market which might be considered market allocation state guaranty funds are intended to protect the policyholders in the case of insurer insolvency in general states require 9 the largest of these advisory organizations today are the insurance services office iso and the american association of insurance services aais for general propertycasualty insurance and the national council on compensation insurance ncci for workers compensation insurance 10 see the testimony of robert hunter before

of challenges on grounds of unfair collaboration or collusion if mccarranferguson antitrust protection for the business of insurance is in fact curtailed or abolished many lawsuits challenging some of these insurer practices as violations of the federal antitrust laws are likely if all of the cited examples of cooperation were found to be in violation it would necessitate major changes in the operation of insurers particularly small insurers which do not have large pools of information from their own experience should additional data be unavailable to small insurers in some way it would likely drive consolidation in the insurance industry as small insurers merge in order to gain the competitive advantage of additional information this outcome however is only one of range of possibilities it is also possible that many of the cooperative activities that insurers engage in would be found to be permissible under the state action doctrine 11

possibility of numerous perhaps lengthy lawsuits to clarify which practices of insurers are antitrust violations and of significant upheaval in the insurance industry congress might take note of its solution to another litigationrelated problem that arose more than 20 years ago congress was confronted then with the concerns of municipalities facing antitrust suits on account of certain activities the prospect of trebledamage antitrust liability in suits brought against municipalitieschallenging eg municipal designation of an authorized taxicab company operation of an airport or the awarding of cable television franchiseswas unsettling to municipalities even though defendants were often fo und not liable many municipalities voiced concerns about expenditures of both time and tax dollars read in the insurance context costs often translated into increased insurance premiums during hearings or in other communications to congress in response congress enacted the local government antitrust act of 1984 12 which inter alia prescribes that damages interest on damages costs or attorneys fees may be recovered under 15 usc 15 15a or 15c in any claim against person based on any official action directed by local government or official or employ ee thereof acting in an official capacity 13 subsequent to the enactment of the local government act the number of challenges to municipal activity significantly abated while inserting similar provision into bill such as s 618 or hr 1081 would reduce the financial incentive to file suit for insurer antitrust violations the absence of private damages does not remove the authority of the courts to issue injunctive 11 the state action doctrine was first enunciated by the supreme court in1943 parker v brown 317 us 341 it is based on the concept of federalism and is the reason the fe deral antitrust laws are not applicable to the states the doctrine has over the years been interpreted clarified and expanded to the point that it now confers antitrust immunity not only on the states qua states including state agencies and officials who act in furtherance of statedirected activity but also on those who act pursuant to statesanctioned but not necessarily mandated courses of action its essence is captured in the twopart test set out in california retail liquor dealers assn v midcal aluminum inc 445 us 97 1980 first the challenged restraint must be clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy eg in legislatively enacted statute second the policy must be actively supervised and subject to enforcement by the state itself 12 pl 98544 15 usc 3436 13 15 usc 36a
