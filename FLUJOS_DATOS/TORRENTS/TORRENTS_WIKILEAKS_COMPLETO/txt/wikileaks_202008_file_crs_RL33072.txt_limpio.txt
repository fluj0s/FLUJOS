during the october 26 hirc hearing committee chairman henry hyde called strange and unusual the administrations minimal consultation with congress on the details of such plans and said he was troubled by public statements from the administration suggesting that congressional support for such cooperation was broad and virtually guaranteed2 in november letter which echoed much of the analysis of nongovernmental hearing witnesses group of 18 experts scholars and former us government officials urged members of the congress to critically examine the proposed nuclear cooperation agreement saying it poses farreaching and potentially adverse implications for us nuclear nonproliferation objectives and is unlikely to bring india into closer alignment with other us strategic objectives3 in late january us ambassador to india mulford caused diplomatic stir when he explicitly linked progress on the proposed nuclear deal with indias upcoming international atomic energy agency iaea vote on iran saying if india chose not to vote with the united states he believed the usindia initiative will die in the congress state department spokesman called the ambassadors comments personal opinion and denied that the issues were linked indias external affairs ministry responded that india categorically rejects any attempts to link the two issues and opposition and leftist indian political figures criticized the remarks as serious affront to india and its sovereignty4 on february 4 india voted with the majority and the united states on an iaea resolution to refer iran to the security council new delhi called the resolution wellbalanced and insisted that its vote should not be interpreted as detracting from indias traditionally close relations with iran the united states later expressed being pleased with indias vote5 developments relevant to civil nuclear cooperation with india have progressed in countries other than the united states in september 2005 india and france issued joint statement promising that the two countries would work toward conclusion of bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement and france committed itself to working with other countries and the nsg to accomplish

nearly half of the worlds unmined uranium indicated that it might alter its policy of not selling this resource to nonsignatories of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty meaning india may become

should acquire the same benefits and advantages as other such states and president bushs assurance that he would work on achieving full civilian nuclear energy cooperation with india8 such cooperation would require changes in both us law and nuclear suppliers group nsg guidelines this clause is widely viewed as representing the most direct if still implicit recognition to date of indias facto status as nuclear weapons state and thus as reversal of more than three decades of us nonproliferation policy notably omitted from the july 18 statement was any mention of indias aspirations for permanent seat on the security council just weeks earlier the united states and india signed tenyear defense framework agreement9 many observers view this and other us moves to build strategic relations with india as part of an effort to counterbalance the rise of china as major power although both washington and new delhi insist that their strategic cooperation is not directed against any third party this report reviews the major provisions of usindia bilateral agreements signed in 2005 and further explicated in march 2006 including the status of issues addressed in the now completed

bipolarity in 1991 the same year that new delhi began efforts to transform its once quasisocialist economy through fiscal reform and market opening however relations with india continued to be viewed primarily through the lens of us nonproliferation interests the marked improvement of relations that began in the latter months of the clinton administration president clinton spent six days in india

steps in strategic partnership nssp initiative which sought to address longstanding indian interests by expanding bilateral cooperation in the areas of civilian nuclear activities civilian space programs and hightechnology trade and expanding dialogue on missile defense13 in march 2005 the bush administration unveiled new strategy for south asia based in part on judgment that the nssp was insufficiently broad and that sets as goal to help india become major world power in the 21st century14 nongovernmental proponents of closer usindia security cooperation often refer to the rise of china and its potential disturbance of asian stability as key reason to hedge by bolstering us links with india while the bush administration has sought to downplay this probable motivator pentagon officials reportedly assert that india is likely to purchase up to 5 billion worth of conventional weapons from the united states including platforms that could be useful for monitoring the chinese military15 skeptics of us embrace of india note that the indian parliament passed resolutions condemning us military operations against iraq and later declined us requests for troop contributions in

current indian prime minister three major factors have driven redefinition of usindia ties the end of the cold war the accelerating pace of globalization and the increasing influence of nearly two million indianamericans however there is concern among elements of indias security establishment and influential leftist political parties that the united states is seeking to turn india into regional client state in accord with indias traditional nonalignment sentiments leftist figures have called the july 18 joint statement overly concessional to us interests and further violation of the ruling coalitions commitment to independence in foreign affairs such criticism may have elicited assurances by indias defense ministry that decisions about any future joint indianus military operations would be strictly guided by indias national interest and the principles of its foreign and defense policies in 2003 the indian external affairs minister denied that indias relations with the united states could be used as counterforce against china saying we categorically reject such notions based on outmoded concepts like balance of power we do not seek to develop relations with one country to counterbalance another17 the administrations policy of assisting indias rise as major power has significant implications for us interests in asia and beyond the course of us relations with china and pakistan especially and the relationship between beijing and islamabad itself is likely to be affected by an increase in usindia strategic ties of most immediate interest to the us congress may be the

steps in strategic partnership and beyond since 2001 the indian government has pressed the united states to ease restrictions on the export to india of dualuse hightechnology goods as well as to increase civilian nuclear and civilian space cooperation these three key issues came to be known as the trinity and top indian officials stated that progress in these areas was necessary to provide tangible evidence of changed usindia relationship19 there were later references to quartet when the issue of missile defense was included prior to the formal launching of the nssp initiative in january 2004 the united states had sought to balance indian interests in cooperation on and trade in sensitive technologies with concerns about proliferation and security according to secretary of state powell in october 2003 we have been trying to be as forthcoming as we can because its in our interest to be forthcoming but we also have to protect certain red lines that we have with respect to proliferation because its sometimes hard to separate within space launch activities and industries and nuclear programs that which could go to weapons and that which could be used solely for peaceful purposes20 indias export controls are generally considered sturdy with some analysts calling new delhis track record comparable to or better than that of most signatories to multilateral export regimes21 however others call attention to recent us sanctions on four indian individuals and entities said to have been involved in wmdrelated transfers to iran the strategic partnership forwarded by the nssp involved progress through series of reciprocal steps in which both countries took action designed to expand engagement on nuclear regulatory and safety issues enhanced cooperation in missile defense peaceful uses of space technology and creation of an appropriate environment for increased hightechnology commerce22 despite the nutsandbolts nature of nssp efforts some analysts characterized the initiatives overarching goal increasing rather than denying new delhis access to advanced technologies as revolutionary shift in the us strategic orientation toward india23 on july 18 2005 the

agreement calls for expanded collaboration on missile defense since 1998 several indian entities have been subjected to casebycase licensing requirements and appear on the us commerce departments entity list imposing licensing requirements for exports to foreign end users involved in weapons proliferation activities in october 2001 president bush waived nuclearrelated sanctions on aid to india and the number of indian companies on the entity list was reduced from 159 to 2 primary and 14 subordinate in september 2004 as part of nssp implementation the united states modified some export licensing policies and removed the indian space research organization isro headquarters from the entity list further adjustments came in august 2005 when six more subordinate entities were removed indian companies remaining on the entity list are four subordinates of the isro four subordinates of the defense research and development organization one department of atomic energy entity and bharat dynamics limited missile production agency25 it may be that numerous indian observers will remain skeptical about the nssp process even after the july 18 joint statement viewing it in the past as mostly symbolic exercise that will not alter perceived us intention of ensuring its own technological superiority26 many such analysts believe that past us moves have not been substantive opining that changes in licensing requirements for high technology trade have been of little consequence for prospective indian buyers and progress on space and nuclear energy cooperation has been marginal months after its january 2004 launch the nssp appeared to some indian analysts to have crashed against bureaucratic obstacles in washington often an oblique reference to the nonproliferation interests of the state department27 civilian nuclear cooperation28 among the more controversial and farreaching provisions of the july 18 joint statement is an implicit recognition of indias status as nuclear weapons

regime29 the director general of the international atomic energy agency iaea has welcomed the agreement as out of the box thinking that could contribute to the enhancement of nuclear safety and security30 many favorable analysts view the decision in the context of perceived need to counterbalance rising china calling nuclear cooperation with india means of both demonstrating us resolve to assist india in increasing its power and stature and bringing new delhi into the global nonproliferation regime rather than leaving it on the outside for these observers engaging facto nuclear india as such is necessary and realistic policy31 there is evidence that indias increasingly voracious energy needs can partially be offset though increased nuclear power capacity although at present nuclear power accounts for about 26 of indias total electricity generation prime minister singh asserts that major expansion of indias capacity in this sector is imperative and india sets as its goal generation of at least 20000 megawatts of nuclear power by the year 2020 present capacity is less than 3000 mwe general electric which built indias tarapur nuclear power plant in 1969 is an american company that might see financial gains from resumed sales of nuclear fuel to india32 in april 2005 secretary of state rice noted that current us law precludes the sale of nuclear technology to india and she conceded that us nuclear cooperation with india would have quite serious implications for the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt33 critics of such cooperation insist that policy of exceptionalism toward india may permanently undermine the coercive power of the npt they say such move would seriously risk turning the existing nonproliferation regime from imperfect but useful

condoleezza rice interview with the wall street journal us department of state apr 13 2005 crs10 the bush administration for lowering the bar too much with selective and self serving policy34 many opponents worry that the joint statement exacerbates global perception that the united states cannot be counted upon to honor its own nonproliferation obligations including those made in the 1995 and 2000 npt review conferences this may encourage other supplier countries such as france russia and china to relax their own rules and provide increased aid to potential security risks such as iran pakistan and syria35 further concern is that npt member countries with advanced scientific establishments that have foresworn nuclear weapons may become tempted to develop their own such capabilities especially if negotiations over the status of iran and north korea break down36 some also see overt us strengthening of india as disruptive to existing balances of power involving both pakistan and china37 moreover some in congress do not believe the united states should sell nuclear materials to any country that is not member of the npt and which has detonated nuclear device38 during september 8 2005 hearing on usindia relations the first held after the july 18 joint statement members of the house international relations committee expressed widespread approval of increasingly warm usindia relations however many also expressed concerns about the potential damage to international nonproliferation regimes that could result from changes in us law that would allow for civil nuclear

of the conference committee but rejected by the senate side crs11 18 joint statement administration officials appearing before the panel insisted that the united states was not condoning indias nuclear weapons program and that bringing india into the mainstream of nonproliferation norms would represent net gain for international nonproliferation efforts these officials also assured the committee that the administration will do nothing to undercut nsg guidelines or the bodys consensus process even as they conceded that preliminary consultations with nsg members had brought mixed results with some expressing reservations andor opposition to making an exception for india39 many influential indian figures have weighed in with criticism of the specifics of greater usindia nuclear cooperation for example former indian prime minister vajpayee of the bharatiya janata party bjp criticized the july 18 joint statement as causing consternation among indian nuclear scientists and defense analysts his primary objections were that separating indias civilian and military nuclear facilities could erode indias ability to determine the future size of its nuclear deterrent and that the costs of such separation would be prohibitive indias main opposition bjp asserts that india stands to lose from the july 18 deal while the united states risks little claim echoed by some nongovernmental analysts40 prime minister singh has dismissed such criticisms as misguided insisting that the stipulations will not lead to any limitations on or outside interference in indias nuclear weapons program and that substantive indian action is conditional upon reciprocal us behavior41 under the heading of energy and the environment the july 18 joint statement contains an agreement to strengthen energy security and promote the development of stable and efficient energy markets in india this clause has obvious relevance to the above discussion and may also be considered in the context of us efforts to discourage india from pursuing construction of proposed pipeline that would deliver iranian natural gas to india through pakistan see regional issues section below washington

on planned indian moon mission and working to include an indian astronaut in the us astronaut training program the two nations also express readiness to expand cooperation on the global positioning

countries while meeting new delhis specific desire for advanced technologies the united states has taken the position that the burden of action rests largely on indian shoulders in this arena given past frustrations with indian trade barriers and inadequate intellectual property rights protections48 in addition to concerns about sensitive us technologies being transferred to third parties critics warn that sharing hightechnology dualuse goods with india could allow that country to advance its strategic military programs some in congress have expressed concern that providing india with dualuse nuclear technologies could allow that country to improve its nuclear weapons capabilities49 security relations since september 2001 and despite concurrent us rapprochement with pakistan

indian military officers voice frustration at what they see as inconsistent us policies and lack of us credibility53 the june defense pact and july joint statement apparently seek to mollify indian

proliferation security initiative the proliferation security initiative psi launched by president bush in may 2003 seeks to create multilateral cooperation on interdiction of wmdrelated shipments according to the state department psi is not an organization but rather an activity in which more than 60 participants cooperate and coordinate efforts new delhi has been concerned that core group comprising psis founding states represented twotiered system but has since been reassured that organization will be nondiscriminatory however indias navy chief indicates that india has reservations about the mechanics of maritime interventions and that new delhi seeks to be among the initiatives decisionmakers rather than peripheral participant57 neither the june 28 defense pact nor july 18

counterterrorism cooperation the june 28 defense pact calls for strengthening the capabilities of the us and india militaries to promote security and defeat terrorism62 usindia joint working group on counterterrorism was established in january 2000 and meets regularly the two countries also share relevant intelligence new delhi has long been concerned with the threat posed to indias security by militant islamic extremism especially as related to separatism in its jammu and kashmir state following major terrorist attacks on the united states in september 2001 washingtons own attention to this threat became greatly focused and indias offers of full cooperation with us counterterrorism efforts included base usage and territorial transit however ensuing us operations in afghanistan were better facilitated through accommodation with pakistan leaving many in new delhi uncomfortable with renewed us embrace of country that indian leaders believed to be the epicenter of terrorism thus while washington and new delhi agree on the need to combat terrorism there remains disconnect in the two countries definitions of the term and in their preferred policies for combating it globally for example the 2003 usled invasion of iraq and its aftermath gave pause to indian leaders who may have been predisposed to greater usindian counterterrorism cooperation63 united nations reform india germany brazil and japan the g4 have engaged in an effort to expand the security council unsc and gain permanent membership in that body after confirming that india is worthy candidate for such status

coordinating their efforts to defeat the g4 measure which requires twothirds majority in the general assembly for passage in what many analysts called the one substantive disappointment for india during the prime ministers dc visit the july 18 joint statement makes explicit mention of new delhis aspirations although it does reflect president bushs view that international institutions are going to have to adapt to reflect indias central and growing role many in congress have expressed support for indias permanent representation on the unsc the bush administrations position is that proposed

closely the course of usindia global partnership with an eye toward how their own geopolitical standing is affected china rising concern for us policymakers is chinas growing global reach and the consequences that chinas increasing international economic military and political influence has for us interests after decades of relatively little us attention to india recent us moves to embrace new delhi are widely seen in the context of washingtons search for friendly asian powers that may offset beijings power prevent future chinese hegemony and give washington more nuanced opportunities for leverage in asia however for many observers it appears unlikely that india will be willing to play role of balancer against china except on new delhis own terms and not those imposed from abroad in this view new delhi tends to see beijing more as an opportunity than as problem for some american analysts the emergence of an overt counterweight alliance is viewed as both misguided as policy and unlikely as an outcome65 brief but intense indiachina border war in 1962 had ended the previously friendly relationship between the two leaders of the cold war nonaligned 64 meeting of the usindia

relations with india and pakistan persistent and oftentimes perplexing aspect of us engagement in south asia has been the difficulty of maintaining moreorless balanced approach toward two antagonistic countries while simultaneously promoting perceived us interests in the region despite indias clearly greater status in material terms the united states has for the past halfcentury found itself much more closely engaged with pakistan even if us policy toward one south asian power often required justification in the context anothers perceived interests in recent years however the united states has shown increasing signs of delinking its india policy from its pakistan policy and this process has been starkly illuminated with an explicit recognition of india as responsible state with advanced nuclear technology islamabad expressed serious concern over recent usindia agreements and their potential meaning for pakistan islamabad has requested and been refused an opportunity to be given the same consideration as is being shown to new delhi pakistans nonproliferation case was seriously undercut by the exposure of aq khans global proliferation network69 increased usindia cooperation may
