shsbc 52 what is auditing lecture given on 31 august 1961 well this is the 31st of eventful august ad 11 and the generalities which have come up to relieve auditing come into various new gains of some kind or another i hope very soon that we can be through in scientology with all bad auditing of every character size shape and everything else there is such thing as poor auditing there are two stages of it basically the individual audits sort of naturally and then learns the rules of auditing and audits all thumbs with the rules of auditing you got the idea and then eventually why these rules drop back to where they ought to belong and then the guy is now doing very good job of auditing there comes time in any auditors career where one audits with all thumbs but the basics of auditing are what they are which is to say you are auditing human being and this auditing is addressed to case and the road map which you have is better and better and its so darn plain now that you can almost walk out in an open field you know and you just cant miss the road you will get to tipperary whether you like it or not you know providing you do anything even sensible but nothing discounts auditing auditing must be done auditing must be done now what is auditing what is it well its the pc insession definition willing to talk to the auditor and interested in own case exact definition we broadened that definition recently by saying able to talk to the auditor this becomes manifest in security checks how you bring this about able to talk to the auditor interested in own case well interested in own case means interested in own case not interested in session get the vast difference here sessions should never be interesting never never never never interesting the session itself the pcs attention should never really be distracted from his own case and then he will find that its very interesting session he will say its an interesting session but what he means is his own case was interesting during that session now youll find many witch doctor has violated this to such remarkable degree that they practically bang everybody into apathy but this is the way witch doctor runs an auditing session he gets couple of rattles and you dont realize it but hes the immediate forbearer here on earth there hasnt been any therapy since the witch doctor that which went in between didnt get the 2212 percent the witch the witch doctor the witchcraft of europe which extended up into in england here up to the maybe about the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth century yeah i know its extended into the sixteenth century because thats where the doctors got digitalis they got it from the witchcraft so it is bit different being witch and being witch doctor but their modus operandi was quite the same they maintained such compelling presence their presence was so compelling one way or the other that patient didnt have chance of doing anything else but being interested in the session you take couple of gourd rattles and snake that leaps out of the middle of the witch doctors bonnet little things like that as matter of fact i can scream like witch doctor now thats quite an accomplishment ill have to practice one of these days go down the woods and scare old farmer joness cows in old irish mythology theres wonderful wonderful line two giants are fighting and they made the ground shake to such degree that the cows shed their calves even though they had none but anyway the witch doctor very often has mechanism like this carries little pouch normally youll see witch doctor has pouch and this pouch is supposed to be an amulet thats to keep the patient from knowing whats in the pouch and theyll normally have things like greek fire gunpowder pepper you get the uses of these things gunpowder well theyve got fire there and the session is going very tamely and they flip some of this gunpowder you see with quick prestidigitation cant even see their hand approach the pouch you see theyre making some motions in the air and suddenly pow you see the fire blows up well its interesting it distracts people and while after the fires exploded they make some more motions in the air and nobody notices that the hand has approached the pouch you see and its come out and flipped something in but the fire burns glaringly red with leaping flames you see and all this kind of thing its very interesting and the patients sitting there minding his own business and he looks very calm at this particular moment and with some prestidigitation and fast hand passes calling on the spirits of the air why the patient starts sneezing like mad because of course hes just had face full of pepper its very interesting to watch north american indian particularly amongst the iroquois they had various well as matter of fact the white man has so stamped out the indian up there that theres practically tracing any of the real old customs but there were few missionaries who went up there amongst the iroquois and into the hinterland before the white man and rum and fur ever were subject you see none of these things were subject inland and the indian tribe was there as it was with all of their customs they used to live we think of them as living in wigwams you know and all kinds of things actually they used to live in bark houses in palisades and very elaborate very elaborate civilization and the iroquois medicine clans were fantastic they were something that would make the ama green with envy as far as organization was concerned they were really complicated clan setup and they had rituals of various kinds that you would have been very interested in to have studied them these early missionaries as i mentioned did find most of the dope about this and they reported it endlessly before of course they got executed or something of the sort or exorcized themselves from either the indian or the white society and we find there are very few books of this character still extant they are very rare and ive had the privilege of reading some of them very fancy they had ideas of soul transference they had ideas of exteriorization they had medicaltype exteriorization you know you fed guy enough of the proper bark you know and gave him enough fumes well hed find himself out of his ruddy ead and way up in the air you know and they apparently could do something with animals such as exteriorize and do something with the animal you know make an animal do something peculiar and then reinteriorize and so forth quite interesting and of course their religion is indistinguishable from christianity thats why they had such hard time making the indian into christian the indian was full of endless arguments of course because the indian believed in one god and there the missionary would come cropper at once hed come in there with the big news that there is one god you see and the indian would say mmhm ug total agreement you see and at one time there was an enormous flood and there was fellow by the name of noah and so on and he built an ark and all of the beings on earth all died and perished in the flood except and the indian will say mmmmmmmm and when the white man gets all finished telling him about it he says name not noah name hecton knew all about the flood you see but he had different personnel in there adam and eve knew all about adam and eve except adam and eve wasnt quite the right names so the white man wasnt quite smart he wasnt in the know you see all man had descended from adam and eve and there had been flood and one god and you know the lot you know and god had created all the animals oh yes see religion never had too much of chance because the indian never found out there was any difference but he had very advanced medical technology that was around the subject of herbs and so on which was quite good and it all got lost lost the lot because it wasnt written technology and it went down by word of mouth and so on and you had to have new people to be studying the thing in order to preserve it and as soon as the white civilization made an encroachment and disease like measles which they call smallpox but actually was just measles reached of course from continent edge to continent edge and practically wiped them out long before they had even heard of the white man so much so that lewis and clark could uncork little bottle or just pretend to start to uncork little bottle saying now you will have peace with all the tribes here on the pacific coast and if you dont im going to take the cork out of this bottle and empty its contents over the land and it contains the red death and all the chiefs went pale and said we will have peace and they did thereafter they had peace that was peaceful mission blackmail or redmail anyhow they technology of healing contained so many factors of such complexity that it required half lifetime to learn how to do these things now imagine if you as an auditor had as requisite being able to scream loud and piercingly enough you see to be heard about three city blocks see you find yourself going out in the woods and practicing screaming actually screaming is an interesting therapy you can sometimes send some preclear out and tell him go on out there someplace where nobody can hear you and scream for while and hell feel better but anyway as therapeutic measure the scream is used in this fashion piercing scream is emitted followed by total silence you see you have to be able to cut the scream off right now and leave silence in there and then utter the magic hypnotic words you see theyre actual just an hypnotic command of some kind or other like you will be well or you will die tomorrow they didnt care which way they sent people and then resume the scream at the same pitch and volume so actually you have heres the scream you see and then heres the silence with the command in it and then that gets totally buried in the rest of the scream and the patient doesnt ever realize that the practitioner has ever spoken he just lays one into the middle of the scream well of course when youre standing two feet away from guy screaming loud enough to be heard three city blocks and then you cut it off suddenly and then you put the implant in and then start it up again and so forth why all kinds of interesting things happen because the audience that is watching this on the tribal ground they never heard the stop of the scream and the start of the scream you see and after this witch doctor has screamed at the fellow of course he either gets well in three days or dies in three days whichever way was the most profitable and they had it taped all kinds of wild things like this you have to be able to leap in back somersault high enough to go through the top of the smoke hole of wigwam and sit on the trees you know those poles so that you ostensibly in smoky interior simply disappear from sight so that you cannot be found anywhere in the wigwam the way they did this was to do backflip and go up through the smoke hole and sit there on the poles you see and then by projecting their voices downward talk in loud voices spirit voices which had different tones and incantations than their own normal voice you see and boy was this show and some patient lying there next to deaths door naturally would become so interested that hed come back to life again very abrupt the history and breadth of medicine or healing or religious healing or anything like that has gotten pretty well unknown to the white man he is so selfsufficient in his belief that he can do great many of these things but actually their percentage was pretty high very high you combine herbs and magic and superstition and these things together and its pretty high and right now the white man in his arrogance doesnt realize that in south africa he is only doing maybe 30 to 40 percent of the cure even when hes paid because the native goes across the street to see the witch doctor to complete the cure and he merely considers the white doctor is quite inadequate because he never gives the spiritual fillip to it you see that drives the cure home that white pill might be all right but that split feather in the pocket is guarantee that it wont happen again and the white man of course he doesnt realize these things so hes just stupid the white man had never really better find out what natives think of him it would be very very bad for his pride believe it was an awful shock to the first time i ever ran across this was the eskimo there was fellow there and he wasnt working and somebody said dudtha to him you know and my ear cocked up and i had heard this word dudtha or whatever it was nobody can speak eskimo its fact nobodys ever learned all of it id heard this word thrown in my direction so i wondered what the connection was and i said what did you call him oh he said hes loafer hes good well what did you call him oh he said he sits there hes not helping us load yeah what did you call him he said white man and wouldnt they get that impression its good thing we dont hear these things anyway if you were practicing amongst such people and you failed to follow these nowimsupposedtos of what healing were all about you see why you would naturally be suspect as practitioner you couldnt flip backwards and disappear and there were spirit voices suddenly resounding where you had just left and you would talk to somebody and he didnt start sneezing you know you got near fire and nothing exploded theyd say fake man fake got the idea well youre walking forward straight into that in scientology but the fake is the guy who wont know model session and he wont know how to do this and he wont know how to do this and he wont know the proper form so of course he isnt an auditor isnt that right youve got the nowimsupposedto now these nowimsupposedtos have very very potent reasons back of them they are tried and tested and true but they also become badge and the ease with which person can handle model session is of course his hallmark of whether or not hes pro you get that its whether or not he follows the form now he makes mistakes in the form immediately the preclear thinks of him as bad auditor he omits part of the form the pc is immediately upset its in actually the same category as he hasnt done backflip and had spirit voices appear at the point he vanished you see so therefore he couldnt possibly make anybody well because part of the magic incantation is missing the nowimsupposedto is missing so the fellow must be illy informed as to what to do rather amusing but youre walking forward to that now this can become so much thing that it is only necessary to follow the form to be an auditor you see the reverse side of the coin and that can become so idiotic as to be the same as the old master who was teaching the neophyte and the old master every time before he gave the neophyte his lesson tied his cat to the bottom of the bed having nothing else to do with the cat you see tied him to the bottom of the bed so of course the neophyte when he became the master he starts to teach somebody and he says now he says the first thing lets do is find cat and tie him to the bottom of the bed you see now that old wheeze is not without good purpose but you can get so interested in tying cats to bottoms of beds that the soul and spirit of auditing can vanish its all right to know the forms and you sure better use the forms and you better go through the forms but auditing comes back to something else it comes back to running cases it is almost more important always more important to run cases than to run cases according to form that doesnt persuade you in any way to abandon form but it does persuade you to be able to use form with such ease that you can immediately and instantly sail into case and find out everything you want to know about the case and follow the case through and your use of the form is very very easy your use of the form can be so easy as to not really be apparent to anybody as form and that is the real art that is the real art when youre really expert it wont ever look like form to anybody itll look like just youre doing something and itll look like youre doing something effective and that requires real art and it requires real skill and thats the point youre moving over into and if you stop short of moving all the way over into total casual ease actually youre running something that is as bound in rules you see as concrete but you handle it with such offhand ease and you handle it with such naturalness that it never occurs to anybody that its form now that is really fantastic you have to be terribly comfortable with what youre doing you have to be completely comfortable you have to be able to move within the perimeter its like japanese painting japanese painting you know is the most stylized painting in the world the laws which surround japanese painting are so fantastic that when i was kid i used to wonder how on earth anybody could remember all the rules and still paint picture that looked like that great deal of you see the stroke that paints the tree must be stroked upward since the tree grows upward and all sorts of odd rules of this character you see and you have to do it this way and that way and the other way and there are certain ways to grind ink stones and oh it just goes on and on but when they turn something out when real craftsman turns something out it is quite piece of art it is really remarkable but he turned it out according to the rules which made it three times as hard and i should think that the rule instead of making auditing easier i should think you are now at the stage where you realize that the form makes it harder because you have to sound natural and you have to be interested and you have to be in there pitching in spite of the fact that you are utilizing form now if you fall short of appearing totally natural then you will fall short of total control there is where this thing bridges if you sound the least bit artificial while youre doing this one of course if you dont use any form at all you know you wont be pro thatll be youll be fake you see you get the idea i mean you wouldnt really be an auditor hes not welltrained auditor he doesnt use model session you get the idea doesnt run the rudiments right and so on tisnt in the proper order all right thats not enough if you can use this to point where the preclear never notices that rudiments are being used in that order ahha now thats real art that is real art youve moved over way over on the other side and your ability to control pc and hold him in session will be utterly fantastic because he has doubt about anything he is very sure that your mind is straight on him and his case and that he must comply with what youve said because it is obviously addressed to him and is totally natural it is so natural that it must be addressed to him dont you see and it sounds like communication this is very compelling so your nadir you might say of professional appearance in auditing is to be able to use the form perfectly but to use it with such ease that it isnt recognizable as form with such casualness that it appears to be totally relaxed and that there is question in your mind as to what youre doing or where youre going or what youre going to achieve and this very casualness seems to speak of reserved power something on the order of huge rollsroyce motor which is sitting at the curb idling you got the idea ease is power always strain is never power the soft voice will always compel more obedience than the loud one man is in an utter rage with you i mean youre bossing workmen or something like that walk over to the foreman and whisper something to him just whisper it now get these men back to work get them back to work walk away quietly boy youll have injected more enturbulence into that rage than you ever heard of the next thing you know theyll all be back working and they might still be muttering but they figure that if anybody said anything to them like that there must be something to it see try it sometime dont just qanda with him out of rage you see then out of that results war i imagine that if some of the warring nations of world war ii had found the method of submitting quiet enough message to one another in quiet enough way they would never have been in any war but all the messages were very loud werent they and they got louder and louder and there got to be more and more confusion now this is based on the fact that of the effect scale naturally and its very easy for you to audit pc with tremendous control providing you yourself are not anxious providing you yourself appear to have and actually have every confidence that you can control every part of this situation and you just go on and audit in this particular way and the fellow says something and you take it up and you give another command and he says something and you say thats fine and all right how about that and so on and hes purring along there like mad because you are not trying to interest him in the session he feels that there is nothing to look at at all but the bank theres just nothing to see around there but his case got the idea and if theres nothing to see around there but his case theres great demonstration of rudiments and theres great demonstration of nice big fumble with the emeter and there is big twisting of knobs and dials and the clatter of cans and strained look on the face and the deep concentration and the this and the that and the worry on the part of the auditor all of these various things add up to control to the pc the auditor sits down takes the emeter turns the thing on he doesnt even bother to settle it in you know he settled it in before the pc got there hands the pc the cans and says all right good fine squeeze the cans all right thats it okay now beginning of session all right start of session all right now lets see where are we at today mmhm mmhm all right thats good thats good now and here we go you go on down the line with your rudiments check them out and so forth youre not doing anything very important that isnt very important the pcs arc breaks arent very important now you get down to point of where you got youre going to run the process see well you roll up your sleeves you know just about that much interest as far as the voice comes up all right we got that out of the way now heres the process im going to run on you and you give it to him see heres the first command i seldom ask the pc if its all right with him i assumed that it was if he sat down in the chair if hes fool enough to sit down in the chair why im not going to trifle with it im not going to trifle with this any further believe and he says wow wow and gee whiz and so on and etc and i say kidding all right all right what do you know about that yeah well what do you know about that i dont say yes good yes thank you much more likely to say mmhim all right get the idea different attitude its the attitude of the fact that all right hes given were interested and were both in his bank running it you know and here we are and so on and thats all thats important thats happened around here its his bank thats the only thing were interested in were just interested in what hes looking at and where hes going and that sort of thing thats where the interest is our interest isnt on sessioning got the idea well when you get that good you all of sudden will speed your results up thats all its the ease with which you can do it the ease with which you can do it is to large degree born of confidence your confidence is based of course on wins and ability and when you have ideas that youre not going to win naturally your confidence drops the reality factor has to be kept in and if youre anxious about somebodys case you will appear anxious about somebodys case i handle it another way i say gee i sure am worried about your case these days and the guy says you are i say yes sir i sure am i was thinking last night i was wondering what in the name of common sense this is all about and he says you did and i say yes he says well i havent been worried about my case i say well i have been well why are you worried about my case well you never say gee whiz you never say gosh what do you know nothing you just keep running this stuff i dont know i im worried much higher reality factor than now we are going to audit you you are going to sit there and i am going to give you here is the first auditing command do fish fly good do fish fly good do fish fly if you feel that way its much more real to say to the fellow well i hope this is the right process to run on you lets see how it goes and youll find all of sudden the pc is right in there pitching with you it isnt the fact that youre anxious about it that makes him anxious about it hes liable to try to cheer you up but i mean if you are looking confident apparently but are feeling very unconfident hes liable to go quite the reverse hes very likely to respond to your anxiety extremely likely to respond directly to your anxiety and the more you withhold your anxiety the less hell go into session i hope you can put up with this session because i feel little bit tired if thats all right with you ill go on auditing you oh yeah do you feel very tired oh not particularly its overt overt for you to sit there and get audited but if i flub few times why you know what to put it down to if thats all right with you here we go he isnt getting arc breaky but you sit there youre dead exhausted dead beat and youre saying you know brace is it all right with you if i start this session good here it is start of session he says whats the matter with this guy thrown an unknown into the situation the auditors an unknown factor to the pc now frankness on the part of the auditor is part of the auditors communication and this goes over to borderline of evaluation the auditor starts thinking unkind thoughts about the pc starts chopping up the pc one way or the other and of course this is very very bad for the session indeed and it jumps the code and the whole situation is going to run sideways and backwards and upside down and the session is going to drown you can sure count on that well the answer to that is if youre having bad thoughts about pc and you feel very antipathetic about this particular pc and that sort of thing you better get one of your fellow auditors its good thing you know to have friends because theyll audit you and you better get one of your fellow auditors to flatten ow or something on this particular pc youll feel better and hell feel better before its through see but the reality factor begins of course in your actual command of your information if you dont feel you have an actual command of the information and youre pretending to have an actual command of the information your session will come cropper every time you cannot help it it always will come cropper matter how hard you try itll come cropper session goes to pieces only on those points of unreality in the auditor if you want to know why session goes to pieces analyze the points of unreality that the auditor had its interesting isnt it you look it over sometime if youre training bunch of auditors and you find one or two of the auditors having trouble auditing find out whats unreal now one of the ways you ask about whats unreal i just give you this as method of checking this down what were you disagreeing with in that session you know the auditor was auditing session get him afterwards now what were you disagreeing with in that session well i disagreed with this and i disagreed with that and i disagreed with something or other and you find those are the exact points that the session went to pieces on and the exact places where the pc went astray it is quite interesting because there was r in the session now if theres r let yawningly go back to 1950 theres r there is and if there is there is c reality affinity and communication it is the triangle and when one of those corners of the triangle goes out of balance the other two go out of balance and they go zip boom and dont think that they go out on lag the r doesnt go out and then little while later like half an hour the go out and little while after that the communication goes out that isnt the way it happens thats simultaneous triangle when you say the r goes out and then the goes out and then the c goes out youre actually talking in milliseconds they all go out together theyre simultaneously operating factors you may become aware of them later as separate factors you may become aware eventually that the c went out the c went out well if you want to spot where the c went out when the c actually went out you had to go back and find out when the r went out the r went out and there went the and there went the c you feel mad with the pc youll find out that this was gradient scale that you actually started feeling mad at the pc much earlier and it was at that moment when an unreality entered the situation from the auditor not from the pc but from the auditor when an unreality was entered into the session at that moment the auditor started to get peeved with the pc just bingbing happens right now all these things are sensible sensible factors now session basically is an arc activity and if session has high arc in the auditor its only necessary in the auditor it will materialize in the pc now pc can look at his bank as well as he can communicate good auditor has highly perceptive pc thats interesting isnt it the same pc audited by an auditor with low arc is not perceptive isnt that fascinating now were getting back to the iroquois indian practically arent we were getting into factors of telepathy and transference and rapport and empathy and all kinds of oddball factors but actually these factors have always existed matter whether you call them good witch doctoring or good this or good that these factors are always present now if you feel an annoyance or an anxiety with the pc basically that annoyance or anxiety with the pc is going to drop r and is going to cut c and it can be very destructive to session be very destructive to the pc the pc would find himself practically running in the dark why is he running in the dark well the auditor has got low arc not with him you see but the auditor who is actually the projecting force of the session is projecting low perceptivity and thee pc cant see his bank you got this this is one of the first factors that got in the road of dianetics this got in the road of dianetics one auditor would be able to get session going and run engrams and another auditor couldnt run engrams and there was quite big lot of question marks flying around in all directions how could all this be taking place actually it was auditor presence in the session you could explain it in many ways and these many ways do not have to be explained by telepathy or any odd factor at all an auditor who is confident of course is furnishing an auditing environment in which it is safe to depart into the nevernever land of the unknown its as simple as that dont you see so of course you can say well an auditor whos not confident has pc then who wont see the bank well of course it isnt safe to look at the bank in an environment which has got sort of an ostile flavor to it you got the idea so its the auditor in the final analysis and the emotional tone of the session and this has great deal to do with whether or not auditing takes place im talking to you now about the real highschool basics of auditing these are not just the mechanics of auditing this is where this stuff goes now when youre you yourself have been auditing for long time and you havent cleared anybody youre not auditing in any high level of confidence now youve seen somebody cleared and you start auditing in higher level of confidence that we would phrase as hope when youve cleared somebody you start auditing in something that could be characterized as confidence and when you really have rung up string of them nobody will be able to live with you youll be totally insouciant but that in itself is reality now also it goes this way when you have audited pc up to results you feel more confident about pcs and when youve not gotten these results you feel less confident about pcs and so youre auditing in an auditing environment which has low arc in it got the idea these things are very easily explained they are simply observable you can always detect the false note in somebodys confidence always the auditor is sounding confident but isnt at all confident and of course this is observable the pc is nervous the pcs attention goes off of own case on to auditor because he feels there is something here he doesnt know and we have an unknownness in the session unknownnesses would be the keynote of this the auditor doesnt know whether or not he can produce result he doesnt know whether or not he can hold pc insession he doesnt know what he can do he doesnt know what is going to happen he has determination of the final result these are all notknows notknows notknows you see it adds up to the pc that the auditor is notknowing therefore there is mystery in the session the pc may try to spot this notknow very hard and arduously the pc may be trying to spot this and not know what hes trying to spot but he gets stuck on the auditor why thetan stuck to anything is of course just mystery sandwich its thetan mystery object mystery sandwich and of course the auditor then cant keep the pc insession because the pc has got mystery on the auditor and we have the auditor plastered all over the pc you get the idea because the pc is see and he doesnt dare see anything and he doesnt dare act these are the factors these are the factors that are involved theyre all explained on the order of how much mystery does he smell around here well i disabuse the pc of mystery as fast as i can as method of operating procedure i tell him how long we are going to audit if this seems to have any importance if it has bearing on the thing i say well were going to run this session until such and such time of course if youre running the session not against the part of pcs day where the pc will have anything to do you say to hell with that were just going to run the pc you see got the idea i mean youre running him from eight oclock on and youve got till midnight as far as thats concerned it just doesnt matter the pc knows you probably may or may not start ending it at around ten if he looks the least querulous about anything well you find out why its usually something about the time of the auditing session or something like that so youd set him right anyhow got the idea the rule of thumb is if there appears to be mystery about what is going on you give the pc the dope you just destroy the mysteries about the session i can be counted on usually to give pc synopsis of what is going to happen ive never gone so far as to say and at the end of that time you will feel much better but i have gone as far as to say well well take care of that im going to take care of this headache youve got you know i ask the pc for his goals too its polite while i tell him what im going to do tell him what im going to run if i ignore doing something i tell him im going to ignore it that is to say rudiment id say well theres fall here on this arc break with but thats what im running toward anyhow and is there anything you want to tell about this i notice theres little fall here yeah well soandso and soandso i thought it was something like that okay now were just going to skip that at the moment because itll come out in the session shortly okay and the pc says well i guess so well all right and all of sudden the arc break disappears because so much r has been thrown into the session hahahaha get the idea and quarter of the way through youre running some kind of process or other and the pc seems to be floundering around and nothings happening i say i dont like the way this is going im going to give you another auditing command going to change the auditing command what do you think of that the pc says well i dont know i think itll probably be very good idea well i dont like the way the others going i dont like the way its going either all right heres the new auditing command bridge didnt stop any session start any session see why id introduce an unreality into this situation without telling the pc why im going to stop an auditing command im going to throw bridge in im going to start another auditing command im going to go through the tortuous mechanics of everything you know you can hear the wheels click you know and the cuckoo is grinding his beak inside the clock and all this kind of thing the pc can be counted on to look up and say well hey what what what whats the matter i know that ive been very bad auditor i know that ive been an absolute fool if the pc ever looks up and asks whats the matter if i havent filled him in before he thought of it i figure im doing wrong im going to run through this and im going to keep up with this command until i think the thing is squared away is that all right all right and that may mean that well be overrunning this session is that all right all right theres never any doubt in his mind that when the session starts to overrun that the session was going to be overrun he knows about it already see and i always try to make the pc right and never try to make the pc wrong i never bother to make the pc right at the expense of my being wrong if he says i said something that i didnt say i acknowledge him i dont say i said it because that would introduce another mystery in it because he probably knows down deep that i didnt say it you see this so i just acknowledge it im liable to say something well can we recover from that is that all right yeah well thats all right if im challenged for flubbing an auditing command or repeating an auditing command if it is valid if it is perfectly valid if i did repeat one leg of process you know running without any tally or anything of the sort on tenway bracket god knows and so on i will normally catch it before the pc does and if i dont catch it before the pc does i figure im kind of slipping you see how many ways from center have you batted your oh ive said that before excuse how many ways has your grandmother batted you thats the right command is that okay you got it pc says all right he says well anybody can make mistake thats his reaction to it if he thinks of it at all and you say well how many ways have you batted your uh your urn uh your grandmother pc says i answered that before oh man that is really lousy piece of auditing see its not lousy piece of auditing because you made mistake on which auditing command you were giving the pc thats not necessarily horrible but it was horrible because the pc found it out you got the idea you didnt find it out before the pc did see you should know more about whats going on in the session than the pc does at any given instant and therefore you have more r in the session than the pc and therefore you stay in control of the pc in the session when you have pc wising you up as to what was going on well theres something has slipped thats all it has slipped and it slipped long time ago and it slipped badly and theres rfactors are out and everything else is out from the middle outward in session this thing was out this has probably been out for days or weeks lord knows how long its been out if that kind of condition can exist the pc is not always right but the auditor doesnt have to tell him hes wrong because the auditors not trying to prove anything to the pc there isnt single part of auditing that consists of proving anything to pc you dont have to prove thing to pc you dont have to prove him there are clears or that he can get clear or that he can get released you dont have to prove to him that scientology works you dont have to prove anything to him got it prove is one of the basic games of the thetan and people are always on the whole track thetans have been running around telling others to prove it and pc can get this games condition very early but if pc wants you to prove something to him you already have got an out rfactor someplace something has gone wrong earlier than this point you say well ill show you that scientology works i will give you session see the guys says oh i dont believe it works and i believe its kind of fraudulent and so forth and im not sure and uh im not sure and uh so on not because you want to prove anything to him say what withholds have you got you know this is social conversation taking place in the underground what withholds have you got you know very puzzled whats with you and the rest of the human race bzzzzzz boom i never qanda with whether it works or not i wouldnt discuss for three seconds with anybody whether dianetics or scientology work and i would never audit anybody to get result that will electrify the community you know the guy wants to be audited on this sole basis he wants this young girl to be audited because itll do so much for scientology and we hear that quite often thats one of these prove things prove it prove it prove it sure if we audit young girl and get some result itll electrify the community thats for sure but isnt it interesting that every effort to prove the validity of dianetics and scientology some of which efforts have cost as much as fifty thousand dollars have all of them netted us not one single bit of gain its given us lots of nice records and im very happy to have the records the reason they have trouble with business is the president of the company is sitting there in his old slacks and his tweed coat that is out at the elbows see they longer wear top hats because laborers knock them off and hes sitting there at his solid mahogany desk and he says now you say he says that this will up production you say this will up production now we could do it on basis that if it did up production why then we would do soandso and if it didnt up production then we wouldnt do soandso and so on that is the time to go yawn yawn yawn because the old thetan game of prove has started stopping things you shouldnt be selling him anything anyhow sit on his head and audit him hell come up at the other end and say what in the hell happened to i feel better you say good of course you do hell say what is this stuff and you say this is scientology and he says kidding he says does it always do this yeah why dont you go to pe course im not going to give you one here or ill give you some more auditing if you want the guy says well if you could just get over my lumbosis i would be happy to pay you four hundred dollars that is the time to go yawn yawn yawn you now say well im not trying to take any lumbosis away from you but ill give you some auditing you dont want my lumbosis you dont want this game game you mean game game and you say game scientologys the game that everybody wins the only game on earth where everybody wins so were not interested in your lumbosis or proving to you or your wife or anybody else that scientology works because youve gotten the thing into disagreement an argument and games condition before youve even begun to audit and an auditing session is not games condition you should know it the one thing an auditing session must not become is games condition whereby the auditor sits there and prevents the pc from getting win and the pc sits there and prevents the auditor from getting win and this can be quite detrimental but you should realize and the only reason ive embarked upon this little excursion here is just this that every homo sap that is wearing out shoe leather or rubber soles on the metropoli of earth is in games condition and all you have to do is just whisper games condition and theyre right there it almost takes precedent over session and could very easily take precedent over session so anytime pc offers up anything that looks like games condition just let it fall with dull plop in the middle of the floor and every time you embark on anything that looks like games condition to the pc patch it up because from there on your goal will be opposite from his goal and if your goal is to make him better then hell get worse or try to because its games condition he will try to do an opposite he wont agree with you in this kind of condition and games condition immediately and directly results instantly that you obey almost any part except the eating one oh i guess maybe that one too of the auditors code those are all prevention of games conditions they could be looked at that way in loose rough way pc well get the shuns the pc is sitting there to get smarter so you educate him see hes sitting there to find out from himself so you give him the information now lets put it little more closely and youll see exactly how this fits hes sitting there to find out something about his case and he finds out something about your case see that just doesnt work and itll start putting him in games condition whether you like it or not all right now the pc says uh you said the auditing command before and you say i did not and youll have divergence of goals at that point in the session at the least whiff of games condition pc can be guaranteed to take off in that direction theyll be knocking the tennis balls around the court from there on man disagreements of various kinds of course lead directly into games condition because the game is basically an individuated nonagreement the only agreement there is to have game and as soon as you establish the agreement to have game of course all other things go into disagreement youve got certain rules of this game but the pc is on one side and youre on the other side and youre not auditing now auditing is the one activity in which games condition must not exist thats for sure and as soon as you drop out r of course youve dropped in an ingredient that could lead to games condition so that missing r goes into games condition now youre sitting there withholding something from the pc with magnitude you yourself might kind of get tricked innto the thing youre playing some kind of game with the pc you get the idea it sort of reacts like that youre withholding something from the pc so obviously you must be playing tennis with the pc you see just the fact that you are will enter this type of atmosphere into the situation of course c breaks down at once auditing is an activity of an auditor taking over the control of and shepherding the attention of pc so as to bring about higher level of confrontabiity he has got to be able to confront more of what he has done is doing and so forth you actually are not even changing the pc same pc hes going to shed some valences some various things are going to happen of one character or another which will certainly appear as change you havent changed the pc because his level of vision can remain at 249 degrees in direction only it is now eight miles long it isnt being stopped two inches from his nose by an automobile accident he had you get the idea so you havent even changed the direction of his attention eventually he will wind up with his attention in all those directions only his attention will be free in those directions what youre doing actually is extending and familiarizing pc with himself and his bank and the universe various dynamics and therefore his attention very well has to be shepherded you cant expect the automaticity of an auditing command to do all the shepherding of attention because the pc is going to duck the pcs attention is on object and the pc goes into dispersal from object and you dont want the pc at that moment to be dispersing from object because you dont think object has been regarded at all and yet you think at the same time that the pc is totally capable of regarding object were not going to throw him in over his head but he just told us that well i have this stuck picture of this candy shop all right time goes on now what are you looking at what have you got now well i got this camel camel what happened to the candy shop its all right to have camel but what happened to the candy shop oh that just disappeared well what was that about the candy shop well i dont know it was just candy shop and it was just sitting there there there it is now well did it come back has it still been there why i guess its still been there actually i have this camel its small picture up to the right of the candy shop i hadnt noticed that before well what gives with this candy shop how come whats on the other side of it whats in front of it whats all this about yeah well you shouldnt have asked you shouldnt have asked you see this was the key withhold that was holding up the whole security check he robbed it thats all and it just seems to have been totally occluded and the only thing hes got left of it is stuck candy shop and the motion and action around there with the eighteen blocks he was chased by the police patrol car theres nothing around the candy shop nothing except policemen guilt potential prison and an eighteen block chase and screaming police car you see nothing around the candy shop its totally blank thats it you can count on the fact that every stuck picture is in some degree held but that the person is able to regard the action if he can regard the stuck picture the indicator that he can regard at least some of the action or consequences in the scene are indicated by the fact that he has stuck picture blanking them out so he can always do the gradient scale of looking little bit further and you can always do the gradient scale of looking little bit further at what the pc is looking at you didnt ask the pc to look at the candy shop in the first place you just found out that the pc was looking at the candy shop you got the idea and its just candy shop and candy shop once in while youll have pc saying well candy shop candy shop candy shop aaaahh its picture of this cand its picture of this damned candy shop well what is that well i dont know thats started to worry its just sitting there indicators that the pc gives you is the pc is in trouble and the only error you can make is let him slide out of trouble let him automatically wander out of trouble let him somehow or another fall on the pavement and roll into the gutter so that he doesnt have to look at the candy shop you get the idea and this eventually winds up to very slow gain yes eventually the auditing command will come around again and take another sweetmeat out of the window of the candy shop and then fifteen hours of auditing later we take another tiny little flick off the top cornice of the candy shop now an auditor mustnt press and be anxious and be upset about anything but the pc looking and going case gains he wants the pc to get some case gains he should be quite pressy about that oh this process is taking too long and i think wed better run another process because weve been running this process for five minutes and nothings happened so lets run another process now and so on that is the wrong way to direct pcs attention because its directing his attention off of what hes doing itd be much smarter five minutes have gone by and nothing has happened with the process and you say what are you doing well im doing soandso all right what else you doing whatcha looking at whatcha looking at well i got this stuck picture thats usually the thing or theres just nothing here nothing at all i can see nothing wherever i look you say is that so which direction are you looking well im looking up good look down got the idea dont change the process because it isnt going fast enough for you get the pcs attention directed and itll go fast enough to suit most anybody and of course you get educated against doing this because you do it five times with great success and on the sixth time the pc lets out piercing scream and you are yourself restimulated into remembering that poor native that you shoved the iron spear through while upholding imperialism so the communists could eventually knock it down you know and you are restimulated into believing that you have just impaled this poor native again obviously theres man in trouble in front of you because he is screaming naw he isnt in trouble because hes screaming hes in trouble because hes getting well he thinks see he isnt in trouble the only way to get him in trouble is say now come up to present time hed be in trouble hed be in trouble right then you get what the right way out is the way out is the way through and an auditor who cannot get pc to move on through is of course an auditor who is being oblivious of what the pc is doing you cant get pc to move through something when you dont even know hes anywhere if the pc is exactly nowhere as far as youre concerned you cant tell him to look up down sideways you cant tell him to look further at something you cant tell him to go well i dont know the guy says i dont know i just i dont know ever since i ran that picture about the camel ive had lot of difficulty here i just dont seem to be able to get the auditing command and so forth well what about the camel did you miss anything around the camel is there anything else around that camel and so forth oooooooh you shouldnt have said that you see you can count on it every time every time the pc stops running the pc has started fixedly looking the way to stop him from fixedly looking is tell him to look little more or look little better and the next thing you know youll be getting resounding and horrendous results that you never heard of before this case will be running that you thought was all slowed down because you didnt have the rudiments in and all of sudden the case will be running bang bang bang bang bang case will be very interested in what he is doing and so forth got it if i didnt teach you how to audit pc and if i taught you only how to follow form i would be doing very wrong forms are forms but running pc is running pc and that is all there is to it pc sits down in the chair and you say start of session if youve got your arc in and your rfactors are in and so on you go down there with the rudiments you square them away and you get the pc into the process and then you run that pc you run him now it doesnt mean repeat an auditing command and repeat an auditing command and repeat an auditing command yes it means repeat auditing commands but it also what is the pc doing with the auditing command what else is he doing with the auditing command what is he looking at what is happening tone arm all of sudden isnt moving hasnt moved for about four or five commands what are you looking at nothing but this stuck picture oh how long have you had that well i dont know last five minutes or so well what is it well its picture of mosque okay whats going on in the mosque nothing its just picture of mosque oh right away what do you know he must have run into confusion and stable datum and the stable datum is the mosque and hes looking busily at the stable datum and he is ignoring the confusion and the only thing thats going to let him out of there of course is to pay some attention to the confusion and if you can get him to look at the confusion of course there goes the stable datum because the stable datum is longer necessary his security is totally bound up in the fact that if i just stand here and look at this mosque im all set the hell he is hes been all set but hes been standing there looking at the mosque in the bank with his attention all bound up on it for maybe the last thousand years well that seems to to be long time to examine mosques well it hasnt done him any good for thousand years to look at the mosque how do you think its going to do him any good through the rest of this session to look at the mosque you better tell him what might be around that mosque well nothing is around any mosque of course it is just sand in all directions yeah well whats around that particular mosque oh this one oh well nothing nothing mossians or something they come out and well as matter of fact there is mossian right now he comes out and he says something or other well what do you know haha something happened to the picture hoho hey what do you know thats good enough give him the next auditing command and he executes it and you say what happened what happened to the mosque oh its still there the mossians stuck now well whats around that mosque what is around it where is this thing located what is it doing what is going on anything you care to say and he says well theres nothing around it he says you see the whole city has been destroyed everything except the mosque oh well what are you looking at there now im looking at the destroyed city well what else do you see there sniff nothing except my whole family sniff sniff dead but you see the computation was if he could just stand there and look at the mosque for the next thousand years he wouldnt have to notice all those corpses something of this sort dont you see its always that sort of thing always im not talking now about one particular case the case that has the black field wake up sometime and say what is on the other side of it the case that never sees picture there everything is invisible and so forth which direction is this invisibility oh its all around all around in what direction up of course well look down so much for the invisible case you got the idea its up to you to direct the pcs attention why because he himself in that very bank he has been in has his attention fixed on these objects solely for one reason only that he has been powerless to direct his own attention in that particular bank and those particular situations and if an auditor doesnt come along and do some attention direction of course the auditing command alone will do the attention direction well it will do something at slow limp but unless the auditor says look see what is it what did you do with the auditing command what else did you do with the auditing command what is happening unless those things go in you also dont have arc either because the pc winds up believing implicitly that the auditor doesnt care if you want to run session which has fast results and you want to do fast clearing im afraid youll just have to get down to the fundamental which is that the auditor is somebody who directs the pcs attention through his bank okay all right i feel now like saying go now and more but i wont ill be back nagging at you again next week thank you
