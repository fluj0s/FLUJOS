the honourable mr justice m ole keiwua po box 34088 nairobi 12th may 2006 the honourable the attorney general attorney general chambers nairobi dear sir re nairobi chief magistrate court criminal case 2157 of 2003 r v livingstone kunini ole ntutu and onyambu please refer to our conversation sometime in the month of march 2006 you recollect i passed to you an elaborately made out complaint backed to minor details on the on the role of your dpp in sabotaging the prosecution of his client mr livingstone ole ntutu in this case the letter is dated 12th april 2006 and requested the termination of the case under nolle prosque to enable your office instruct neutral lawyer to prosecute the case away from the interference of mr keriako tobiko you were seeking instruction from mr tobiko before you react to the complaint your office is yet to response you had at the time indicated your reluctance to terminate the case while ruling was pending the ruling has now been delivered and the accused has been put on his defence but there is lot of evidence conveniently withheld at the instigation of mr tobiko mr gathenji and mr kilukumi and of livingstone ntutu that evidence must be given it is our right we believe to see proper and fair trial to everybody you also recollect that i wrote to you personal note on 18th august 2005 that the case should be prosecuted properly to avoid the government and myself being sued for malicious prosecution since there is ample evidence of crime having been committed on the part of mr tobiko client which regrettably he is trying in abuse of his office to suppress and exclude my letter of 18th august 2005 attached i had mentioned that people like mr david kibaki mr jimmy michuki and mr stanley murage have been interested in the disputed property i have the evidence of people like mr hassan ole kamwaro chairman of the transport licensing board he was approached by mr murage that he the president was about to believe story that it was i not mr tobiko client who stole this public property i gave ole kamwaro documents to call off this bluff i have the evidence of ole sapalan on the involvement of mr david kibaki who wanted to be accompanied by the former to visit the mara property but ole sapalan appears to have prevailed he warned david kibaki that this is property in respect whereof his father suspended judge and it would be scandal of monstrous proportions if david was seen contriving with tobiko and ole ntutu to whisk it away from the judge and his people or the part that belongs to the county council from the council it seems as if one mary wambui is the new recruit she the other day visited ole ntutu home though evidence leaked regarding her quest for the mara property but it is obvious that david kibakis interest might have faded since the two groups cannot go together in search of loot as to jimmy michuki i have the word of alex ole magilo that jimmy is preparing plans to develop property in the mara at the disputed area i also have documents showing mr tobiko and hon ole ntutu visited state house in the referendum days when hon stephen ole ntutu mp made demands that civil cases involving his brother and the county council of narok be speedily settled i believe it was this demand that saw the speedy transfer of the council clerk mr ondimu who had braved the odds and dared give evidence in this criminal case you can therefore see that the civil cases are not an option for either us as lessees or the council as their fate seemed predetermined contrary to the law the predetermination is contrary to law as your office has instruction from the commissioner of lands showing the grabbing was fraudulent you have instruction from the ministry of local government that the property is public property and belongs to the council and that the constitution and statute law were breached in its registration by land officers in narok you now have task force report released on 7th april 2006 not only on the management of the maasai mara but all national reserves under the mandate of local authorities the negligent manner your dpp is handling this case will certainly give still birth to the task force findings and recommendations huge chunk of the maasai mara national reserve had been illegally curved and dished to developer this was unprocedural as mara is gazetted entity protected by relevant statutes so should not have been encroached the council was asked to reestablish the boundaries of the reserve and acquire trust title deed to prevent encroachment the task force was jointly appointed by the ministers of local government and tourism and wildlife why should mr tobiko use his public office to defeat government policy and breach the constitution and statute law he has been appointed to safeguard the answer lies in the fact that livingstone kunini ole ntutu the accused in the case is tobiko client copy of letter dated 12th april 2006 reverend david ole nkumum and pastor john ololmaitai have addressed to mr solomon boit permanent secretary ministry of local government has all that mr tobiko had acted for livingstone ntutu in high court succession cause no1263 of 2000 mr tobiko certified that livingstone ole ntutu being 19 on the list tobiko signed and filed in court on 20th june 2000 g appeared and being personally known to him and acknowledged his signature what is also baffling and borders on crime is that livingstone daughter nayianoi ntutu who is no42 in the list 6 years on 20th june 2000 appeared before tobiko as known to him but strangely nayianoi on 20th june 2000 had national identity card no1269818 surely this government ought to be saved all this uncalled for embarrassment on the part of mr tobiko i am certain that if action is taken all these people are going to go public on this unseemingly conduct of public officer i do not shy away to write as i do because i know i have done nothing wrong as my suspension was instigated by mr tobiko in bid for him to take away my property surely that cannot be the proper purpose of suspension enc yours sincerely m ole keiwua
