24823613264qmweb45210mailsp1yahoocom sealsendtime fri 28 aug 2009 141912 0400 i did not mean to come across so abruptly i was very upset that visser would turn on us while never asking for us to remove him i figured that by provocation he would reveal his true nature it took this event to make place all the pieces and figure out what he joined us for the church of the sons of yahweh leader excommunicated him along with lindstedt which i learned recently for the same back stabbing behavior visser worked with the answp for quite while which was like joke that he would accuse of having fedfriends after being in that sewer before the answp combusted visser had been on very public war of words with many of their members and they truly were jews posteriors so i signed visser in and used my reputation for pacifism well documented to explain to his detractors that they had two options to either shut up or be shut up they preferred to remain silent i suspect now that visser also worked against them in the end and used them for promotion it is pattern apparently and when i provoked him before his new crowd he even turned on them pastor visser is great preacher and perhaps that is all he should be because when it comes to organizations and politics like the jew with the bony finger of accusation he accuses and manipulates that seems to be what gets him in trouble little maturity and some hard lessons and people come back better off speaking of henrys accusation stating that we do not do anything well soon we will be resurrecting some sort of radio network to replace turncoat i have made contact with most of the people whom were sponsors owners of radio transmitters etc and we are trying to pick up the pieces i figure that will spread yahwehs word moreso than throwing some little or large gathering i like parties also but this thing we do is not just fun and games preach to few hundred vs few thousand is an obvious effort worth the undertaking as far as the hal turner thing that did take by surprise i was talking to trip henderson about it who was hals principal financier had hal not been arrested this charade would have continued and more damage done the only realistic point that we can make to people is that traitors exist everywhere and watch how the government rewards them for their service bill nonwhite and turner will be cellmates soon funny thing is that the people that they went to work against were either truly protected by yahweh god or that clean neither one could get close enough to anyone of worth so the jews lost them somewhere where they cannot speak any further in hindsight we now know what to look for opportunists and grandstanders i have sent this to some other members of the aryan nations and some affiliates so they can welcome you and also thankyou for the heads up preferably i would like to leave visser all by himself where he can do what he does i hold nothing personal against him except minor case of subversion real damage done b list pastor jay faber aryan nations theological director original message from lenio barcelos to jay faber eli james pastor visser commander clifton emahiser pastor visser cc mlindstemonetcom sent thursday august 27 2009 930 pm subject re re hello pastor faber anywayid just like to thank pastor faber for answering my original email and giving better understanding as to what was going on as for everything else that has transpired within these back and forth messages aryan nations revival is 1 in my opinion and the opinion of good portion of those that most count within the ci community when it comes to an organizational entity which stands for yahweh and the establishment of his heavenly kingdom here on earth aryan nations revival seems to now focus more on the quality of its membership rather than the quantity which i believe to be good thing those who are lukewarm or apostate should be weeded out and disposed of from within its ranks if they cannot be successfully reproved of their own detrimental errors aryan nations revival must remain strong in the faith and in its membership i thank yahweh for the existence of such an organization and its zealous members especially pastor jay faber himselfi believe that anr has the potential now to become even greater than it once was under pastor richard butler may he rest in peace this however will take time and effort to achieve but it can be done let the anr approach this goal cautiously so as to not be compromised by those who would wish to destroy it from the inside out yes i suppose some mistakes have been made but they have not been fatal to the anr thankfully may yahweh bless the aryan nations revival and strengthen it in order to use its membership as his battle axe against his enemies4 words death to the jewa friend of anrlenio q barcelos on thu 82709 pastor visser cpmcovenantpeoplesministrycom wrote from pastor visser cpmcovenantpeoplesministrycomsubject re re hello

unlisted website i suppose it is devils lie snare and deception damn those jews of encarta anr had more than that day 1 of coarse you made us what we are my god how dare us look at facts do you really think you can remove another mans title of pastor yes and you did it for meno credit here since pastor gullet never stated that your excommunication was reversed what do you hope to achieve other than an internet smear campaign against another israelite israel means to rule with yahweh yahweh is not an opportunist nor liar if lindstedt feels hes preacher thats between him and yahweh youre obviously wasting your time with this high school gossip gossip you show one article present one sermon by alleged pastor lindstedt he talks crap about everyone supports the weak that agree with him does nothing at all positive unless you are kaik gee maybe your opinion about what constitutes pastor is the reason that i have carried this so far yahweh gives the bodytempleministry the authority to cut off or correct ecumenical council is good term for body of pastors that decide what qualifies and what does not your friend decided that some creatard deserved ordination because he shot some nigger guard at the holyhoax museum never bothering to question the belief system john hinkley jr shot president reagan to meet and copulate with jodi foster shall i ordain him by this standard and you approve by the way i care less if this henry person is gaining listeners from my flock id hope that my people listen to numerous pastors and if i lose them they were never really mine were they you on the other hand seemingly feel threatened by others if theyre better than us god will bless them yahweh blesses them thats why they come to the anr they pray to yahweh for knowledge and they receive of coarse lindstedt is there with you to bless them i refuse to get dragged into this silliness dragged you dragged this query upon yourself by talking shit and supporting the infernal conception of prozac alias lindstedt why not voice your concerns to lindstedt himself instead of visiting your personal issues on others hal turner is an admitted fed and frankly so are his friends i have nothing for you guys get it what you call big league i surpassed years ago convenient excuse to take the foundation of one ministry and lie to act like victim of oppressive deception niggers do that your uploads to our site state that you not only agreed but named your sermons hal turner spot pastor in the name of yahweh god lies now turn and attack some more as i expect for doing the scriptural thing go on and on about how you made which is laughable in the end it doesnt matter how dare you attempt to tell or lindstedt how to run our churches you simply think more highly of yourself than you should in peace pv there is peace with deception i have proven you liar an opportunist and further an ally of fraud once again i state my willingness to undergo inquisition by the established ecumenical council and i fear nothing i call for the ecumenical council to not just depose lindstedt formally but also visser when lies must be used to justify cause right or divinity there is justification i pastor jay william faber rightfully ordained order upon the ecumenical council that not just visser and lindstedt be placed upon the potential chopping block i also demand that my pastoral rank be either justified or revoked under the same scrutiny as these others let those that accuse present proof mine is already presented pastor jay w faber aryan nations ordained by pastor butler 2001 at 31 years of age 14 years of study pastorjayfabermsncomre hello pastor faber pastor visser what was the concern here was that you disassociated without informing us and further began working against us as this email has proven as far as fed harassment well welcome to the big leagues as you can state that the turner network created some problems we knew the risk we discussed this before we proceeded and you agreed that it was worth the risk and this explains your new 100k listener base the proper thing for you to have done was to contact us first and express your concerns or intention did you really think that the fbi was not going to bother you ignoring emails hanging up the phone and then posting an alleged pastor as the aryan nations one that you also decided to dispossess well what is one to believe part of operating ministry is to see that all people involved stay on track sometimes part of teaching theology is keeping the herd on track also be advised henry has been trying to contact anyone associated with you for the purpose of subversion since we have been reaping the fallout from turners crash and burn i placed our old programs up for week and they received hits over 1000000 sticking to preaching the word well adding few million listeners requires an investment in time and manpower were getting ready to go the next leap we are in the process of creating another network to absorb the slack my main concern was that you advised people not to join the anr it is the membership and cooperation of the anr that you can thank for your new found success and it will keep going foreword 100k was landmark now we add zero and proceed you had nothing to be concerned about with fed questioning and the turner turncoat event you never even spoke to him i handled turner personally and exposed myself to the risk so we could reach those extra numbers apparently you are satisfied with what we reaped for you and will bite the hands that created it for you pjf original message from pastor visser to jay faber lenio barcelos eli james pastor visser sent wednesday august 26 2009 104 am subject re hello pastor faber pastor james and faber please understand that cpm has affiliations nor are we responsible for what certain posters may say on our forums i say this because our past affiliation with the turner radio network and his close associates has earned us several visits from the feds our lack of response on this matter is because weve chosen to allow the men of israel to deal with their problems scripturally and to protect the flock pastor faber is certainly welcome to voice his concerns as he has an active account on the mentioned forums simple report post could save us all lot of time and grief well censor nor ban any man nor his ministry for anything less than death threat we believe that yahweh raises up pastors according to his own heart and man has all truth because of this well judge man regarding this mornings email i have idea who henry is i was never member of answp nor ucoy we garner 100k listeners week and certainly dont need turner radio network for anything and such faulty affiliations in the past have earned us mostly grief i feel we should all focus on theology over such petty squabbles and simply refuse to get involved one way or another i respect you both and im looking forward to 999 war for christ pv from jay faber mailtopastorjayfabermsncom sent monday august 24 2009 1127 pmto lenio barcelos eli james pastor visser pastor vissersubject re hello pastor faber it was joint agreement to remove lindstedt from the aryan nations including the input and vote of pastor visser based upon lindstedts lack of credentials as pastor gullet excommunicated him for publicly promoting articles about how nonci woman were not just available but suitable for us to take and rape then further lindstedt was promoting the creator as lindstedt titles creatard that shot some nigger at the holyhoax museum and called that act worthy of ordainment 1 lindstedt lied to us claiming to still be pastor 2 lindstedt in article ever in any of his listings preached identity he simply ridicules the people that he sees as adversarial to his objectives and further disgraces the message of yahweh god by his constant attacks on other persons endlessly without material substance and without any biblical substance 3 there is pastor lindstedt i am as surprised to see that one as eloquent in theology as pastor visser would even continue to entertain lindstedt after all of his ramblings henry on the other hand we discharged because some guy offered him place on high council to be that claims to be aryan nations but accepts any person of any belief as can be seen on httparyannations88com upon this very premise we left august kreis and anyone that places his hand on the plow and looks back is unfit yes i turned on henry with heavy hand yes i turned on lindstedt with heavy hand i have forwarded this email to pastor eli james as we agreed today that an ecumenical council needs to exist my position is that lindstedt is pastor and i would like once and for all hearing on this issue those that are with yahweh are one family the aryan nations revival does not support persons that use the name pastor in title only if henry who is betrayer who is covertly talking to pastor vissers people behind his back to sway them makes pastor visser and i at odds so be it i can respect pastor visser and one of the reasons that i ditched henry is that he is sending our members our contacts and our alliance down the drain pastor visser is apparently unaware that henry was also going on his website to betray pastor visser as well lindstedt well if pastor visser chooses to endorse man that he knows lacks all spirit of yahweh let that stand between pastor visser and yahweh it was in agreement between i and pastor visser that lindstedt needed to go needless to say i was surprised to see that visser had the excommunicated lindstedt on his forum i call for hearing as to pastor lindstedts claim i do not question pastor vissers eligibility as pastor but i question his judgment in friendship henry called and made that statement that pastor visser had turned on to which pastor visser has made comment if this is the case i would like to know lenio once again as we read in the new testament many churches formed and most were destroyed by yahweh god as was evident in the epistles for steering away from truth the aryan nations revival was founded as an organization with yahweh first and foremost as we fired august kreis for blasphemy and continued the aryan nations free from some infidel i tried to contact pastor visser for some time apparently you may be correct if this is whom visser chooses for an alliance henry stout and lindstedt all i can say is that the company you keep defines you and yahweh is not part of that two or three as far as never wanting to do anything may i present the website httparyannationsrtevivalorg now always listed on the front page of any search engine from sheer volume of hits on there are over 500 hours of sermons for audio many texts and foremost good men all of whom serve yahweh god just because henry wants to throw national events as we are not ready and wants to ask people to invest thousands of dollars of their hard earned money to attend events across the country to which we have not established the numbers to justify well i am not going to ask people to do anything that i would not wish to attend henry wants party lindstedt is proof that prozac needs improvement lindstedt and henry stout are not worth the effort hopefully pastor visser and i can work this out funny thing is that as the answp turned on visser i signed him as member and then by rather righteous means made them tuck in their tails and shut up i assisted him i gave him better than myself on the turner network for publicity and as our program continued we reached well over 100000 listeners et brutus pastor visser here are my phone numbers 2018240090 8627558176 i deserve an explanation separate pastor eli james since you hold rank in the ecumenical council i request that alleged pastor lindstedt be examined as to whether or not he is pastor pastor jay faber ordained 2001 at 31 years of age student of scripture from 1986 in ceds as founded by bob miles in all fairness i will also be fully willing to undergo any challenge to my ordination before this same ecumenical council maybe more of us need to agree to the same challenge original message from lenio barcelos to pastorjayfabermsncom sent sunday august 23 2009 957 pm subject hello pastor faber hello pastor faberyou asked on an forums to email you here so im doing so but im not really looking to talk about the aryan front issue in this message although id still like to know if something could be done about that i was actually wondering if you could put into perspective for what exactly is going on between you pastor visser henry and some others who apparently have left aryan nations revival why all the hostility towards you and the anr all of the sudden ive already spoken with henry and his friend john on newsaxon about this john basically told that you were talking alot of sht about henry those were johns own words and that i should stay away from you and anr henry told that his reason for leaving was because he was fed up with you never wanting to do anything i have already known about your disassociation with pastor lindstedt for about month now based on thread on his website that i happened to come across and i agree with your reasons for wanting to distance yourself from him based on what i read there incase you are not aware of what pastor lindstedt had to say about you and the anr on this thread then here it is httpwhitenationalistorgforumshowthreadphpt353 i feel it should be brought to your attention incase you arent already aware of it now about henry and the others i havent taken to heart what he and his friend said because i they never really gave in real good reason for leaving anr as far as pastor visser goes im completely in the dark on that one if you have the time and are willing to inform of whats going on concerning this issue i would very much like to here things from your side pastor 4 wordslen walla mail get your
