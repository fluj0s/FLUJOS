congress updated march 29 2004 jonathan medalia specialist in national defense foreign affairs defense and trade division congressional research service the library of congress nuclear warhead pit production background and issues for congress summary pit is the fissile core of nuclear warhead in modern warheads it creates nuclear explosion that triggers substantially larger thermonuclear explosion all pits currently in the us nuclear stockpile were made at the rocky flats plant near denver co which opened in 1952 the department of energy doe halted pit manufacturing operations there in 1989 the united states has been unable to make stockpilequality pits and therefore complete nuclear warheads since then inability to make pits may have adverse consequences for example 1 the united states cannot replace pits for the w88 warhead for the trident ii missile that are destroyed during evaluation currently only one w88 evaluation pit remains so use of more w88 pits would reduce deployable warheads 2 pits deteriorate over time though the rate at which that happens is under study if pits of given type deteriorate so much as to be longer reliable or if an unanticipated defect arises then hundreds to thousands of deployed warheads might have to be withdrawn the national nuclear security administration nnsa which manages the us nuclear weapons program has fivepart plan to restore pit production capability 1 establish small facility pf4 at alamos national laboratory nm to fabricate pits initially for the w88 alamos manufactured the first pit to stockpile standards in april 2003 2 develop procedures to certify w88 pits to provide high confidence without nuclear testing that the pits will work as intended nnsa expects that in 2007 alamos will be able to certify w88 pits that it makes only certified pits can enter the stockpile 3 conduct experiments not nuclear tests in support of w88 pit certification at the nevada test site 4 conduct pit manufacturing and certification for other pits 5 plan modern pit facility mpf with higher capacity than pf4 to reach full operational capability in fy2021 nnsa estimates total cost at 146 billion for items 1 and 2 smaller amounts for items 3 and 4 and 2 billion to 4 billion for item 5 congress has long shown interest in the program it generally supports lowrate production at alamos it raised concern over budgeting and the pace of pit certification but now praises nnsa for turning around the w88 pit program on mpf the fy2004 defense authorization act supported the administrations schedule the appropriations act reduced funding conferees stated that until congress reviews nuclear stockpile plans it is premature to pursue further decisions on mpf mpfs schedule to reach full operational capability slipped year between 2003 and 2004 congress faces several issues as it considers the pit program is nnsas plan for certification reasonable does the united states need new pits beyond limited quantities for the w88 if so what capacity is needed can pf4 be expanded to build enough pits to avoid the need for mpf could mpfs schedule be accelerated should its schedule be delayed this

19 table 4 key dates in nnsas proposal for the pit manufacturing and certification campaign 23 nuclear warhead pit production background and issues for congress background us policy since the mid1950s has been to maintain stockpile of at least several thousand nuclear weapons active and inactive for the indefinite future the bush administration reaffirmed this policy in its nuclear posture review briefed to congress in early 20021 this report deals with an element the administration views as necessary for continued maintenance of the stockpile resuming production of pits key component of nuclear warheads2 us nuclear warheads include primary and secondary stage the primary stage has layer of chemical explosive surrounding shell of fissile metal all warheads in the stockpile use plutonium and other components detonating the explosive compresses the fissile metal so much that it can sustain fission chain reaction the resulting nuclear explosion triggers secondary stage which through fission and fusion produces most of the warheads explosive yield in the primary the components inside the explosive make up what is called the pit of these components the plutonium shell is by far the hardest to make when completed the pit is sealed to protect it from air and moisture from 1952 to 1989 rocky flats plant under the supervision of the department of energy doe and its predecessor agencies used industrialscale processes to manufacture many thousands of pits for deployed weapons all weapons now in the us stockpile use pits made there alamos and lawrence livermore national laboratories fabricated hundreds of oneofakind pits for nuclear tests following 1989 raid by agents of the federal bureau of investigation and others to investigate suspected environmental safety and health violations3 doe suspended rocky flats pit manufacturing operations in 1989 and permanently closed these operations in 1992 thus since 1989 the united states has had capability to build pits of the quality and quantity that doe deems necessary for use in the stockpile doe stated in february 2004 today the united states is the only nuclear weapons power 1 for discussion of this policy see crs report rl31623 us nuclear weapons changes in policy and force structure by amy woolf 2 for more general discussion of nuclear weapons production see crs report 98519 f nuclear weapons production capability issues by jonathan medalia archived report available from the author 3 see matthew wald grand jury seeks inquiry on weapons plant case new york times november 19 1992 16 crs2 without sufficient capability to manufacture stockpilecertified plutonium pits required to sustain its nuclear arsenal4 the national nuclear security administration nnsa semiautonomous agency within doe that congress established in 1999 manages the nuclear weapons complex the labs plants and test site for nuclear warhead rd production maintenance etc it is thus responsible for restoring pit production nnsa holds that the inability to build pits could impair the nuclear stockpile for reasons such as the following each year nnsa monitors some warheads for defects most of these warheads can be put back into the stockpile but few undergo more extensive tests that preclude their reuse these latter tests include destruction of pits therefore when doe built pits for stockpile weapons it built some spares to replace pits expected to be destroyed over warheads design life now warheads are expected to remain in the stockpile far beyond their design lives unless new pits are made by the time spares are used up tests that consume pits would force the removal of deployed warheads from the stockpile based on current data nnsa anticipates that pits will last for decades but will eventually deteriorate if that proves to be the case nnsa would ultimately have to replace all pits that remain in the stockpile beyond that time without replacement pits if type of pit develops certain kinds of defects nnsa might have to withdraw from service all warheads using that pit if nnsa designs new nuclear warheads in the future it would probably need new pits for them nnsa now stores thousands of pits from retired warheads in theory new warhead designs might incorporate stored pits however any aging problems would affect stored pits as well as deployed pits so that nnsa cannot count on using existing pits in future warheads the nuclear posture review presents the administrations general policy guidance for nuclear weapons and related defense elements including infrastructure while it is classified nnsa said that the review stated that the ability to produce pits is important to ensure the future viability of the nations nuclear deterrent5 4 us department of energy secretary of energy national nuclear security administration report to congressional defense committees on an enhanced schedule for the modern pit facility requested by the united states senate in senate report 108 46 pages 457458 february 1 2004 p 3 5 ibid p 1 crs3 the national nuclear security administrations program for pit production the pit manufacturing and certification campaign is nnsas effort to restore pit production campaigns are focused scientific and engineering efforts whose goal is to develop and maintain special capabilities and tools needed for continued certification of the stockpile now and into the future in the absence of underground nuclear testing6 this campaign seeks to manufacture and certify one type of pit in the short term restore the capability to build other pit types in the intermediate term and build highercapacity manufacturing facility for the long term this section discusses the elements of this campaign congressional actions below discusses congressional handling of this campaign table 1 presents estimated funding the fy2005 request document is the first to include detailed outyear budget projections in this case through fy2009 generated through the futureyears nuclear security program providing window into future plans the basis for the pit manufacturing and certification campaign was record of decision on stockpile stewardship published december 26 1996 in which doe decided to reestablish pit fabrication capability with small capacity at the alamos national laboratory7 doe estimated requirements at 20 pits per year to replace pits destroyed in surveillance testing but also claimed that with the capability to produce all types of pits in the stockpile it could produce about 50 pits per year in single shift operations it judged the latter rate would be sufficient for the next 10 years or more rejected larger capacity because of small current demand and the long period before added capacity might be needed and raised the prospect of greater capacity in the future8 shortterm goal w88 pits rocky flats plant ceased production abruptly when it was only partway through the planned production run of pits for the w88 nuclear warhead used on the trident ii submarinelaunched ballistic missile only one w88 pit remains for destructive evaluation9 accordingly the most urgent shortterm need of the current pit program is to produce and certify w88 pits to accomplish these tasks the w88 pit effort has two main elements within the pit manufacturing and certification campaign w88 pit manufacturing and w88 pit certification third element pit campaign support activities at nts mainly involves subcritical experiments at the nevada test site to provide data that nnsa requires for w88 pit

not available for fy2004 the pit campaign was reduced from 2985 million to 2968 million as result of the omnibus rescission of 059 percent the reduction was all applied to w88 pit manufacturing the amount appropriated for that component was 1267 million source for the latter figure us congress committee of conference making appropriations for energy and water development for the fiscal year ending september 30 2004 and for other purposes 108th congress 1st session hrept 108357 usgpo p 158 b fy2008 and fy2009 funding for w88 pit manufacturing is currently included in directed stockpile work nnsa estimates that the cost for this activity will be 110 million year for each of these two years these amounts do not appear in table 1 which presents funding for campaigns crs5 as table 1 shows nnsa projects that w88 pit manufacturing will remain in the pit manufacturing and certification campaign through fy2007 in the fy2005 budget submission w88 pit manufacturing continues in fy2008 and beyond in different part of nnsas weapons activities budget directed stockpile work dsw which is direct work on warheads currently in the stockpile this was originally planned to mark the transition from manufacturing that supported certification to interim production of w88 pits pit campaign support activities at nts is not budgeted in fy2007 because subcritical experiments to support the w88 are planned to be completed in fy2006 similarly w88 pit certification budgets are planned to end after fy2008 as result of expected certification in fy2007 by way of background the term certifiable and the fouryear gap between delivery of certifiable pit and certified or war reserve pit have caused much confusion certifiable pits meet quality control and process standards certified pits meet product performance standards certifiable pit is manufactured using processes meeting standards set by the laboratory that designed the weapon and approved by nnsa war reserve pit is one that nnsa has determined to meet engineering and physics standards to be accepted for use in deployed nuclear weapons nnsa has launched major effort to establish that certifiable pits meet these product standards it holds that it needs this effort because alamos manufactures pits using different methods and equipment than did rocky flats rocky flats pits were proven to work in underground nuclear tests at the nevada test site the us nuclear test moratorium which started in 1992 and continues to the present bars similar tests on pits manufactured at alamos nnsa plans to provide the basis for certifying pits without nuclear tests by demonstrating through computer models subcritical experiments10 smallscale laboratory experiments experiments using multimilliondollar nuclear physics facilities and archived data from past nuclear tests that alamos pits are equivalent to rocky flats pits in many key characteristics and by resolving uncertainties conservatively such as by insisting on tighter specifications and greater manufacturing precision in these ways nnsa seeks to provide confidence that alamos pits will work as designed to meet the need for w88 pits nnsa decided to create at alamos facility that could produce pits at low rate the facility is housed in pf4 plutonium facility 4 which opened in 1978 for plutonium rd it occupies about 30 of the space in pf4 available for plutonium operations another 25 is reserved for plutonium metal preparation alamos manufactured the first certifiable w88 pit in april 2003 nnsa expects alamos to produce six or more certifiable w88 pits in fy2005 to achieve by fy2007 sustained manufacturing rate of 10 10 crs offers the following definition based on documents and on discussions with doe and laboratory staff subcritical experiments at nevada test site involve chemical high explosives and fissile materials in configurations and quantities such that selfsustaining nuclear fission chain reaction can result in these experiments the chemical high explosives are used to generate high pressures that are applied to the fissile materials the only fissile material used in the 19 subcritical experiments held from 1997 through 2002 is plutonium239 nnsa states that these experiments support certification of w88 pits department of energy fy2004 budget request vol 1 p 77 crs6 20 pitsyear and to complete certification work in fy200711 nnsa also expects alamos to certify in fy2007 the first w88 pit made there12 in march 2004 nnsa indicated that certification was on track and that production of certifiable pits was proceeding extremely well with five such pits produced as of early march 200413 the nearterm goal is to produce those pits needed to support certification experiments each early pit has specific physics and engineering certification test purpose and will exercise the processes required to confirm that production is reliable and efficient accordingly there is reason now to produce pits faster than the schedule calls for once certification activities are complete nnsa may choose to increase the production rate in theory nuclear testing could accelerate pit certification successful test would demonstrate promptly that pit worked and that the processes used to make it were acceptable in practice however nnsa would probably conduct series of tests because single test would not likely provide sufficient confidence and the first test might indicate the need for changes that would require subsequent tests to validate further it would take 2 or 3 years from presidential decision to test until the conduct of first test while the administration plans to reduce that time perhaps to 18 months it would take some time to make that change compared to the current program if it proceeds as anticipated then testing might accelerate certification by year or so pf4s capacity and schedule and the schedule for pit certification have changed over time and statements have been contradictory in the december 1996 record of decision cited above doe appeared to need capacity of 20 pits per year would wind up with capacity of 50 year and found the latter sufficient for some time doe foresees only the replacement of pits destroyed in routine surveillance testing unless nearterm lifelimiting phenomenon is discovered in stockpile pits the technological capability to manufacture all of the pit designs in the enduring stockpile provides an inherent capacity to manufacture about 50 pits per year in single shift operations about 20 pits per year are expected to be 11 us department of energy office of management budget and evaluationcfo fy 2005 congressional budget request vol 1 national nuclear security administration doeme0032 february 2004 p

about 50 pits per year is therefore judged to be sufficient for the next 10 or more years14 the fy1999 doe budget request released february 1998 stated in accordance with the record of decision on the programmatic environmental impact statement the current objective is to establish long term capacity for manufacturing up to 50 pitsyear with single shift of personnel15 further doe planned to produce single wr war reserve pit per year at lanl beginning in fy 1998 and provide up to 10 pits annually into the stockpile ie certified as war reserve beginning in fy 2001 to meet nearterm requirements and to meet schedules to rebuild qualify and certify trident ii w88 pits by fy2001 and develop intermediate pit production capability of 20 pits per year at the alamos national laboratory by 200716 in the september 1999 record of decision on the sitewide environmental impact statement for alamos national laboratory doe decided to establish at alamos capacity to produce nominally 20 pits per year to be achieved in 2007 while this decision does not change the 50pitperyear mission assignment made in the stockpile stewardship and management programmatic environmental impact statement record of decision it does suspend full implementation of that decision until an undetermined time in the future17 in 2000 nnsa stated fy 2001 efforts will support w88 pit certification by fy 200518 in 2001 the

goal of fy 0721 and in february 2004 nnsa stated its intent to enable the plutonium facility at lanl ta55 to achieve by fy2007 sustained manufacturing rate of 1020 pitsyear22 these changes have occurred for several reasons nnsa has over time developed better sense of how many pits would be needed alamos has found that certifying pits is more complicated and timeconsuming than it had anticipated at first the schedule has slipped further the documents or peoples reading of them have led some to confuse available and required capacity intermediateterm goal other pits the pit manufacturing and certification campaign has an intermediateterm element pit manufacturing capability pmc for pit manufacturing and certification activities not specifically supporting the w88 this includes work on pits for the w87 warhead currently carried by minuteman iii intercontinental ballistic missiles and the b61 mod 7 gravity bomb nnsa notes that these two pits together with the w88 pit span technical variations of pits within the stockpile23 that is the ability to manufacture and certify these three pits would help nnsa manufacture and certify all types of existing pits that may need such work in the future while pf4 could build some w87 and b61 developmental pits by 2012 under current plans pmc would not manufacture war reserve pits for these warheads because many spare pits of these types are available to be cut apart for examination in ways that preclude their reassembly and reuse rather pmc will develop manufacturing technologies that nnsa plans to use in fabricating pits for these and other warheads in pf4 or the modern pit facility table 1 shows pit manufacturing capability increasing substantially as pilot work on w88 pit manufacturing and certification is

develop manufacturing capability for other types of pits longterm goal modern pit facility plutonium radioactive metal decays radioactively and generates heat as result plutonium pits undergo metallurgical and other changes that may affect weapon performance24 as of may 2003 the nnsa weapons laboratories have determined that pits will perform adequately for 4560 years25 this remains nnsas estimate as of march 2004 this estimate could increase or decrease based on experimental data further analysis or data obtained by examining pits from deployed weapons accordingly nnsa is working to refine its estimate two of its labs are performing pit aging experiments and modeling to determine whether pit lifetimes equal or exceed 60 years 26 alamos is conducting experiments that accelerate sixteenfold key process that ages plutonium27 livermore will also conduct studies related to assessing pit life28 the results will help define whether potential new pit manufacturing facility should be accelerated or delayed and what capacity would be appropriate in addition to funds for the pit manufacturing and certification campaign nnsa requested 259 million for fy2004 for component of another campaign enhanced surveillance to support pit aging research29 the fy2005 nnsa budget document did not break out funds for pit aging research several factors larger stockpile shorter pit life desire to build pits for newdesign warheads or desire to hedge against the prospect that type of pit develops problem that necessitates replacing all units quickly would increase the production capacity needed or require having that capacity sooner or both smaller stockpile etc would have the opposite effect international events could work in either direction the implications of plutonium aging for the need and schedule for new pits are therefore debated some outside government argue that there is clear end to pit life or that pits could last many more decades further some claim that with thousands of spare pits available from retired warheads many would be available as hedge against aging in the remaining arsenal30 responding to 24 these changes are detailed in us department of

budget request vol 1 p 152 30 greg mello need for largescale pit facility existing alamos facilities are adequate alamos study group remarks and press advisory october 24 2002 continued crs10 concerns that plutonium will deteriorate in ways that impair weapon performance one report finds that plutonium undergoes benign aging and exhibits good crystalline order even after decades of aging31 it may also be argued that any decision on future pit production can be put off until there is reasonable evidence on the shelf life of pits nnsa on the other hand believes that pits will ultimately fail to function if one type of pit used in deployed warheads goes bad then depending on the specifics of the problem there might be confidence in any of the hundreds to thousands of warheads using that pit or in spare pits of that type which would age at the same rate as pits in deployed warheads nnsas view is that maintaining the stockpile indefinitely therefore requires in the longer term higher pit fabrication capacity than pf4 can offer in order to replace pits removed due to aging or destructive testing similarly the panel to assess the reliability safety and security of the united states nuclear stockpile the foster panel observed while it is desirable to attempt to forecast the life spans of plutonium and other weapon components we must be able to replace such parts if our predictions are incorrect or our needs for deterrence change and recommended that nnsa establish with urgency pit production capability adequate for national needs32 responding to the argument that plutonium aging will not impair weapon performance for long time nnsa asserts that based on research at the weapons labs increased deltaphase stability of plutonium with aging cannot be assumed33 because of or depending on ones point of view despite uncertainty about pit life nnsa has decided to proceed with planning for new facility the modern pit facility mpf which is another element of the pit manufacturing and certification campaign nnsa is currently assessing capacity from 125 to 450 pits per year in singleshift operation34 choice of capacity would depend on requirements for production reserve capacity and expansion potential all to be determined nnsa estimates that mpf operations will start in fy2019 and that the plant will achieve full production capability in fy202135

new release date or whether this decision would delay mpf mpf has not proceeded on an accelerated basis because of competing priorities uncertainties in the size of the stockpile and pit lifetimes and the value for mpf of gaining experience from alamoss pit efforts the nuclear posture review and approval of mission need provided impetus for nnsa to give higher priority to mpf this higher priority was to begin in fy2004 as reflected in the increased request from 21 million in fy2003 to 228 million in fy2004 as discussed under the fy2004 request below however the fy2004 energy and water development appropriations act pl 108137 reduced funds for mpf from the requested 228 million to 108 million on grounds that it would be premature to pursue further decisions on mpf pending congressional review of the nuclear stockpile plan nnsa stated that in general reductions could cut either the scope of activity or the schedule in this case scope involves activities conceptual design and steps to comply with the national environmental protection act since these activities are required for mpf nnsa anticipates that the reduction will result in slippage of the schedule it estimates the slippage at one year future technical developments funding decisions or other actions might offset this delay if decisionmakers later determine that oneyear slip is inadvisable for the long term40 as table 1 shows nnsa projects substantial increase in mpfs budget through fy2009 mpfs schedule has slipped between june 2003 and february 2004 as table 2 shows nnsa states that this delay

on an enhanced schedule for the modern pit facility crs13 design schedule starting some construction actions before completing the final design and using longer work week 16 some costs to accelerate the schedule are modest fraction of the total project cost planning activities before construction starts are expected to account for more than half the total project time at about fifth of the estimated cost 5 accelerating mpf can reduce its required capacity rocky flats produced most currentlystockpiled pits between 1978 and 1989 if pits have 60year life they would expire between 2038 and 2049 the time available to remanufacture them largely sets the number that must be produced each year accelerating mpf would spread that production run over more years lowering required capacity after the initial run production could be done at steady lower rate nnsa did not provide numbers linking schedule to capacity as they are classified 1112 using pf4ta5543 as the sole pit facility has many drawbacks nnsa states that it requires the agility to simultaneously manufacture different types of pits and that ta55 cannot provide such agility for stockpile sized in the 1000s of warheads because of inadequate floor space nnsa says it could make do with ta 55 if the longterm stockpile is at level in the 100s of weapons with reduced number of pit types and if modifications to ta55 to manufacture 50 pits per year could be made without constructing an additional building it recommended against this upgrade for such reasons as high risk that it could not do the upgrade within ta55 the upgrade might be completed around 2015 at which point the facility would be about 40 years old and it would be problematic to operate it another 50 years and the layout designed for rd is not optimal for production operations 1314 nnsa plans to take various steps to preserve expertise in pit production these include maintaining an interim production capability at alamos drawing on us experts in plutonium manufacturing and nuclear facility operations for planning mpf and starting to hire and train staff for mpf at least 5 years before operations start 18 nnsa staff stated that there are too many uncertainties to establish an annual requirement for numbers and types of pits to be produced when mpf is operational44 instead nnsa arrived at range of capacities by examining the range of variance of such factors as size and composition of the stockpile in the future pit lifetime and when 43 pf4 is located within technical area 55 ta55 at alamos the two terms are often used interchangeably 44 information provided by nnsa staff march 17 2004 crs14 fullscale production might start nnsa will continue to revalidate mpf capacity 21 in particular 125 pits per year is reasonable estimate for the minimum capacity minimum set of pit manufacturing equipment would result in manufacturing facility with capacity of approximately 125 pitsyear 19 challenges to does report on mpf acceleration the case for accelerating or even building mpf might be challenged in the following ways if pf4 began production at rate of 50 pits per year in 2015 and the stockpile many years from now had 2000 pits both deployed and nondeployed pf4 could produce 1750 of these pits by 2050 future stockpile in this range is possible the strategic offensive reductions treaty calls for 17002200 deployed strategic warheads by 2012 and there are additional stockpiled pits that are not deployed on the other hand the number of deployed nuclear forces has been declining for 20 years or more if mpfs capacity is 125 pits per year and the stockpile many years from now included 2000 pits then nnsa could rebuild these pits in 16 years if the rebuild had to be finished by 2050 then in theory mpf could begin operations in 2034 it might be well to advance this date by few years to provide margin in case unanticipated problems required an earlier rebuild of some warheads even in that case it could be argued that there is need to complete mpf by 2021 let alone to accelerate it accordingly while mpf might be accelerated by few years at fraction of the projected cost it might arguably be better use of funds to wait on mpf until pit life and future stockpile size became clearer if it appears some years from now that the future stockpile will drop sharply then pf4 might suffice yielding net savings largescale production at mpf is scheduled to begin three decades after rocky flats shut mpf would involve different people than rocky flats at different location in new facility with different equipment and processes despite ongoing efforts for certification it could be argued that uncertainties would be likely to arise about the performance of mpf pits these uncertainties could generate pressure to conduct nuclear tests keeping the production line open at ta55 might reduce these uncertainties despite explicit direction by the senate armed services committee that the report base mpf capacity on specific requirements nnsa based capacity on parametric analysis it may be that there was other reasonable approach and capacity of 125 pits per year may turn out to be needed if it is found that substantially smaller capacity is needed once mpf is well along however the united states would be committed to mpf even though it would in this case have been less costly to use pf4 crs15 congressional actions congress has expressed interest in the pit program for many years both houses have repeatedly raised concerns over such management issues as budgeting and planning and over the slow pace of pit certification both houses have supported lowrate pit production at alamos requests and responses fy1997fy2003 fy1997 national defense authorization

campaign to allow the eis for mpf to proceed urged nnsa and dod to establish valid annual pit requirement and cautioned nnsa not to begin construction on mpf until dod and doe have approved valid requirement for it57 the conference bill provided 1995 million for the campaign an increase of 50 million over the request in its report on fy2003 energy and water appropriations the senate appropriations committee recommended 2460 million for pit manufacturing and certification an increase of 515 million over the request the committee however remained greatly concerned about the nnsas refusal to request funds consistent with its own project plan submitted less than 1 year ago because this was not done which would have resulted in lower request for this important project the committee has been forced to reduce other items in the budget the senate appropriations committee directed nnsa to revise the plan and report to congress before the end of the current fiscal year and then annually58 the house appropriations committee provided 1945 million the requested amount for pit manufacturing and certification the final appropriation for pit manufacturing and certification was 2220 million with 065 rescission general reduction and reprogramming the adjusted appropriation was 2206 million according to the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference the increase will ensure that the nnsa maintains its commitment to produce certifiable w88 pit by 2003 and certified w88 pit by 2007 the conference statement directed nnsa to provide revised pit production and certification plan to the relevant congressional committees by march 31 2003 and annually thereafter59 the fy2004 request for fy2004 the administration requested substantial increase to

s 1050 national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2004 each armed services committee recommended authorizing the full amount requested for the pit manufacturing and certification campaign the senate armed services committee urged doe to evaluate options for accelerating mpf and for maintaining pit production expertise until mpf opens and to indicate how the production program can be made able to respond rapidly to needs for multiple types of pits or for pits that can meet changing military requirements accordingly the committee directed the secretary of energy to report on steps doe is taking to accelerate mpf and protect production expertise and to provide schedule to establish requirement by pit type by year to ensure that the mpf is appropriately sized it directed that the report be submitted to the congressional defense committees with the fy2005 budget request61 the report is summarized above under longterm goal modern pit facility the conference bill included the full request for the pit manufacturing and certification campaign the report hrept 108354 did not comment on the matter which was not at issue between house and senate on november 7 the house agreed to the conference report on hr 1588 36240 the senate agreed to the report 953 on november 12 the president signed the measure into law pl 108136 on november 24 the house appropriations committee saw the pit campaign as proceeding too quickly in hr 2754 energy and water development appropriations for 2004 it recommended reducing the request for this campaign by 470 million still an increase of 122 million over the fy2003 budget the committee praised nnsa and alamos national laboratory for turning around this campaign but urged nnsa to reduce costs it stated that the current plan would aggressively pursue multibillion dollar modern pit facility before the first production pit has even been successfully certified for use in the stockpile in reducing mpf to 108 million from the requested 228 million it recommended that nnsa should look hard at better ways to use the alamos pit production facility for nearterm requirements and take less aggressive planning approach to mpf it felt that it was premature to spend 197 million to develop technologies for manufacturing pits other than for the w88 when mpf was at least 15 years from operating and so recommended reducing this part of the request to 47 million62 on july 18 2003 the house passed hr 2754 without amending the weapons activities section which includes 60 department of energy fy2004 budget request vol 1 p 77 61

strategic nuclear weapons the conference report stated the conferees agree with the house report that until the congress reviews the revised future stockpile plan it is premature to pursue further

work beginning in fy2008 as per note b to table 1 w88 pit certification and support activities at nts are reduced as w88 certification work is completed the pit program will increasingly focus on developing technology to manufacture other pit types which accounts for the ramp in pit manufacturing capability funding and on mpf which increases substantially as work begins on an eis on the selected site for mpf in fy2005 and conceptual design activities are expanded to prepare for the start of preliminary design in fy2007 the schedule for mpf may change issues for congress this section highlights issues connected with the pit program raises arguments and counterarguments for each issue and presents under prospects the state of play for each issue or what currently appears to be the most likely outcome issues dealt with include pit certification the need for new pits beyond limited quantities for w88 warheads if new pits are needed what is the required capacity how might that capacity be obtained and how quickly could or should that be done is nnsas plan for certification reasonable yes to certify pits without nuclear testing nnsa believes it must use much more sophisticated techniques than were used to certify rocky flats pits in order to rule out each plausible source of failure in one view only nuclear testing can assure that pits will work as intended on grounds that pits are sensitive to minor variations in process and materials many potential unknowns exist and computer models may not capture what we do not know others see the certification plan as excessive claiming pits will work despite minor production variations for decades alamos and livermore technicians made many oneofakind pits for testing these pits did not meet war reserve standards but as evidenced by the nuclear test record great many of them worked64 prospects absent nuclear testing the united states seems sure to use nnsas plan to certify pits does the united states need new pits beyond limited quantities for w88 yes in one view greater pit manufacturing capability is needed to hedge against uncertainty in pit life in order to ensure that the us nuclear deterrent 64 for an official unclassified record of us nuclear tests see us department of energy united states nuclear tests july 1945 through september 1992 doenv200 rev 14 december 1994 viii 97 p crs21 remains effective further the international situation may require the united states to manufacture newdesign warheads including pits pits in storage may prove unsuitable for these warheads because of design or aging some believe pits will deteriorate so slowly that decision on mpf can be deferred for decades some see new types of warheads as undesirable because these warheads would imply that the united states was preparing to test build deploy and threaten the use of nuclear weapons so these critics reject the newweapons argument as rationale for new pits those who favor abolishing nuclear weapons would not produce these weapons or their components prospects one can be certain that nnsa will not need to manufacture pits at some future date and at any rate nnsa will have limited capacity to produce pits at pf4 accordingly the need for some new pits is less at issue than are capacity schedule and the need for mpf if so what capacity is needed low it is not clear that pits will fail for many decades if ever in the critics view pf4 could replace the few pits without spares that are destroyed during surveillance if newdesign warheads are needed small numbers might suffice or nnsa might use spare pits for those warheads or it might convert existing warheads for new missions without changing the nuclear explosive package multipleshift operations at pf4 would increase output somewhat if needed further critics argue proceeding with mpf would reduce funds for other stockpile stewardship programs higher one study stated paramount concern is the need to begin work now on an adequate plutonium pit production manufacturing capability in order to hedge against the uncertainties in useful pit life and in the time required to establish new production facility65 mpf in this view would guard against the failure of one or more types of pits and would enable ongoing replacement of pits to forestall problems from aging it would permit fabrication of large numbers of newdesign warheads while smaller stockpile might permit lower pit production capacity there can be assurance on future stockpile size prospects the fy2004 energy and water development appropriations conference report required doe and dod to submit report to congress with the fy2005 budget request providing details on stockpile plan supporting the nuclear weapons stockpile memorandum and stated it would be premature to pursue further decisions on mpf pending congressional review of the report in hearing before the house armed services committee on march 18 2004 nnsa administrator linton brooks could not provide an estimate of the delivery date of the report the report should help clarify stockpile size giving some indication of required capacity on the other hand while the report will focus on the stockpile through 2012 the stockpile and required capacity could change substantially by 2021 when mpf is scheduled to begin full production operations thus capacity will be at issue for some time to come and with it the fate of mpf can nnsa expand pf4 to build enough pits without mpf yes critics of the current plan note that some areas of pf4 are not used for pit manufacturing instead they are used for fabricating plutonium238 components for space probes monitoring weapons components and storing obsolete equipment from past plutonium rd floor constraints make the layout of pit production equipment 65 us panel to assess the reliability safety and security of the united states nuclear stockpile fy 1999 report november 8 1999 letter of submittal crs22 less than ideal using all of pf4 for pit production arranging equipment more efficiently and using multiple shifts might raise pf4s capacity beyond 50 pits year by one estimate if national security depended on boosting the rate and if alamos had prepositioned the necessary production equipment pf4s capacity might reach 100 or more year66 further some plutonium work could be consolidated moved out of pf4 or moved to livermores superblock facility67 mpfs proponents note that pf4 is the nations main plutonium rd facility they hold that using it for production would interfere with rd nnsa holds that the maximum feasible capacity of pf4 is 80 pits per year that achieving this capacity would require major changes to plutonium work and considerable expense and that adding 50 years to the life of pf4 which would be 40 years old by the time that it could begin production at the new rate may not be feasible68 since mpf must proceed now if it is to provide hedge against possible future needs the question of expanding pf4 is moot prospects mpfs prospects appear unsettled without knowing pit life future stockpile size and required capacity it cannot be determined conclusively if pf4 would suffice and such determination might not be possible for some years on the other hand pf4 would not suffice if the dominant consideration is desire to begin to hedge against possible future need for larger capacity than pf4 could reasonably offer congressional approval of mpf is also uncertain while the fy2004 national defense authorization act provided the funding requested for the entire pit program including mpf the energy and water development appropriations act cut mpf funding from 228 million to 108 million and the conferees as noted stated it was premature to pursue further decisions on mpf pending report on the stockpile plan could nnsa accelerate mpfs schedule yes the nnsa report on mpf acceleration cited above presents various steps that it states could accelerate mpf by 3 to 4 years yes but projects often take longer than anticipated so net acceleration might be less than anticipated if mpf acceleration were to delay other nnsa projects by drawing funds or managerial attention from them it is not clear that the tradeoff would be worthwhile prospects the nnsa report arguably moves the debate away from the feasibility of accelerating mpf toward the desirability of so doing ironically if congressional actions delay mpf and congress were to subsequently decide to return to the original scheduled operating date an accelerated schedule might be the only way to meet the original schedule should congress and the administration delay mpfs schedule yes those who would delay mpf find little if any evidence that pits will deteriorate in ways that will require rebuilding of all pits of given type hundreds to thousands of units furthermore international developments might lead to smaller arsenal that pf4 could support it would be unwise in their view to spend billions on facility that might well prove unneeded and that would support any future decision 66 mello need for largescale pit facility existing alamos facilities are adequate 67 regarding consolidation or moving work out of pf4 see mpf eis p s25 regarding superblock see john immele perspectives weapons insider publication of the alamos nuclear weapons program januaryjune 2002 p 3 68 mpf eis p s24 s25 crs23 to proceed with development of new types of nuclear weapons mpfs supporters believe uncertainties about plutonium aging and the international situation mean that the united states would be taking big risk to delay proceeding with mpf if events turn out unfavorably an inability to make pits on large scale could prove disastrous to us security hedge instead of proceeding with or delaying mpf based on incomplete information nnsa could proceed on the current track until 2012 by that time that agency expects to complete the large volume of preconstruction work eis site selection planning permitting design process development etc if at that time plutonium aging did not appear to be problem or if the stockpile were projected to shrink or if fewer types of nuclear weapons were deployed or the likelihood of using nuclear weapons had become more remote than at present then the united states would for fraction of the cost of mpf have purchased hedge in case mpf needed to be built on the current schedule should such events turn out unfavorably mpf could proceed to construction and operation with little or loss of time prospects in the short term further delay of several months in submitting the doddoe report on stockpile plans could lead congress to delay mpf in the fy2005 budget cycle in the longer term for reasons noted earlier prospects for acceleration or delay are both
