naqib awk said the alikozais chose mullah naqibs karimullah to lead the alikozai scr pointed out coalition conventional wisdom that president karzai had interfered in that process to appoint karimullah which led to certain alikozai elements to support the taliban in arghandab awk said unconvincingly this was not the case awk then contradicted himself and said karimullah in fact did not

media saying the allegations are like spice added to dish to make it more enticing to eat political party for southern pashtuns 8 srel nato isaf scr asked awk if there are discussions to create pashtunoriented political party in the south awk said such party would be announced shortly and it would encompass southern pashtuns from herat to kandahar tajiks also would be represented awk said

united states and is eager to be seen as helping the coalition he also demonstrated that he will dissemble when it suits his needs he appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his
