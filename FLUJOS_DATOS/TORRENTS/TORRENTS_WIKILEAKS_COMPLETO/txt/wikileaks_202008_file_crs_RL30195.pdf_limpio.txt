large transactions would never go to the floor at all but would take place directly between the principals such deals make up what is called the fourth market the ats is the product of two factors 1 the desire of institutional investors to cut trade execution costs and avoid the market impact of their trades and 2 advances in data processing and electronic technology the first ats to have

the atss be able to maintain the level of surveillance provided by the traditional markets in publish ing its 1998 ats rules6 the sec noted two examples that indicate the seriousness of these concerns the twotiered market instinet and nasdaq in 1994 pricefixing scheme on the nasdaq market came to light nasda q7 market makers had adopted the convention of not using prices that ended in odd eighths this meant that the minimum bidask spread was artificially maintained at8 25 cents per share as part of the investigation that followed the sec turned it s attention to the function of the instinet the ats used by institutions and securities firms to trade nasdaq stocks 9 the sec found that 90 of transactions on instinet involved nasdaq marke t makers or alers and that 85 of the prices quoted over instinet were better than the prices offered by those same market makers to investors who traded the sam stocks on nasdaq the pricing convention was not followed on instinet oddeighth prices were common the disparity in pricing could exist b ecause instinet prices were not reported to the public in effect there were two markets private one limited to dealers and institutions and second market where public investors traded t inferior prices the sec concluded that the exist ence of instinet supported the price fixing arrangement because the availability of private market removed the incentive for dealers to compete on price by narrowing spreads on the public markethttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30195crs5 us securities and exchange commission release 3438156 january 10 1997 10

effect on january 20 1997 in june 1998 the sec filed cease and desist order against two traders for illegal manipulation of stoc k prices on january 27 and 28 1997 the manipulation exploited one of the ne w11 trading rules which required that limit orders for at least 100 shares placed b customers be displayed on market makers screens if the prices were better than the market makers own quotes12 the technique of the manipulation was as follows one of the traders woul d enter limit order to ll 100 shares at price below the best available current quote the national b est bidoffer or nbbo since limit orders of this size were now required to be displayed to t he public this would effectively lower the nbbo then the other trader would place buy orde r in the same stock which would be executed

finally the second trader would sell th shares he had just purchased and the first trader would immediately cancel the limit order to buy the traders were successful in manipulating prices profitably

prices in the primary market may become more volatile as there are fewer b uyers and sellers to absorb large orders another way to put this is to say that the primary market suffers loss of liquidity as trading moves to atss which means that transactions of given size will have greater price impact perhaps reducing the efficiency of the pricesetting mechanism at present the sec does not view market fragmentation as pressing problem although it foresees that over time an ats may become the primary market fo r some securities competition among markets brings offsetting benefits and th e16 effects of fragmentation are tempered by the trend towards linkages amon g exchanges and by rules requiring that the best prices be available to all investors 17 moreov er moves to prevent fragmentation by regulation would be criticized s attempts to defend those with entrenched interests in the status quo related concern is how the ts markets would fare in market crisis such as the

to predict gaps in regulation exchange vs ats although ats markets now offer virtually all the trading s ervices that exchanges provide they have not been regulated or legally classified as exchanges

exchange must consider the public interest in its dealings its fees must be reasonable and reasonably allocated it must establish rules to admit members on nondiscriminatory basis it must conduct market surveillance and its rules must not be anticom petitive an exchange has governmental powers it can apply sanctions to its members therefore its structure of governance is als controlled by sec regulation members of an ats regulated as brokerdealer do not have the same regulatory redress available to them investors who trade on n ats may not have the degree of regulatory protection that applies to exchang customers even though the two trading venues handle transactions in exactly th same securities on the other hand some features of brokerdealer regulation are clearl inappropriate to an ats for instance brokerdealers mus t join the securities investor protection corporation which insures customer funds against broker failure eve n though most atss never hold customer funds but simply match buyers and sellers the primary intent of the sec rules issued in december 1998 was to resolv these disparities and inconsistencies the secs new rules the new s ec rules give an ats choice

rules do not require an ats registered as brokerdealer to perform market surveillance however the sec noted that it intends to work with the self regulatory organizations the exchanges and the national association of securitie s dealers nasd to ensure that they can operate ongoing realtime surveillance for manipulation and fraud and develop surveillance and examination procedure s specifically targeted to alternative trading systems they oversee20 the rules provide for pilot program that is an exemption from regulation for new trading systems for two years such systems could be put into operatio n without prior sec approval the exemption however does not ap ply to systems that exceed the 5 volume threshold they then become subject to the relevant provisions of regulation ats the rules also specify that us securit ies laws do not prevent an exchange from reorganizin g itself into forprofit business they are now structured as mutua l membership associations but some observers believe that this reflects the 200year old floortrading model where access to the market was limited by physical spac constraints demutualization which has been undertaken by several europea n exchang has the potential to lower the costs of market entry and increas competition among markets finally the rules do not address the question of electronic trading of foreig n securitie s technology is available to give us investors direct access to foreig n markets instinet is already an international trading system its screens are available in many countries and carry price

established institutions in the securities industry have regularly an d effectively used existing regulation to stifle innovation and competition another22 witness described the traditional exchange floorauction trading model as one which adds unnecessary layers of intermediaries and creates inefficient marketplaces by greatly distancing the ultimate buyers and sellers from the point of transaction 23 perhaps the central issue in the computerization of the stock market is ho w much of the service provided by traditional intermediaries exchanges an d brokerdealers adds economic value to the market and the economy investor s have long since discovered that new communications media can provide them directly with much of the market information for which b rokers used to charge hence the rise of discoun t brokerage other functions however are not so easily replaced intermediaries provide assurances that securities sold to the public will be of th quality advertised by the issuing corporation they guarantee that purchased securities will be delivered to the buye r or that payment will be received by sellers and finally in times of crisis they re expected to keep markets open and trading smoothly even when their pure selfinterest would lead them to withdraw from the market the logical end of present trends may seem to be to reconfigur the stock market into an internet auction where buyer and seller meet directly and let both beware however on witness at the march 25 hearing pointed out that this ebay model is fine for flea market but not an adequate model for us financial markets as24 investors large and small r ush towards cheaper trading and direct market access and as ats and internet entrepreneurs strive to accommodate them it is wort h remembering that in the long run the pendulum may swing back the other way demands for liquidity may drive markets to consolidate and demand for marke t integrity may increase demands for regulated intermediaries who are charged wit h maintaining fair and orderly markets in the mea ntime an error or overshooting in either direction can impose rea l costs on the economy not just stock market participants in terms of higher tha n necessary capital costs for business and less efficient allocation of investment whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30195crs11 translates into slower economic growth therefore it is ppropriate for congress and the sec not to stand back and let the chips fall where they may but to continu oversight and to intervene with new regulation or legislation when required
