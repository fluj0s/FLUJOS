taking place between the two countries every day of the year each country has an increasingly large stake in the health and openness of the others economy france is the 9th largest merchandise trading partner for the united states and the united states is frances largest trading partner outside the european union more than half of bilateral trade occurs in major industries such as aerospace pharmaceuticals medical and scientific equipment electrical machinery and plastics where both countries export and import similar products the united states and france also have large and growing trade in services such as tourism education finance insurance and other professional services in recent years france has been the sixth largest market for us exports of services although trade in goods and services receive most of the attention in terms of the commercial relationship foreign direct investment and the activities of foreign affiliates can be viewed as the backbone of the commercial relationship the scale of sales of usowned companies operating in france and frenchowned companies operating in the united states outweighs trade transactions by factor of almost five in 2006 france was the eleventh largest host country for us foreign direct investment abroad and the united states with investments valued at 659 billion was the number one foreign investor in france during that same year french companies had direct investments in the united states totaling 159 billion historical cost basis making france the fifth largest investor in the united states frenchowned companies employed some 473000 workers in the united states in 2005 compared to 619000 employees of us companies invested in france most us trade and investment transactions with france dominated by multinational companies are noncontroversial nevertheless three prominent issues agriculture government intervention in corporate activity and the war in iraq have contributed periodically to increased bilateral tensions the most pointed perhaps arose in early 2003 with reports of us consumer boycotts of french goods and calls from some members of congress for trade retaliation against france and germany due to foreign policy differences over the iraq war the foreign policy dispute however appears not to have had much impact on sales of products such as french wines perfumes and toiletries travel goods and handbags and cheeses that are most prone to being boycotted while some public opinion polls at the time suggested support for economic boycotts as way of expressing opposition to frances position on iraq an economic backlash appears not to have materialized effective boycotts would jeopardize thousands of jobs on both sides of the atlantic this report will be

this report was written at the request of the cochairs of the congressional french caucus usfrench commercial ties overview us commercial ties with france are extensive mutually profitable and growing each country has an increasingly large stake in the health and openness of the others economy while the relationship dates back to the colonial period it is also constantly evolving the us and french economies share many similarities based on gross domestic product gdp in 2007 of 137 trillion the united states is the worlds largest economy france with gdp of 25 trillion is the worlds sixth largest economy frances population 2007 of 641 million has per capita income of 39000 while the comparable figure for the united states based on population of 302 million is 45400 as industrialized economies both share similar structural attributes where over 75 of the civilian workforce is employed in services and less than 3 in agriculture1 at the same time the state still plays larger role in the economy of france than in the united states this is particularly true in the provision of services such as education and health care but also in energy telecommunications and transport where stateowned companies play prominent role policies geared to supporting national champions in leading sectors to influencing mergers involving french companies to screening foreign investments in strategic sectors to sustaining network of personal relationships linking the heads of large companies with senior civil servants and to rejecting americanstyle laissezfaire capitalism all distinguish france from the united states yet prompted by mandates of the european unions single market the need to reduce budget deficits by raising revenues through privatization efforts as well as the need to deregulate the economy the french governments interventionist capabilities have been weakened in recent years while president sarkozy has supported mergers to create national champions in nuclear power energy and defense he also has promoted marketoriented domestic reforms to put frances overregulated economy back on path of stronger growth2 trade ties differences in the role the state plays in the economy however have not precluded growing number and type of international economic transactions from making the two economies increasingly interdependent in the case of merchandise trade

concentrated in similar industries and sectors socalled intraindustry trade in 2006 38 billion or 62 of bilateral trade occurred in major industries such as aerospace pharmaceuticals medical and scientific equipment electrical machinery and plastics where both countries export and import similar products see tables c and d in the appendix many of these products are components or capital goods used in the production of finished goods in both the united states and france furthermore due to large amounts of foreign direct investment across both sides of the atlantic much of this intraindustry trade takes place as trade between parent companies and their affiliates socalled intrafirm trade this kind of trade where large multinational companies such as michelin and general electric trade between their affiliates has accounted for around 50 of total trade turnover in recent years3 the overwhelming role that both intraindustry and intrafirm trade play in merchandise trade tends to limit targets of any potential trade retaliation this is because restrictions placed on most of these traded items would adversely affect domestic production as well as employment of the country imposing the restriction the united states and france also have large and growing trade in services such as tourism education finance insurance and other professional services as shown in table 2 the us exported 138 billion in services to france in 2006 and imported 148 billion in services these amounts make france the sixth largest market for us exports of services and the seventh largest provider

foreign direct investment and the activities of foreign affiliates can be viewed as the backbone of the commercial relationship compared to trade flows the scale of commercial activities of usowned companies operating in france and frenchowned companies operating in the united states outweighs trade flows by factor of almost five this key dynamic of the commercial relationship is illustrated in table 4 in 2005 french companies sold 2423 billion of goods and services to us consumers while us companies sold 2288 billion of goods and services to french consumers of this combined 4708 billion in sales only 818 billion or 17 was accounted for by international trade exports of goods and services from french companies to the us and from us companies to france the vast majority 83 was due to sales by us foreign affiliates producing and selling in france and french foreign affiliates producing and selling in the united states the combined usfrench annual 4708 billion sales figure

trade and 22000 in scientific and technical services french companies are also active in doing research and development rd in the united states tensions and disagreements france as member of the european union adopts the same trade policy as other members of the eu9 by sharing common tariff and nontariff policies with other eu members and by adopting euwide regulations and standards there are few trade disputes that can be considered usfrench bilateral disagreements per most us trade and investment with france dominated by multinational companies and intrafirm trade is noncontroversial nevertheless three prominent issues agriculture government intervention in corporate activity and the war in iraq have contributed to increased bilateral tensions in recent years agriculture agricultural trade disputes historically have been the major sticking point in usfrance commercial relations although the agricultural sector accounts for declining percentage of output and employment in both countries it has produced disproportionate amount of trade tensions between the two sides as trade as well as agriculture is under the jurisdiction of the european commission the problems of course are not technically bilateral in nature from the us perspective the restrictive trade regime set up by the common agricultural policy cap has been the main problem it has been longstanding us contention that the cap is the largest single distortion of global agricultural trade american farmers and policymakers have complained over the years that us 7 based on us data collected by the bureau of economic analysis department of commerce french data indicate that frenchowned companies operating in the united states employ 550000 persons or 100000 more than the us data indicate 8 embassy of france economic relations between france and the united states january 2004 available at httpwwwonfofranceusaorg 9 for discussion of useu commercial ties see crs report rl30608 euus economic ties framework scope and magnitude by william cooper crs6 sales and profits are adversely affected by 1 eu restrictions on market access that have protected the european market for european farmers by 2 eu export subsidies that have deflated us sales to third markets and by 3 eu domestic income support programs that have kept noncompetitive european farmers in business from an eu and french perspective the cap has been substantially reformed in recent years and cannot be characterized as the largest source of distortions in agricultural trade on the contrary under this view there is ample evidence that eu as well as australian new zealand and canadian farm exports have been hampered by us food aid policies in some developing countries frances agricultural sector which in terms of output and land is the largest in europe has long been the biggest beneficiary of the cap over the past several years french farmers have received about 20 to 25 of cap outlays that have averaged around 40 billion acting to continue benefits and subsidies for its farmers the french position which is shared by many other eu members can determine the limits and parameters of the european commissions negotiating flexibility on range of agricultural issues that are of keen interest to the united states the most prominent and perhaps important example relates to current efforts to get the wto doha round of multilateral trade negotiations back on track by reducing agricultural subsidies and other barriers to market access other examples where the french position backed by many other eu members arguably has made settlement of disputes more difficult include expanded trademark protection for wines cheeses and other food products linked to specific regions and ban on the importation of beef treated with hormones10 government intervention in corporate activity despite significant reform and privatization over the past 15 years the french government continues to play larger role in influencing corporate activity than does the us government this difference is manifested not only in the french governments continuing direct control of key companies and its support of national champions but also in its continuing proclivity to influence mergers involving french firms president sarkozy in number of ways has continued to support this policy tradition nevertheless although bilateral disputes may be more prone to occur because of the french governments interventionist and regulatory tendencies the dictates of eu laws as well as the urgent need to raise the revenues through privatization efforts and to enact marketoriented reforms are weakening the french dirigiste tradition in 1997 the then socialist government restarted process of privatization and opening of governmentcontrolled firms to private investment that had begun in the 1980s and the program was continued by the centerright government that took power in 2002 in 2003 and 2004 the government reduced its stakes in large 10 trademark protection for geographic indications is also an issue of great importance for italy parma ham and parmesan cheese greece feta cheese hungary tokay wine and portugal porto wine denmark italy and germany are other eu countries taking the lead on limits on research and use of gm crops and most all eu members strongly support the ban on the importation of beef

still has stakes in bull and safran and in 1280 other firms while the trend has been to privatize many large companies fully or partially the government still maintains strong presence in sectors such as power public transport and defense11 despite its ongoing privatization program the french government continues to promote national champions and economic patriotism concept that has been used to justify opposition to foreign takeovers of french firms this tendency has been apparent in an effort by the government to strengthen french takeover law and parallel effort to scrutinize sensitive foreign investments more closely in the summer of 2005 the government orchestrated quick merger of two utilities publicly traded suez sa french utility and statecontrolled gaz france gdf to fend off potential takeover by enel of italy president sarkozy is now exploring ways to create national champions in other industries such as nuclear power and defense such mergers would involve areva the stateowned nuclear group and other french companies plus the huge defenseaerospace companies thales and safran12 at the same time that sarkozy is supporting interventionist policies designed to enhance frances economic and industrial strength he is also promoting market oriented domestic reforms on issues such as taxation and labor markets in this context president sarkozy views increased competition as way to get frances overregulated economy on track for stronger growth13 iraq war in the era of the cold war there was considerable concern that trade disputes between allies could undermine political and security ties deep differences over the iraq war between the united states and many of its allies particularly france and germany reversed this cold war concern into whether foreign policy disputes can weaken or undermine strong commercial ties specific concerns that divisions over iraq could spill over into the trade arena arose in early 2003 with reports of us consumer boycotts of french goods and calls from some us lawmakers for trade retaliation against france and germany the spike in bilateral tensions and hard feelings however appears not to have had much impact on sales of the products such as wines perfumes handbags and cheeses most prone to being boycotted14 as shown in table 5 us imports of all four of these french products increased in absolute terms from 2003 to 2007 moreover the french share of us total imports of these products has increased for cheese and 11 us department of commerce country commercial guidefrance 2006 12 financial times

not exhaustive list of products that are likely to be targets of boycotts because they have strong element of brand identification with france and tend to be luxury items crs8 curd stayed the same for perfumes and travel goods and declined only for wines but the decline in market share for wines from 35 in 2003 to 316 in 2007 started well before the iraq war15 it also should be pointed out that because the euro grew substantially weaker during this 20032007 time frame us demand for these products had to remain strong although there are few signs that goods and services clearly identified with france or the united states are being boycotted some polls have found evidence of public support among some segments of the us population for expressing opposition to foreign policy disagreements in the shopping malls nevertheless substantial economic backlash appears unlikely because of the high degree of economic integration effective boycotts would jeopardize thousands of jobs on both sides
