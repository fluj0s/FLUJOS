allegations and issues for congress raphael perl specialist in international affairs foreign affairs and national defense division summary at least 34 documented incidents many involving arrest or detention of north korean diplomats link north korea to drug trafficking such events in the context of ongoing credible but unproven allegations of large scale state sponsorship of drug production and trafficking raise important issues for the congress the administration and americas allies in combating international drug trafficking the challenge to policy makers is how to pursue an effective counter drug policy and comply with us law which may require cutting off aid to north korea while pursuing other high priority us foreign policy objectives including 1 limiting possession and production of weapons of mass destruction 2 limiting ballistic missile production and export 3 curbing terrorism counterfeiting and international crime and 4 addressing humanitarian needs us aid to north korea is currently limited to providing food and other humanitarian assistance together with heavy fuel oil shipments under 1994 usnorth korea agreement reports that north korea may be limiting some of its food crop production in favor of drug crop production are particularly disturbing though the acreage in question is comparatively small another issue of rising concern is the degree to which profits from any north korean drug trafficking counterfeiting and other crime forprofit enterprises may be used to directly underwrite or free funds from elsewhere to underwrite the costs of maintaining or expanding north korean nuclear programs this report will be updated if warranted by new developments background allegations of north korean drug production trafficking and crime for profit activity have become the focus of rising congressional attention on october 28 1997 senators grassley and helms sent letter to secretary of state albright questioning why north korea was not included in the departments annual international narcotics control strategy report incsr they noted that press reports indicated north koreas 1995 opium production level was 40 metric tons roughly comparable to mexicosan amount clearly over the 1000 hectare threshold for designation as major congressional research service the library of congress crs2 illicit drug producing country1 more recently on march 5 1999 representatives gilman armey hyde cox and knollenberg sent letter to special north korea policy coordinator william j perry which stressed that his policy report to the president should address among other key policy points the issue of north korean narcotics production and trafficking the provisions of the foreign assistance act of 1961 referred to above require that countries cultivating 1000 hectares or more of illicit opium poppy be subject to annual march first drug reporting and certification procedures and that certain aid be withheld and discretionary trade sanctions be imposed unless the president determines that 1 the country has cooperated fully with the united states or taken adequate steps on its own to curb drug trafficking and production or 2 vital national interests require provision of assistance2 also prohibited is assistance to any individual or entity emphasis provided that the president knows or has reason to believehas been knowing assistor abettor conspirator or colluder in the illicit trafficking in any such controlled substance notably the act permits exceptions to restrictions on furnishing assistance when the president determines that providing assistance is important to the security interests of the united states international disaster assistance such as the food aid received by north korea is specifically exempted from all limitations on providing assistance under the act3 us foreign aid to north korea is severely restricted because of north koreas designation by the us secretary of state as country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism4 assistance is currently limited to humanitarian assistance food and petroleum assistance ie heavy fuel oil for electrical generating capabilities as an alternative to nuclear generation of electrical power negotiated in response to serious concerns that north korea was developing nuclear weapons capability in fiscal year 1998 north korea received 1834 million in food assistance and an additional 215 million thus far for fy1999 us petroleum assistance to north korea had dollar value of 58 million in 1998 and is set at 315 million for the year 19995 1 nb north korean climate and soil are relatively inhospitable to poppy cultivation and fertilizer is in short supply best guess us government estimates are that such conditions would yield roughly the equivalent of 10 kilogram of opium gum per hectare with 40mt of raw opium indicative of 3000 to 4000 hectares of poppy cultivation 2 pl 87195 as

sources north koreas legal exports are expected to decline by 425 in 1998 to 520 million from 904 million in 1997 while imports will decrease 23 from 127 billion to 980 million6 exacerbating the nations already dire need for hard currency among other things hard currency is required to meet the maintenance costs of north koreas nuclear program which according to an informal interagency consolidated estimate approximates 200 million per year at current levels7 allegations of drug trafficking the department of states march 1 1998 incsr8 includes information on north korea in its money laundering section which reads in part as follows the most profitable lines of state supported illegal businesses remain drug trafficking gold smuggling illegal sale and distribution of endangered species trafficking of counterfeit us currency and rare earth metals north korean officials appear to be increasing their involvement in financial crimes as means to generate operational funds and support their countrys anemic economy the 1999 incsr reads in part as the reports on dprk drug activity multiply and the incidents cumulate it seems more likely than not that the state itself is involved in criminal activity for example alleged large scale opium cultivation could likely not be undertaken without the explicit knowledge of the north korean government the same could be said of large scale imports of ephedrine known precursor chemical for methamphetamine concerns over north korean drug production and trafficking are also expressed in the 1997 report of the international narcotics control board incb the report in circumspect language common to such documents notes that the board has received disquieting reports on the drug control situation in the democratic peoples republic of korea therefore the board expresses its concern that the government of the democratic peoples republic of korea has not yet accepted its proposal originally made in 1995 to send mission to that country to study and clarify drug control issues9 us drug enforcement administration dea data and plethora of domestic and foreign press reports portray an ongoing pattern of drug trafficking trafficking of counterfeit us currency10 and other smugglingfor profit activities by north korean diplomats over the past 24 years since 1976 north korea has been linked to over 34 verifiable incidents involving drug seizures in at least 14 countries significant number of these cases has involved arrest or detention of north korean diplomats or officials all but four of these incidents have transpired in the 1990s with 10 incidents occuring from 6 seoul yonhap semiofficial news agency of the rok nov 20 1998 citing the korea trade investment promotion agency the 1998 cia world factbook lists the value of the dprks exports in 1996 as 912 million 7 data provided crs january 1998 this figure is relatively low because of minimal labor costs and the assumption of north koreas adherence to the agreed framework to freeze its nuclear program 8 id page 623 9 incb report for 1997 p 17 10 eg the 1998 incsr p 623 cites february 1997 izvestia article on the arrest of third secretary of the north korean embassy who was apprehended attempting to exchange counterfeit us dollars russian officials tied him to smuggling operation designed to sell more than 100000 in counterfeit us bills which they believe was his main function at the embassy crs4 january 1998 to september 1999 in 1999 substantial seizures of north korean methamphetamine occurred in japan south korea and taiwan 11 press reports citing north korean defectors and south korean intelligence sources as well as us government investigative agency source material paint grim picture of an anemic economy in north korea held back by disproportionate military spending dysfunctional economic policies and the consequences of broad economic and trade embargo led by the united states since the korean war pressed for cash and perceiving its vital national security at stake the regime reportedly created an office to bring in foreign currency bureau 39 under the ruling korean workers party which is headed by north korean leader kim jong il 12 this office is reported to be in charge of drug trafficking and according to some reports all crimeforprofit activity including 1 opium production and trafficking 2 methamphetamine production and trafficking 3 counterfeiting and 4 smuggling drugs are reportedly exported through china and russia to asia and europe via government trading companies diplomatic pouches and commercial cargo money earned is reportedly used to 1 buy loyalty from party elites and military leaders to leader kim jong il 2 fund costs of overseas diplomatic missions and 3 finance national security activity especially technology and electronic purchases for the intelligence and military services13 farmers in certain areas reportedly are ordered to grow opium poppy with cultivation estimates of 4000 hectares for the early 1990s and 7000 hectares for 1995 current production however is believed to be below 1995 figures because of heavy rains and the broad decline of agricultural output as consequence of poor policies and insufficient fertilizer and insecticides looking at all available estimates cultivation estimate of 30004000 hectares for 1998 would appear reasonable but nevertheless based on indirect and fragmented information us government investigative agency sources 11 eg may 1976 400 kg hashish seized from north korean dprk diplomat in egypt july 1994 chinese officials arrested chinese national on charges of smuggling 6 kg of north korean produced heroin through the dprk embassy in china august 1994 dprk intelligence agent arrested by russian

north korean government pharmaceutical labs reportedly have the capacity to process 100 tons of raw opium per year14 methamphetamine production in north korea is reported to have started in 1996 after heavy rains decreased income from poppy production this coincides with time when markets for methamphetamine are dramatically expanding in asia especially in thailand japan and the philippines15 north koreas maximum methamphetamine production capacity is estimated to be 1015 tons of the highest quality product for export according to the incb north korean legitimate pharmaceutical needs for ephedrine traditional precursor for methamphetamine are 25 tons per year one ton higher than us investigative agency source estimates incb officials confirm receipt of allegations of north korean involvement in diversion of 20 tons of ephedrine16 moreover the dprk may be bypassing the highly regulated market for ephedrine in favor of an alternate technology for benzine based product raising speculation that us and allied petroleum assistance to north korea may be used to sustain illicit drug production conservative estimates suggest north korean criminal activity carefully targeted to meet specific needs generated about 85 million in 1997 71 million from drugs and15 million from counterfeiting17 looking at all available estimates 100 million figure although admittedly low falls in the general range where estimates overlap however there are strong indications that the figures are considerably higher 500 million to 1 billion annually from criminal activities18 if credence is to be given to department of state reporting and dea shared information as well as press reports citing north korean defectors and south korean intelligence sources pattern of activity emerges which indicates that 1 in the 1970s north korean officials bought and sold foreign source illicit drugs 2 in the mid1970s north korea began cultivating opium poppy as matter of state policy 3 in the mid 14

speculative us law enforcement agency source estimate for world market price of heroin produced by the dprk in 1995 is 600 million for the 15 million figure on counterfeiting see korea herald november 16 1998 18 eg see us news world report 8999 p 31 citing estimates of us officials crs6 1980s north korea began refining opium poppy for export and exporting refined opium products 4 and in the mid1990s after heavy rains reduced opium production in 1995 and 1996 north korea began manufacturing and exporting methamphetamine to expanding markets in southeast asia if this pattern reflects reality an important question is the degree to which the government of north korea may respond to increased financial pressures and expanding methamphetamine markets by dramatically increasing currently reported levels of drug trafficking activity recent seizures of dprk source methamphetamine in japan taiwan and south korea may well reflect such disturbing trend some analysts however question the reliability of information reported in the press attributed to north korean defectors and south korean government sources in the context of what is seen as cold war propaganda battle between the two koreas they note that in closed state such as north korea hard data is difficult to obtain thus what is obtained is fragmentary and indirect at best north korea continues to dismiss media reports and speculation on government involvement in drug trafficking activities as slander based on politically motivated adversary propaganda sources such as south korean intelligence services north korean officials stress privately that corruption drug use trafficking and criminal activity in general are maladies to which individuals in all societies may fall prey and that any involvement by north korean individuals in such activity is in way stateconnected or state sanctioned further officials have stressed that in instances where such activity has come to the attention of authorities individuals involved have been duly punished finally dprk officials maintain that drug trafficking and production are matters that should be handled and are best handled by their government as internal matters officials also point to the politically charged milieu of allegations of drug trafficking by north korea and point out that drug smuggling by individuals in the diplomatic community is by means limited to north korea issues for congress at least thirty documented drug trafficking incidents coupled with credible if unproven allegations of large scale north korean state sponsorship of opium poppy cultivation and heroin and methamphetamine production and trafficking raise significant issues for congress the administration and americas allies in combating international drug trafficking the challenge to policy makers is how to pursue sound counter drug policy and comply with us law which may require cutting off aid to north korea while effectively pursuing other high priority us foreign policy objectives including 1 limiting possession and production of weapons of mass destruction 2 limiting ballistic missile production and export 3 curbing terrorism counterfeiting and international crime and 4 addressing humanitarian needs the state departments first incsr report on north korea was released february 26 1999 central to the policy debate is the need for hard data such as satellite imagery to confirm the extent of reported opium poppy cultivation in north korea enhancing law enforcement focus and intelligence cooperation on targeting reporting and tracking north korean opiumheroin and methamphetamine trafficking and production is another option which warrants consideration for other versions of this document see
