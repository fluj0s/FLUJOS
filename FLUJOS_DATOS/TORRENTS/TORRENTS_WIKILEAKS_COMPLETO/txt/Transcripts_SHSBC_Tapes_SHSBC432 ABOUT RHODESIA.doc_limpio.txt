about rhodesia lecture given on 19 july 1966 thank you lets see what this is goodness gracious booby trap break anything oh man look atlook at the desk set nice beautiful lighter female voice take the red thing off the top pull it out there yes this is beautiful cigarette boxlovely and nice ashtray female voice nice great great anything more i guess thats enough i was greedy well thank you thank you very very much i appreciate it most of all i just appreciate being home just period well might as well sit down here its not formal lecture this is what july the lath ad 16 the year of the clears thats for sure im going to tell you today about the adventures of somebody who went out barefooted to take country about february why i was holding the mockup together with sticky plaster and the organization was running it was running just fine everything was going along all right technology was all wrapped up and i knew it was wrapped up but i thought id better put it all on wait so i put several things on wait put own case on wait in case i needed it to find out why they couldnt make it ive done this time and time again for years id get up to certain level then ill stand around and wait for somebody to catch up you know and the sevendivision system was in organizationally and so i decided why i would take short vacation so i went down to palmas and i was down there for about thirty days and while i was down there i kept an eye open to see what was going on organizations seemed to be running all right and then all of sudden you made clear one so i says great but will there be clear two well i said thats good enough ive reason to sit around here in palmas waiting for clear two and reason to sit around here waiting endlessly to find out what on earth can happen in sevendivisional system whether they go up or down ill go on down to south africa and get into some mischief i didnt have very well conceived plan about it but actually what i wanted to do was to find and found and locate an alternate base or ot base i couldnt quite figure out why i couldnt do this ill tell you why i couldnt do this in minute or two so i went down and i stopped off in rhodesia but route to rhodesia it suddenly occurred to that there was type and principle of constitution that would get them off the hook as country and solve some of their problems so i decided i would write this up which i did in some notes and when i got there i got it typed up and i handed it over to the government and the government seemed to be very happy about it it was quite an incidental gesture i said well lets see if we cant do something in this direction all by ourselves and i got to looking around the placesuddenly remembered i had some assets and some stuff in southern africa so i decided i would go into bit of investment id put on another hat see i can always locate money for some peculiar reason and this baffles income tax by the way but thats explained very easily you dont make moneyyou just have it you want to learn that someday just have money just dont bother to make it so anyway iminding my own business more or less and i decided id rent house and then next thing you know why i found out i could buy this house very cheaply so i bought it some guy came tearing up the drive one day and told that i could buy hotel that was entirely surrounded by elephants on lake kariba which was going very cheap indeed it was about an eighty thousand pound hotel and we could buy it for about fiftyfive hundred so i bought that i wrote him check and then later on why i noticed farm it was nice farm so i got the farm and so on but what i was watching hereduring this whole time what i was watchingwas simply the economics and behavior of the wog world now you know ive been kind of gone from the wog world for long time ive been spoiled ive had you for friends and its different and i in actual fact was getting kick out of being out there cheek by jowl with just the wog world and i found out i had lots of friendscould make lots of friends and the guys that i made friends with were pretty tough characters in their own right i normally find it very easy to make friends with very tough characters now i dont mean by that low grade social characters i mean just savagetype characters that havent reformed you know unreformedtype people and theres lot of those in rhodesia and i was getting along just fine its wonderful area lot of sociality they have whats called sundowners and about well from anytime from fivethirty on why people start dropping in or you start dropping in and they have some drinks and that sort of thing and then they go home and its typicaltypical nineteenth century english you know victorian in the extreme because you dont have dinner without putting at least dark suit on you see theyve come off the tuxedo you know the englishman used to you know out in the bush you see in the old days why hed take off his sun helmet and his bush jacket and his shorts and he would get into tuxedoall by himself you see way out in its true and sit down at fancily spread dinner elegantly served dont you see and he didnt want to lose contact with civilization so he would make it so anyhow thats still hanging on in rhodesia very interesting country its totally sophisticated civilization sitting as small jewel in the midst of howling wilderness you go any direction very far and you start running into elephants buffalo lion and the lot you see but those sports cars and chromiumplated girls and so on abound inside the tiny perimeters of the areas that are civilized very sophisticated far more modern than london it provides some fantastic contrasts so anyway this civilization of course is an interesting civilization to look at but its more practical than that because its got an areai dont know how many times the size of what countrythat really isnt growing anything the thing is full of minerals and theres fivemile mountain of chrome ore down there that they havent even begun to dig up and theres gold and theres everything else you can think of there but mainly there is enough land and enough range and so on to feed probably europe and most of it untouched by the plow beautiful climate and so on here is brandnew country that hasnt been run downhill yet and could afford great deal of development well i went ahead and went to work on this kept in touch with the government i met all the ministers and talked to them and had sundowners with them and met the prime minister and all that and had tea with his wife and you know that kind of thing and i was very acceptable bloke i assure you very acceptable i didnt say one single word about scientology and every time anybody would ask about scientology why i would just brush it off and not say anything about it dont you see id define the word for them or something like that and then go on talking about cows or gold mines or something or other well i probably was giving them whole dose of noauditing in actual fact but i was purposely and with malice aforethought examining the wog world and i didnt want to unwog anybody so television found and i went on television radio found and i started going on the radio you know i see some situation or problem or something like that to be solved i go ahead and solve it you know but by george you know i didnt have any authority i didnt have any authority i couldnt put out sec ed and by actual sober calculation joking about it i could have had them off the launching pad in about three weeks i could have gotten rid of their sanctions got rid of their poverty and gotten them moneyjust bangbangbang it was too easy dont you see well althoughalthough i didnt gialthough i wasnt giving them any auditing i was awful near clean and the unreality of the fact that one could actually resolve this situation that has staggered the greatest minds on the planet dont you seei say that advisedlymindsleft some rather baffled but what was very interesting was that each rhodesian knowing what i was advising them to do would himself agree with it flat out and lets do it tomorrow but he would caution that the ideas were too far advanced for any other rhodesian to accept and this was 100 percent sweep so that included all the rhodesians well time ground on and i got in transport into lake kariba its the first time anybody had ever gone down to the southern shore of lake kariba with any kind of transport and i got fourwheeldrive land rovers two tonners and started throwing them in there to supply the hotel and they ran alongcalled the boomy express and it ran along through the lions and through the buffalo and the elephants and so forth boomy has anboomy hotel has an airstrip its mostly an air hotel and they actually have to buzz the hotel every now and then to get the elephants off the runway and it sits right there on lake kariba which is huge lake very beautiful setting but you can sit on the porch of the thing and drink tom collins you know and watch the elephants and buffalo and so forth walking around very close by sometimes too close by because theyre all very wild animals theyre not even gamepark tame you know and baboons coming up thumbing their noses at you and tearing the thatch off the roofs you know and raising the devil but i got the boomy express going and it left every wednesday and came back every thursday and fellow by the name of samson drove it and he was an old kariba truck driver samson hes black fellow and he didnt quite fit into the scene as domestic chauffeur he did not have the tact or polish that my proper numberone driver frank had but as soon as i turned him loose with the boomy express why he was in his element i gave him car boy to help him out and man he would take that boomy express out of salisbury and burn the road and then hed turn off at karoi and go thundering through the swamps and jungles and dongas and so on and wind up at boomy and turn it around and come back again first time theyd ever had any transport in there we couldnt put our hotel transport on it anymore we were filled up with freight and industry started blossoming after all there are thirty thousand batongasnativesright there in the vicinity of the hotel and they fish in the lake and theres way to get their cargoes out or anything and economy started to spark and elsewhere it started to spark i did some various other things i got furniture factory started andand odds and ends and the statistic of rhodesia started to rise business started picking up now it was sort of on the basis theyd look at on tv and they would say well he thinks the countrys all right so there must be something right about it you know and then get busy instead of sitting and moping you get the idea i mean that was all it took it wasnt any encouragement or the ideas themselves but just the fact that somebody would come in and be interested and so on where they thought everybody would be running and disinterested made bit of difference well the adventures were many and time ground on and i began to wonder how on earth am i going to get back to saint hill because to walk off at this stage of the game would have been very discreditable in the eyes of the rhodesian why they couldnt have explained how i could possibly have walked off you see so how to walk off that was the main problem because of course i didnt intend this as total profession i would have kept it going very nicely but how to bow gracefully out of this picture i was woven too tightly into it you see and i wasnt woven into it just with the white rhodesian all kinds of weird things had been going on i had staffactually i employed about thirtyeight africanscoloreds and europeans and my own staffi had staff of about nine and they were the pick of all the consular staffs you see the various nations helped rhodesia by kicking the african in the teeth and when their consuls and missions left after the declaration of independence of course they just callously sacked all their staffs you know and pulled out and they just left the town mobbed with the highest order of domestic african and i sorted them out one after the other and picked out the best ones and wound up with staff as i say of about nine but the rhodesian was always very helpful he was always telling how to handle the african and it was quite quite remarkablequite remarkable the advice was very sound very soundat least it made sounds but i began to realize they didnt know anything about africans truth they didnt because they didnt know this about africans simply that africans are people do you follow they respond to scientology formulas just like any other people and people dont have peculiarities but if you dont know scientology then people could look awfully peculiar to you they say these boys go sullen on you and you have to be very careful and you have to watch them very carefully because theyll go sullen theyll go outside and stand around and be very very sullen and you have to watch for this sign and symptom oh the rhodesianwhite rhodesianwas very helpful with this see i found out why they went sullen after theyd been told to do something they couldnt do and then crossconfused the 8c was all mixed up and then they were bawled out they went sullen now of course there are two errors being made with regard to the african one is to take bird who does not have any backgroundeducational or experiential background immediatelythat has anything to do with politics economics statesmanship and all that sort of thing theyve gotten out of this line you see if they were ever in it and we cant instantly take one of these boys and say all right you are now an expert economist run the country because hes immediately overwhelmed and baffled because he isnt able to do it any more than an english laborer out here you walk up to him and say youre prime minister now very often hell take it and start shooting other laborers or something but i see parents scientologicallyevery now and then i see scientological families where the baby has just learned to crawl and the parents are sort of nagging at it because it isnt walking you see and they fail to acknowledge what the baby can do and youll find very unhappy baby after while little kids you know you know why arent you clear its the same type of invalidation you know the birds trying hes coming up the line and you try to push him too fast overrun it in other words get it up there overexpect do you see and you start overexpecting and the fellow has not been trained as an electricianwell lets not knock his block off because he now cannot fix electrical contacts and is just stupid you see but on the one side why part of the world is saying these men are totally educated completely grooved in and should therefore be able to take over all the concerns that any other society has and on the southern african side why they say these fellows are too stupid to live and cant learn anything you see somewhere in between here theres some truth about the situation but its just truth about this well recognizing that fact my boys were very very happy boys i denationalized and renationalized them which is one of the reasons their morale was good i told them they werent rhodesians anymore they were americans and this was highly acceptable to them well when they first started to work they were bit lean they were bit thin and when i left they were very fat they were very fat and of course their uniforms were spotless and they had lots of them you see and they really looked very snap and polish any guest coming in the area was practically overwhelmed by car boys and things opening doors you know and shoving drinks in their hand and all that sort of thing but they served with great enthusiasm those people sure can work the african sure can work thats one thing nobody has ever quite noticed about them they are very hardworking people and after while these africans drifting around their own townships going out for an afternoon off and having boys in on their own you see you know the african hashes very interesting character but he has flaws just like whites do you know and he has good points you know and i used to tell jambo the numberone boy id say well youre very good this almost killed him because always before hed just been scolded and nagged at about this id say youre very good boy in spite of the fact that you smoke dagga drink and gamble and of course he never expected anybody to really know that he smoked dagga drank and gambled but he ran practically gambling establishment out in the boys huts every night and boys were in there from far and wide terrific communication line and these boys kept telling other boys that there was mr hubbard here who was an american who was building everything up and he actually believed in everybody getting break and that the country was now going to amount to something you know and you know how they could blow this sort of thing up they really can blow one up i gave the chef one day noteone night when it was very lateso that if the police stopped him why they wouldnt chop his head off and the note simply said that if he was stopped and if there was anything wrong to call at once and i gave my phone number he showed this all over the town only his interpretation of it wasis you see master tell da police what to do so i eventually in this short period of about four months achieved the rather fantastic position of being very acceptable to the various races and this was very peculiar this was pandeterminism of course one is looking at and more importantly the moderate white and the extreme right white could also agree on what i was saying one night i was listening to replay of radio program and there was one of these extreme extreme extreme white supremacy boys sitting in the room and there was one of the very very very moderate individuals you knoweverybody should have vote tomorrow without any limits of any kind and after that program why the extreme moderate said almost in chorus with the extreme right man now if we could convince the other people to follow that wed all be home and dry fantastic breadth of agreement see so this was all very pleasant and so on i do not say at this time that certain elements in the area were not becoming slightly greeneyed now about the fourth or fifth time somebody says to you that you ought to be pm you know very well theyve said it to the pm they said you know why dont you take this fellow hubbards advice on this sort of thing or more maliciously maybe hes pitching for your job after all its very tiny community there are only 270 thousand whites in the whole country you know i dont know any day of the week weve got more scientologists than that you see so this is actually down statistic on people number but look at this look at this tiny community only thirty thousand taxpayers in the country pay all the taxes and with modern communication this all became very simple and very easy well of course i didnt have anything in mind but trying to build it up break the deadlock little bit and having bought property and so forth why then be able to operate it because itd be money for well that was the entirety of the game and all the time i had eye open on what was going on and what this was all about in the wog world and i found out an awful lot naturally because this was in actual fact im not trying to give you an exaggerated idea of my importance in rhodesia although the rhodesian herald just put call through just little while ago to find out when i was coming back to rhodesia and so forth very very pleasant queries you know they think im great now because the smith regime doesnt and it worked out like this peter younghusband reporter of the london daily mail and part of this conspiracy thats going on on the newspaper proprietor associates or whatever they call themselves or the mafia or whatever it isthis outfit considered all this sufficiently important to send one of their reporters peter younghusband down to get next to their minister of information to tell their minister of information what terribly bad fellow i was he instantly without checking his facts of any kind whatsoever turned around and gave smith story about what terribly bad fellow i was who turned around and gave the cabinet the same story and the next morning when the rhodesian front committee heard about this and charged down flatfootedlyyou know bangwhat the devil is this when they heard that hubbard was not going to have his visa extended unfortunately for smith he was talking to group who knew that every word he was saying was he smith in march was known to be too fair and too honestdirect quote hed been built up as god his popularity had begun to decline because he hadnt lead them to the wonderland you see hed led them deeper in the swamp but more importantly he had begun to read speeches by this fellow howman and instead of doing an adlip on tv why he began to read speeches on tv and then he stopped even appearing on tv when he stood there and told this group that this action was being taken against hubbard because his business associates were complaining about him he overlooked the fact that i only had three business associates and he was talking to one of them there in the committee and all of them were trying to knock the governments doors down with rocks because they considered this action completely irrational that was lie one then he told them that id been deported from australia glance at my passportsand i had my cancelled passports with medemonstrated such action and modern visa of any kind whatsoever for australia stamp of entry and then he said that i was wanted all over the place and had record and these people knew that my credit was in the stars all over the world people whose credit is in the stars dont have records and they sat there in shocked horror and looked at those clay feet that god sure had clay feet he was not fair at all he hadnt inquired into his evidence and they knew that either he or somebody else was being very dishonest and they walked out and now sweepingly through the rhodesian front theyre talking about the replacement of smith he shouldnt have done it now howman was exposed as they very often suspected of being sympathetic toward the left wing and it suddenly occurred to them that howman in many instances had dismissed anybody who had fought communist in that government these were such people as ivor benson fellow named hasker nigel bruce hankey these were people that had been in his ministry and had been quite able in deterring communism from getting into the government and he had sacked every one of them now that he had pulled longbow like this and had listened to newspaper reporter from londonan english newspaper reporter could bring influence on the rhodesian government i wouldnt give much for his life hes liable to run into bullet do you see the situation then is pretty well unsettled and an american whos been there for about thirteen years said well its all right for you to leave now because when you walk back in here youll walk back in as hero it couldnt have been arrangedcouldnt have been stage managed better and so i could come back to saint hill now after an adventure of that particular kind it makes one wonder why one doesnt try funding operation or financing and so forth of the british government or you take it on that low why you should be able to take it on that high but it looks like slightly steep gradient to for instance the bank of england had to put out twentyfive million pounds just yesterday to stabilize the pound and so forth and i probably couldnt dig up thatit would just stabilize the pound for two hours and i dont think thats long enough ive been looking this over and i dont think that our logical next step is to assist the british government financially or otherwise but i now know what i was trying to locate and call ot base that was the first thing that my problem was where and what is ot base where and what is this thing after id been going for while i found out much to my amazement that you cannot locate base you do not know the purpose of you dont know the purpose of the thing naval base you see that would be on the sea an air base you know that would be on some airfield in flat country and an army base that might be most anyplace but they all have different purposes hospital base would be where you could get in and out ambulances and so on but in order to locate base you have to know what its supposed to do and i know that sounds terribly elementary and often very stupid but the great mistakes are made in life by not getting answers to stupid questions so i now know what ot base has got to do and the first thing its got to do is put in ethics on planetary level because if we put in ethics we can then get in technology and your worries right now as you associate with the public in general and try to tell them about scientology are totally centered on just one thing ethics is out theres sps walking all over the place and just one sp just one all by his little lonesome is blocking the entire rhodesian situation is knocking the british empire crosswise is costing fantastic quantities in trade and is showing up the vulnerability of england and his name is jackie howman minister of information tourism and immigration of rhodesia real gardenvariety nut every time they try to make settlement theres howman and hes got smith 100 percent under his thumb smiths his hes rather weak man to begin with but hes very his well now the major threat to scientology is that an atomic war or political takeover may occur before we get sufficiently well advanced that the organizations themselves are able to continue clearing human beings see that stands as an actual threat in the road i had this in mind i had other purposes in this one of the purposes in mind is i wanted to see if southern africa couldnt serve as security point and another avenue the overseas us british organizationsthey might go right on and take the planet but if political barriers or war prevented these organizations from going ahead with their mission properly then we at least had base you see in southern africa well i was looking at that base and trying to make it secure and so on as just second avenue now the third avenue of course was ot base the way i had it figured out originally but now i found out what ot base would have to do ot base would have to put in ethics on the planet because if you dont put in ethics youre not going to get any tech but theres one other thing that has to be put in less important than ethics but nevertheless very important and thats economics man is running around with bone in his nose on the subject of economics i hate to be snide but as the rhodesian looks at the stupidity of the african i look at the stupidity of man only i can do something about it and am trying the laws of economics are plain plain plain they are very elementary its very elementary subject and man just violates them all the time for some political advantage he starves people and he does this and he does that and slows up production and so on all kinds of reasons why and he develops various kinds of economicsall ideological you know theres communist economics and theres democratic economics and theres socialist economics and so forth heres all these economics economics economics actually there is only one subject called economics but its become so obscured so complex and so kicked in the head by these ideological economics that people have forgotten there is such thing as real economics well we have to be into economics because people wouldnt have enough to eat to sit still and wouldnt be able to pay for or finance themselves for processing except on total subsidy and i can assure you right now you cant do it on total subsidy there is contribution and the moment there is contribution you wont find those cases moving so there has to be some economic support on the planet in order to keep the economies moving so that organizations can flourish and expand because the economic systems being employed are usable if modified so therefore ot base would also have this in view ethics and to small tiny degree economics and then that would permit organizations to move forward and get in tech now of course you still have ethics inside tech but you take great big bite of ethicslike how are you going to solve problems between the united states and russia oh i think that takes just little bit more than our ordinary ethics officer cares to bite off its an ethics problem but sometimes ethics requires economics assistance in order to get the problem solved if you have tremendous number of people who are starving to death to try to get in ethics on themyoure not going to get very far theyre too distracted they would rather shoot people and you can at least have ethics in to the point of telling them who to shoot but out of all this we have the purpose of ot base and the one thing that is out first and foremost in the society is ethics that brother that is out every time youve tried to disseminate scientology you have run into ethics and when you didnt solve ethics you fell back for loss right now there is situation right here in england which were solving by investigation but which is an ethics problem there are two or three blokes one or more of whom is an sp who have suddenly decided to spend fortune trying to cave in scientology now were going to have to do something about those fellows and we better move fast because its all too slow i mean its all too slow the way weve been going about it weve got to make up for some lost time here but these fellows do things like get your headquarters robbed of private research papers buy them off the thief publish them out of context and thus confuse the theory and research papers of scientology with the actual practice of scientology and i point out to you that these are two entirely different things because i have just reserved the right all the way along the line to write down whatever i found but i did not put it out for unlimited circulation you see so theyre challenging fellows right to make notes of what hes seen but those research papers and books today actually do not much reflect the practice of scientology which if you look at it up the grades has very very reasonable and very comprehensible goals do you see so what theyre trying to do is bring about an identification of research papers out of context with an actual very sober very practical practicedo you see thisand therefore knock you around with it well unless we can get ethics in at this level we ought to quit trying man but we just better get these ethics in in hurry nearly every human being on this planet that is in trouble is in trouble because ethics are out their lives are lives of miseryjust because of that when you see three five ten million troops being killed in war theyre being killed in war just because there was an sp in some government nobody took out and i think thats too many men to kill off just because theres one sp it would only take one bullet one beam you know i dont say we would go into it on that level i dont wish to frighten you i had poor johni had himi had him he wasnt worried he wasnt flustered or anything like that but he was just little bit protesty slightly and so on i was teasing him i was saying i reserve the right to be able to tip over the white house and nobody was to tip over the white house but i was snarling about something that had happened in america he naturally took seriously and it disturbed him it disturbed him i had to point out to him however i was not yet clear and therefore i had right to want to tip over the white house but what i didnt tell him is after the amount of trouble i was caused in 63 and so forth i earned the right to tip over the white house well that probably wouldnt get in ethics unless you knew what sp was in the white house at the time you tipped it oven but anyway but all joking aside these situations resolve rather readily we have the technology we know exactly why this is out and that is out we could actually go and sort out what are the key sps in the situation on any international basis we could sort them out i dont say wed do anything to them we might just be reasonable about it or so forth because now thats into technology at ot level which by the way at this moment is relatively unexplored but thats ot base now if youre going to appeal to the wog world you certainly better know the wog world so i learned all kinds of weird things i learned for instance how to sell scientology against an outethics situation which is an interesting trick you want to try it sometime you say to some personwho is friendly to you but who is little bit upset because of the bad things he has heard about scientology you seeyou say to this person you say well youve heard objections to scientology and you reach into your pocket and you whip out problems of work and you hand him the problems of work and you say here read that and find out what there is in it to be objected to go ahead see if theres anything objectionable in that book one lady i did this with forgot to feed her family at eight or nine oclock she should have served supper at six she was still reading so anyway all kinds of data all kinds of data accumulated but it was never more visible to than that man neednt be in trouble at all he neednt be in trouble i dont care how many crossconflicts he has in his religions or political systems or anything else its just sps some sp gets ahold of political system and there we go some stalin decides that the best possible thing to do is to kill off ten million georgians thats the only way he can solve the problems of his country is kill off ten million georgians of course thats the act of madman and of course he was mad but he was also very sp russia is just now staggeringly recovering from all this they think this has something to do with communism has nothing to do with communism at all the system called communism and so on the system called socialism the system called democracy and so on all these could probably live cheek by jowl with just minor theoretical arguments it isnt political systems anyway that make countries productive or peoples happy political systems only exist because one has solved the problem of succession of good ruler thats the problem political system is trying to solve you talk to whole bunch of people and you say benevolent monarch is fine form of government if he is brilliant and runs his country well and youll find every political ideologist will agree with you matter what he is and theyll say thats true and then theyll come right in on the back of it but how would you succeed him and then we get political system so they cant guarantee that they can succeed him you know he cant have successor so the answer to it is dont have successors clear him now where our difficulties lie individually personally at this moment is only because we havent got ethics in in the society around us any difficulty youre having as an individual is only because you havent got ethics in in your immediate environment now we ought to shift gears on our emphasis now weve been having lot of fun as i told you we would have much much earlier weve been having lot of fun getting in ethics on scientologists weve had ball boy youve had enough comm evs to run out of your ears youve had enough ethics orders served on you and about you and chits and so forth and that sort of thing to last you quite while and i hope in the process you have learned something about the ethics system i also know that you wouldnt quite figure out how youd get along without it that its very handy thing to have you possibly can remember when you didnt have any ethics system at allhow gruesome it was instructors for instance couldnt instruct auditors couldnt audit everything was flap and blow the d of t was somebody who chased students but now of course where we have erred is getting ethics in too heavily on scientologists and too lightly on the surrounding environment thats fatal to do it reverse that way thats fatal too lightly on the environment around us too heavily on scientologists now what we ought to do is reverse that and get ethics in if anything too heavily on the environment now and err in the direction of too lightly on scientologists you got it so im sort of turning the cards on you in this talk because there isnt any point in getting ethics in on willing person hes perfectly willing hes trying to do his job so hes stupid well i assure you that it does good whatsoever to get ethics in on somebody because hes stupid none whatsoever it doesnt do bit of good just kind of makes him sullen the purpose of ethics is to get out of the way willful mopery and dopery on the high seas in other words this guy intends to knock it apart this guy intends to knock you down you should upgrade your idea of what an sp is man meet one sometime real one real monster and of course him you justhang it around his neck man real one but real sp is not just difficult person hes only about two and half percent of the human race and hes utterly nuts and he is the guy who has been putting people in sanitariums and busting up lives and making nervous breakdowns and that sort of thing thats real sp when those show up inside scientology groups and so forth of course shoot them but you dont have somebody thats been around three years and has been doing quasily all right and has lot of trouble with his motherinlaw turn up suddenly to be an sp see sps are real theyre real monsters now upscale upgrade your idea whats an sp whats he do you know of course youre probably bit adrift on what they do do and what they look like and what they sound like well one of the first things has this guy driven people into sanitariums you know is this bird strewing nothing but wreckage around him whether material or personal wreckage you know i mean you know social wreckage wrecking lives and families and smashing things up in all directions and is he willfully depressing the living daylights out of statistics and going all over the place well in all the time weve been around here we only had one sp that i know of one real sp that was on staff and he got the tech statistic right out through the bottom of the graph he was denying everybody in the place auditing and all the time he was protesting 100 percent now whether he was sp or pts i have not made up my mind to this date because i havent investigated the case enough but we were certainly better off without that person and i dont know of another single sp that weve ever had on staff isnt that interesting you see all these sp orders and so on well you take an sd you take an sd maybe the person is being suppressed by somebody else but maybe the person merely makes them unhappy hes not driving them into frantic state dont you see find the real sp in the persons life you know real one dont throw it around carelessly because this is ana very exaggerated condition sp they can look very nice they can sound very nice but actually you can tell one aboutusually tell one long way away you hear the sounds of conflict and you see the strewn wreckage long before you see the sp now err by all means in getting ethics in on the environment outside scientology err by all means in getting it in too heavily because the only mistake you can make is getting it in too lightly that can be bad error its the error were making right now with this very tiny group that is dashing around to governments and trying to knock our heads in thats the error were making right now were getting in ethics too softlynot fast enough not hard enough that is the mistake were making well we will go ahead and we will remedy that i trust we are in time without causing another big kerfuffle do you see but fast and hard now out in the perimeter outside scientology dont stand around and worry about whether or not youre going to make mistake on what person or which dont worry about that just get ethics in and then if you find out youve gotten it in wrongly why correct it but get it in but amongst scientologists why you better be pretty careful you better be pretty careful after all the guy is perfectly willing after all hes with us and hes trying and so forth thats why you saw get board of investigation in lieu of committee of evidence now of course the board of investigation just was to find out the facts for ron in state of confusion or upset i didnt put in it that they should also find the facts out for ron as to how come the affluence happened see ive got to rewrite that policy letter by adding this in to its purposes but its seldom ethics matter seldom an ethics matter that you really run into now i know tomorrow you instructors and executives are going to be faced with total revolt well all i invite you to do isjust raise your own ability to handle people learn to be persuasive and cajole and so on because those are techniques too if you think youve got to write and send out an ethics order why send out an ethics order but its pretty serious you know it has an awful recoil but getting ethics in on the planet the first grasp on thatoh itll probably be gradient but it better be fairly steep gradient and better be done fast while weve still got planet i dont like billiard balls now how are we going to do this well i couldnt tell you at this particular time probably ot technology but i cant tell you exactly what that is at this time because first i had to find out what we were trying to do well you would just be surprised at how marvelous it was to find out that the organization could exist and continue and go on without that was great that meant i really had built it up well that was why i was then perfectly willing to stay away but after i found that out was when i first started asking the question how am i going to get out of here im popular i have tremendous numbers of people depending on now how do i get out of here well i got shot from guns fortunately in the nick of time and the other thing was is could you make more clears wow wow and made number twentytwo just to celebrate my coming home now of course i have the immediate program of polishing meself off which im doing at great rate of speed now everythings fine i dont need any bits and pieces left around to experiment with in case you dont mention it i found out by the wayi found out by the way why people dont make it is nobody actually ran sometimes didnt rehab but mostly didnt run the release grades from 0 on up to v sometimes they had grade v processes and then should have gone back to grade 0 and then go on up again skipping grade v this time and gotten to grade vi then youd find out the case would run well but cases that arent running just arent properly released on the grades thats the simplicity of that more fancy material is needed there wasnt any necessity to change anything around and so on so ill just go on and finish it off and then of course i start the real research which is ot and we have quite few volunteers in this particular and weve already had our first lesson already ive handed out the first piece of information i had reg and jenny and we were in some godawful airport of bugawugaville or something like that flying back i was very fortunate the only reason i could possibly get out of there in the time i did is because rag and jenny flew in on wednesday i only had three days you see something like that and reg and jenny knocked all the baggage together and so forth and onto the airplane we went and out but anyway at bugawugaville or some such place they started asking questions about something or other so i gave them scale and its an ot scale has to do with knowledge and perception and so forth its create scale actually and when we reached london airport and all of you were waiting patiently or otherwise they stopped and told that i hadnt been vaccinated so i had to be vaccinated but in the processin the process of getting vaccinated you see id already given them this idea of the scale and so on but in the process this girl simply sat there with line of about fifty people she was going to take care of before she sent into the vaccination room to get vaccinated she didnt sit there long reg put beam on her and she went into the office bang she was kind of cross with afterwards her selfdeterminism if any had been totally overwhumped but that shows you how dangerous it is hed had just ten minute lecture in one elementary scale you see on ot and there went the vaccination clerk but ot is something one moves up into it is not state of clear and gradually all clears are starting to move forward and they move on up and they gradually develop this and that and they feel themselves getting bit bigger and they start resolving some of the things that theyre worried about you know about whats mest and so on there are faster ways however to do this there are faster ways and we will find those faster ways and when weve found them of course why then we can get ethics in very nicely providing we have an ot base from which to get it in from now im not sure whether the ot base is england or the middle east or the mountains of the moon or the moon ive studied it further than that i know what the society needs i know what the society responds to i got my data were making clears our organizations are functioning theyre very functional life looks pretty smooth the abilities of being are at this moment only hinted at and so i have to go forward into all of that its very interesting by the way that every time i try to put together the scope of ot i have to take it off as invalidation matter what extravagant statement you make about an ot and the capabilities of it it is an invalidation isnt that wild thing well anyway i wonti wont tell you about this again usually old soldiers and people who have had campaigns of one kind or another sit around for ages and ages talking about how they were at malta or this and that and i wont do that to you i wont keep saying when i was in rhodesia i will just take it from here it was so funny though it was so funny to get back and not really be back you know you shocked into realizing where i was you know but still things werent too bright and shiny until bonwick took around and showed the place you know showed what hed been up to and what youve been doing and so on and when we got that i came into pt and writing the reports you see about rhodesia has been an awful chore ever since because i laid it off i said i would tell you about it write some reports about it got to submit some reports concerning it and so on but to right now its not very interesting i came up to present time saint hill looked awfully good im much more interested much more interested in beginning to get ethics in on those people we ought to be getting it in on with great speed so we can get and maybe weve entered the first gradient maybe we get ethics in just on simple gradient it occurred to the other day that we might be able to just get ethics in on the planet on simple gradient just like were going right now with the technology and so forth so on after all the first point of attack that were making is one of the heaviest newspaper groups in the united kingdom pretty fabulous now anyway theres my adventures in rhodesia and the tale of fellow who went out to conquer country to find out what he needed in order to conquer country and what application scientology had on planetary basis and how and where and what to operate from got all those questions answered now all ive got to do is polish meself up get things lined up little bit and make the next move you see you just got through running totally out of technology so anyway ive got long job ahead of still and ill still have to stick around i can see that now and im sorry if thats bad news but i apologize for not giving you all the lectures you have missed i will try to make up for it in quality in the ensuing weeks ive got at jammed solidly around ears and weve got an awful lot to do but i want to thank you very much for keeping the show on the road for making the clears for making the affluences and for keeping everything going while i was gone and ill do the same for you next time thank you
