area summaries of various statutes that contain explicit statem ents as to their effect upon state law summaries of recent agency interpretations and court decisions on newly enacted state laws and general an alysis of the proposed regulations the question of whether or not state law applies to federally chartered banking institution depends upon whether or not the state law has been preempted by federal law unless there is an explicit federal statute specifically preempting the particular type of state law indicating that such state laws are not to be applied to federally chartered banks thrifts or credit unions the issue often turns on interpretation of the applicable federal laws generally if the statutory authority is ambiguous and the courts determine that the statute at issue is one that the federal banking regulators are charged by congress with administering the courts will defer to reasonable wellreasoned in terpretation by the regulator with this in mind the office of the co mptroller of the currency occ the regulator of national banks has recently issued regulations that preempt various state laws that affect national bank real estate lending ot her lending and deposittaking functions there is also regulation that sets procedure for occ to preempt other state laws affecting other activities or powers authorized by congress for national banks occ premises these regulations on legal arguments flowing from principles of federal preemption deri ved from various judicial decisions and on practical argument which in turn are based on the array of federal re gulations addressing functions of national banks including recent occ guidance on real estate lending and predatory lending state regulators consumer advocates and certain member s of congress have questioned whether occ has the authority to issue such broad regulations some have criticized occ as going beyond the st andard articulated by the supreme court in barnett bank of madison county v nelson 517 us 25 31 1996 when it decided that state law that would pr event some national banks from exercising insurance powers authorized by federal w was preempted because it would prevent or significantly interfere with the national banks exercise of its powers in recent years criticism of increased bank fees and entry into new market areas have provoked state legislation aime d at protecting consumers in such areas as insurance sales insurance licensing requirements atm fees check cashing fees and credit card warnings national ba nks sometimes supported by amicus briefs by the

dueonsale clauses leaseholds as acceptable security and mandated statements and disclosures some of these have been preempted by federal court decisions others by occ regulations after establishing histor of judicial treatment of national banks relationship with state law setting forth the reasons fo r issuing the proposals occ proceeded to discuss each of the regulatory proposals in turn it proposed to preempt state laws with respect to real estate lending deposittaking and ot her lending it also proposed to provide standard for preempting state laws affecting other activities authorized for national banks by federa l law under the proposed standard state laws that obstruct in whole or in part or c ondition national banks exercise of powers granted to it would be preempted ce rtain types of state laws would be presumptively not preempted but would be subject to preemption should they be found have more than an incidental ffect upon national bank powers with respect to real estate lending the agency also solicited comments as to whether occ should make an explicit statement that its regulations preempt the entire field similar to the ots rule14 occs preemption regulations as promulgated final rules were prom ulgated on january 7 200415 they generally conform to the format of the proposed rules ther is some modification of the preemption standard and of the text of th rules but field preemption16 there is also predatory lending provision that prohibits making consumer loans based on the foreclosure or liquidation value of the real property or collateral and specific rule enforcing section 5 of the federal trad commission act declaring unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce to be unlawful17httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32197crs5 18 see crs report rs21104 should banking powers expand into real estate brokerage and management by william d jackson 19 this provision requires all

final rules assured realtors that the regulations were not means of authorizing real estate brokerage activities18 to the concerns raised by consumer advocates that consumer protections would be weakened occ responded by extending the prohibition on practices that might be viewed as predatory lending practices to cover all consumer loans rather than only real estate loans comments were also received from state banking regulators members of congress various state legislators and attorneys general and consumer groups arguing against field preemption and challenging th obstruct in whole or in part standard that occ had proposed occ responded by choosing not to issue field preemption rule and by slightly modifying the preemption standa rd the final rules employ the following preemption standard state laws that obstr uct impair or cond ition national banks ability to fully exercise power the proposals standard had read state laws that obstruct in whole or in part or condition national banks exercise of powers the commentary accompanying the issuance of final rules discusses the basis and authority of these regulations expanding upon the material accompanying the proposed regulations it emphasizes the na ture of the national banking system its congressionally mandated goals and the need for it to be responsive to the demands of an increasingly mobile and technologi cally advanced society occ refutes arguments that there is any one particular articulation of the standard that applies to preemption of state law affecting nationa l banks by referring to the variety of formulations used in prev ious supreme court cases statutory authority for preempting state laws under the authority of 12 usc 371 which authorizes national banks to engage in real estate lending subject to such restrictions nd requirements as the comptroller of the currency may prescr ibe by regulation or order the occ regulation lists state laws by type that are preempted and types that are generally not preempted two basic banking functions authorized under 12 usc 24 seventh deposittaking and lending other than real estate lending are covered by separate sections of the regulations final sec tion covers all other functions of national banks and their subsidiaries in general rule preempting state law respecting all powers authorized under federal law including activities conducted under the incidental powers clause of 12 usc 24 seventh occ appears to be interpreting its rulemaking authority as virtually exclusive under the real estate lending statute 12 usc 371 which includes the phrase subject to section 1828o19 and such restrictions and requirements as the comptroller of the currency may prescrib by regulation or order the other statutory authority that occ relies on is 12 usc 93a which grants general rulemaking authority to occ to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32197crs6 20 in comments submitted to occ on october 6 2003 the center for responsible lending hereafter the center criticizes the occs lega l analysis of the authority provided in 12 usc 371 it reads the occ proposal on real estate lending as tantamount to field preemption because it refrains from preempting onl those state laws that are beneficial to national banks it reads occs interpretation of amendments to 12 usc 371 as misguided because the mere requirement of compliance with safety and s oundness regulations promulgated by all banking regulators cannot mean that congress intended to provide occ with authority to occupy the fiel d exclusive of state c onsumer protection laws there is similar assertion that occs interpretation of barnett bank of marion county v nelson 517 us 25 1996 inaccurately compares 12 usc 371 with 12 usc 92 at issue in that case according to the center the latter is clearer as to the limit of state authority 21 in agency rules with the force of law the original convention 116 harvard law review 470 473 2002 thomas w merrill and kathryn tongue watts make this point and summarize the current state of the law w ith respect to all federal agencies but the internal revenue service as embracing the assumption that facially ambiguous rulemaking grants always include the authority to adopt rules having the force of law 22 710 f 2d 878 dc cir 1983 23 this is the language that occ relies on in the proposed regulations it reads subject to such terms conditions and limitations as may be prescribed by the comptroller of the currency by order rule or regulations and refers to the power of national banks to make real estate loans 24 with respect to the interaction of national bank legislation and the dual banking system the court opined that congressional decisi on to upgrade the powers of national banks because they were at competitive disadvan tage does not entail the altogether different proposition that congress intended to compel nati onal banks to move in lockstep with state banks 710 f 2d 878 885responsibilities of the office subject to the following exception except to the extent that authority to issue rules and regulations has been expressly granted to another regulatory agency20 this occ interpretation may well be consistent with the way the courts have since the 1970 s interpreted such general grants of rulemaking authority as authority to issue substantive regulations21 occ use of these two statutes to issue preemptive regulations has already been upheld in the context of litigation in conference of state bank supervisors v conover 22 federal appellate court relying on the reasoning of fidelity upheld an occ regulation allowing national banks to offer or to purchase adjustable rate mortgages and preempting inconsistent stat laws in reaching the conclusion the court specifically found that the language in 12 usc 371 provided such authority and further held that even without th language added by garnst germain23 occ had the authority to issue such regulations the court also found that 12 usc 93a provided authority to issue such rules and that it was not merely housekeeping authority24 according to the court section 93a provides occ with power to issue rules that have the force of law to discharge its obligations with respect to overseeing the national banking system the court stated the entire legislative scheme is one th at contemplates the operation of state law only in the absence of federal law and where such state law does not conflict with the policies of the national banking act so long as he doeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32197crs7 25 710 f 2d 878 885 26 the types of state laws generally preempted for real estate lending and appraisals are 1 licensing registration filings or reports by

the prospect of preemption of state laws by fede ral banking regulators because of the potential impact on consumer protections and on the dual banking system40 banking trade associations on the other hand have taken the view that occs regulations help to preserve the dual banking system against state attempts to restrict or condition the authorized activities of national banks41 of course one aspect of the dual banking system that permits an occ ruling to work to the advantage of statechartered banks vi savis nonbank lenders in state with predatory lending laws is 12 usc 1831d under it statechartered bank with branches in more than one state may take advantage of the most favored lender standard and operate under th rules applicable to nati onal banks in its home state42 the dual banking system refers to th fact that two parate systems of chartering banks and thrifts exist in this count ry federal and state in the early days although there was the experience of the fi rst and second banks of the united states banking was generally conduc ted through statechartere d banks even after the supreme court had upheld the author ity of congress to charter banks43 in 186344 however congress established system of federallychartered national banks as means of raising funds to finance the civil war45 ever since bankseither new banks or those in operationmay choose fe deral or state

moreover there is question that certain state laws apply to national banks the preemption issue arises because there is precise way of identifying each and every state law that may apply to national bank ccs initiative appears to be that agencys attempt to place itself in the position of making an initial determination on that issue while some federal laws contain explicit language of preemption many do not under the supremacy clause of the us constitution46 congress may override state laws conflicting with its exercise of delegated powers when congress has done so preempted state laws are une nforceable that was the ruling in mcculloch v maryland47 case dealing with the power of congress to create national banks in it the court found maryland law establis hing tax rates for notes issued by the first bank of the united states to be void in broad language the court voiced its conviction that the states ve power by taxation or ot herwise to retard impede burden or in any manner control the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by congress to carry into execution the pow ers vested in the general government48 federal statute addresses the procedures that the banking agencies must use in issuing preemption determinations in certain areas it does not however include language curtailing their substantive authority to issue preemption determinations section 114 of the riegleneal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 199449 requires the occ in making preemption determinations as to the application of state law regarding community reinve stment consumer prot ection fair lending or the establishment of intrastate branches to follow certain procedures it generally requires federal register notice at least 80day comment period consideration of

has upheld state authority often starting from presumption of the applicability of state law in waite v dowley 94 us 527 1877 the court found that state statute not in conflict with federal law regarding the place for assessing national bank shares for tax purposes could be enforced subsequently in first national bank v missouri 263 us 640 656 1 924 it upheld state law that prohibited banks including national banks from forming branches the principal reason appears to have been its interpretation of federal law as not c ontemplating branch bank operations the court said national banks are subject to the laws of state in respect of their affairs unless such laws interfere with the purpose of their creation tend to impair or destroy their efficiency as federal agen cies or conflict with the paramount law of the united states it examined the language and purpose of the national bank act and determined that the power sought to be exercised by the bank finds justification in any law or authority of the united st ates and found the way open for the enforcement of the state statute52 the starting point for preemption analys is is the language of the federal legislation if congress enacts legislati on under one of its delegated powers that includes an explicit statement that state law is preempted the supreme court generally will give effect to that legislative intent53 where there is language of preemption the court is likely to find preem ption when it identifies direct conflict between the federal law and the state law or when it concludes that the federal government has so occupied the field as to preclude enforcement of state law with respect to the subject at hand54 where there is direct conflict with federal law relating to national banks ie where complying with the federal and state law is impossible the supreme court has repeatedly upheld the federal law of ten it has used broade r language than the facts of the case require for example in

question 12 usc 92 authoriz ed national banks in towns of not more than 5000 to sell insurance under the stat statute banks with affiliates could not sell insurance the court began its analysis from the premise that congress had granted national banks power that was to be free of state interference it reasoned that since there was clear statutory language of pr eemption preemption was to be determined by an examining the statut ory structure and purpose for clear but implicit preemptive intent55 it listed three possible ways of finding preemptive intent 1 finding that the federal law so occupies the regulatory field as to exclude role for the state 2 determining that there is an irreconcilable conflict ie that complying with both the federal and state law is impossible or 3 finding that complying with the state law would obstr uct one of the purposes of the federal legislation the court did not find that federal regula tion of national banks is so extensive as to occupy the field nor did it find that the state statute was in complete conflict with the federal one nonetheless it held that the state statute was preempted as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the cong ressional intent of permitting all national banks whatever their affiliation in towns of not more than 5000 to sell insurance in reaching its conclusion the court treated earlier decisions requiring interpretations of statutes conferring powers on national banks grants of powers by congress to national banks ar to be treated as grants of authority not normally limited by but rather ordinarily preempting contrary state law56 the court generalized in defining the preemptive scope of statutes and regulations granting power to national banks these cases take the view that normally congress would not want states to forbid or to impair significantly the exercise of power that congress explicitly granted to say this is not to deprive states of the power to regulate national banks where unlike here doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national banks exercise of its powers57 although barnett found state law that complete ly prevented some national banks from exercising statutory power to have been preempted as significant interference it did not set forth any measuring tool to decipher degrees on interference this may raise the question as to whether occs

within thei r jurisdictions regardless of the type of charter an institution holds in particular states have legitimate interest in protecting the rights of their consumers businesses and communities federal banking agencies through their opinion letters and interpretative rules on preemption issues play an important role in maintaining the balance of federal and state law under the dual banking system congress does not intend that the interstate banking and branching efficiency act of 1994 alter this balance and thereby weaken states authority to protect the intere sts of their consumers businesses or communities under wellestablished judicial prin ciples national banks are subject to state law in many significant respects the laws of the state in which national bank is situated will apply to the national bank unless those state laws are preempted by federal law generally state law applies to national banks unless the state law is in direct conflict with the federal law federal law is so comprehensive as to evidence congressional intent to occupy given field or the stat law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of the federal law in

both in proposing and finalizing th regulations on preemption occ sets forth legal and practical justifications th legal argument is based on principles of federal preemption relating to national banks the histor of the national bank act and its conferral of powers pa rticularly the real estate power and the analysis of the supreme court in barnett the practical arguments center on the fact that there has been significant history of national bank predatory lending problems and state enforcement efforts have focused primarily on unregulated financial institutions even with this record according to occ it has taken steps and has adequate tools to prevent the problem from surfacing in na tional banks or to deal with it if it does it issued two advisory letters on predat ory lending

equity stripping and refinancin g of subsidized mortgages are subject to enforcement actions under the ftc ac t as unfair or deceptive practices the major criticisms of the occ position may also be classified as legal and practicalthat occs legal standard is slan ted and that the regu lator of national banks has not provided sufficient data for its c onclusions about the impact of the various types of state laws at issue on national ba nks the basis for the assertion that occ has extended barnett s more limited standard139 may be seen in comparing the two standards according to occ where there is statute delineating the applicability of state law to particular situation i nvolving nati onal bank stat law would be applicable only if it is not altering or conditioning national banks ability to exercise power that federal law grants to it the barnett standard which occ cites as authority for the occ version140 reads in defining the preemptive scope of statutes and regulations granting power to national banks these cases take the view that normally congress would not want states to forbid or to impair significantly the exercise of power that congress explicitly granted to

the grammleach bliley act it used this formulation142 if occ is broadening the barnett standard it may be that it is not following the advice of the conference committee report accompanying the enactme nt of the riegleneal interstate branching efficiency act of 1994 which set up certain procedural requirements before occ could promulgate certain preemption determinations as means among other things to help ensure that an ag ency only makes preem ption determination when the legal basis is compelling and the federal policy interest is clear143 since the supreme courts preempti on rulings concerning national banks predate fda v brown williamson that case may provide some arguments to convince courts to impose the more stringen t test of that case rather than pure chevron analysis in ruling on challenges to occs authority to promulgate these rules or some aspects of them the pot ential economic impact of preempting state lending and deposittaking state laws for na tional banks is consid erable the contrast between the history of judicial approva l of and congressional acquiescence to occ preemption rulings over the years and the fortyyear history of the refusal of congress to provide fda with explicit ru lemaking authority over tobacco products seems to preclude any analogy between the tw situations it is true however that occ has explicit statutory authority to preempt state laws on the covered subjects or with respect to subsidiaries what the agency relies on is the breadth of the overall purposes of the national banking system the comprehensive general authority delegated to occ to regulate nationa l banks and various specific statutory authorizations to issue rules on s ubject matters covered by these proposed regulations
