otherwise hr 833 106 congress 1 sess 1999 the bankruptcy reform act of 1999th st hr 833 like its predecessor hr 3150 is comprehensive bill addressing consume r practice under chapters 7 and 13 and business bankruptcy reform with respect t consumer bankruptcy great deal of the impetus towards legislative action has bee n fueled by the everincr easing rate of consumer bankruptcy filings congressional debate3 over bankruptcy reform during the 105 congress repeatedly evidenced desire b yth members to elevate personal responsibility in consumer financial transactions to prevent bankruptcy filings from being utilized by consumers s financial planning tool rather than lastresort solution to personal financial crisis and to recapture the stigma associated with bankruptcy filing which many perceive to have eroded since enactment of the us bankruptcy code in 1978 oppone nts of the legislation argue inter alia that the growth in consume r bankruptcies is not result of liberal bankruptcy laws but is the consequence of greatl expanded consumer cred it and highrisk lending practices that the imposition of means test will permit debtors to manipulate jurisdictional filing criteria that undermining th fresh start in bankruptcy by making commercial debt nondischargeable will adversel impact debtors family support obligations and that the increased cost of administering the us bankruptcy court system wi ll not be justified by the incremental increase in debt recovery realized by creditors several day s of hearings during the 106 congress have elicited testimony by manyth experts which suggests significant disagreement over the causes of increased consumer filings and the most effective way to enhance debt repayment 4 highlights of consumer bankruptcy provisions in the bi ll passed by the house presumpti ve abuse hr 833 utilizes the means testing formula similar to that of th conference version of hr 3150 the bankruptcy trustee would make preliminar determination whether the debtors filing under chapter 7 debtor was an abuse of th ehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20128crs3 11 usc 7075 hr 833 1026 11 usc 1322d7 hr 833 6068code the definition of abus under 11 usc 707 however would be amended5 6 in summary abuse woul d be presumed for chapter 7 filing if the debtor met the following criteria if the debtors monthly income calculated under fiveyear repayment pla n under chapter 13 would leave him or her with an ability to pay 100 per month in disposable income after factoring in deductions for living expenses privat school tuition payments to secu red creditors and payment of priority claims such as child support and alimony the debtors living expenses would be calculated by referral to internal revenu service living standard allowances which ar used to determine taxpayers ability to pay delinquent taxes not by reference to the debtors actual historical livin g expense exper ience in other words the law would assume that debtors and their families can live for five years within the budgets established by the irs livin g allowances if debtor believes that he or she cannot live within the irs living allowanc standards he or she must demonstrate the existence of extraordinar circumstances that require additional expenses or adjustment of current monthl total income if the debtors current monthly income calculated within these parameters left the debtor with 100 per month then the debtor would meet the presumptive abuse standard the debtor would be requir ed either to file under chapter 13 or to refrain from filing for relief under the us bankruptcy code extraordinary circumstances the debtor could rebut the presumption of abuse by demonstrating extraordinary circumstances that require additional expenses tha t showing would require extensive evidentiary proof attestation under oath by the debtor and the debtors attorney and the net effect of rendering the debtor unable to pay of f 6000 of unsecured claims over five years plan duration chapter 13 reorganization plans currently are permitted to b completed within three year time frame with possible extension to five years fo r cause under the bill the duration period will be five years if the debtors curren t7 monthly income is not less than the highest national median family income hence the8 length of confirmation plan will depe nd upon the debtors current monthly income at the time of plan inception httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20128crs4 11 usc 507a19 hr 833 13910 see testimony of robert waldschmidt pres national assoc of bankruptcy

welfare departments would be included while this would of course elevate the status of domest ic support obligations in bankruptcy there was testimony before the hous subcom mittee on commercial and administrative law that the financial incentive fo r trustees to serve the estate including his or her ability to investigate and recove r fraudulent trans fers may suffer if there are not sufficient funds to pay support and to compensate them and other professionals for their efforts11 nondischargeable unsecured debt two provisions of the bill enlarge the class of debts whic h would become nondischargeable in bankruptcy consumer debts owed to single creditor aggregating more than 250 for luxury goods incurred within 90 day s before the filing are presumed to be fraudulent and would become nondischargeable12 current law presumes that consumer debts or cash advances owed to single creditor for more than 1000 that are incurred within 60 days of bankruptcy are nondischargeable13 and debts presumably credit card debts incurred to pay debt that i s nondischargeable would also become nondischarg eable if the debtor incurred the debt to pay such nondischargeable debt with the intent to discharge in bankruptcy the newly created debt or incurred the debt within 90 da ys of filing it is not clear how the debtor14 would prove or disprove that he or she intended to discharge the debt in bankruptc when it was incurred secured creditors the position of secured creditors would be greatly enhance d under the bill under current law the claim of secured creditor is only secured that is legally protected up to the market value of the collateral the law currently assumes that the amount that the creditor would likely realize for the property if the debtor returns the secured property to the creditor is the value of the claim and an unsecured claim for the difference between t he collaterals market value and the contract price that the debtor agreed to pay in chapter 13 debtor is permitted to cramdown claims against some secured cr editors this means that the creditor must accept payments equal to the value of the collateral as full payment on the claim under the bill debtor would not b permitted to bifurcate or strip the lien on the secured claim that is divide it into secured and unsecured amount if the debtor purchased the ite m within 5 years of the filing the debtor in most cases would be required to pay the full contract price and in somehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20128crs5 id 122 12315 145 cong rec s2738 daily ed march 16 1999statement of sen grassley16 s 625 203

was modified prior to introduction to accommodate the concerns raised by some senators in his introductory statement sen grassley notes s everal features which differentiate the senate and house bills16 the senate bill gives more flexibility to the bankruptcy judge to determine whether debtor is effecting an abusive chapter 7 filing there are greater consumer protections in the senate bill addressed at curbin g abusive and illegal creditor behavior to coerce debtor reaffirmation of dischargeable debt for example the justice department and the fbi are directed to appoin t prosecutors and agents to investigate abusive or deceptive reaffirmation practices and state attorney generals are given express authority to enforce remedies fo r abuse of reaffirmation protections in the bankruptcy code17 bankruptcy trustees would be required to notify state enforcement agencies of bankrupts address and telephon number if the bankrupt owes child support this is designed to promote help by bankruptcy courts in tracking down deadbeat parents and18 although the senate bill like hr 833 provides that certain debts incurred prior to bankru ptcy to pay off nondischargeable debts will also be nondischargeabl even though they are dischargeable under current law those debts will remai n dischargeable if the debtor owes child support this is intended to protect th interests of child support recipients postbankruptcy19 presumed abuse s 625 does not automatically subject debtors to means test in order to determine eligibility to file under chapter 7 instead it permits party in interest including creditor to challenge the debtors ability to pay when party raises th issue the court will presume abuse if by applying calculations sim ilar to those in hr 833 including reliance on irs living standard allowances the court finds that the debtor s monthly income would leave him or her with an ability to pay 25 of nonpriorit unsecured claims or 250 per month in disposable income whichever is less httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20128crs6 id 31820 hr 833 14721 s 625 306 30922 see eg id 310 31423 letter from sen torricelli to sen grassley march 17 199924 srept 10649 199925plan

homestead exemption last years senatepassed version of hr 3150 placed 100000 cap on homestead ex emptions under state law the conference version did not include monetary cap but did impose longer residency requirements in order to tak advantage of state homestead exemption hr 833 imposes 250000 cap n homestead exemptions under state law but would permit the states to enact law s exempting their residents from the federal cap s 625 as reported by the senate does21 not appear to impose monetary cap on state homestead exemptions treatment of secured debt and nondischargeable unsecured debt s 625 doe s have provisions comparable to those in hr 833 with respect to limitations on cramdown of secured creditors and expanded categories of nondischargeable debt22 23 bankruptcy reform legislation appeared to enjoy widespread suppor t during the 105th congress sen torricelli cosponsor of s 625 has indicated however that there are still many important outstanding issues th at need to be addressed as the legislation moves forward these may include determining the appropriate degree of judicial discretion in the application of means test the appropriateness of applying irs living allowances to bankruptcy debtors the appropriate scope of nondischargeable debt and whether or how abusive practices by the credit industry should be addressed24 senate judiciary committee markup the bill was reported out of committe with relatively few amendments proceedings before the senate judiciary committe e25 suggest that members may still be divided over many issues including the use of ir s living expense standards and other calculations for m eans testing the need for monetary cap on state homestead exemptions attorney liability for debtor filings mandatory credit counseling reaffirmation agreements and consumer protections against credit car d lending practices these issues and many others are likely to be addressed i n amendments submitted when the bill comes to the floor
