from jonathan overpeck jtouarizonaedu to wahl eugene r wahlealfrededu subject re wahlammann paper and uaz position date fri 10 feb 2006 120544 0700 cc keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk eystein jansen eysteinjansengeouibno xflowed hi eugene this is good news i hope please contact steve and see if we will have in press status before the end of the month he knows the drill but also the downside of not being precise let eystein and keith know as soon as you know bit nuts right now really appreciate your help thanks peck hi peck well as i have understood it in our communications with steve final acceptance is equivalent to being in press for climatic change because it is journal of record however this would need to be confirmed to be quite sure if that is the case then in press is still possible by the end of the month i think which would be best at this point for to write and ask steve this or would it be better for you to ask im happy to do so i just want to act in the most timeeffective and appropriate way i apologize for the fact that it is coming right down to the wire the status right now is that i am waiting for final analytical results from caspar re pearsons r and ce results on all the scenarios we have done these results will go in an appendix table and i have to write brief text to go with them for contextualization purposesi already have in mind what i want to say the entire rest of the document is essentially done steve turned around the change from in review to provisionally accepted within days last december after receiving back the final independent rereview it had been due month earlier so i can imagine that he could potentially turn around the change from provisional acceptance to full acceptance similarly quickly please advise about who is best to contact steveand if i will get on it today peace gene dr eugene r wahl asst professor of environmental studies alfred university ________________________________ from jonathan overpeck

email wrt ua geography based on your update which is much appreciated im not sure well be able to cite either in the sod due at the end of this month sections will have to be done this week or earliest next week to meet this deadline the rule is that we cant cite any papers not in press by end of feb from what you are saying there isnt much chance for in press by the end of the month if this is not true please let keith tim and eystein know and make sure you send the in press doc as soon as it is officially in press as in you have written confirmation we have to be careful on these issues thanks again peck hi peck two quick things 1 regarding the wahlammann wa climatic change papercaspar and i are in the very final stages of completing the requirements steve schneider set for bringing this paper into full vs provisional acceptance we have an internal goal of week from now for resubmission we have had an equally pressing deadline with science re our comment on the vonstorch et 2004 criticism of mbh that was based on an improper and undisclosed detrending step which has taken some extra work to be sure we have our mathematics exactly correct we have been multitracking on both this and wa and so far have been quite close to meeting our internal time goals i feel the week time frame will be fairly accurate 2 i am aware of position now open at uaz in the geography and regional development dept i think i make good fit with the position profileactually quite goodhowever i have met roadblocks in geography departments before because my degree is not in geography geographers seem to have particular sensitivities to their discipline being watered down also the geography depts at some research grade institutions umn for example require pretty heavy teaching loads which makes nice challenge to keep up with researchdont i know and finally the position is subject to budgetary approval which makes wonder if there are significant deeper budgetary issues that it would be good to know about do you have any read on this position and the budget issues i have lot of contacts there in climatologyearth systemrelated areasincluding you malcolm hughes tom swetnam owen davis and also julio betancourt of the usgswhich is something that would be considered strength for this position from my perspective the fit would be very good but i dont want to invest effort in the application process if it is clear that not being geography phd is stopper or if there is some other significant red flag i should know about any thoughts you might have will be welcome ill be contacting malcolm for his read also and then talk to the search chair peace gene dr eugene r wahl asst professor of environmental studies alfred university 6078712604 1 saxon drive alfred ny 14802
