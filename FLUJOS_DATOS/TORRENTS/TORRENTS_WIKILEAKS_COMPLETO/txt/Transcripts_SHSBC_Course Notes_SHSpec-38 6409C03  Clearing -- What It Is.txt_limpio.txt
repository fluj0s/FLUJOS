6409c03 shspec38 clearing what it is clear means what it meant in dianetics the evolution of science which is the same as what it means on adding machines computers have complex circuits sometimes drop of solder gets dropped in which shortcircuits the circuits and adds some wrong constant factor to the computer in mechanical adding machines if you never pushed the clear button after the previous operation you would get the old total added in that is the uncleared answer where old data modifies pt data the mind likewise will add old answers into current computations and get wrong answers persons memory will be bad in the area where the old answer is stuck amnesia is all the helddown fives adding up to total blank memory is not broad condition it is spotty as leopard person has bad memory in an area of aberration traumatic experience is surrounded by locks so sometimes it is hard to find there is such thing however as uniformly good or bad memory the worse off someone is the more areas of nomemory there are insanity becomes way of obfuscating overts as well as motivator and justifier for them if we could get person to see the overt all that insanity would become unnecessary if you want to improve someones memory you must ask memory on what person is aberrated in the area where his memory is poor there is fairly goodsized piece of nuttiness occluding some area of his experience and memory all you have to do is to monkey with it little and it will start to clear psychiatry errs by trying to make sense out of the incomprehensible it cant be done by definition you should not try to figure that square shapes make people nervous because some patients were nervous around doors instead you should find out how come the patients got nuts on the subject of doors you dont try to make sense out of the incomprehensible all you have to do is to understand that he the person who has presented you with the incomprehensible doesnt understand it and to start looking for where it came from people are far more normal than they are crazy cf hs sullivan nobody is totally crazy other mental sciences go crazy on this fact because of mans thirst for allness which is just the craving to identify with psychiatrists going aaa think that there is such thing as total insanity and that therefore there is such thing as the state of being insane even in his legal systems man has to have something called insanity this is not correct person is insane in one or more areas or subjects there is such thing as total insanity gibbering idiot who asks for glass of water when he is thirsty is sane in that area the sentence this man is insane requires three dots at its end to show that it is incomplete psychiatrists have never completed the sentence so that it reads properly and accurately as this man is insane on the subject of _______ but if psychiatrists knew that much about the subject of insanity they could cure it it is the missing link actually they have never defined their terms if you ask psychiatrist what subject is this guy insane on he would say maybe exhibitionism bull pucky thats condition not subject you cant classify insanities because insanity is the same on the same subject as any other to finish the sentence this man is insane on the subject of _______ psychiatrists would have to observe the patient then they would see that there was similarity to others insanity find the subject on which person is insane find the source of the subject and he will have cognitions and the aberration will blow if you are in an area where the pc is cogniting you must therefore be in an area where the pc was aberrated you are tracking down and clearing helddown five cognition is returned memory when the pc is cogniting it is an indicator that he is getting rid of helddown fives and he will be remembering better in that area if person never cognites you arent tracking down any helddown fives clear means on any given subject not nuts anymore especially where the person has been pretty nuts you could say for example on the subject of children this person is clear you would have to put it into the framework of relationship of some kind when you have hit enough stuck fives you can call the guy clear which means cleared being with cleared ability to think guy who has been cleared in given area of aberration cant go nuts in that area again it took fantastically offthewall set of circumstances to aberrate the person in the first place to aberrate him again you would have to get the same weird circumstances all together again and then some because now he is educated too he knows how it happened cleared person or clear would be person with obvious aberrations and with majority of areas cleared who has cleared ability to think the basic business of an auditor is to use scientology tech to locate areas of aberration in the being and then to follow those areas down until the person recognized an earlier causation for the condition he would then be unable to reconstruct his nuttiness in that area because the thing that had him aberrated in the first place is gone and he also knows that he has been nuts in that area so when he sees something approaching that could be recurrence of the condition he preunderstands what might happen again and it wont happen having had the experience and being aware of it is like being inoculated he couldnt go nuts again in that area if he tried therefore clearing is stable the state of total causation is not the same as the state of clear the state of total causation is ot which is different from being unaberrated clearing is something that applies to the mind it is related to finite state of existence the ability to survive well in everyday existence in the universe across time when we try to make clear an absolute we go beyond that into another area that has the sideeffects of clear although you are not trying to fix the guy up the final result is total resumption of beingness at total causation which isnt necessarily in the physical universe in finite time clearing is an assist to finite existence not some supernatural thing man doesnt leap from state of total aberration to state of total divinity it is long walk which starts with the guys present environment the gradient scale only breaks down when the pc gets into running the things that make up the mind gpms now you are handling uncommon unnatural problems like why did the being make time track what is he doing in the physical universe etc an individual who had time at all would not be normal it takes different framework to explain this now you have an individual who through his understandings of what is around him and his exact handling of the masses and significances in his immediate vicinity has gradual emergence and cognition of what is going on we are knocking out his concept of existence and replacing it with total knowingness of existence that individual is emerging towards causation not towards being cleared he is going towards point where he causes the past not where he is cleared of the past the aberrations you are taking away from him on r6 are not timed aberrations that is what makes them build up and that is why they are rough they cant be blown by meter dating they date now however you can date and blow an implant gpm isnt something that happened in the year 2681 bc that is quite different from something that happened within the universe that you can fit in on the time track if you find an engram all you have to do it date it and it goes bzzt the pc wouldnt have prayer of getting it back after the guy is clear you begin to ask where is the time coming from that you are dating the clearing in now you are into r6 and ot the guy is more causative over the universe less worried about what the universe is doing to him you are going from the finite to the infinite the field of recreation of the individual or the individuals rising up towards total cause is long and arduous road you dont run out of gpms very fast the point is that there is separation point between the finite universe and the world of total beingness people going towards clearing are interested in physical wellbeing and their relationships with other human beings they are interested in accomplishing finite goals in the physical universe like keeping job etc if person going up the other track hasnt totally followed the clearing track he is still interested in those things too although perhaps not so aberratedly but only people who are interested in clearing are interested in finite physical universe goals if someone is insane you remove the individual areas of aberration as they become accessible and leave growing core of sanity that was always there somewhere along the line he ceases to be interested in becoming clear of his past and he begins to be very sincerely interested in causation personal individual causation what is the individuals relationship to and responsibility with regard to the physical universe the individual is also capable of going nuts in this direction and thinking that he is god but only if he isnt really past the gates on the road clearing ceases when the individual can recognize his basic gpms and knows where they came from etc ordinary clearing procedures wont touch gpms so clearing ceases now you go into running gpms the person soon gets over being interested in blowing out the electric light or wondering if he could do this etc he gets more seriousminded about the situation as it becomes more real to him and more natural to him he stops worrying about other people getting to be ot the end of the road is in view and it is finite road so the two roads are different one has to do with processing somebody within the limits of time and experience deleting things that keep the individual from getting right answers in existence the other is different auditing changes the individuals responses to auditing change you can still shift the preot back little onto the other road if you do this too much he collides with the next gpm and it jams the meter the locks are now all on top of gpms not on traumatic life experiences charge on subject could lead to misunderstanding word on the subject clarification of the word would cause dropping away of some locks on the subject this could apply to gpm words also it isnt how big or how little persons aberrations are that counts it is how many aberrations he has the closer the aberrations are in subject to each other the more there are these aberrations are not necessarily based on dramatic or interesting experiences either although the pc may try to make more out of them than is actually there
