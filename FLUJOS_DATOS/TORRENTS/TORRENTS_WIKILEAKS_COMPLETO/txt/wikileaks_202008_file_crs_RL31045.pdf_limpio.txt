finance divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045financial risk an overview of market and policy considerations summary financial risk is measure of the variance of return on investment in general the higher the potent ial return the greater is the probability of loss all financial choices are risky not just those that involve new and untried ventures market discipline balancing fear of losses against hope for gains is what underlies the efficient allocation of capital in the economy recent decades have seen striking advances in methods of risk measurement as well as the development of financial instruments that allow users to separate the various risks bound up in single financial transactions and decide which risks they wish to bear and which they wish to transfer to others these developments should promote financial efficiency as firms specialize in the risks they understand best and make market discipline more robust however even as private risk management has improved financial crises have beco more common around the world leading government regulators to pay more attention to private risk taking given the nearuniversal belief that private markets do better job of allocating capital and judging risk than central planners what justifies government intervention in the risk management process the problem is that under certain circumstances financial losses may be borne not just by risk takers but by innocent bystanders in the real economy while all market participants have the incentive to limit their risk taking to prevent the loss of their own capital market participant has an incentive to limit its risk taking to reduce risks to the economy as whole the possibility that the failure of single large financial institution or simultaneous risk misjudgements by many firms and regulators may trigger disruption in the markets that could damage the real economy is called systemic risk regulators seek to control systemic risk by preventive measures such as requiring financial intermediari to maintain capital reserves as cushion against unexpected losses in addition they are prepared to intervene when markets are under stress to prevent widening crises or falling dominoes by acting as the lender of last resort in effect bailing out market participants who have misjudged risk both these regulatory tools have costs they reduce funds available for lending or investment and weaken market discipline fundamental question that remains unresolved is how much time and resources governments should devote to preparation for systemic financial crises which may be damaging when they occur but which happen very seldom do the benefits justify the costs of intervening in private risk taking decisions this report surveys private market developments and policy issues related to financial risk it is intended as an introductory overview and will be updated only if warranted by significant market or legislative eventshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045contents definitions 1 advances in risk management 2 value at risk 3 derivatives 3 summary 4 the government role 5 systemic risk scenarios 7 contagionfalling

overview of market and policy considerations risk taking is the central feature of free market economy as such the best oversight of private risk decisions is generally provided by market discipline that is the possibility of loss rather than government regulation losses that follow from risky financial investments are painful to the individuals and firms who suffer them but have positive economic effects they send signals to the markets that guide capital to the most productive uses maximizing economic growth and wellbeing however in certain cases as when large financial institution makes catastrophic error or when many firms or investors make similar misjudgements at the same time private risk taking becomes in the view of most economists proper object for government oversight in these extreme cases losses may be borne not only by those who took risks in hope of gain but by innocent bystanders as well if these spillover effects are serious enough financial crisis may emerge with potential damage to the real economy of jobs and production of goods and services the line between risk taking that spurs innovation and efficiency and excessive risk that threatens stability is never easy to discern making the distinction however is key responsibility of congress private markets and government agencies exercise risk judgement daytoday but congress decides which markets are to be regulated and sets the parameters within which the regulators operate this report sets out framework for considering the issue of financial risk and its regulation first basic concepts and the state of the art in private risk management are discussed then scenarios for financial crises that may require government intervention are explored the next section deals with the development and the shortcomings of tools available to regulators to prevent or cope with crises the report ends with an analysis of current trends in financial markets and their implications for risk oversight definitions financial risk is measure of the variance of return on investment in general the higher the potential return the greater is the probability of loss financial risk is subset of economic risk the latter may be defined as the unpredictability of the outcome of decisions regarding the production of goods and services in the real economy while the former reflects variations in the prices of contracts and instruments that represent claims on goods and serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs2 1 this intellectual project which has involved economists physicists statisticians gamblers psychologists mathematicians and traders as well as finance professors is recounted in continuedeconomic growth depends on risky investment in new productive facilities financial risk taking is necessary to supply innovators and entrepreneurs as well as establis hed firms with capital all financial choices are risky not just those that involve new and untrie d ventures healthy capitalist economy requires creative destruction the status quo must be constantly undermined the replacement of the obsolete upon which gains in general welfare depend is accomplished by risk taking losses are certain to accompany risk taking however while losses are painful to those directly affected they do not ordinarily interfere with the progress of the financial system and the economy fear of loss is what prevents excessive risk taking that would result in the wasteful allocation of scarce resources and also provides the incentive for risk takers to monitor their choices carefully there are four types of financial risk market risk which stems from fluctuations in financial variables such as interest rates or in the prices of financial assets credit risk or the possibility that borrowers may default on their obligation to repay debt liquidity risk or the possibility that assets may not be readily convertible into cash except perhaps at price too low to cover liabilities and operational risk term not precisely defined but which includes the possibility that risk management controls may break down and leave one exposed to unexpected losses in the markets these types of risk are often closely intertwined any of them may result in sudden and unexpected losses to financial market participants systemic risk defined more fully below is not distinct type of risk but occurs when losses stemming from one or several of the four types of risk have repercussions beyond the firm or individual directly involved systemic risk as the term is generally used is one that can cause not just widespread disruption of financial markets but harm to the real economy as well advances in risk management individuals and firms activ in financial markets have strong incentives to monitor the risks they take excessive risk taking may lead to ruin excessive caution may have opportunity costs in the form of lost income the need to measure risk has driven many of the most notable advances in financial theory and practice over the past halfcentury1 sophisticated mathematical and statistical techniques have beenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs3 1 continued bernstein peter l against the gods the remarkable story of risk new york john wiley 1996 383 pdeveloped to gauge the probabilities of gain or loss in individual financial assets or in complex portfolios of assets one believes that present techniques for measuring risk are the best that can be devised theoretical and applied research continues measure of progress however is that small investor with personal computer can now perform more rigorous risk analysis based on greater amounts of data than was possible even few years ago for the professional traders at institutions like morgan stanley or citibank general survey of risk measurement tools is beyond the scope of this report however to give sense of the field two key features of the current state of the art are discussed briefly below value at risk valueatrisk var analysis has become nearly universal at financial institutions over the past six years the var calculation measures the probable distribution of profits or losses producing single dollar figure for the maximum amount that portfolio should experience over given time period the calculation can be adjusted to produce various confidence levels the standard is the 95 level which means that in 95 of time periods of the specified length losses will not exceed the var figure the power of var is that it measures market risk across firms entire portfolio the var figure provides basis for decisions about how much capital firm should set aside to cover possible losses or about making adjustments to firms portfolio to conform with its risk tolerance var measures only market risk but its popularity is partly result of concerns about operational risk as the variety and complexity of financial instruments have increased and as more and more firms including nonfinancial companies have put significant resources at risk in trading markets the importance of internal controls on risk taking has been highlighted regulators as well as shareholders and directors insist that senior management be aware of the risks implied by firms portfolio matter how complex or innovative its trading departments strategies may be several firms have lost billions or have failed because of rogue traders whose transactions were either not authorized or not understood the var figure as comprehensive measure of market risk is useful tool for managers and regulators who have neither the time nor the expertise to evaluate the risk of every single transaction or investment position derivatives in addition to techniques for measuring risk markets have over the past few decades developed new financial contracts to control financial risk derivative instruments whose value is based on derived from the price of some other financial asset can be used to modify the risk of holding many financial assets for example the owner of portfolio of fixed interest bonds which will lose value ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs4 2 with an interest rate swap the bank would agree to pay swap dealer fixed interest rate the amount it will receive from its german customer and to receive from the swap dealer floating rate pegged to libor or some other interest rate benchmark if interest rates rise income from the swap rises notice that the borrower continues to pay fixed interest the swapping of fixed for floating rates takes place in the derivatives market 3 currency swap consists of the two counterparties in this case the bank and swap dealer agreeing to exchange currencies at fixed rate over certain term if in the example the dollar rises relative to the euro the bank is unharmed because it continues to receive from the swap dealer fixed number of dollars for the fixed number of euros it receives from the borrowercurrent interest rates rise may purchase derivatives that will gain value if rates do go up drop in the price of bonds will be offset by rise in the value of the derivatives the market risk of holding bonds is thereby transferred or hedged derivatives now traded in the market offer protection against changes in currency exchange rates and the prices of stocks and commodities as well as interest rates the value of such contracts now in force is in the trillions of dollars relatively new form of derivative offers protection against credit risk credit swaps are form of default insurance the buyer is compensated if borrower defaults on loan or bond or if the borrowers credit rating is downgraded the availability of derivatives lets firms choose the risks they wish to bear often single transaction carries many risks for instance if an american bank makes fixedrate loan denominated in euros to german firm the bank faces three distinct risks first interest rates may rise making the loan less profitable because the rate is fixed than loans it could make at the new rate second the dollareuro exchange rate may change if the dollars value rises relative to the euro the income stream from the loan will be worth less in dollar terms third the borrower may default swaps allow the bank to hedge any or all of these risks an interest rate swap will allow the bank to receive floating rate interest payments2 currency swap allows it to fix the exchange rate over the term of the loan3 and finally it can use credit swap to hedge the risk of default derivatives markets do not reduce the total amount of risk in the financial system they merely permit it to be reallocated risk that is hedged does not disappear it must be assumed by someone else often speculator seeking to profit by forecasting trends in the financial variables that underlie deriv ative instruments in the aggregate derivatives ought to increase the efficiency of the financial system by allowing market participants to specialize in the risks that they best understand summary in summary the past several decades have seen advances in risk measurement and risk management tools to the extent that they can quantify and control financial risk firms can avoid real economic costs if they can limit losses to tolerable levels they avoid financial distress and its accompanying costs if they can reduce volatility in the cash flows linked to their financial operations they eliminate noise from their accounting statements which may make them appear less risky to investors andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs5 4 index futures and options are derivatives contracts whose value is multiple of the underlying stock index figure eg the sp 500 times 500 these contracts allow speculators to play the market without actually owning stock while holders of stock portfolios may hedge market risk by purchasing contracts that will gain value as the underlying stock indexes fall 5 us securities and exchange commission division of market regulation the october 1987 market break washington sec february 1988 p xiiilenders and lower their cost of capital their return on financial investment may be higher if they can unbundle the various risks inherent in individual transactions and decide to bear some of those risks and hedge others they may gain flexibility in their financing arrangements us firms may find it advantageous to borrow in foreign markets and swap their repayment obligations into dollars for example the government role if private market participants have strong incentives to monitor the financial risks they assume and if the risk measurement tools available to them have become and continue to grow more sophisticated what is the need for government regulation it is an axiom of market economics that central planner can allocate capital that is weigh risks and rewards as efficiently as the invisible hand which is the collective judgement of millions of firms and investors with their own money at stake why then do central bankers and other regulators seek to impose limits on risktaking by financial institut ions why should we expect them to be any more successful in preserving the soundness of the financial system than the market itself there are several ways to justify government intervention in financial markets even if all individual market participants adopt rational risk strategies the result may be market instability at the aggregate level each member of an audience may be capable of running to the theater exit but if all do so at once there will be chaos in the mid1980s many large institutional investors in the stock market followed portfolio insurance strategy which directed them to sell stock index futures and options4 as stock prices declined the value of these derivatives contracts would rise if the market continued to fall the net effect of the strategy was supposed to be to put floor under the value of stock portfolio and limit the maximum possible loss the assumption was that the futures and options markets would always provide liquidity that is that they would be willing to assume the risk the portfolio insurers wished to avoid this was not the case in october 1987 as stock prices weakened the portfolio insurers orders overwhelmed the available liquidity in the derivatives markets and futures and options prices plunged unable to hedge their growing risk exposure many institutions dumped stocks and the market crashed according to the securities and exchange commission sec the widespread use of portfolio insurance accelerated and exacerbated the price drop on october 19 1987 when the dow jones industrial average fell 23 in single day5 in other words while all market participants have the incentive to limit their risk taking to prevent the loss of their own capital market participant has an incentive to limit its risktaking in order to reduce risks to the market as whole another wayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs6 6 this example is based on actual events in the recession of 199091 see crs report 93649 credit crunch monetary or regulatory problem by william jackson and gail makinento put this is that private risk taking has externalities losses that occur may not be borne entirely by the profitseeking risk takers but may also fall upon innocent bystanders in the economy for example if banks have large share of their assets in the form of loans to real estate developers and there is downturn in the property market loan losses will rise and the banks will have to build up capital reserves by curtailing new lending andor calling in existing loans the availability of credit to all firms not just developers will decline if enough banks are affected there will be an economywide contraction of lending reducing business investment and slowing economic growth6 other financia l events such as sudden volatility or disruption in securities or currency markets may also interrupt the smooth functioning of the financial system herd behavior is often observed in investors and financial institutions when widelyfollowed market trend unexpectedly reverses itself what appeared to be reasonable manageable and measurable risks are transformed into uncertainty in common usage risk and uncertainty are synonyms but in finance they are opposites risk can be measured uncertaint cannot investors know that risks can produce losses but when there is uncertainty they cannot estimate the probability of loss in market conditions dominated by uncertainty investors may become excessively riskaverse if enough seek to liquidate their risky assets or refuse to accept any new risk the result may be panicky overreaction which disrupts the process of financial intermediation whereupon in extreme cases the system will cease to funnel capital from suppliers to users and the real economy of jobs goods and services will feel the impact this sequence of events serious financial disruptions constricting the flow of funds to industries and entrepreneurs is called systemic risk it begins when single loss or series of losses triggers repercussions throughout the financial system the vast majority of financial losses or shocks do not become systemic crises the conditions under which widespread crisis develops and the pathways by which problems in one market are transmitted to others are unpredictable and often mysterious the key point however is that these conditions and transmittal mechanisms fall outside the scope of the risk management concerns of private firms and investors therefore it is up to regulators to be vigilant against the possibility that risk taking by private market participants even though it is subject to market discipline that enforces prudence through fear of loss may suddenly and unexpectedly become the source of systemic crisis the next two sections of this report consider various systemic risk scenarios and the tools that regulators have to prevent or cope with financial criseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs7 7 several thrift institutions experienced runs during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s as depositors feared not the loss of their savings but the prospect of having their funds frozen for several months as the institution was reorganized or closed 8 see crs report rl30272 global financial turmoil the imf and the new financial architecture by dick nanto 9 financial stability forum report of the working group on highly leveraged institutions april 5 2000 p 144 the financial stability forum is an international group of central bank regulators meeting under the auspices of the bank for international settlements the central bankers central banksystemic risk scenarios contagionfalling dominoes the classic case of systemic risk is the bank run in the absence of deposit insurance it is reasonable for customers to withdraw their money when the bank is in difficulty or even rumored to be however if all depositors do this the bank will fail because depositors funds are not held in the vault but are lent to businesses and individuals thus there is premium on being first in the withdrawal line if one bank fails otherwise sound neighboring banks may face runs if their customers adopt better safe than sorry attitude individually rational but collectively disastrous bank runs are contagious problem in single institution can spread quickly to others the phenomenon of the bank run was largely but not entirely7 eliminated by deposit insurance established in the united states in the 1930s financial contagion may take other forms however during the asian financial crisis of 199798 the domino theory provided an apt description of events the crisis began in thailand and then jumped to halfadozen other countries in the region where macroeconomic conditions and government policies were significantly different8 similar pattern was observed in europe in the early 1990s when several countries in sequence were forced to abandon their excha nge rate targets and devalue their currencies after coming under intense speculative pressure in the foreign exchange market again there were similar financial episodes in countries as diverse as great britain and greece according to the financial stability forum international liquidity crises can emerge as the international analog to the domestic bank run9 many economists argue that the focus on contagion is misplaced or exaggerated that financial crisis is generally symptom of some underlying imbalance in the macro economy or misguided economic policy such as in the examples cited above fixed exchange rate number of developments in financial markets in addition to the crises noted above however make it impossible for regulators to ignore the possibility of contagion what is generally called the globalization of markets consists of several factors including the following communications and computer links make it practical for large traders to effect transactions in all major markets around the worldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs8 10 examples of such pools are hedge funds unregulated mutual funds and the proprietary trading operations of large commercial and investment banks 11 see crs report 97992 hong kongs financial crisis and the us market by mark jickling 12 it has been observed that price movements in international stock markets have become more closely correlated see highly contagious economist march 24 2001 p 83news that affects prices is instantly available worldwide major securities derivatives and currency markets trade on 24hour basis legal and regulatory barriers to crossborder trading and capital movements have been relaxed or eliminated and there exist large pools of speculative capital hot money that can shift rapidly from market to market often with little or regulatory oversight10 the result is that financial events have echoes around the world which often seem to ignore fundamental economic conditions for example the 554point drop in the dow jones industrial average recorded on october 27 1997 was attributed to hong kongs financial crisis even though the us economy and stock market were both in the midst of long booms and ushong kong trade and us positions in hong kongs financial markets were both extremely modest in proportion to the us economy11 rather than seek an explanation for this sudden market volatility based on fundamentals it seems more plausible to say that investors got whiff of panic other markets around the world also fell sharply12 the incre asing linkages among world markets mean that national financial systems and their regulators have to contend with random shoc ks generated elsewhere of course most such shocks do not cause financial crises in the 1997 hong kong episode the dow had record gain the next day but these shortlived disruptions do have the potential to trigger systemic problems if they expose underlying imbalances in finan cial markets that regulators and market participants have not recognized or addressed hence this form of financial contagion may be result of the breakdown of the relative insulation in which national markets used to operate too big to fail variation on the domino theory is the concern that failure of single large financial firm could damage others both directly by defaulting on uninsured obligations and indirectly by creating uncertainty about the financial condition of other institutions thought to have similar portfolios hence it is commonly assumed that regulators stand ready to bail out certain key institutions that are deemed too big to fail the us financial system has proved robust in cases of large financial failures in the past few decades systemic problems failed to appear after the failures of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs9 13 the ltcm rescue did not involve government funds rather the fed persuaded 14 of the hedge funds creditors to buy out the existing management and owners some view it as remarkable that these creditors who had the most to lose did not act themselves to prevent default by some accounts they were making shortterm profits off the funds distress by selling in advance of ltcms attempts to liquidate its portfolio frontrunning and it was left to the fed to consider the potential systemic risk and intervene 14 portfolio that is financed almost entirely with borrowed money 15 the major otc contracts are swaps and options this unregulated market contrasts to the regulated futures exchanges which also trade instruments that gain or lose value as an underlying price or rate changes and offer the same risk management possibilitiespenn central railroad which some predicted would destroy the commercial paper market the investment bank drexel burnham lambert which dominated the junk bond market and continental illinois at one time the second largest commercial bank in the united states the potential for disruptions stemming from single institution in difficulty remains however as was demonstrated in 1998 by the case of the hedge fund long term capital management ltcm ltcm was saved from collapse by the federal reserve bank of new york because of the systemic risk implications of default13 the nature of the systemic threat posed by ltcm remains unclear because details of the hedge funds portfolio were never made public even after the regulatory intervention however it is generally known that ltcm had highlyleveraged bond portfolio14 worth about 100 billion and derivatives portfolio of about 12 trillion in notional value liquidating bond portfolio of that size might have depressed markets or caused them to seize up international bond markets were already under stress because of the asian crises and the russian governments default on its debt the consequences of default on ltcms derivatives obligations are harder to assess because of the existence of large unregulated market about which government agencies have little timely information unregulated overthecounter otc derivatives15 make up huge market in instruments that are linked to the prices of various economic variables principally interest rates and currencies customers for these instruments include thousands of financial institutions corporations institutional investors and units of government that seek to avoid financial risk or speculate on price changes at the dealer level however the otc derivatives market is dominated by handful of large firms two dozen american european and japanese commercial and investment banks account for about 95 of all contracts these dealer firms trade heavily with each other and operate on global scale the failure of major otc dealer could have unpredictable consequences this may have been one of the considerations of the federal reserve when it decided to prevent the collapse of ltcm other financial markets are dominated by few institutions credit risk exposure in the home mortgage market for

modernization legislation in the 106th congress the grammleachbliley act pl 106102 opened the way to further consolidation among financial firms as barriers to affiliation among banks brokers and insurers were removed the result may be the creation of increasingly large and complex financial institutions while regional and product diversification may reduce risk in large institution there is also the opposite possibility recent group of ten study suggests that if such an institution became seriously distressed consolidation and any attendant complexity might increase the chance that winding down the organization would be difficult or disorderly16 irrational exuberance and asset bubbles in the wake of the recent asian crisis failure of single institution is less often put forward as model for systemic risk than situation in which many institutions and investors make the same mistake at the same time before 1997 the conventional wisdom was that the asian tigers could continue to grow at annual rates of above 10 indefinitely this belief was current not just among private lenders avid for profits but was supported tacitly or explicitly by the actions of government regula tors and international financial organizations like the international monetary fund imf lending to asian businesses appeared much less risky than it was and asian banks took out foreign currency loans from foreign institutions to support domestic credit expansion when trouble came the affected countries faced simultaneous crises in banking and foreign exchange markets overwhelming their financial systems and triggering drops in real economic output of the magnitude of the great depression in the united states the recent performance of technology stocks on the nasdaq market17 made the concept of an asset bubble familiar bubble forms when investors become convinced that asset values far above historical norms are now the standard historical analyses that suggest that current prices are too high and not likely to be sustained carry little weight when the market believes that new era has arrived and that the old economic yardsticks are longer useful an amplifying phenomenon is the greater fool theory even investors who accept that prices must fall eventually may be swept into the buying mania on the assumption that the rising trend will continue for some time and that someone else will pay even more than they did trends are further reinforced by many investors convictions that they will be able to get out of the market before the bubble bursts in fact few dohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs11 18 the argument that follows is based upon crockett andrew monetary policy and financial stability lecture before the hong kong monetary authority february 13 2001in markets for physical goods the law of supply and demand acts as restraint upon the formation of bubbles18 if the supply of good increases for whatever reason the price will fall and producers profits will drop leading some to curtail investment or leave the market eventually equilibrium will be restored in financial markets this kind of builtin stabilizing effect is absent if there is an expansion of credit the price that falls is the interest rate lower interest rates push up the value of assets such as stocks and make the balance sheets of both lenders and borrowers appear less risky higherpriced assets which can serve as collateral and more robust balance sheets both encourage further expansion in credit growth this cycle does not have to end in financial crisis but the tendency is to create imbalances in the system as market participants collectively underestima risk the asian crisis was an example of unrealistic expectations in credit markets coinciding with exchange rate difficulties with disastrous results the creation of asset bubbles is recurring feature of financial markets why do investors with the lessons of history before them continue to drive asset prices above the level justified by fundamental economic conditions the problem is that fundamental value cannot be determined with any certainty there is financial recordin g angel to be consulted only the markets judgement which reflects the opinions of firms and investors who base their decisions in large part on what they believe others views to be even if we assume that market prices must eventually return to fundam ental values timing is crucial consider alan greenspans famous remarks about irrational exuberance in the stock market in late 1996 in retrospect he may have been right but investors who heeded his warning and there were some and sold the market short would have been crushed during the next three years as the market registered annual gains of over 20 it is difficult for regulators less than investors to judge whether bubble is underway or when it will burst regulatory tools against financial instability regulators efforts to preserve financial stability fall into two categories the preventive and the reactive private risk taking is monitored and in some cases limited to reduce the possibil ity of systemic disturbances and when crisis does develop regulators must take quick action to minimize the damage prevention the traditional focus of laws and regulations designed to promote financial stability has been the risk profile of the individual firm more recently regulators have turned their attention to systemwide risk that is to the correlation of risks among many firms but risk supervision at the firm level remains the most important element in the prevention of financial crisishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs12 19 thus for example the prospectus for highyield junk bond usually contains language to the effect that there is foreseeable way the issuing corporation can meet the interest payments on the bond let alone repay the principal there is huge market for such bondsin the united states how regulators approach the risk taking activities of firms depends on the type of firm there are two basic forms of supervision risk disclosure and direct regulation of risk taking disclosure requirements contained in the securities laws apply to all firms that sell stocks or bonds to the public these publicly traded companies must register with the securities and exchange commission sec and must file detailed financial statements which are made public with this information the market can compare the riskiness of investment in various firms or industry sectors firms whose risk taking appears to be prudent or wellmanaged will generally have access to capital at lower rates the sec itself however does not place any restrictions on risk taking amount of risk is excessive from legal and regulatory viewpoint as long as it is fully disclosed19 bank regulation starts from different premise since the government insures bank deposits regulators do not rely solely on market discipline to enforce prudence in bank risk taking if bank examiners conclude that an insured institutions balance sheet is too risky under the banking laws it is engaged in unsafe or unsound banking practices and regulators have wide range of sanctions available they can intervene directly in the banks business decisions and require it to change its lending practices or otherwise adjust its portfolio other financial institutions subject to direct regulation of risk taking include insurance companies regulated by the states and pension funds regulated by the department of labor under erisa the employee retirement income security act both insurers and pension funds are subject to various forms of prudential regulation they may be barred from engaging in certain transactions or from holding certain types of assets the basel accords in 1988 the bank for international settlements bis established an international capital standard which requires banks to set aside percentage of their outstanding loans and other risky assets to provide cushion against unexpected losses under the bis standard known as the basel accord banks must maintain capital equal to at least 8 of their riskweighted assets to determine this figure different classes of assets are assigned different risk weights the riskier an asset the more capital is required in the early 1990s an unsuccessful attempt was made to extend the basel capital standard to securities firms however the sec has net capital rule that requires us stockbrokers doing business with the public to maintain capital cushion the amount of which is also calculated according to risk factors assigned to different types of assets capital requirements are an effective way to lessen the risk of bank failure but they are costly they reduce the amount of money to be loaned which is the samehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs13 20 for example if half portfolio consists of instruments that gain value as interest rates rise while the other half loses value when rates go up the portfolio may be market neutral or very lowrisk even though the instruments themselves may be extremely volatile 21 for general discussion of these proposals see meyer laurence h the new basel capital proposal remarks to the washington conference of the institute of international bankers march 5 2001as saying that they raise the cost of borrowing it is useful to have capital cushion against failure when bank or the financial system is in difficult conditions but to sound bank in strong macroeconomic environment setting aside capital is drag on business investment however it is impractical to have capital standard that requires capital to be set aside only when an institution is distres sed the act of compliance would make the institutions problems worse to be effective capital standard must apply in good times as well as bad but this implies tradeoff reducing vulnerability to failure also means limiting opportunities for profit and growth capital requirements impose other costs they affect and may distort portfolio decisions the basel accord which sorts millions of uniquely risky financial instruments into few risk classes is by necessity blunt instrument in the real world the riskiness of portfolio is determined not by the volatility of its individual components but by the correlation and interaction of risks across the entire portfolio20 feedback from capital standards to investment behavior takes several forms the gap between the risk weightings and net portfolio risk encourages banks to structure their portfolios to reduce capital charges the capital standards by raising the cost of lending have caused disintermediation that is they encourage corporations to raise funds in the capital markets by issuing securities rather than by borrowing from banks they also encourage securitization the process by which banks sell off the loans they make after packaging them as bonds this allows them to reduce capital charges by moving the securitized loans off their balance sheets none of these effects is necessarily harmful per and they do not appear to increase systemic risk but most economists and regulators agree that the optimum regulatory regime is one that is neutral regarding portfolio decisions finally another weakness in regulation by capital standards should be apparent from the discussion of systemic risk above capital standards limit risk taking by individual institutions but system ic risks are more likely to be caused by collective misperceptions of risk by many institutions and their regulator s the asian crisis when widelyhel d risk perceptions changed suddenly and dramatically led to reevaluation of the basel accord in january 2001 the bis issued revised accord for comment the proposed basel standards which emphasize systemic rather than individual institution risk have three parts or pillars the three pillars of the new basel accord21 the first pillar is the 8 capital standard the overall capital requirement is unchanged but the system of riskweightings will become more sophisticated usinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs14 22 it could be argued that the bulk of regulation of banking and securities markets in the united states was enacted primarily to prevent recurrence of the great depressionmore risk classes and making greater distinctions among assets in particular type in order that capital charges may be more closely aligned with the true riskiness of portfolio capital requirements will also be linked to external credit ratings of an institutions debt securities where available the second pillar calls for greater supervisory emphasis on the assessment of banks internal risk controls this proposal represents recognition of the progress made in private risk measurem ent techniques such as var but is also call for improvements in those techniques the second pillar will also encourage the use of stress testing or subjecting portfolio to range of worstcase scenarios var analysis asks given past volatility what is the maximum loss we can expect over specified time span stress test on the other hand asks how much could we lose if the historical price assumptions built into the var model fail and if current valuations suddenly change the third pillar calls for greater public disclosure of banks financial condition and portfolio choices move towards greater reliance on market discipline or sec type regulation traditionally the results of bank examinations have been treated as confidential proprietary data making some of this information public will permit other market participants to judge more accurately the risks of doing business with particular bank the common thrust of the new basel proposals is towards greater reliance on market discipline reaction there is fairly strong consensus among economists and central bankers that if financial crisis does occur in spite of all attempts at prevention the tools and policy options available to regulators are limited likely to be ineffective or counterproductive and that steps taken to stabilize the financial system may worsen the macroeconomic situation since the asian crisis regulators tend to hold pessimistic view of themselves as generals preparing to fight the last war there is reliable blueprint for crisis management because financial trouble is likely to strike from the unexpected quarter neverthe less taking action to bring financial crises to quick end and to minimize the concomitant damage to the real economy is one of the principal duties of financial regulators22 the difficulties in planning or choosing the right action stem from theoretical conflict almost paradox actions that must be taken in crisis are often the opposite of what constitutes responsible financial regulation in normal times in general financial efficiency is best served by letting those who have mispriced risk suffer the resulting losses in crisis however when the stability of the entire system is in doubt the central bank may have choice but to act as the lender of last resort in this role it provides liquidity to enable market participants to meet theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs15 23 mcdonough william j the role of financial stability remarks at the xiii international frankfurt banking evening may 3 2001shortterm obligations this may well mean bailing out those who have taken excessive risks in search of high profits market discipline must be set aside in order to prevent either fallingdomi sequence of defaults or panic driven by uncertainty about the solvency of affected financial institutions ideally this form of intervention will be shortlived the panic will burn itself out and markets will return to normal this was the case during the stock market crash in october 1987 when the federal reserve was widely praised for announcing that it would supply liquidity and for urging banks not to withdraw credit from their customers in the securities industry however there is guarantee that future crises will follow this pattern if the financial system does not stabilize itself fairly quickly the lender of last resort itself faces potentially unlimited risk exposure second actions taken to deal with financial crisis may conflict with monetary policy with negative macroeconomic consequences in the asian crisis for instance the prescription for falling exchange rates was to drive up domestic interest rates which of course further depressed stock prices and worsened corporate balance sheets third and finally the major problem with interventi on to prevent widespread failure or panic is the creation of what is called moral hazard the concept of moral hazard is that if firms believe they will be rescued from their mistakes or that they are too big to fail they are likely to take greater risks than they would otherwise the costs of this excess risk taking are borne by the government rather than by the firm which nevertheless keeps any profits that may accrue the president of the federal reserve bank of new york recently spoke in favor of what he called principled intervention the essence of successful casebycase crisis management he said is the development of viable plans that link broader generally acceptable principles to the particulars of given situation to achieve this clearer and more transparent articulation of the public sectors objectives is necessary greater emphasis and clarity are needed as to the the purposes and limits of public intervention in this way all parties will be better placed to understand current developments and how the international community might react to future strains23 the problem is that moral hazard requires regulators to be somewhat vague and imprecise about what actions they are prepared to take in crisis risk takers cannot be assured beforehand that they will be rescued from their mistakes in their public postures regulators must appear to be much less willing to act as the lender of last resort than in fact they are and less willing than the market assumes them to be this imperative works against the clarity and certainty that could be useful in reducing panic in crisis if regulators could set out their actions in advance in transparent manner

fall the speculators would then profit from short positions in stocksother forms of crisis reaction are available to government regulators but these constitute such extreme intrusions into the workings of the free market that their use in the united states is seldom proposed or even discussed except dismissively in 1998 the malaysian government sought to stem the financial crisis by imposing currency controls foreign investors were prohibited from withdrawing their capital from the country and the exchange value of the ringgit which had plunged in previous months was frozen in hong kong the monetary authority reacted to renewed speculation against the currency which it viewed as an attempt to drive down stock prices24 by purchasing about 10 of all outstanding shares in the market the conventional wisdom among us policymakers and economists was that the longterm costs of such interventions would outweigh the benefits foreign firms in particular would be deterred from investing or lending however both interventions appear to have been effective it is clear that there is still much to be learned about crisis management conclusions and look forward the tools availabl to government regulators to prevent financial crises from developing and to control those that do develop are imperfect and impose costs on the financial system to avoid these costs regulators would like to rely on market discipline to regulate private risk taking complete reliance on the market is unacceptable however given the historical tendency of financial market participants to become overexuberant to follow the herd to underestimate risk and at times to overcorrect for these mistakes when they become apparent the link between financial crisis and econ omic slowdowns though debated in particular instances is also part of the historical record thus systemic risk becomes subject of regulatory attention fundamental question not yet addressed in this report is how much time and resources risk managers in both the private and public sectors should devote to preparing for events that have very low probability of ever occurring ones answer depends on ones views of the robustness and selfstabilizing capacity of the financial system many economists argue that concerns about systemic risk which have certainly grown since the crises of 199798 are overstated the more productive course for government policymakers in this view is to tend to macroeconomic policy stable prices predictable fiscal and monetary policies and an appropriate exchange rate regime will do more to promote financial stability than any amount of tinkering with private risk decisions however regulators today are more likely to be swayed by the observation that while price stability and other macroeconomic conditions have generally improved in most countries since 1980 financial crises have become more common there are number of reasons why this should be sohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31045crs17 25 stulz rene why risk management is not rocket science financial times june 27 2000 special supplement p 7globalization of markets as discuss ed on page 7 above with its adjunct features instantaneous electronic communication and deregulation consolidation of financial institutions which may lead to the establishment of firms of such complexity and size that distress in one of them would almost automatically have systemic implications and the introduct ion of new trading markets such as credit swaps that are unregulated and have the potential for concentrating risk exposures in single firms or market sectors or redistributing risk in ways that are invisible to regulators and market participants alike striking improvements in risk measurement and management have been made by private firms and to lesser degree government regula tors in recent years yet uncertainty remains the financial markets find themselves in position analogous to physicists who find that certain subatomic phenomena cannot be measured because the act of observation changes those phenomena if there is corresponding principle in human affairs it certainly applies to financial risk when risk can be measured in new way that information becomes the basis for new trading strategies when risky investm ent strategies change markets respond to information and to regulatory stimuli differently the fact is that risk is inherent in financial markets as long as we cannot see the future the limits are contained in the observation that risk management is not rocket science it cannot be since the past does not repeat itself on sufficiently reliable basis25
