for congressional consideration of measures to acquire or dispose of particular land and to establish new authorities or amend or terminate existing ones congress faces questions on the adequacy of existing authorities the extent and location of their use the amount of land in federal ownership overall and the sources and adequacy of funds for land acquisition among other issues the nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities of the federal land management agencies varies in general the acquisition authorities are signed to allow the four agencies to bring into federal ownership lands that many believe would benefit from federal management disposal authorities generally are designed to allow agencies to convey land that is longer needed for federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose many of the authorities specify particular circumstances where they can be used such as the conveyance of forest service land for educational purposes the extent to which the agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land differs considerably the bureau of land management has broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals under the federal land policy and management act of 1976 the agency has other authorities for disposing of land including two laws that allow the agency to retain the proceeds for subsequent land acquisition among other purposes by contrast the national park service has general authority to acquire or dispose of land the authorities for the forest service and the fish and wildlife service are somewhere in between the forest service has authority to acquire lands only within the boundaries of national forest the agency has various authorities to dispose of land but they are relatively constrained very specific authorities such as for townsites and infrequently used the fish and wildlife service has various authorities to acquire lands but general authority to dispose of its lands the agency frequently uses acquisition authority under the migratory bird treaty act of 1929 because of the availability of funding through the migratory bird conservation fund congress also enacts legislation to acquire or dispose of lands and in some cases the president has such authority with regard to the four agencies covered here httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34273g8g142g141g142g155g138g149g561g14g138g151g141

of federal lands and the sources and adequacy of land acquisition funds among other issues the various acquisition and disposal authorities were provided by congress through various laws enacted over time the extent to which the agencies have authority to acquire and dispose of land and the nature of the authorities vary considerably some of the agencies have relatively broad authority to acquire andor dispose of land most notably the blm has broad authority for both acquisitions and disposals other agencies have general authority to acquire or dispose of land as is the case for the nps the authorities for the fs and fws are somewhere in between the fs has authority to acquire lands only within the boundaries of national forest the agency has various authorities to dispose of land but they are relatively constrained and infrequently used the fws has various authorities to acquire lands but general authority to dispose of its lands the acquisition authorities differ as to the circumstances where they apply and the disposal authorities likewise differ as to their purposes thus the particular authority at issue should be consulted where specific acquisition or disposal is contemplated most generally the acquisition authorities are designed to allow federal agencies to acquire lands that could be viewed as benefitting from federal management among other circumstances acquisition might be authorized to bring inholdings or lands adjacent to federal lands into federal ownership to improve or simplify management of federal lands acquisitions also might be authorized to conserve species protect natural and cultural resources and increase opportunities for recreation the disposal authorities generally are designed to allow federal agencies to dispose of land that is longer required for federal purpose or that might be chiefly valuable for another purpose for instance disposal might be authorized for lands that are inefficient to manage other reasons for disposals might include to allow lands to be used for agriculture community development mineral extraction and educational purposes agencies also acquire and dispose of federal land in exchanges exchanges are not discussed separately in this report as often the authorities to acquire and dispose of lands also apply to land exchanges however there are provisions of law particularly applicable to exchanges the exchange authorities for the nps and fws are relatively narrow the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma as amende d 43 usc 17011781 et provides 1 us general services

authority and is the main authority governing exchanges by the blm and usfs2 the nature of the acquisition and disposal authorities covered in this report and the extent and circumstances of their use by the agencies form the backdrop for congressional consideration of legislation pertaining to land acquisition and disposal recent congresses have considered measures to provide agencies with additional acquisition or disposal authorities or to revise such authorities with regard to additiona l authorities for instance the 106 th congress enacted legislation to allow the secretary of agriculture to dispose of national forest system lands for educational purposes title ii of pl 106577 with respect to amendment of existing authorities for example the 108th congress expanded the purposes for which the proceeds of land sales under the southern nevada public land management act snplma pl 105263 could be used3 congress also addresses acquisition and disposal policy in the context of deliberations on the role and goals of the federal government in owning and managing land generally for instance in the 109th congress hearings were held on legislation requiring disposal of federal land before federal acquisition in states where 25 or more of the land is already in federal ownership in addition congress frequently considers legislation authorizing and governing the acquisition or disposal of specific land the 109th congress for instance directed the conveyance of blm land to the city of eugene or to establish wildlife viewing area and build an environmental education center pl 109457 congress may consider such legislation to provide an agency with acquisition or disposal authority because it is lacking in other cases congress directs particular acquisition or disposal to facilitate the action for instance the legislation may seek to direct an acquisition based on congresss assessment of public needs and priorities it may expedite the process for acquiring parcel of land such as by limiting the assessments and evaluations that would ordinarily be required under law the legislation also might authorize actions not ordinarily permitted such as the conveyance of land at cost rather than at fair market value the 110 th congress is faced with varied issues related to federal land acquisition and disposal they include the adequacy of existing authorities for managing the federal estate and whether new authorities or changes to existing ones might be desirable the public and members of congress are interested in agencies disposal and acquisition efforts and especially in the location of the transactions congress continues to consider bills to direct numerous specific acquisitions and disposals further the amount of land in federal ownership overall remains controversial many western citizens and members of congress are concerned about what they feel is excessive federal influence over their lives and economies and contend that the federal government should divest itself of many lands see table 1 at the end of this report others support the policy of retaining lands in federal ownership and sometimes advocate adding more lands that they believe warrant protection 4 another set of issues pertains to the sources and adequacy of funds for land acquisition the principal financing mechanism for federal land acquisition is annual appropriations under the 2 see crs report rs21967 land exchanges bureau of land management process and issues by carol hardy vincent 3 section 342 of pl 108108 directed snplma

conservation fund lwcf5 lwcf is credited with 900 million annually from designated sources congress determines the level of appropriations each year total appropriations for land acquisition and the amount provided to each of the federal land management agencies have varied substantially since the origin of the program more than 40 years ago appropriations for federal land acquisition more than tripled during the five fiscal years ending in fy2001 rising to 4534 million but have declined steadily since then to 1130 million in fy2007 additional sources of funding are available for some agencies or under certain authorities the fws has large additional source of funds for land acquisition through the migratory bird conservation fund as discussed below the blm has authorities allowing the agency to keep the proceeds of land sales and use them for subsequent acquisitions and other purposes as detailed below the application of these authorities including the uses of the proceeds has been of interest to congress whether similar authorities might be desirable for other agencies or under other circumstances also might be of interest

management agencies have different authorities for acquiring lands in general all four agencies are authorized to accept land as gifts and bequests in addition each is generally authorized to use eminent domain taking private property through condemnation for public usewhile compensating the landowner however this practice is controversial and it is rarely used by the land management agencies

not have general authority to acquire lands to establish units of the national park system 6 rather most units have been created by congress although the president also may establish one type of unitnational monuments congress often first enacts law requiring the nps to evaluate an area for possible addition to the system an act of congress creating park unit typically identifies the boundaries and authorizes the nps to acquire the nonfederal lands within those boundaries the secretary of the interior is authorized to make boundary adjustments for proper preservation protection interpretation or management and to acquire the nonfederal lands within the adjusted boundary under the provisions and conditions of 16 usc 460 l9c the president has authority to create national

recent proclamations creating national monuments with nonfederal land within the boundaries typically have specified that these lands will become part of the monument upon acquisition by the united states under law the secretary of the interior and the nps have responsibilities related to the potential acquisition of lands for the national park system for instance the secretary is directed to investigate study and continually monitor the welfare of areas that could potentially be added to the system and to report to congress on possible additions 16 usc 1a5 the general management plan for each unit is to include indications of potential modifications to the external boundaries of the unit and the reasons therefor 1a7 the secretary is to prepare systematic and comprehensive review of certain aspects of the national park system in report to congress at least every three years 1a9 this report is to include comprehensive listing of all authorized but unacquired lands within the exterior boundaries of each unit 1a11a and priority listing of all such unacquired parcels 1a11b g23g495g21g495g561g8g152g155g142g156g157g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g561 the secretary of agriculture has various authorities to acquire lands for the national forest system nfs although the lands must be within the proclaimed boundaries of national forest many national forests contain substantial acreages of nonfederal lands within their proclaimed boundaries particularly in the east where forests were established after extensive settlement western national forests average about 10 nonfederal land within their boundaries while the national forests in the eastern and southern regions average about 45 nonfederal land within their boundaries the usfs has regulatory authority over the uses of nonfederal lands within the boundaries of the national forests each national forest was originally created by presidential proclamation but the presidents authority to proclaim new forests and modify previous proclamations was terminated in 1976 today new national forests can be created only by an act of congress and national forest boundaries can be modified only by an act of congress the first and broadest usfs land acquisition authority was provided in the weeks law of 1911 16 usc 515 the secretary is hereby authorized and direct ed to examine locate and purchase such forested cutover or denuded lands within the watersheds of navigable streams as in his judgment may be necessary to the regulation of the flow of navigable streams or for the production of timber originally the acquisitions were to be approved by national forest reservation commission but the commission was terminated in 17 of the national forest management act of 1976 nfma 16 usc 513518 other laws authorize land acquisition for the national forests typically in specific areas or for specific purposes7 for example 205 of flpma authorizes the acquisition of access corridors to national forests across nonfederal lands 43 usc 1715a 7 the 1937 bankheadjones farm tenant act 7 usc 10101012 authorized the secretary of agriculture to establish program of land conservation and land utilization for

conservation of migratory birds to the migratory bird conservation commission after consulting with the relevant go vernor or state agency and appropriate local government officials 715c the secretary may then purchase or rent areas approved by the commission 715d1 and acquire any area or interest therein 715d2 the mbta is frequentlyused authority because of the availability of funding through the migratory bird conservation fund mbcf the mbcf is supported from three sources the sale of hunting and conservation stamps commonly k nown as duck stamps import duties on arms and ammunition and portion of certain refuge entrance fees mbcf funds are permanently appropriated to the extent of receipts and after paying certain administrative costs may be used for the location ascertainment and acquisition of suitable areas for migratory bird refuges 718db however the acquisition must be approve d by the governor of the state or appropriate state agency 715k5 the predictability of funding and permanent authority for use make the mbcf and thus the mbta particularly important for fws land acquisition other laws provide general authority to expand the nwrs including the fish and wildlife coordination act of 1934 16 usc 661667a the fish and wildlife act of 1956 16 usc 742a et seq and the endangered species act of 1973 16 usc 15311544 further flpma authorizes the secretary of the interior to withdraw lands from the public domain for creating or adding to refuges which would be an interagency transfer withdrawals exceeding 5000 acres are subject to congressional approval 43 usc 1714c 8 in contrast to nps and fs land acquisition where the lands generally must be within the boundaries of established units the fws can acquire new lands to create new refuge under the general fws authorities cited above as well as under certain other laws some units have been created by specific acts of congress such as protection island nwr wa and bayou sauvage nwr units also can be created
