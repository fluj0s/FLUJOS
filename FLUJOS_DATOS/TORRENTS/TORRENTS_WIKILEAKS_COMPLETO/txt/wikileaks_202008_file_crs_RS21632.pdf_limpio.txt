imminent danger pay hostile fire or imminent danger pay hfidp is authorized by 37 usc 310 wh ich provides special pay for duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger although dod regulations distinguish between hostile fire pay and imminent danger pay they are both derived from the same statute and an individual can only collect hostile fire pay or imminent danger pay not bothhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21632crs2 1dod regulations make clear distinction between imminent danger pay idp and hostile fire pay hfp which is only implicit in the statute idp is provided to service

house have included provisions affecting hfidp and fsa in their respective versions of hr 1588 the n ational defense authorization act for fy2004 the senate version sets the monthly rate for hfidp at 225 per month and the monthly rate for fsa at 250 for all service members eligible for these forms of compensation effective october 1 20039the house version also effective october 1 2003 sets the

would receive the lower rates for these forms of compensation currently found in permanent law the special rate for hfidp and fsa for those serving in an oef or oif combat zone would expire on the date the president terminates the specified operation the department of defense ppropriations act for fy200411did not contain any legislative language regarding hfidp or fsa but the conference report that accompanied the bill contained language providing 128 million in funding for continuation of the higher rates of pay t he report language stated that the 128 million was provided for increases in family separation allowance and imminent danger payhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21632crs4 12hrept 108283 p 62 13the senate provisions are located in s 1689 section 306 there was house bill number at the time of this writing the description of its hfidp and fsa provisions was based on press release from the house appropriations committee entitled highlights of the chairmans mark of the iraq supplemental dated october 6 2003 14srept 108160 p 4 15the appeal stated the dod position as follows the department opposes both the house and senate provisions the house provision specifies that eligibility depends on assignment to duty in particular military operation inside the combat zone this restriction would nullify higher rates for personnel serving in direct support of t hose same operations but outside the combat zone such as diego garcia israel etc also specifying an increased rate solely for operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom would create an inequity for those who subsequently face imminent danger or the hardships of family separation in other contingencies the senate provision would make the current temporary rate increases permanent beginning in october 2003 but the department has not budgeted for these increases the department urges the conferees to exclude these pro visions department of defense department of defense appeal fy2004 defense authorization

committee report that accompanied the senate bill speci fically rejected the dod proposal discussed below14 the department of defenses position in july 2003 the department of defense sent an appeal to congress opposing the hfidp and fsa language in both the house and senate versions of the national defense authorization act on equity and budgetary grounds15newspaper accounts of dods position generated considerable criticism of the defense department16subsequently news release sent out by dod on august 14 seemed to indicate that the department approved of maintaining the higher hfidp and fsa rates for those serving in afghanistan and iraq17 but briefing that same day by david chu under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness indi cated that while dod remained opposed to the house and senate provisions the pentagon would ensure that total compensation for those deployed to iraq and afghanistan would not drop18dr chu explained that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21632crs5

for operation iraqi freedom oif operation enduring freedom oef and operation noble eage one september 2003 p 10 22the first sentence quoted refers to personnel in theater or in direct operational support while while the last sentence refers only to personnel serving in combat zone wit hout mentioning those serving in direct support however in lig ht of other statements made by dod officials it appears that dod wants to provide increased hdp to service members operating in direct support of combat zone see footnote 10 for dis cussion of combat zones associated with oef and oif 23for example those serving in bosnia are curren tly eligible for hfidp and are eligible for fsa if they have dependents those serving in south korea are not currently eligible for hfidp but are usually eligible for fsa if they have dependents because korea is frequently an unaccompanied tour in other words dependents are not authorized to move to the duty location at government expensedepartment had other statutory authorities such as hardship duty pay which could be used to maintain the total compensation of military personnel in afghanistan and iraq if the hfidp and fsa rates reverted back to their earlier rates of 150 and 100 per month respectively19subsequently president bush s ubmitted supplemental appropriations request to congress for ongoing ope rations in iraq and afghanistan20that request included proposed language that would susta in the hfidp rate at 225 per month and the fsa rate at 250 per month through december 31 2003 it also included proposed language that would increase the hdp rate from the current maximum of 300 per month to maximum of 600 per month beginning on january 1 2004 in the written justification accompanying this request dod explained that the estimate also includes funding for enhanced special pays including imminent danger pay idp family separation allowance fsa and hardship duty pay hdp for oif and oef deployed personne l in theater or in direct operational supportthe department intends to keep paying idp and fsa at these fy2003 rates increased rates through december 31 2003 beginning on january 1 2004 the departments plan is to begin paying an additional 225 per month in hdp to military personnel serving in oifoef in combat zone21 though the language is bit confusing as to the precise criteria for receiving the increased rate of hdp it appears that dod wa nts to provide it to those serving in combat zone or in direct support of combat zone associated with oef or oif22 implications of the dod proposal if implemented the dod proposal would h ave number of financial implications for service members first many service members who are currently receiving hfidp or fsa would see their total compensation drop as they are not serving in combat zone or in direct support of combat zone associated with oef or oif23on the other hand almost all of those serving in combat zone or in direct support of combat zonehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21632crs6 24the dod justification argues that this increas in pay for service members without dependents is fairer way of compensating oef and oif participants noting that the additional 225 per month being paid to members in combat should be in recognition of the risk that they all face not drawing any distinction as to their marital status or number of family dependents department of defense fy2004 supplemental request for operation iraqi freedom oif operation enduring freedom oef and operation noble eage one september 2003 p 10 25for example basic pay hardship duty pay hostile fireimminent danger pay etc there are several dozen distinct types of pay in the military compensation system although many of them are targeted at comparatively small subpopulations of the armed forces for example only certain aviators can qualify for aviation career incentive pay and only pharmacy officers can qualify for pharmacy officer pay 2626 usc 112 27while this combat zone taxexclusion benefit pplies only to federal income tax almost all states have provisions extending the benefit to their state income tax as well department of defense military compensation background papers 5th edition september 1996 832837 28according to the internal revenue service for 2002 the most an officer could earn taxfree each month was 553290 538290 the highest monthly enlisted pay plus 150 hostile fire or imminent danger pay the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of 2003 pl 10811 raised the imminent danger pay to 225 per month through september 2003 therefore the 2003 combat pay exclusion for officers is 595770 per month through september and 588270 per month for the remainder of the year more information on this topic is available at httpwwwirsgovnewsroomarticle0id10126200html 29for example medical officers and pilots ofte n receive comparatively large amounts of special or incentive pay in addition to their base payassociated with oef or oif would see their total compensation maintained or even increased specifically those currently receiving both hfidp and fsa would see their compensation from these two sources drop by 225 per month but would receive an additional 225 in hdp per month to offset that decrease those military personnel who have dependents and who therefore have not been receiving fsa would see their hfidp payment decrease by 75 per month but would see an increase of 225 per month increase in hdp net gain of 150 per month24 the only people serving in combat zone or in direct support of combat zone associated with oef or oif who would suffer an slight adverse financial impact under the dod proposal would be relatively sma ll group of officers who are both receiving fsa and have relatively high levels of total compensation this is due to the tax implications of reducing compensation via an allowance fsa and replacing it with pay hdp because allowances are not subject to federal income tax while the various types of pay25are all service members in iraq and afghanistan are serving in combat zone and are therefore eligible for the combat zone tax exclusion26but this exclusion is limited for some military officers for enlis ted personnel and warrant officers all compensation for active military service in combat zone is free of federal income tax27 for commissioned officers compensation is free of federal income tax up to themaximum amount of enlisted basic pay plus any imminent danger pay received just under 6000 per month at current pay rates 28this means that for the typical officer in paygrade o5 lieutenant colonel or c ommander or above and for lower ranking officers who receive large amount of incentive or specialty pay29replacing fsa with hdp means replacing nontaxable compe nsation with taxable compensation
