updated april 6 2006 lawrence kumins and robert bamberger specialists in energy policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress oil and gas disruption from hurricanes katrina and rita summary hurricanes katrina and rita shut down oil and gas production from the outer continental shelf in the gulf of mexico the source for 25 of us crude oil production and 20 of natural gas output katrina which made landfall on august 29 resulted in the shutdown of most crude oil and natural gas production in the gulf of mexico as well as great deal of refining capacity in louisiana and alabama 554000 barrels per day of which was still closed as of late october 2005 offshore oil and gas production was resuming when hurricane rita made landfall on september 24 and an additional 48 million barrels per day mbd of refining capacity in texas and nearby louisiana was closed combining the effects of both storms 13 mbd of refining about 8 of national capability is shut down reducing the supply of domestically refined fuels commensurately much of the refined product shortfall was made up by imports of refined products some of which were made available by strategic supplies released by international energy agency iea member nations on september 2 as part of the iea drawdown 30 million barrels of crude oil were made available from the us strategic petroleum reserve spr which holds only crude only 11 million barrels was sold from the spr in part because limited refinery capacity reduced the call on crude natural gas production from gulf of mexico and louisiana state lands has been recovering since the storms but the equivalent of about 3 of us consumption remains shutin because of production or transport problems unlike refined products which can be imported there is little extra available supply normal storage situation at the start of the heating season coupled with very warm winter saw spring 2006 arrive with surplus gas in storage and gas prices well below equivalent oil prices this report will be updated to reflect significant restoration of gas and oil production and related infrastructure as well as relevant

rita shut down oil and gas production from the outer continental shelf in the gulf of mexico the source for 25 of us crude oil production and 20 of natural gas output katrina which made landfall on august 29 resulted in the shutdown of most crude oil and natural gas production in the gulf of mexico as well as great deal of refining capacity in louisiana and alabama offshore oil and gas production was resuming when hurricane rita made landfall on september 24 and an additional 48 million barrels per day mbd of refining capacity in texas and nearby louisiana was closed the most profound impacts of the hurricanes were on refined product supply although natural gas supply to the us pipeline grid is also concern at one point about onethird of the nations refining capacity was closed virtually all have been restored although output at couple of units is still in the process of ramping up heroic recovery efforts at refineries and increased imports of refined products met warm heating seasons needs and kept gasoline supplies flowing without isolated runouts about 400000 bd of crude oil from the outer continental shelf ocs and louisiana state lands is currently shut in this is the equivalent of about 5 of total us petroleum demand imported crude has kept stocks at more than adequate levels refined product supplies were initially made up from the release of 30 million barrels of gasoline middle distillate and other products from the strategic reserves of member nations of the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd who are international energy agency iea members since those barrels arrived in early fall 2005 the world market private sector has provided the united states with an increased level of imports supply appears to have matched demand as prices fell through late 2005 and early 2006 number of crosscurrents bear on this situation including how fuel demand is affected by prices and when winter weather arrives and how cold it might be on the supply side of the relationship are factors which include the rate at which us refining recovers and the availability on world markets of commercial refined products in addition some waivers of gasoline specifications have been granted by the environmental protection agency epa aimed at making gasoline easier to supply crs2 with natural gas about 85 of the nations supply comes from domestic production there is very little opportunity to import replacement supply as of october nearly 10 of total nationwide consumption was shutin because of production problems in the federal offshore gulf of mexico or because of damage to critical infrastructure another 3 of nationwide supply from louisiana state lands is shutin despite reduced output gas was still being placed in storage the additions during the week ending october 14 were 75 billion cubic feet bcf the amount of gas already in storage was equivalent to the fiveyear average although it was slightly below yearearlier levels gas sold from storage is used to balance seasonal demand swings and not to replace catastrophic loss of production given that the current amount of shutin ocs and louisiana state lands gas is the equivalent of half the most recent weeks storage addition the perception of robust injection to storage should be adjusted accordingly despite the fact that supplies continue to flow wellhead prices have doubled since last summer issues for the onset of cold weather include timing and severity as with oil as well as demand destruction resulting from higher prices but if gulf of mexico production does not recover there is import safetyvalve and supplies could become tight and prices could spike in the immediate wake of katrina and rita much of the impacted area was without electric power but nearly all customers who had been without power in texas have had service restored in louisiana power outages are more widespread although many customers listed as being without power are unable to receive it because of damage to the premises hurricane effects on crude oil production imports and transportation nearly 16 mbd of crude oil the equivalent of 76 of us oil consumption was produced on the gulf of mexico federal offshore before the hurricanes struck production was virtually halted in the wake of both storms as production facilities were evacuated and wells were shut down the storms destroyed 111 production platforms and 52 were seriously damaged number of drilling rigs were destroyed which will limit future production from new wells yet to be completed oil production has begun to resume output has begun to rampup reaching 600000 bd on october 11 but 60 of gulf of mexico oil remains shut in and over 50 million barrels of oil output have been lost since katrinarelated shutdowns began on august 26 the amount of lost output continues to mount as about 1 mbd of capacity remains shutin between october 1 and october 7 oil output rose by 300000 bd an encouraging sign of restarting operations but full assessment of damage to facilities including underwater production platformwellhead connections and pipeline gathering systems has not been completed it may be too early to assess crs3 whether production is steadily coming back or if all the production that has come back was the easiest to restore while currently shutin output presents significant challenges at production platforms within transport infrastructure and at coastal processing facilities production can come back only as fast as pipelines and processing facilities return to service that said energy information administration eia administrator guy caruso has estimated that shutin production will continue being restored the amounts shut in will likely average 930000 bd in october 724000 bd in november and 517000 bd in december1 in addition to disrupted production the operation of two important longdistance crude oil pipelines were impeded capline which transports crude from louisiana to illinois was shut for several weeks it is now operating at 80 capacity this limited crude supply to number of refiners in the central part of the nation and the sun pipeline and terminal started limited operations in early october supplying number of texas and louisiana refineries some pipelines transporting refined products had service outages or throughput reductions as result of the hurricanes most notable was the colonial pipeline which transports fuels from the gulf northeastward ending in new york this is an important source of supply for consumers all along its route and its outage resulted in very high prices in places like maryland and washington dc which at one point had the highest gasoline prices in the nation colonial received full commercial electric power on october 13 full capacity is now available subject to availability of pipeline input gasoline prices in its service area are returning to parity with prices elsewhere about 25 mbd of crude oil imports including 09 mbd by way of the louisiana offshore port loop flow through stormdamaged ports in louisiana mississippi and alabama this constitutes more than 12 of petroleum consumption2 loop was operating at full capacity when it was shut down again as precautionary measure in anticipation of hurricane rita it is reportedly operating at 100 capacity having escaped more damage from rita other gulf coast ports through which oil imports flow have resumed operation except for port arthur which can accept barge traffic only during daylight hours the mississippi river is open with some restrictions refineries and product pipelines in the days after rita 56 mbd of refining capacity was shut nearly onethird of the nations total by midoctober most of this capacity was operating or in the startup process four facilities were closed in the wake of hurricane katrina one has restarted and full production is expected at the end of october electric power 1 eias winter energy outlook oct 12 2005 2 ibid crs4 has recently been restored to three other louisiana plants which sustained substantial damage and they are expected to be down for an extended period they have combined capacity of 554000 bd 3 an additional 722000 bd of capacity shuttered in the wake of rita remains off line leaving total of 13 mbd down as result of both hurricanes this represents nearly 8 of national capacity and presents potentially serious supply problems given the lack of any spare us refining capacity additionally the shutdown of over 5 mbd of capacity for virtually all of september has affected refined product stocks as seasonal demand starts to grow strategic petroleum reserves coordinated release by the us and iea on august 31 secretary of energy bodman announced that the bush administration was authorizing releases of strategic petroleum reserve spr crude oil seven refiners requested loans of crude oil totaling more than 13 million barrels the release of spr oil and the announcement on september 2 from the iea of coordinated drawdown of 30 million barrels of crude and 30 million barrels of refined products calmed markets by early in the week of september 5 the us spr holds crude oil only the netimporting iea member countries are required to hold at least 90 days of net imports and this obligation is met with combination of crude and refined products at the end of june 2005 these stocks amounted to 222 million barrels of products and 545 million barrels of crude two million barrels were to be released daily by the iea4 nearly all 30 million barrels of products have been released gasoline and heating oil imports are still in transit and continue to reach united states5 they are reflected in the gasoline import statistics reported each wednesday by eia citing falling us product demand iea executive director claude mandil told platts there is immediate issue right now but there is still lot of oil and products that will be missing in the balance we still need to carefully monitor the situation together with our american friends to see whether demand destruction is longlasting or not because there may be risks to supply in november and december 3 doe office of electricity delivery and energy reliability gulf coast hurricanes situation report 19 oct 21 2005 4 of that total 30 million barrels was to be crude oil from the us strategic petroleum reserve on sept 14 doe accepted bids on purchase of only 11 million barrels of the 30 million barrels that had been offered 5 platts oilgram price report iea sees need for additional emergency oil oct 7 2005 crs5 the most recent import statistics for the four weeks ending october146 show that refined product imports were about 14 mbd higher than yeartodate 2005 suggesting continued flow of this fuel as the ieas mandil points out it remains to be seen how us gasoline and distillate stocks hold up as the oil industry recovers from the hurricane damage loans of crude oil from the strategic petroleum reserve were granted to seven companies totaling roughly 132 million barrels7 on september 2 as part of the 60 million barrel crude and product stock drawdown coordinated by the international energy agency iea the united states offered 30 million barrels of spr crude for sale on september 14 doe announced the sale of 108 million barrels of sweet crude and 200000 barrels of sour at prices ranging from 5976 to 6646 bids for an additional 82 million barrels were rejected additionally some of the companies awarded loans may not borrow the full volume of crude for which they asked the results of crude oil and refined product offerings from government strategic reserves show demand for products to be stronger than crude perhaps as result of so much refining capacity shut by the hurricanes and us product demand exceeding the nations refinery capacity during periods of normal supply and demand petroleum inventories and prices despite list of impediments to adding to crude and refined petroleum inventories stocks of crude oil and refined products have not dropped to levels which could cause alarm table 1 shows the changes in stocks for total petroleum crude oil gasoline and distillate fuel oil between the week before katrina struck august 26 and the most recent week of october 14 table 1 us commercial petroleum stocks after katrina

table 3 6 doeeia weekly petroleum status report oct 20 2005 table 1 7 department of energy office of fossil energy see httpwwwfedoegovnews techlines2005tl_sprexchange_totalpetrohtm crs6 table 1 shows that the major categories of petroleum inventories have experienced declines since katrina with the exception of gasoline total stocks have declined at rate of about 750000 bd how these figures might be interpreted is matter of some debate the obvious facts are that they have declined and that there is some level below which spot shortages and distributional problems begin to appear prior to march 2003 does weekly petroleum status report referred to this as the minimum operational inventory moi subsequent issues have dropped any reference to moi because of differing views within the industry regarding what the minimum level might be because of improvements and inventory management and logistics industry had recommended using lower figures than doe had previously been using doeindustry dialogue held by the national petroleum council in august 2004 failed to reach an agreement on moi and it has not been referenced since it was dropped when last shown on does charts of inventory levels8 these statistics were 185 million barrels for gasoline and 85 million barrels for distillates which includes both heating oil and diesel fuel if these levels are guide there is about one days worth of gasoline stocks available 107 million barrels of extra stocks compared to about 88 mbd of demand before runouts would start to occur tight inventory situation might be expected to be cause for concern however prices for the moment at least are falling at the pump regular gasoline prices peaked at 306 an alltime high on september 5 they have steadily declined falling to 270 in midoctober wholesale prices and gasoline traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex fell similarly the market does not appear to be responding to any shortagerelated fears but it may be responding to concerns about demand destruction resulting from high prices indeed the data for the four weeks ending october 14 show demand for gasoline and middle distillates each about 200000 bd below the yearago period9 distillate stocks are 377 million barrels above the old moi level demand is about 40 mbd implying less than 10 days worth of supply cover wholesale trading on the nymex has seen distillates decline from 213 per gallon at the end of september to 185 in midoctober suggesting few current concerns other than the level fo retail prices for the approaching heating season eias heating oil and propane update for october 10 shows residential heating oil price of 265 per gallon down 44 cents from the prior week doe has forecast that home heating costs will be much higher this winter than last eia administrator caruso indicated heating oil was forecast to cost 254 per gallon an increase from the 200405 heating season average price of 192 he added that it could range as low as 234 per gallon

distillates and 430000 bd of intermediate products petrochemical feed stocks and lubricants10 it remains to be seen how this demand scenario plays out against fuel supply as refineries recover from the hurricanes and if there are additional sales from iea strategic stocks relaxation of motor fuel standards11 on august 31 2005 environmental protection agency epa administrator stephen johnson announced that epa would temporarily waive certain gasoline and diesel fuel standards nationwide through september 15 2005 in order to help increase available fuel supplies for gasoline epa waived volatility standards that would have otherwise prohibited the sale of gasoline produced for northern states in the south or the sale of winter gasoline in the summer months this waiver was intended to make it possible for gasoline normally prohibited in certain areas to be transported to those areas in response to supply limitations after september 15 many of the waived standards longer applied as the country transitioned from summer to winter gasoline12 epa also waived national sulfur standards for diesel fuel so that through september 15 fuel produced for nonroad uses could be legally used in highway vehicles this waiver was intended to help mitigate some of the disruption in diesel fuel supplies13 in several cases epa has also issued waivers of specific standards for certain states or regions these waivers have been issued on casebycase basis as some standards and specific fuel supply issues vary from state to state and within states in most cases these waivers will expire by the end of october14 natural gas disruption in addition to crude oil about 10 billion cubic feet per day bcfpd of natural gas the equivalent of roughly 17 of total us consumption is produced from the

available from the epa website at httpwwwepagovcompliancekatrinawaiverindexhtml crs8 production has been shut in as of october 12 52 bcfpd or 52 of output was shut in in effect this amount reduced the nations total current gas supply by about 10 natural gas production from louisiana state lands was also interrupted by the hurricanes the louisiana department of natural resources estimated that 07 bcfpd of gas production has been restored which is the equivalent of 31 of the 22 bcfpd state total15 about 15 bcfpd remains offline in the 38 parish coastal region surveyed combining lost gas output from state and federal lands the total amount of 67 bcfpd is the equivalent of 11 of an average days total consumption for the whole country natural gas pipelines and processing facilities gas production can recover only as fast as transport facilities return to service there is comprehensive overview of the condition of pipeline and processing infrastructure in the stormdamaged region repairs could prove lengthy bottleneck in reattaining prekatrina levels of gas flow one industry analyst noted while most pipeline companies have been eerily quiet about the status of pipelines major facilities are still offline with little guidance as to when they will return to full strength16 on october 13 does office of electricity delivery and energy reliability noted that 15 gas processing plants with aggregate capacity of 95 billion cubic feet or greater were offline in louisiana these plants had prekatrina throughput of 53 bcfpd gas processing plants treat gas upgrading it to pipeline quality and making it physically suitable for transport both doe and the louisiana department of natural resources publish updates of pipeline and infrastructure service status but they do not paint comprehensive picture of how gas is flowing over the longdistance grid and how much capacity remains sidelined the case of henry hub is good example henry hub is nodal point on the sabine pipeline which connects with nine interstate and four intrastate pipelines when fully operational it has the capacity to move 18 bcfpd because of these attributes it is the point at which nymex contracts for physical delivery are settled trading in henry hub futures is an extremely important benchmark for establishing natural gas prices nationwide the sabine pipeline went out of service after rita and force majeure was ultimately declared on the nymex contracts resulting in postponement of trades and physical deliveries trading was suspended on september 22 it resumed on 15 louisiana department of natural resources louisiana instate daily production and pipeline update oct 12 2005 16 gulf repair job tougher than expected by christopher edmonds thestreetcom oct 12 2002 crs9 october 7 when sabine partially reopened how much gas can be transported given limited availability of pipeline compression is unclear as is how this limited pumping ability might affect trading in futures and physical deliveries for traditional customers of deferred gas the absence of definitive reports on the condition of the gas delivery infrastructure has caused uncertainty that has become reflected in spot gas prices natural gas prices and inventories for the first months of 2005 wellhead prices for natural gas17 averaged just over 600 per million btus in july they began to rise averaging 669 for that month and to 748 in august with the impact of both storms felt in natural gas markets during september prices rose to an average of 950 trading on the nymex for henry hub has averaged between 13 and 14 per million btus while it may be early to make estimates of what natural gas prices could be this winter producer gas prices have more than doubled since the first half of 2005 eia recently forecast that wellhead prices will average 1140 this heating season if the weather is normal they will run 1320 if the winter is 10 colder than normal and 1000 if the weather is 10 warmer than normal18 in addition to the producer price of natural gas residential consumers rates also include longdistance pipeline tariffs and charges of local distribution utility which actually owns the connection to the home delivered residential natural gas cost 1113 per million btus during the winter of 20042005 this winter eia projects range of 1532 to 1668 and 1558 with normal cold weather normal winter would see prices about 48 above last winter natural gas demand tends to be highest during the winter months and gas produced in nonpeak demand months is stored to meet peak demand storage peaks at about 325 trillion cubic feet tcf in late fall and declines to about 075 tcf at the end of the heating season typically during april19 current inventory is about 30 tcf about the average stock level during the past five years during the most recent week 75 bcf were added to storage slightly under the fiveyear average figure for this week suggesting that gas is available and flowing in the nations pipeline system to what extent this will be the case after the onset of cold weather remains to be seen but it is likely that prices will keep demand in check and allocate supply where needed 17 eia natural
