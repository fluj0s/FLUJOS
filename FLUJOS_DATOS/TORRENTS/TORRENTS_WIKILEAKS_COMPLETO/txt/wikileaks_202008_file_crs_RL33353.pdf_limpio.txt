variety of forms for at least 150 years over the pa st 15 years civilian border patrol groups appear to have proliferated along the usmexico border partly due to the increasing numbers of aliens entering the country illega lly in the spring of 2005 attention focused on these civilian patrols when the minuteman project mobilized hundreds of volunteers along the arizonamex ico border to obser ve and report the movement of illegal aliens to the us border patrol although some participants were armed minutemen volunteers were in structed not to engage in hostile confrontations with any illegal alien or ganizers of the minuteman project have expanded the project to the other southwes tern border states and canada and have split the mission into border defense corps and an internal vigilance operation that monitors businesses and government th minuteman launched new border watch initiative named operation s overeignty in september of 2006 near laredo texas the activities of the minutemen sparked national debate on the legality and effectiveness of such civilian action along the border some questioned for instance the authority that allows civilians to undertake immigrationrelated enforcement activities and the legal status of volunteer ie private vs federal actor others suggested that the secretary of the homeland security should deputize the minuteman volunteers or other private citizens so that they may play larger and more regulated role some in the 109th congress introduced bills that would have authorized and expanded civilian patrols along the border others in and outside of congress were concerned with the effect that civilian border patrols might have on current border dynamics nd enforcement operations civilian border patrols would seem to be private actors since they are not operating under the color of federa l or state law or at the behe st or direction of federal or state authorities as private actors civilian patrols appear to have the right to gather and conduct some of their activities under combin ation of constitutional and common law rights and privileges some of these rights and privileges have been codified in state law and provide quasi law enforcement authority civilian patrols would still have to abide by state and federal laws there does not appear to be authority under the ina for the secretar to deputize civilians to enforce immigration law though some activ ities may not necessarily re quire an authorization this report provides history of civilia n border patrol groups with focus on those groups

forms for at least hundred nd fifty years over the pa st fifteen years civilian border patrol organizations appear to have proliferated along the usmexico border partly due to the increasing numbers of liens entering the country illegally this trend appears to have further sharpened over the past five years with number of highly organized groups forming and ac tively recruiting volunteers nationwide attention focused on the phenomenon in ap ril 2005 when the minuteman project mobilized hundreds of volunteers along the arizonamexico border to observe and report the movement of illegal aliens to the us border patrol usbp although some participants were armed minutemen volunteers were instructed not to engage in hostile confrontations with any illegal alien the minuteman project sparked national debate on the legality and effectiveness of such civilian action at the border from this debate number of legal and policy issues emerged as partie s considered the potentially dangerous law enforcement nature of the mission and the overwhelming fede ral responsibilities in immigration matters some questioned for instance the authority that allows civilians to engage in immigrationrelated enforcement measures and the legal status of volunteer ie private vs federal actor others suggested that the secretary of the homeland security should deputize th minuteman volunteers or other private citizens so that they ma enforce immigration law indeed some in the 109th congress introduced bills that would have authorized and expa nded civilia n activities along the border others in congress and elsewhere were concerned with the effect that such activities might have on current border dynamics and enforcement operations this report opens with discussion on the federal authority to enforce immigration law at the border and some us border patrol operations that have affected illegal migration patterns along the southwest border next the report provides history of civilia n border patrol groups with particular focus on the minuteman project and othe r groups operating along the southwest border it then highlights issues of authority that might ar ise and includes as an appendix table that sets forth various state laws that might be cited by civilians performing immigrationrelated enforcement activities the report also addresses some of the legal and policy issues as mentione d above that have surfaced from civ ilian involvement in immigration enforcement at the border the report concludes with an overview of legislation introduced in the

makes clear that all authorities and functions of dhs to administer and enforce immigration laws are vested in continuedauthority to enforce immigration law for decades the administrative authority to interpret implement enforce and adjudicate immigration law within the us lay almost exclusively with one officer the attorney general the most gene ral statement of this power was found in 103a1 of the immigration nd nationality act of 1952 ina1 the fundamental statute regulating the entry and stay of aliens the attorney general shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of the act and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens except insofar as this act or such other laws relate to the power functions and duties conferred upon the pr esident the secretary of state or diplomatic or consular officers prov ided however that determination and ruling by the attorney general with re spect to all questions of law shall be controlling operationally most of this authority wa s delegated to and carried out by the commissioner of immigration nd naturalization service i ns and the ins though the attorney general still retained ultimate authority in the homeland security act of 2002 hsa pl 107296 congress reallocated administrative authority over immigration law from the department of justice doj to the department of homeland security dhs the hsa amended 103a1 of the ina to place the secretary of dhs in primary charge of the administration and enforcement of immigration laws2 congress transferred the enforcement functions along with aut horities and personnel ttendant to those functions3 that were being conduc ted through the commissioner of ins as well as others to the under secretary for border and transportation security4 an administrative reorganization later divided the transferred enforcement functions into two separate agencies to address priorities 1 at and near the border and 2 within the interior of the united states5 subsequent administrative reorganization appears to have consolidated the functi ons performed by the under secretary for border and transportation security into new directorate of policy but made the immigration enforcement agencies freestanding entities within dhs the hsa makes clear that all functions of all offi cers employees and organizational units of the department of homeland security dhs are vested in the secretary6 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33353crs3 6 continued the secretary 7 the hsa effectuated the transfer of immigra tion authority in statutory language that is separate and apart from the ina itself ie it did not amend the ina consequently many forms of authority including executive orders rules regulations directives and the ina still refer to the attorney general or other doj components the hsa remedies this situation in 456 1512d and 1517 by making all references in the abovementioned forms of authority relating to an agency that was transferred deemed to refer to the appropriate agency or employee in dhs accord ingly this report refers to the secretary or applicable dhs component 8 pl 107296 402with respect to border enforcement 103a5 of the

while responsibilities at the ports of entry fall on cbp inspectors although the enforcement of immigration law within the proximity of the border rests with cbp and the usbp the secretary of dhs

practices in the 1990s the united states border patrol began imple menting policy of prevention through deterrence with the goal of placing usbp agents and resources directly on the border to detect and deter the entry of illegal aliens rather than attempting to arrest liens after they had already entered the country the policy was applied nationally after the perceived successes of the hold the line program in paso texas and of operati on gatekeeper in san diego california14 i n addition to placing more agents directly on the border these operations utilized landing mat fencing15 stadium lighting cameras and sensors to deter and detect unauthorized aliens additiona lly the policy reflected the usbps goal of rerouting the illegal migration patterns away from traditional urban routes such as san diego towards less populated and geographically isolated areas providing usbp agents with tactical advantage over illegal border crossers and smugglers16 in practice the prevention through deterrence strategy has succeeded in shifting the migration pattern of unauthorized aliens throughout the late 1990s apprehensions decreased significantly in the traditional hightraffic areas along the california and texas border instead pushing wouldbe migrants out into the harsh conditions of the arizona desert along the tucson sector17 in fy1997 the california section of the border accounted for 31 of the 138 million apprehensions made by the usbp while arizona accounted for 22 in fy2005 arizona accounted for 49 of the 119 million apprehensions ma by the usbp while california accounted for 15 whether the strategy has succeeded in reducing the overall number of people attempting to enter the country illegally is matter of much debate usbp apprehensions increased steadily through the late 1990s reaching peak of 165 million in fy2000 from fy2000 to fy2003 apprehensions declined steadily reaching low of 905065 in 2003 apprehensi ons increased over the last two fiscal years reaching

variety of forms for at least hundred and fifty years some are informal or ad hoc groupings of citizens while othe rs are highly organized and well funded groups that actively recruit members over the past fifteen years civilian border patrol organizations appear to have proliferated along the usmexico border though the reasons for their formation vary many of the groups were organized in response to an apparent lack of federal re sources at the border and to the significant increases in illegal entries not surpri singly civilian border patrol groups have tended to follow the trends of unauthorized migration in the 1980s and early 1990s the majority of these groups operated along the san diego border which up to then had been the flashpoint for unauthorized migration as unauthorized migration was pushed eastward after the advent of the prevention through deterrence policy and operation gatekeeper in california num ber of civilian border patrol organizations began to grow along the arizona border the following paragraphs further describe some of the types of civilian operations that have occurred along the border ad hoc groups examples of ad hoc groups along the bor der are many and varied but they tend to lack formal organizational structur these groups are typically comprised of local citizens reacting to increasing num bers of unauthorized immigrants crossing into the country through their land for example in 1997 one rancher near campo california organized nighttime operations on his property in which volunteers were equipped with camouflage fatigues and semiautomatic rifles18 while many civilian border patrol groups resent th label of vigilantism that some have given them this rancher reveled in being characterized as vigilante vigilante is by definition citizen upholding the law in the absence of law enforcement thats the way we out here look at it19 also in 1997 ranchers in eagle pass texas engaged in shootout with armed aliens in which more than 30 rounds were fired many of the ranchers in maverick county texas repor tedly carried handcuffs and semiautomatic weapons in order to deter and apprehend unauthor ized aliens20 as unauthorized migration pa tterns have shifted from california to arizona number of ad hoc groups of arizonans have begun operating along the border for example in 2000 an anonymous flyer wa s posted in public areas around douglas inviting volunteers to form posses to track down unauthorized aliens21 one of the more known arizona ranchers to become involved in border operations is

firearms and do not attempt to detain migrants but rather focus on documenting border intrusions34 despite this disclaimer however spencer was sentenced to year of pr obation and fined 2500 for

part in the minuteman project the project in part was designed to demonstr ate that an increase in the manpower placed directly along the united statesmexico border could successfully reduce the number of illegal aliens entering the country the volunteers were unpaid and traveled to arizona at their own expense the volunteers were instructed by their leaders to assist usbp agents patrolling the border and not to do anything other than alert the proper authorities of the presence of ille gal aliens though some of them carried rifles or other firearms the volunteers were instructed to abide by the rules of contact and engagement never confront the illegal liens use their weapons only in self defense and comply with the laws of arizona44 organizers told volunteers that they could not chase restrain or talk to the suspected illegal aliens the volunteers were organized into groups of f our to eight people these groups set up observation posts on or near the border nd notified the border patrol when aliens were seen crossing the border illegally45 according to chris simcox minuteman project volunteers assisted the border patrol with locating and apprehe nding 349 aliens

codified in state law for example state law often outlines when private person may make an arrest carry weapons or use selfdefense and deadly for ce these laws would be pertinent to civilian

state militia laws may also provide author ity for state residents to conduct border enforcement activities or to participate in certain law enforcement type activities at the direction of the

patrol groups must also abide by an special requirements that exist on indian reservations and territories that are near the border62 civilian border volunteers must also be cautious not to impede or interfere with the work of federal immigration officials in violation of federal law63 with respect to state crimes assault false arrest or imprisonment trespass disorderly conduct and manslaughter are among offenses that could arise in the context of civilian conducting quasi law enforcement duties along the often violent international border for instance while immigration officers would be authorized under the ina to enter onto private land within twentyfive miles of the border private persons could be trespassing if they do not have pr oper permission state law may also regulate the use or possession of firearm or make it crime for some people to use or carry weapon as pr eviously mentioned members of american border patrol and ranch re scue were arrested and fi ned for firearm violations some states also have antimilitia laws that might be applicable64 for instance in texas body of persons other than th regularly organize d state militia may not associate as military company or organiza tion or parade in pub lic with firearms65 members of civilian patrol groups could also be lia ble for civil damages under state tort principles for example th ere are reportedly veral pending lawsuits against citizens who patrolled the border for assault battery infliction of emotional distress and other torts66 as private citizens they would probably not be protected by the immunity or treated with the typical deference that is often granted to law enforcement and government personnel however civilians would not necessarily be bound by the same federal and constitutional restraints eg fourth amendment that are generally imposed on government officials see discussion below this is not to say that they may use an unreasonable amount of force as several courts have concluded only force that is reasonable under the circumstances may be used to restrain the individual arrested pursuant to citizens arrest67 the amount of force that is reasonable is generally factsensitive questionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33353crs15 68 there is some case law however discussing the authority of customs and immigration officers to make warrantless citizens arrest s for

issues for the courts particularly if civilian volunteers attempt to do more than merely report illegal entries eg search and arrest for example the extent to which civilian may use states citizens rrest authority to apprehend detain and arrest an illegal alien is not clear68 moreover the fact that civ ilian border groups are proactively putting themselves in harms way may affect claims of selfdefense69 immigration law is also distinctly federal issue and many experts still disagree on the extent to which even state and local law enforcement officers may enforce immigration law70 notwithstanding these unresolved legal matters civilian border patrol volunteers have relied on and tinue to rely on many of the ri ghts and state laws described above to address i ndividuals coming onto private pr operty from across the border and to report alleged illegal entries to the usbp legal and policy issues while president bush has asked the pub lic to be vigilant and mindful of suspicious activities he and others in the administration have been wary of citizen patrols for number of reasons including the potentially violent nature of such activities along the border still as the minuteman project and the other groups detailed in this report demonstrate many civilians have continued to gather along the border region irrespective of the admoniti ons in congress many have introduced bills that would authorize and enhance the use of civilians for immigration purposes along the border the enhanced use of civilian patrols along the border could present number of legal and policy issues due to the law enforcement nature of the mission and the overwhelming federa l responsibilities in immigrati on matters the following paragraphs explore number of these issues including 1 whether there is authority to deputize private persons to enforce immigration law 2 the extent to which private persons might be considered federal immigration officers 3 whether large presence of civilians at the border could interfere with or otherwise impact on the usbps ability to execute its mission and 4 whether the presence of armed civilians at the border will create situation that could lead to further violence deputizing civilians as earlier paragraphs illustrated the secretary of dhs appears to have the authority under the ina to authorize any employee of dhs the federal

to be however au thority under the ina for the secretary of dhs to authorize or deputize civilians to enforce immigration law ina regulations seem to further refl ect this absence of authority71 the apparent lack of authority to formally deputize civilians with all the powers of an immigration officer of course does not prevent the federal government from cooperating with civilians dhs for instance has stated that it would accept and investigate information from the minuteman like it does from the general public72 indeed dhs currently receives aid from civilian volunteers through citizen corps an organization coordinated by dhs which helps plan preparedness activities nationwide dhs officials still recognize that the border presents an extremely dangerous environment and that they would never encourag members of the public to conduct law enforcement activities on their own73 civilians however might be allowed to perform activities that fall short of the actual full enforcement of immigration law in which case authorization in statute might not be required for example current citizen corps program known as volunteers in police service vips builds on local programs in which civilian volunteers help local police departments to perform nonsworn functions freeing up police officers to perform vital front line duties in times of emergency74 c b p officials

activities or organiza tions that might be developed for border enforcement activities it is difficult to determine whether legislative action would be required nonetheless it seems feasible to argue that the more oversight provided by the federal government and the more law enforcement support assumed by volunteers the better th argument that explicit authorization may be needed some have suggested that there is alr eady appropriate authority for organizing volunteers to support border security under 32 usc 109c which allows state to maintain state defense force sdf77 an sdf is volunteer state force in addition to its national guard that is re gulated under state law and is under the command of the governor78 members of an sdf generally do not receive pay for training but may be paid for active duty under stat control sdfs do not receive federal funds but may use armories train on military installations and receive inkind support provided the state complies with federal standards fo r the national guard79 proponents argue that border security would be an ideal mission for state defense force and that an sdf is an effective vehicle to integrate the active participation of volunteers into the mission states however may be reluctant to use such authority without more federal suppor t particularly because of the federal nature of immigration additional

happened81 or could easily occur during exigent circumstances search by private person however does not implicate th protections afforded by the fourth amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures unless he acts as an instrument or agent of the government82 for private person to be considered an agent of the government courts generally look for two critical f actors 1 whether the government knew of and acquiesced in the intrusive conduct and 2 whether the private actors purpose was to assist law enforcement efforts rather than to further his own ends83 the first part of this test examines the governments level of involvement while the second looks to th citizens motivati ons and independence from governmental purpose volunteers ac ting as government agents could raise liability issues for the federal government and the volunteer and complicate issues of authority the following paragraphs pr ovide more detail on these prongs using the minuteman project as an example with respect to prong one courts have generally held that private citizens acts are not acts of the government if based on merely minimis or incidental contacts between the citizen and law enforcement agents prior to or during the course of search or seizure84 thus general exchange of information or mere cooperation with authorities would probably not make the minutemen agents of the government85 but if it is perceived that the volunteer s acted on the direction or suggestion of immigration officials the first prong of the government actor test could be met86 moreover if immigration officials

the government and the minutemen and who initiated the contact from what has been reported it appears that the usbp is not engaging in activities that normally satisfy this first prong as to the second element courts gene rally examine whether the private actor had the mental state of government employee88 or again analyze the exercise of governmental power over the private entity to determine whether the private entity may be said to have acted on behalf of the government rath er than for its own private purposes89 here there is little doubt that th minuteman volunteers wanted to help the federal government indeed they claim that they are doing the job the government should be doing90 but there is also some indication that the volunteers might be motivated by more personal go als from protecting personal property to creating type of symbolic or civil movement91 in cases where dual motives were shown some courts have concluded that being motivated in part by desire to aid

many of these civilian pa trol groups including reported 40 percent of the minutemen carry firearms in performing their duties however civilian patrol groups and other members of the public also
