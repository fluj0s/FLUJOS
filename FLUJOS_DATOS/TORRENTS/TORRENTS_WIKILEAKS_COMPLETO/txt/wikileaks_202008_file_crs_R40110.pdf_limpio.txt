energy prices the passage of major energy legislation in 2005 pl 10958 and 2007 pl 110140 and the passage of new farm bill in 2008 pl 110246 there is ongoing congressional interest in promoting alternatives to petroleum fuels biofuelstransportation fuels produced from plants and other organic materialsare of particular interest ethanol and biodiesel the two most widely used biofuels receive significant government support under federal law in the form of mandated fuel use tax incentives loan and grant programs and certain regulatory requirements the 24 programs and provisions listed in this report have been established over the past 28 years and are administered by five separate agencies and departments environmental protection agency us department of agriculture department of energy internal revenue service and customs and border protection these programs target variety of beneficiaries including farmers and rural small businesses biofuel producers petroleum suppliers and fuel marketers arguably the most significant federal programs for biofuels have been tax credits for the production or sale of ethanol and biodiesel however with the establishment of the renewable fuel standard rfs under pl 10958 congress has mandated biofuels use pl 110140 significantly expanded that mandate in the long term the mandate may prove even more significant than tax incentives in promoting the use of these fuels the 2008 farm billthe food conservation and energy act of 2008amended or established various biofuels incentives including lowering the value of the ethanol excise tax credit establishing tax credit for cellulosic biofuel production extending import duties on fuel ethanol and establishing several new grant and loan programs this report outlines federal programs that

independence and security act of 2007 202 pl 110140 scheduled termination none description the energy policy act of 2005 established renewable fuel standard rfs for automotive fuels the rfs was expanded by the energy independence and security act of 2007 the rfs requires the blending of renewable fuels including ethanol and biodiesel in transportation fuel in 2008 fuel suppliers must blend 90 billion gallons of renewable fuel into gasoline this requirement increases annually to 36 billion gallons in 2022 the expanded rfs also specifically mandates the use of advanced biofuelsfuels produced from noncorn feedstocks and with 50 lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than petroleum fuelstarting in 2009 of the 36 billion gallons required in 2022 at least 21 billion gallons must be advanced biofuel there are also specific quotas for cellulosic biofuels and for biomassbased diesel fuel on may 1 2007 epa issued final rule on the rfs program detailing compliance standards for fuel suppliers as well as system to trade renewable fuel credits between suppliers epa has not yet initiated rulemaking on the lifecycle analysis methods necessary to categorize fuels as advanced biofuels while this program is not direct subsidy for the construction of biofuels plants the guaranteed market created by the renewable fuel standard is expected to stimulate growth of the biofuels industry
