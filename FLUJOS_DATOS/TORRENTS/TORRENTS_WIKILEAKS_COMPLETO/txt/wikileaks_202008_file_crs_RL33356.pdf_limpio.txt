within us borders of new immigrant populations whose primary language is other than english has created public policy divide on issues of language diversity on one side opposition to expanded foreign language use has led at least 30 states to enact statutes or amend state constitutions to declare english the official state language1 federal statutes and the us constitution however have traditionally afforded some legal protection to minority language rights for example the v oting rights act of 1965 as amended mandates the use of bilingual voting materials in states and political subdivisions when certain conditions are met 2 other federal statutory safeguards include title vi of the 1964 civil rights act and the equal educational opportunities act3 in addition state and federal policies mandate the use of languages other than english when necessary for effective delivery of public and private services to nonenglish speakers in judicial and law enforcement proceedings health and managed care services conduct of state and local administrative agencies business and professions elections and other critical areas 4 congressional proposals to install english as the official language of the united states reflect yet another aspect of the complicated ongoing national debate over federal immigration policy the modern official english movement in congress is traceable to the mid1980s when various proposals to achieve linguistic uniformity by constitutional amendment were considered 5 when that approach failed congress renewed its efforts to codify english as the official language proceeding on statutory track this effort culm inated in 1996 with house passage of hr 123 declaring english the official language of the united states government and restricting other linguistic usage in the conduct of official governmental business the language in government act passed the house in the 104th congress but died in the senate6 substantially amended versions of this earlier measure however have appeared in subsequent legislative sessions for example during the 109th congress the senate adopted the inhofe amendment as part of its comprehensive immigration reform package declaring english to be our national language and calling for governmental role in preserving and enhancing the role of english7 an alternative offered by senator salazar also passed the senate it would have recognized english as the common and unifying language of the united states while protecting existing rights of non english speakers to services and materials

would be largely symbolic act of negligible legal effect although an affirmation by the congress of the central place of english in our national life and culture such pronouncement would not of its own force require or prohibit any particular action or policy by the government or private persons nor would it without more imply the repeal or modification of existing federal or state laws and regulations sanctioning the use of nonenglish for various purposes as in the past however any official english proposals introduced during the 111 th congress would give varying force to this declaration depending on the degree to which they would propose adherence to english in various governmental activities at the federal and state level several examples of legislation introduced during the 110 th congress illustrate this concept g18g155g142g159g146g152g158g156g561g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 both the inhofe and salazar amendments to the proposed immigration reform effort included elements from earlier legislative proposals declaring english to be our national language the former measure called on the government of the ited states to preserve and enhance the role of english and except as otherwise provid ed by statute would have denied any private right entitlement or claim to nonenglish governmental services or materials the salazar amendment would have recognized english as the common language of the united states while protecting existing rights of nonenglish speakers to services or materials provided by the government in languages other than english as far as the jurisdictional scope of the amendments was concerned the inhofe amendment appeared largely limited in any direct manner to actions of the federal government rather than the states and localities nor did it appear that the salazar amendment would carry direct legal implicationsbeyond perhaps those that congress might impose by means of the carrot and stickof federal funding conditionson the linguistic policies of state or local governmental 8 id 9 153 cong rec s7161 daily ed june 6 2007 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33356g7g151g144g149g146g156g145g561

supporters and its opponents appeared to center on the measures potential effect on executive order 13166 clintonera order directing federal departments and agencies to ensure that individuals with limited english proficiency lep are provided meaningful access to programs and activities conducted by the federal government or by recipients of federal financial assistance10 although proponents of the inhofe amendment appe ared concerned that eo 13166 currently guarantees lep individuals the right to receive government services or materials in language other than english and seemed to believe that the amendment would therefore invalidate eo 13166 it is unclear whether either premise wa s correct indeed although eo 13166 directs federal agencies and recipients to provide meaningful access to lep individuals nothing in the order currently grants such individuals an enforceable right to receive documents in language other than english as result it is unclear whether the inhofe amendment which did not actually prohibit the federal government from providing services or materials in languages other than english would have altered existing law in addition because the amendment would have denied any right entitlement or claim to documents in languages other than english unless specifically provided by statute it would not have precluded language claims brought pursuant to title vi of the civil rights act both eo 13166 and title vi are discussed in more detail in the following section ultimately given their largely symbolic declaration that english was the national or common language of the united states and their limited impact on existing laws regarding services or materials provided by the federal government in languages other than english it appears that if enacted the inhofe and salazar amendments would not have had significant effect on current law

previously proposed legislation with current federal foreign language policy is perhaps best illustrated by eo 13166 and departmental regulations by the federal government issued thereunder that order issued by president clinton in 2000 directed each federal department and agency to implement system for insuring that persons with limited english proficiency lep are provided meaningful access to programs and activities conducted by the federal government and by recipients of federal financial assistance covered by title vi of the 1964 civil rights act 11 policy guidance document released by the department of justice doj on the same day and referenced in the order set forth compliance standards that recipients must follow to ensure that the programs and activities that they normally provide in english are accessible to lep persons and thus do not discriminate on the basis of national origin in violation of title vi and its implementing regulations each federal grantmaking agency was to tailor the general standards of the doj gu idance into an approach ensuring meaningful access by lep persons that is practical and effective fiscally responsible responsive to the particular circumstances of each agency and can be readily implemented 12 10 153 cong rec s7152 daily ed june 6 2007 11 title vi provides that person in the united states shall on the ground of race color or

recipients of federal funds to take reasonable steps to insure meaningful access to information and services they provide what constitutes reasonable steps the document advises will be contingent on number of factors such as the number and proportion of lep persons in the eligible service population the frequency with which lep individuals come into contact with the program the importance of the service provided by the program and the resources available to the recipient in balancing factors for determining what steps are reasonable agencies are to particularly address the appropriate mix of oral and written language assistance acknowledging that written translations are highly effective way of communicating with lep persons the document states that oral communication may also be necessary part of the exchange of information lep persons include those born in other countries some children of immigrants born in the united states and other nonenglish or limited english proficient persons born in the united states including some native americans in its guidance doj cited lau v nichols 13 in which the us supreme court interpreted title vi as requiring that federal financial aid recipient take steps to insure that language barriers do not exclude lep children from effective participation in public educational benefits and services lau involved group of chinese students in the san francisco public school system who received classroom instruction solely in english the court ruled that the failure to provide such students with supplemental instruction in their primary language violated the title vi ban on national origin discrimination the doj document extrapolates an extension of the lau doctrine beyond education to other contexts note however that while the lau precedent remains intact its value as precedent may be diminished somewhat by s ubsequent judicial developments most notably the courts decision in alexander v sandoval 14 the courts ruling in the sandoval case was decided after publication of the doj guidance although doj has taken the position that the sandoval decision did not strike down the title vi regulations that form the basis for executive order 1316615 at issue in sandoval was the state of alabamas englishonly policy requiring all aspects of its drivers license examination process including the written portion to be exclusively in english in rejecting mexican immigrants claim that the state policy violated title vi because of its disparate impact on ethnic minorities five justice majority ruled that congress did not intend private right of action to enforce title vi except as remedy for intentional discrimination federal regulations prohibiting state practices that have discriminatory impact regardless of intent could not provide basis for private lawsuits sandoval however did not directly confront federal agency authority previously acknowledged by the court to enforce title vi compliance administratively with rules condemning practices discriminatory in their effect on protected minority groups thus at least for now disparate impact rulesmandating language assistance for nonenglish proficient clients of federally financed programsmay still be enforced by the government just not by private litigants however some previous cong ressional proposals would arguably have negated any private title vi remedy for linguisticallybased ethnic discrimination and any requirement regarding the governments affirmative obligation to promote english could portend similar perils for agency rules condemning the disparate impact of englishonly policies under title vi 13 414 us 563 1974 14 532 us 275 2001 15 memorandum from ralph f boyd jr assistant attorney general civil rights division

judicial decisions involving the constitutional implications of government language policies have arisen in variety of legal contexts one series of cases has involved nonenglish speaking plaintiffs who have unsuccessfully sought to require the government to provide them with services in their own language in soberalperez v heckler 16 for example the second circuit rejected an action on behalf of hispanic individuals of limited english proficiency who claimed that the equal protection and due process clauses of the constitution required the secretary of health and human services to provide them with social security forms and instructions in spanish the appeals court could find basis for the constitutional and related statutory claims since the secretarys action bore rational relationship to legitimate governmental purpose we need only glance at the role of english in our national affairs to conclude that the secretarys actions are not irrational congress conducts it affairs in english the executive and judicial branches of government do likewise in addition those who wish to become naturalized citizens must learn to read english given these factors it is not irrational for the secretary to choose english as the one language in which to conduct her official affairs 17 the federal courts have similarly found constitutional duty on the part of government to provide certain other forms of official notice or services to individuals in their native tongue18 these cases however hold only that in the circumstances involved nonenglish speakers have affirmative right to compel government to provide information in language that they can comprehend they do not address the converse issue of legislative power to restrict official speech in languages other than english as matter of state or national policy another body of judicial authority has found that certain state law restrictions on linguistic diversity may act as proxy for national origin discrimination or infringe upon first amendment free speech rights in meyer v nebraska 19 for example the supreme court found that state law prohibiting modern foreign language instruction in any

by methods which conflict with the constitutiona desirable end cannot be promoted by prohibited means20 meyer was applied by the court in farrington v tokushiga to invalidate hawaii statute that singled out foreign language schools such as those in which japanese was taught for stringent government control 21 the states purpose for regulating language instruction in tokushiga was in order that the americanism of the students may be promoted22 similarly the governmental interests asserted in defense of the meyer statute were to create an enlightened american citizenship in sympathy with the principles and ideals of this country23 to promote civic development24 and to prevent inculcation in children of ideas and sentiments foreign to the best interests of the country25 despite judicial acknowledgment of the validity of such goals the court found them insufficient to warrant state interference with foreign language usage in the schools yu cong eng v trinidad considered the constitutionality of philippine law forbidding chinese merchants from keeping their business account books in chinese the only language they knew 26 finding that enforcement of the law would seriously embarrass all of the chinese merchants and would drive out of business great number27 the court held that the law denied the merchants due process and equal protection under the constitution although based on the substantive due process doctrine of an earlier period reverberations of yu cong eng and meyer may be found in rulings of more recent vintage in hernandez v new york 28 for example the court determined that peremptory challenges directed at latino jurors because of their bilingualism and demeanor were not unconstitutional because the factors motivating the prosecutors action in that case did not function as proxy for race writing for the plurality however justice kennedy stated that we would face quite different case if the prosecutor had justified his peremptory challenges with the explanation that he did not want spanishspeaking jurors it may well be for certain ethnic groups and in some communities that proficiency in particular language like skin color should be treated as surrog ate for race under an equal protection analysis 29 the us supreme court in arizonans for official english v arizona sidestepped constitutional controversy when it vacated for procedural

english former insurance claims manager for the state who spoke both english and spanish in her daily service to the public argued that the law had silencing and chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech of bilingual monolingual and spanishspeaking public employees and their clients despite assertions by arizonas attorney general that communications to facilitate delivery of governmental services were not official acts covered by the law the ninth circuit held that the plain wording of the law defied such limitation and was an overly broad restriction on free speech rights of state employees and the public they served 31 the first amendment analysis applied by the 65 banc majority of the ninth circuit required balancing the right of public employees to speak on matters of public import against the governments legitimate interest as an employer in achieving its goals as effectively and efficiently as possible although the government may generally regulate public employee speech concerned simply with matters of personal or internal interest the arizona law significantly interfered with communications by or with government employees related to the provision of government services and information form of public discourse entitled to greater constitutional protection 32 moreover the efficiency and effectiveness considerations constituting fundamental governmental interests in the usual public concern caseand that provide the justification against which the employees first amendment interests must be weighedwere found totally lacking by the ninth circuit indeed the appeals court determined that government efficiency would actually be promoted rather th an hindered by permitting public employee speech in languages other than english nor was the states asserted interest in forging unity and political stability by encouraging common language sufficient to warrant restrictions on foreign language usage the supreme court vacated and remanded the case in effect leaving the arizona law intact for the time being speaking for unanimous court justice ginsburg declared the case moot since the plaintiff had resigned from state employment prior to appeal and had never sought to have the case certified class action in addition the justices had grave doubts whether arizonans for official english original sponsors of the ballot initiative had standing to appeal the case as party after the arizona governor declined to do so finally the federal district and appeals courts had erred by failing to certify unsettled statelaw questions regarding the scope of the english only amendment to the arizona supreme court for authoritative construction before proceeding with the case the supreme court thus left constitutional ruling on the arizona official english law for another day in 1998 the arizona supreme court decided ruiz v hull 33 holding that the states englishonly amendment violated the first amendment and the equal protection clause like the ninth 31 yniquez v arizonans for official english 69 f3d 920 1995 32 in this regard the courts opinion observed the practical effects of article xxviiis facto bar on communications by or with government employees are numerous and varied for example monolingual spanish speaking residents of arizona cannot consistent with the article communicate effectively with employees of state or local housing office about landlords wrongful retention of rental deposit nor can they learn from clerks of the state court about how and where to file small claims court complaints they cannot obtain information regarding variety of state and local social services or adequately inform the servicegivers that the governmental employees involved are not performing their
