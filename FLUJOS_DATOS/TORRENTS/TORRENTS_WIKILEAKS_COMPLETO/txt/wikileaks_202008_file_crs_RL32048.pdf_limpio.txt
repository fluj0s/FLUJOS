as profound threat to us national security interests perception generated primarily by irans nuclear program and its military assistance to armed groups in iraq and afghanistan to the palestinian group hamas and to lebanese hezbollah the bush administrations approach has been to try to prevent nuclear breakout by iran by applying coordinated international economic pressure on iran while also offering it potential cooperation should it comply with the in ternational demands to suspend its enrichment of uranium the incorporation of diplomacy and engagement into the overall us strategy led the administration to approve the participation of highlevel state department official at multilateral nuclear talks with iran on july 19 2008 although that meeting and subsequent discussions have not resulted in irans acceptance of the international offer of incentives to strengthen its approach the bush administration has maintained substantial naval presence in the persian gulf which us commanders insist would prevent any iranian attempts to close the crucial strait of hormuz for any extended period during 2006 and 2007 three security council resolutions 1737 1747 and 1803 imposed sanctions that ban weapons of mass destruction wmdrelated trade with iran freeze the assets of irans nuclear and related entities and personali ties prevent iran from transferring arms outside iran ban or require reporting on international travel by named iranians call for inspections of some iranian sea and airborne cargo shipments and call for restrictions on dealings with some iranian banks further security council sanctions are under consideration separate us efforts to persuade european governments to curb trade investment and credits to iran and to convince foreign banks not to do business with iran are beginning to weaken irans economy compounding the effect of sharp drop in oil prices in late 2008 bills in the 110 th congress including hr 1400 s 970 s 3227 s 3445 hr 7112 hconres 362 and sres 580 versions of which are likely to be introduced in the 111th congress would tighten us sanctions on iran amid widespread recognition that most us goals on iran have not been accomplished the incoming obama administration based on statements from presidentelect obama is likely to shift toward more consistent engagement with iran and to deemphasize potential us military action or efforts to promote democracy in iran yet there is vigorous debate among experts over whether such shifts would yield clearer results the policy decisions come as iran enters its run up to june 2009 presidential elections which most us experts hope will produce change to more moderate leadership in iran this report is updated regularly for further information seecrs report rs20871 the

february 1979 the shah assumed the throne when britain and russia forced his father reza shah pahlavi reza shah from power because of his perceived alignment with germany in world wa r ii reza shah had assumed power in 1921 when as an officer in irans only military force the cossack brigade reflecting russian influence in iran in the early 20 th century he launched coup against the government of the qajar dynasty reza shah was proclaimed shah in 1925 founding the pahlavi dynasty the qajars had been in decline for many years before reza shahs takeover that dynastys perceived manipulation by britain and russia had been one of the causes of the 1906 constitutionalist movement which forced the qajars to form irans first majles parliament in august 1906 and promulgate constitution in december 1906 prior to the qajars what is now iran was the center of several persian empires and dynasties but whose reach shrunk steadily over time since the 16 th century iranian empires lost control of bahrain 1521 baghdad 1638 the caucasus 1828 western afghanistan 1857 baluchistan 1872 and what is w turkmenistan 1894 iran adopted shiite islam under the safavid dy nasty 15001722 which brought iran out from series of turkic and mongol conquests the shah was anticommunist and the united st ates viewed his government as bulwark against the expansion of soviet influence in the persian gulf and counterweight to prosoviet arab regimes and movements israel maintained representative office in iran during the shahs time and the shah supported peaceful resolution of the arabisraeli dispute in 1951 under pressure from nationalists in the majles parliament who gained strength in the 1949 majles elections he appointed popular nationalist parliamentarian dr mohammad mossadeq as prime minister mossadeq was widely considered leftleaning and the united states was wary of his policies which included his drive for nationalization of the oil industry mossadeqs followers began an uprising in august 1953 when the shah tried to dismiss mossadeq and the shah fled the shah was restored in successful ciasupported uprising against mossadeq the shah tried to modernize iran and orient it toward the west but in so doing he also sought to marginalize irans shiite clergy he exiled ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 1964 because of khomeinis active opposition which was based on the shahs anticlerical policies and what khomeini alleged was the shahs forfeiture of iran s sovereignty to the united states khomeini fled to and taught in najaf iraq major shiite theological center that contains the shrine of imam ali shiisms foremost figure there he was peer of senior iraqi shiite clerics and with them advocated direct clerical rule or velayatefaqih rule by supreme islamic jurisprudent in 1978 three years after the march 6 1975 algiers accords between the shah and iraqs baathist leaders which settled territorial disputes and required each party to stop assisting each

who did unexpectedly well because of tacit backing from khamenei and the basij an internal security force under the revolutionary guard moved to runoff reformist candidates mehdi karrubi and mostafa

statements the first of which was stated at an october 26 2005 tehran conference entitled world without zionism that israel should be wiped off the map and that anybody who recognizes 3 rafsanjani was

point of contention was his insistence on the holding of december 2006 conference in tehran questioning the holocaust theme he has returned to several times since including at september 2007 speech at columbia university forum where he also denied that iran had any homosexuals security council statement and senate and house resolutions hres 523 and sres 292 passed in their respective chambers condemned the statement on june 21 2007 the house passed hconres 21 calling on the united nations security council to charge ahmadinejad with violating the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide the convention includes direct and public incitement to commit genocide as punishable offense some iranian leaders both conservative and reformist and portions of the population appear concerned that ahmadinejads defiance of the international community on the nuclear issueas well as his frequent visits and meetings with such antius figures as venezuelas hugo chavezis isolating iran and potentially provoking confrontation with the united states several experts believe that supreme leader khamenei seeks to curb ahmadinejads ability to provoke confrontation with the united states the first decision that strengthened this view was the october 2005 grant of new governmental supervisory powers to the expediency council in july 2006 khamenei created tenperson advisory foreign policy committee consisting of former defense and foreign ministers shakeup in the nuclear negotiating team in october 2007 represented further indication of splits in the leadership on that issue especially because the former negotiator now majles speaker ali larijani continued to undertake official visits representing the supreme leader in april 2008 ahmadinejad fired two cabinet ministers including the interior minister mustafa pourmohammadi who is close to khamenei in further sign of rift and of the increasing damage to irans economy that international sanctions are inflicting the supreme leaders top foreign policy advisor former foreign minister ali akbar velayati said in july 2008 that iran should consider western offers to settle the nuclear issue however khameneis public statements of support for ahmadinejad since august 2008 could indicate that the regime is rallying together to confront international demands that month he praised ahmadinejad for refusing to bow to international demands on the nuclear issue and said the cabinet should make plans for another four years khamenei defended ahmadinejad again on september 19 2008 by saying that the political elite should cease its squabbling over the comments of vice president that iran considers itself friend of the israeli people still on november 4 2008 the majles impeached interior minister ali kordan for falsely claiming he had an oxford university degree sadeq mahsouli former revolutionary guard official was confirmed as replacement on november 18 2008 if one more minister is fired or removed meaning half the cabinet changes during his term ahmadinejad would be constitutionally required to submit the entire cabinet to vote of confidence although he could expand the cabinet to avoid that consequence

ahmadinejad is assumed to be running for reelection in the june 12 2009 presidential election even though his allies explained his several public absences in late october 2008 as due to his exhaustion should khamenei openly or actively endorse him that could prove decisive particularly against other conservatives such as qalibaf and larijani major unknown as of the end of 2008 is whether khatemi will run as he is being urged by fellow reformists some reports say that moderateconservatives and reformists are meeting regularly to attempt to jointly mount successful challenge to ahmadinejad

ahmadinejads political fortunes were declining to the point where he would not run or would not win reelection in the december 15 2006 municipal elections his supporters won only 3 out of the 15 seats on the tehran city council with similar results in other cities ahmadinejad supporters did not fare as poorly in the march 2008 majles elections as some expected in those elections about 7600 persons filed to run for the 290 total seats of which 30 are in tehran of these about 2000 mostly reformist candidates including 103 majles incumbents were disqualified by the council of guardians still the selection of ali larijani leader of the moderateconservative faction as majles speaker presented ahmadinejad with more critical majles than was the case previously still ahmadinejad is viewed as favorite for reelection because he has maintained his appeal to the lower classes and rural voters he has raised wages and lowered interest rates for poorer borrowers cancelling some debts of farmers and increased social welfare payments and subsidies he fired the technocratic central bank governor in september 2008 in favor of an official who supports his move to provide direct subsidies to the bank accounts of poorer iranians some believe these moves have fed inflation but rural iranians see him as attentive to their economic plight in the urban areas however ahmadinejad has been greatly weakened by the june 2007 institution of rationing of gasolinea move intended to curb consumption that forces iran to import refined gasoline iranians in the urban areas who sometimes use their cars as unofficial taxis but it did reduce dependence on imported gasoline to about 25 from 40 the oil minister resigned in august 2007 probably because of the unpopularity of the program among some further sentiment against him came in protests in november 2008 by bazaar merchants in major cities against the imposition of sales taxation the protests caused suspension of the imposition of the tax ahmadinejad apparently believed that his distributive policies would be supported by high oil prices but the fall in the price of oil in late 2008 has left ahmadinejad open to increased criticism for mismanagement of the economy some business owners say the difficulty obtaining credit from foreign banks is hurting their ability to operate t able 2 f actions in the eighth majles elected mar ch

power in part because it vigorously suppresses dissent however iranian opinion is hard to gauge and even seemingly low level unrest has the potential to spiral into potential threat to the regime if for example the regime is perceived as committing fraud in an election or if it mismanages financial crisis the bush administration has highlighted irans human rights abuses in order to build international consensus to pressure iran the state departments human rights report for 2007 released march 11 2008 said irans already poor human rights record worsened during the yeara formulation

iran pmoi6 secular and leftleaning it was formed in the 1960s to try to overthrow the shah of iran and advocated marxism blended with islamic tenets it allied with prokhomeini forces during the islamic revolution and supported the november 1979 takeover of the us embassy in tehran but was later driven into exile even though it is an opponent of tehran since the late 1980s the state department has refused contact with the pmoi and its umbrella organization the national coun cil of resistance ncr the state department designated the pmoi as foreign terrorist organization fto in october 1997 7 and the ncr was named as an alias of the pmoi in the october 1999 redesignation the fto designation was prompted by pmoi attacks in iran that sometimes kill or injure civiliansalthough the group does not appear to purposely target civilians in august 14 2003 the state department designated the ncr offices in the united states an alias of the pmoi and ncr and justice department authorities closed down those offices 6 other names by which this group is known is the mojahedinekhalq organization mek or mko and the national council of resistance ncr 7 the designation was made

including children from its activists the groups alliance with saddam husseins regime in the 1980s and 1990s has contributed to the us shunning of the organization the designation is up for formal review in october 2008 and in july 2008 the pmoi formally petitioned to the state department that its designation be revoked on the grounds that it renounced any use of terrorism in 2001 the group is trying to build on recent legal successes in europe in december 2006 european union eu court struck down eus freezing of the pmois assets in europe in may 2008 british appeals court determined that the group should longer be considered terrorist organizati on on the grounds that the british government did not provide any reliable evidence that supported conclusion that pmoi retained an intention to resort to terrorist activities in the future in june 2003 france arrested about 170 pmoi members including its coleader maryam rajavi wife of pmoi founder masoud rajavi whose whereabouts are

extradited to tehran or forcibly expelled as long as us forces have mandate to help secure iraq us forces attacked pmoi military installations in iraq during operation iraqi freedom and negotiated

proc ess of leaving ashraf if host country could be found however the usled mandate will be replaced on january 1 2009 by bilateral us iraq agreement the group fears that this agreement which limits

in resolution 1803 including the authority to inspect suspect shipments but also called on its member states to refrain from providing new credit guarantees on exports to iran however the august 2008

allies and other countries has been whether or not to use military action to delay or halt irans nuclear program although some members publicly oppose most forms of military action against iran others fear that diplomacy and sanctions might not succeed and that preventing iran from acquiring working nuclear device is paramount in discussing possible military options against irans nuclear facilities president bush has repeatedly maintained that all options are on the table 43 at the same time he said during his trip to europe in june 2008 that he had left in place for the next administration the multilateral diplomatic framework discussed above suggesting that he is not leaning toward military action against iran before leaving office comments in july 2008 by joint chiefs chairman admiral mike mullen to the effect that the us military does not need third war in the region also indicate little administration inclination to prev entively strike iran us ground invasion to remove irans regime has not at any time appeared to be under serious consideration in part because of the heavy strains on us forces from the afghanistan and iraq conflicts proponents of us air and missile strikes against suspected nuclear sites argue that military action could set back irans nuclear program because there are only limited number of key targets and these targets are known to us planners and could be struck even those that are hardened or buried 44 estimates of the target set range from 400 nuclear and other wmdrelated targets to potentially few thousand targets whose destruction would cripple irans economic and military infrastructure at least 75 targets are underground or hardened those who take an expansive view of the target set argue that the united states would need to reduce

do not involve air or missile strikes some say that naval embargo or related embargo is possible that could pressure iran into reconsidering its stand on the nuclear issue such action is demanded in hconres 362 see more on this bill below others say that the imposition of nofly zone over iran might also serve that purpose either action could still be considered acts of war and could escalate into hostilities most us allies in europe not to mention russia and china oppose military action these states tend to agree with experts who maintain that the united states is not necessarily aware of or militarily able to reach all relevant sites other opponents believe any benefits would be minor or only temporary and that the costs of strike are too high some believe that us strike would cause the iranian public to rally around irans regime setting back us efforts to promote change within iran on the other hand some european and other diplomats say that france and britain might back or even join military strike if iran were to begin an allout drive toward nuclear weapon israeli officials view nuclear armed iran as an existential threat and have repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility that israel might strike irans nuclear infrastructure speculation about this possibility increased on june 7 2008 when israeli deputy prime minister shaul mofaz said that an attack on iran is becoming unavoidable because it continues to refuse to curb its nuclear program speculation increased further in midjune 2008 when israeli officials confirmed reports that israel had practiced long range strike such as that which would be required to hit iranian nuclear sites although israeli strategists say this might be viable option several experts doubt that israel has the capability to make such action sufficiently effective to justify the risks us military leaders are said by observers to oppose an israeli strike because such would inevitably draw the united states into conflict with iran yet without the degree of planning preparation or capability that would make similar us action success

promote political evolution in iran and change regime behavior not to overthrow the regime still several highranking us officials purportedly including vice president cheney maintained that only change of regime would permanently reduce the threat posed by iran few accounts such as preparing the battlefield by seymour hersh in the new yorker july 7 and 14 2008 say that president bush authorized us covert operations to destabilize the regime48 involving assistance to some of the ethnicbased armed groups discussed above crs has way to confirm assertions in the hersh article that up to 400 million was appropriated and used to aid the groups mentioned there has been some support in the united states for regime change since the 1979 islamic revolution the united states provided some funding to antiregime groups mainly pro monarchists during the 1980s49 the administrations attraction to this option became apparent after the september 11 2001 attacks when president bushs described iran as part of an axis of evil in his january 2002 state of the union message president bushs second inaugural address january 20 2005 and his state of the uni on messages of february 2 2005 and january 31 2006 suggested clear preference for change of regime by stating in the latter speech that our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with free and democratic iran indications of affinity for this option include increased public criticism of the regimes human rights record as well as the funding of iranian prodemocracy activists however the administration shifted away from this option as strategy employing multilateral sanctions and diplomacy took form in 2006 in part because us partner countries believe regime change policies harm diplomacy presidentelect obama has not expressed support for regime change option legislation in the 109 th congress exemplified the preference of some members for regime change in iran by authorizing funding for democracy promotion among other provisions in the 109th congress hr 282 passed the house on april 26 2006 by vote of 39721 companion s 333 was introduced in the senate the administration supported

entitled the iran freedom support act it authorizes funds specific dollar amount for iran democracy promotion and modifies the iran sanctions act many question the prospects of usled iran regime change through democracy promotion or other means short of alloutus military invasion because of the weakness of opposition groups providing overt or covert support to antiregime organizations in the view of many experts would not make them materially more viable or attractive to iranians the regime purportedly also conducts extensive regime surveillance of democracy activists or other internal dissidents iran has been arresting civil society activists by alleging they are accepting the us democracy promotion funds while others have refused to participate in usfunded programs fearing arrest

increased emphasis on direct diplomacy with iran on the nuclear and other issues however the issue of the degree of engagement the level whether any preconditions would attend such gagement and the timingparticularly whether before or after irans june 2009 electionare debated among experts and advisers to president elect obama particularly during his campaign the presidentelect indicated support for enhanced efforts to engage iran directly observing that inclination ahmadinejad sent presidentelect obama letter of congratulation upon his election and called for fundamental and fair changes to us policy on iran it was the first such congratulatory message from iran since the revolution however ahmadinejad subsequently said that iran would judge the obama administration by its iran policies other iranian leaders said that outreach by the obama administration might represent deception on specific steps toward greater engagement the bush administration said it considered opening new interests section in iran staffed by us personnel in tehran which would mostly process iranian visas and help facilitate usiran peopl etopeople contacts the bush administration said in november 2008 that it would leave this decision to the obama administration which 52the service began when congress funded it at 4 million in the fy1998 commercestatejustice appropriation pl 105119 it was to be

including ahmadinejad have said they might accept us interests section but others have said this will not be approved by the iranian side potential factor in the interests section decision could be storming of british diplomatic facility by 50 iranian students on december 30 2008 protesting what they said was britains bias toward israel the obama administration reportedly is also considering establishing special coordinator for us policy toward iran in the 110th congress hr 5056 called on the president to name an envoy to conduct negotiations with iran on outstanding issues prior to 2008 the bush administration directly engaged iran on specific issues afghanistan and iraq viewing such dialogue as helpful to th stabilization missions in those countries the united states had dialogue with iran on iraq and afghanistan from late 2001 until may 2003 when the united states broke off the talks following the may 12 2003 terrorist bombing in riyadh at that time the united states and iran publicly acknowledged that they were conducting direct talks in geneva on those two issues 53 the first confirmed direct dialogue between the two countries since the 1979 revolution the united states briefly resumed some contacts with iran in december 2003 to coordinate us aid to victims of the december 2003 earthquake in bam iran including reported offer to send highlevel delegation to iran iran rebuffed that offer recent meetings on iraq were discussed above regarding broader dialogue with iran on nuclear and other issues since 2006and prior to the july 2008 decision to have undersecretary burns attend the july 19 nuclear issues meetingthe bush administration maintained it would join multilateral nuclear talks or even potentially engage in direct bilateral talks only if iran first suspends uranium enrichment some believe the administration position was based on view that offering to participate in nuclear dialogue with iran would later increase international support for sanctions and other pressure mechanisms by demonstrating the willingness of the administration to resolve the issue diplomatically others believe that this precondition lessened the likelihood of positive response by iran and should be unambiguously dropped in related form of the option former senior us diplomat thomas pickering and other experts said in april 2008 that us and iranian former officials and academics have been meeting to discuss formulas under which iran might continue to enriched uranium to non bombgrade levels under monitoring as part of the us declared openness to talk with iran if it complies on nuclear issues the administration indicated that it considers iran great nation and respects its history such themes have been prominent in speeches by president bush such as at the merchant marine academy on june 19 2006 and his september 18 2006 speech to the general assembly secretary of state rice said in late january 2008 that the united states does not consider iran permanent enemy an amendment by senator biden adopted june 2006 to the fy2007 defense authorization bill pl 109364 supported the administrations offer to join nuclear talks with iran

resolving the nuclear issue is striking grand bargain on all outstanding issues the bush administration did not offer iran an unconditional direct usiran bilateral dialogue on all issues of us concern

that us officials rebuffed reported overture from iran just before the may 12 2003 riyadh bombing to negotiate all outstanding usiran issues as part of so called grand bargain that has been reported in various press articles the washington post reported on february 14 2007 2003 memo says iranian leaders backed talks that the swiss ambassador to iran in 2003 tim guldimann had informed us officials of comprehensive iranian proposal for talks with the united states however state department officials and some eur opean diplomats based in tehran at that time question whether that proposal represented an authoritative communication from the iranian government others argue that the offer was unrealistic because an agreement would have required iran to abandon key tenets of its islamic revolution including support for hezbollah there are some indications that the supreme leader is potentially receptive to restoring relations with the united states on january 3 2008 he said he would support resumed relations with the united states at the right time and under the right circumstances but not at the present because the united states would use relations to insert spies into iran

authorizationa possibility that reportedly was discussed at meeting of security council permanent members at the us state department on september 21 2007 54 on the other hand some us allies such as germany oppose sanctions outside council action on the grounds that doing so would undermine the security council process55 among the further or multilateral sanctions widely discussed are the following mandating reductions in diplomatic exchange s with iran or prohibiting travel by iranian officials as noted above resolution 1803 imposes ban on travel by some named iranian officials one option is to expand the list of those iranians whose travel abroad would be banned further option is to limit sports or cultural exchanges with iran such as irans participation in the world cup soccer tournament however many experts oppose using sporting events to accomplish political goals banning international flights to and from iran bans on flights to and from libya were imposed on that country in response to the finding that its agents were responsible for the december 21 1988 bombing of pan am 103 now lifted there are indications that passenger aircraft flight ban is under consideration among the p51 as noted above inspections of iranian international cargo flights and shipping is authorized in resolution 1803 ban on exports to iran of refined oil products or of other products some members of the security council oppose this sanction as likely to halt prospects for diplomatic solution to irans nuclear program and the sanction does not appear to be under current security council

iranian banks to those under sanction or even entirely ban transactions with any iranian banks fearing that possibility iran reportedly moved 75 billion out of european banks in may 2008 limiting lending to iran by banks or international financial institutions another option is to ban lending to iran by international financial institutions or to mandate reduction of official credit guarantees british prime minister brown indicated british support limitation of official credits on november 12 2007 as discussed below eu countries and their banks have begun taking these steps even without specific mandate banning worldwide investment in iran s energy sector this option would represent an internationalization of the us iran sanctions act which is discussed below and in crs report rs20871 the iran sanctions act isa by kenneth katzman in his november 12 2007 comments brown expressed support for worldwide financing of energy projects in iran as means of cutting off energy development in iran others oppose this step at time of relatively high world energy prices banning insurance for iranian shipping one option reportedly under consideration by the p51 is to ban the provision of insurance for irans tanker fleet shipments of iranian oil require insurance against losses from military action accidents or other causes broad ban on provision of such insurance could make it difficult for iran to islamic republic of iran shipping lines to operate and force iran to rely on more expensive shipping options iran said in september 2008 that it would have ways to circumvent the effect of this sanction if it is imposed imposing worldwide ban on sales of arms to iran resolution 1747 called forbut did not requireun member states to exercise restraint in selling arms to iran future resolution might mandate such an arms sales ban another option under discussion is to eliminate the resolution 1737 exemption from sanctions for the bushehr nuclear reactor project although russian support for such move is in doubt imposing an international ban on purchases of iranian oil or other trade this is widely considered the most sweeping of sanctions that might be imposed and would be unlikely to be considered in the security council unless iran was found actively developing an actual nuclear weapon virtually all us allies conduct extensive trade with iran and would oppose sanctions on trade in civilian goods with iran ban on oil purchases from iran is unlikely to be imposed because world oil prices remain nearly 100 per barrel and could go far higher if

and incentivesnot just economic or political punishmentsas tools to change irans behavior during 19921997 when the united states was tightening its own sanctions against iran the european union eu countries maintained policy of critical dialogue with iran and the eu and japan refused to join the 1995 us trade and investment ban on iran the european dialogue with iran was suspended in april 1997 in response to the german terrorism trial mykonos trial that found highlevel iranian involvement in killing iranian dissidents in germany but resumed in may 1998 during khatemis presidency with iran defiant on nuclear issues the european countries japan and other countries have moved closer to the us position the eu is longer negotiating new trade agreements and other economic interaction with iran but rather it has begun to implement some sanctions that exceed those mandated in security council resolutions for example several eu countries are discouraging their companies from making any new investments in or soliciting any new business with iran in addition several eu countries report that civilian trade with iran is down because irans defiance on the nuclear issue is introducing more perceived risk to trading with iran negotiations with iran on trade and cooperation agreement tca are longer being held such an agreement would have lowered the tariffs or increased quotas for iranian exports to the eu countries during the active period of talks which began in december 2002 there were working groups focused not only on the tca terms and proliferation issues but also on irans human rights record irans efforts to derail the middle east peace process iraniansponsored terrorism counternarcotics refugees migration issues and the iranian opposition pmoi similarly there is

national security issues and that usiran relations might not improve unless or until the islamic regime is removed or moderates substantially even if nuclear deal is reached and implemented the administration and many experts believe that iran has become emboldened by the installation of proiranian regimes in iraq and afghanistan and the new strength of hezbollah in lebanon and that iran now seeks to press its advantage to strengthen regional shiite movements and possibly drive the united states out of the gulf others reach an opposite conclusion stating that iran now feels more encircled than ever by prous regimes and us forces guided by policy of preemption and iran is redoubling its efforts to develop wmd and other capabilities to deter the united states some say that despite ahmadinejads presidency the united states and iran have common interest in stability in the persian gulf and south asia regions in the aftermath of the defeat of the taliban 67 see crs report rl31258
