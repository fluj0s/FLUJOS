policy act of 2005 hr 6 by brent d yacobucci mary tiemann james mccarthy and aaron m flynn 2 however mtbe is not only used as an oxygenate mtbe is also used to extend gasoline stocks and to increase octanesteps to ban or regulate its use the mo st significant of these bans in california new york and connecticut t ook effect at the end of 20031 the law repeals the clean air act requirement to use oxygenates in rfg eliminating key incentive for refiners to use mtbe2 the repeal will take effect on may 5 2006 270 days after enactment ex cept in california where it took effect immediately upon enactment august 8 2005 both the house and senate versions of hr 6 would also have banned the use of mtbe in motor vehicle fuel nationwide with some exceptions in 2014 or 2009 resp ectively the enacted version does not contain ban however effectively leaving the matter to the states to decide individually in place of the oxygen requirement p l 10958 establishes new requirement that an increasing amount of gasoline cont ain renewable fuels ch as ethanol the law requires that motor fuels contain at least 40 billion gallons of renewables in 2006 and requires an increase of 700 million gallons each year through 2011 before reaching level of 75 billion gallons in 2012 in 2004 about 34 billion gallons of ethanol were used in motor fuels the law also authorizes funds to clean up mtbe contamination in groundwater as discusse d further in the next section below the enacted law also contains antiback sliding provisions to preserve the reductions in emissions of toxic substan ces achieved by the rfg program the baseline emissions are set as the quantity emitted in 2001 and 2002 the most controversial of the mtbe pr ovisions was dropped in conference safe harbor that the house bill would have provided for fuels containing mtbe the safe harbor from liability would have meant that such fuels could not be deemed defective in design or manufacture by virtue of the fact that they contained mtbe the effect of this provision would have b een to protect anyone in the product chain from manufacturers to retaile rs from liability for cleanup of mtbe or for personal injury or property damage based on the na ture of the product defective product liability is legal approach that has been used in california to require refiners to shoulder liability for mtbe cleanup if liability for manufacturing and design defects had been ruled out plaintiffs woul d have needed to demonstrate negligence in the handling of such fuels to establish liability more difficult legal standard to meet the house version of the bill had set retroactive effective date of september 5 2003 for the safe harbor rath er than the date of enactment this effective date would have protected oil and chemical industry defendants fromhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32873crs3 3 for further discussion see crs report rs21676 the safe harbor provision for methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe by aaron

prepared by james mccart hy specialist in environmental policy mtbe and leaking underground storage tanks as part of the legislative effort to address drinking wa ter contamination by mtbe pl 10958 title xv subtitle b amends subtitle i of the solid waste disposal act swda to allow funds appropriated from the leaking underground storage tank lust trust fund to be used to enforce us t leak prevention regulations and authorizes appropriations from the fund sp ecifically for remediating gasoline tank leaks involving mtbe and othe r oxygenated fuels including ethanol the subtitle adds several leak prevention provisions and new requirements for states epa and tank owners and makes other changes to the underground storage tank ust regulatory program to address nationwide groundwater c ontamination problem caused by leaking underground storage tanks congress created the ust leak prevention detection and cleanup program in 1984 solid waste dispos act subtitle i in 1986 congress established the lust trust fund to help ep and states pay the costs of cleaning up leaking petroleum usts where owners fa il to do so and to oversee lust cleanup activities while much progress has been made in the program several issues remain major issue has concerned the discovery of mtbe at thousands of lust sites across the country this gasoline additiv which has been used to reduce air pollution from auto emissions is very wate r soluble once released mtbe tends to spread further than conventional gasoline consequently these leaks are more likely to reach water supplies and ar more costly to remediate4 another issue is that state resources have not met th demands of overseeing th ust regulatory program which is aimed at preventing leaks stat have sought larg er appropriations from the trust fund to support the lust program and some have sought flexibility to use lust funds to enforce the us t leak prevention regulationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32873crs4 5 for more information on the lust program see crs report rs21201 leaking underground storage tanks program status and issues by mary tiemann for discussion of mtbe issu see crs report rl32787 mtbe in gasoline clean air and drinking water issues by james mccarthy and mary tiemannsubtitle b which is based on the house bill adds several leak prevention provisions to the ust program it require s epa or states to conduct compliance inspections of usts every three years prohibits fuel delivery to ineligible tanks directs states to develop tr aining requirements for pers ons responsible for operating and maintaining tanks nd responding to spills cl arifies and expands ust compliance requirements for federal facilities and requires epa with indian tribes to develop and implement strategy to address releases on tribal lands the subtitle further requires that when determining th portion of cleanup costs to recover from tank owner or operator epa or state must consider the owner or operators ability to pay for cleanup and still ma intain basic business operati ons it also allows epa and states to use lust funds to conduc t inspections and enforce ust release prevention and det ection requirements to further protect groundwater the enacted law requires states to do one of the following 1 require that new tanks are secondarily containe d and monitored for leaks if the tank is within 1000 feet of community water system or potable well or 2 require that ust manufacturers and in stallers maintain evidence of financial responsibility to pay for corrective actions and require that persons installing ust systems are certified or licensed or that their ust system installation is certified by professional engineer or inspected and pproved by the state or is compliant with code of practice or other method that is less protective of human health and the environment this subtitle authorizes appropriations from the lust trust fund for each of fy2005 through fy2009 of 200 million for cleaning up leaks from petroleum tanks generally and anot her 200 million for responding to tank leaks involving mtbe or other oxygenated fuel additives eg ethanol it also authorizes to be appropriated from the trust fund fo r each of fy2005 through fy2009 155 million for epa and states to administer the lust cleanup program and to enforce the ust leak prevention requirements from gene ral revenues it authorizes 50 million to be appropriated for each of fy2005 through fy 2009 for epa and states to administer the remainder of subtitle i this section prepared by mary tiema nn specialist in environmental policy5 climate change title xvi of pl 10958 establishes voluntary national pr ogram designed to accelerate demonstration and deployment of lesscarbonintensive technology to encourage voluntary reductions in greenhous gases the sections of this title attempt to pport actions focu sed on reducing us carbon intensity the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross domestic product the enacted law does not establish requirement to reduce emissions this title also establishes programhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32873crs5 to encourage exports of carbon intens ityreducing technologies to developing countries title xvi contains provisions similar to those added to the bill on the senate floor by amendments that incor porated language found in s 883 and s 887 the house bill did not expressly address climate change issues included in the senate bill but dropped in conference was sense of the senate resolution that human activities are substantial cause of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere causing average temperatures to rise further the resolution stated that congress should enact comprehensive and effective national program of mandatory marketbased limits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse gases that slow stop and reverse the growth of such emissions at rate and in manner that 1 will not sign ificantly harm the united states economy and 2 will encourage comparable action by other nations that are major trading partners and key contributors to global emissions this is the first sense of the senate resolution on climate change si nce sres 98 was passed in 1997 which voiced concern over the economic effects of emissions limits and the sense that developing countries must participate in meaningful action to control emissions the senate also debated whether to adopt samdt 826 which contained language similar to s 1151 the climate stewardship and innovation act of 2005 this amendment would have established mandatory capandtrade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions from covered entitie s to year 2000 levels by 2010 this amendment was rejected on 3860 vote greenhouse gas emissions and climate change have been an issue of congressional interest for over two decades in 1993 the united states ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which called on industrialized countries to take the lead in making voluntary efforts to reduce greenhouse gases subsequently va riety of voluntary and regulatory actions have been proposed or undertaken in th united states including monitoring of utility carbon dioxide emissions improved ppliance efficiency and incentives for developing renewable energy sources many of these policies were enacted as part of the energy policy act of 1992 howeve r debate over the causes and effects of climate change as well as the potentia l costs of any greenhouse gas reduction strategy curtailed legisla tive action concerning the issue in 2001 president george w bush rejected the kyoto protocol to the unfccc which called for legally binding commitments by developed count ries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions instead the bush administra tion has focused on voluntary actions to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the us economy this section prepared by brent yacobucci specialist in energy policy oil and gas

rules the issue arises from stormwater permitting rules for small construction sites and municipal separate storm sewer systems that were issued by epa in 1999 and became effective march 10 2003 those rules known as phase ii of the cwa stormwater program require most small construction s ites disturbing one to five acres and municipal separa storm sewer systems rving populations of up to 100000 people to have cwa di scharge permit the per mits require pollution prevention plans describing practices for curbing sediment and other pollutants from being washed by stormwater runoff into local water bodies phase i of the stormwater program required c onstruction sites larger than five acres including oil and gas facilities and larger municipal separate storm sewer systems to obtain discharge permits beginning in 1991 as the march 2003 phase ii compliance deadline approached epa authorized twoyear extension of the rules for small oil and gas construction sites to allow the agency to assess the economic impact on th at industry epa had initially assumed that most oil and gas facilities would be smaller than one acre in size and thus excluded from the phase ii rules but newe r data developed fo r the department of energy indicate that up to 30000 new sites per year would be of sizes subject to the rules6 in february 2005 report gao repor ted that the actual number of oil and gas construction activities that could be affected is uncertain and the financial and environmental implications including dditional environmental protections are difficult to quantify7 in march 2005 epa extended the exemption until june 2006 and said it would propose specific rule fo r small oil and gas construction sites by september 2005 and issue final rule in june 2006 section 323 of the law make s epas regulatory dela permanent and makes it applicable to construction activities at all oil and gas development and production sites regardless of size including those covered by phase i rules industry had argued that the stormwater rule creates timeconsuming permitting requirements even though the short construction period for drilling sites carries little potential for stormwater runoff pollution supporters said the amendment was intended to clarify existing cwa language opponents argued that there is evidence that construction at oil and gas sites causes less pollution than other construction activities which are regulate d under epas stormwater pr ogram the legislative provision originated in housepassed hr 6 the senate bill did not include similarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32873crs7 8 the senate version of hr 6 in the 108th congress had called for epa to prepare study of the known and potential effects of hy draulic fracturing on underground sources of drinking water and for the national academy of sciences to provide for an independent review of the study as passed in the 109th congress pl 10958 section 1811 calls for the national academy of sciences to conduct study on the effect of coalbed natural gas production on surface and ground water resources including drinking wa ter in montana wyoming colorado new mexico north dakota and utah 9 in 2000 second suit was filed against epa for approving alabamas revised uic program when it contained several alleged defi ciencies legal environmental assistance foundation inc v us epa 276 f3d 1253 11th cir 2001 the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit directed epa to require alabam to regulate hydraulic fracturing under sdwa the court determined that epa coul d regulate hydraulic fracturing under sdwas more flexible state oil and gas provisions in section 1425 rather than the more stringent underground injection control requirements of section 1422language as result of the provision in the enacted law which is intended to exempt from the cwa all uncontaminated stormwater discharges that occur while setting up drilling operations epa is expected to modify the rule that it said would be proposed in september 2005 devel oping new rule for discharges of contaminated stormwater fro m oil and gas operations this section prepared by claudia copeland specialist in resources and environmental policy hydraulic fracturing drinking water regulation section 322 of pl 10958 amends th safe drinking water act sdwa section 1421d to specify that the defi nition of underground injection excludes the injection of fluids or propping agents ther than diesel fuels used in hydraulic fracturing operations related to oil gas or geotherm production activities this language prevents epa from regulating the underground injection of fluids for hydraulic fracturing purposes thus removing epas existing authority to do so under sdwa as needed to protect sources of dr inking water it also would effectively overturn two court rulings the provision is based on the house bill conferees added the references to dies fuel and geothermal pr oduction activities the senate bill contained similar provision8 the sdwa requires controls on the underg round injection of fluids to protect underground sources of drinking water ep had not considered hydraulic fracturing to fall within the regulatory definiti on of underground injection until 1997 when the us court of appeals for the 11th circuit ruled that the hydraulic fracturing of coal beds for methane production constitute s underground injection and must be regulated this decision applied only to alabama leaf v epa 118 f 3d 14679 while the practice of hydraulic fracturing has been used in the recovery of conventional oil and gas since the 1950s this practice has been applied for recoveryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32873crs8 10 demand for natural gas new technologies federal tax credits and the identification of shallow coal formations have led to drama tic growth in the coalbed methane development industry for example the us geological survey reports that the number of cbm wells in the powder river basin in wyoming and montana increased from 110 wells in may 1994 to 5446 wells in may 2001 testimony of dr gene whitney supervisory geologist us geological survey before the committee on

drinking water by hydraulic fractu ring of coalbed methane reservoirs washington dc june 2004 pp 43 44 12 ibid p 311 13 ibid pp 16 according to epa hydraulic fra cturing of oil and gas found in conventional geologic traps is well established however hy draulic fracturing of coal beds is relatively new conventional sites are usually more than 1000 feet deep and typically involve highly saline ground water that is unsuitable for drinking water in contrast geologic formations that contain coal bed methane can be near the surface where ground water may be used as source of drinking water supplies 14 ibid pp 49 410of coalbed methane primarily since the mid1990s10 hydraulic fracturing involves the highpressure injection of fluids into co beds to enhance the recovery of oil and natural gas from underg round formati ons waterbased fluids are used commonly as fracturing fluids but the industry reports that diesel fuel often is used also methanol and various toxic chemical s are used in fracturing fluids11 the volume of fracturing and stimulation fluids injected into each well for coalbed fracturing is estimated to range from 55000 gallons to 350000 gallons12 growing concern reported by epa is that in many coalbed methane producing regions the target coalbeds occur within usdws underground sources of drinking water and the fracturing pro cess injects stimulation fluids directly into the usdws13 epa has determined that the use of diesel fuel as fracturing fluid introduces benzene and other toxic and carcinogenic substances directly into underground sources of drinking water14 also because the process fractures rock fracturing can create new pathways for natural gas primarily methane and other contaminants to enter drinking water aq uifers as the number of coalbed methane cbm wells and the use of hydraulic fracturing have increased rapidly in recent years so has concern over the potential impact on water resources pa rticularly in the waterscarce west and very few studies ve been done to evaluate these impacts in january 2003 epas national drinking water advisory council established by congress under sdwa submitted to the epa administrator report on hydraulic fracturing underground injection control and coalbed methane production and its impacts on water quality and wa ter resources the council noted several concerns including the use of diesel fuel and toxic additives in the hydraulic fracturing processhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32873crs9 15 national drinking water advisory council report on hydraulic fracturing and underground

development on local underground water resources and on the quality of surface waters15 the advisory council recommended that epa work through regulatory or voluntary means to eliminate the use of diesel fuel and related additives in fracturing fluids that are injected into formations containing sources of drinking water in 2003 epa entered into an agreement with thr ee companies that provide most hydraulic fracturing services bj services hallibur ton energy services and schlumberger technology corporation16 under this voluntary agr eement the firms conditionally agree to remove diesel fuel from cbm fluids injected directly into drinking water sources if costeffective alternatives are available epa has not sought to limit other toxic components in fracturing fluids and other companies did not agree to cease injecting diesel fuel into drinking water sources the national drinking water advisory council further recommended that epa continue to study the extent and nature of public health and environmental problems that could occur as result of hydraulic fracturing for coalbed methane production and defend its authority to implement th uic program in manner that protects groundwater resources from contamina tion however oil and gas industry representatives argue that regulation is unneeded and would slow natural gas development in response to the 1997 court decision and citizen complaints about water contamination attributed to hydraulic fr acturing epa began to study the impacts of hydraulic fracturing practices used in cbm production on drinking water sources and to determine whether fu rther regulation was needed in 2002 epa issued draft report that identified alleged water quality and quantity problems attributed to hydraulic fracturing in alabama ne w mexico colorado wyoming montana virginia and west virginia17 based on the preliminary results of the study epa tentatively concluded that the potential threats to public health posed by hydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane we lls appeared to be small in 2004 epa issued final report based primarily on review of the available literature and concluded that the injection of hydraulic fracturing

air quality ozone nonattainment area deadlines section 1443 of the house version of hr 6 would have amended the clean air act to extend deadlines for areas that have not attained the ozone air quality standard if upwind areas significantly contribut to their nonattainment under the 1990 clean air act amendments ozone nonattainme nt areas with higher concentrations of the pollutant were given more time to reach attainme nt but in return for the additional time they were required to implement more stringent controls on emissions failure to reach attainment by the specified deadline was to result in reclassification of an area to higher category and the imposition of more stringent controls section 1443 would have amended this system to extend deadlines without requiring more stringent controls in areas affected by upwind sources of pollution there was comparable provision in the senate bill and the conferees did not include the house provision in the enacted law the enacted version

environmental requirements pl 10958 includes variety of provisions applicable to several categories of energy projects that are intended to expedite the process for completing or complying with environmental requirements commonly referred to as streamlining these provisions are most often specified for complex federal actions such as oil and gas development projects that may trigger compliance with literallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32873crs13 dozens of federal state tribal and cal environmental stat utory and regulatory requirements such projects in turn may require the partic ipation or input of possibly dozens of agencies proponents of streamlining provisions indicate that they are intended to better coordinate the interagency consultations necessary to complete applicable environmen tal requirements the environmental streamlining provisions in the enacted law primarily specify procedures intended to expedite the process for obtaining federal authorizations eg permits special use authorizations or approvals or to comply with the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa pl 91190 fe deral authorizations for given category of energy projects may be required under any of number of local state tribal or federa l requirements eg permitting requirements under the clean air act or the clean water act some element of nepa compliance is required of all federal actions potentially impacting the environment nepa requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their proposed acti ons before final decisions are ma for proposed federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment nepa requires federal agencies to provide detailed statement of environmental impacts referred to as an environmental impact statement eis projects for which it is not initially clear whether impacts will be significant require the preparation of an environmental assessment ea to determine the level of significance of the actions impacts projects that do not individually or cumula tively have significant social economic or environmental effect and have been determined from past experience to have significant impact are categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare and eis or an ea streamlining provisions re garding nepa often propose legislative or administrative procedures intended to ex pedite the process for completing the necessary nepa documentation methods of expediting federal author izations or nepa compliance include designating specific agency eg the department of energy or the federal energy regulatory commission as the lead agency to coordinate applicable federal authorizations specifying procedures to c oordinate interagency consultations often accomplished through the creation of memorandum of understanding between agencies specifying project milestones and deadlines andor designating specific types of projects that will be considered categorical exclusions some members of congress have argued that streamlining provisions in pl 10958 are needed to reduce delays and more efficiently facilitate delivery of needed projects others members have argued that they are unnecessary or may undercut needed environmental protection categories of projects or actions for which environmental streamlining provisions are provided include coordination of geothermal leasing
