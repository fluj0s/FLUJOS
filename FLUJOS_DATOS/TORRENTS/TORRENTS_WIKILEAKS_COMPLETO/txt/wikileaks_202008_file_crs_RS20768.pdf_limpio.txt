house apportionment formula in theory and practice by royce crocker for an explanation of formula for allocating house seats each states claim to representation in the house is based on priority value determined by the following formula pv p n n 1 ½ where pv the states priority value p the states population and n the states nth seat in the house for example the priority value of wisconsins 9th seat

allocated b these figures represent the population state would either need to lose in order to drop below the 435th seat cutoff or to gain to rise above the cutoff if in the case of wisconsin 109696 more persons had been counted in the census the states priority value would have been increased to 64593077 which would have resulted in new sequence number of 435 b ecause north carolinas 13th seat would have occupied the 436th position in the priority list options for states losing seats the apportionment counts transmitted by the census bureau to the president who then sends them to congress are considered final thus most states which will lose seatshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20768crs5 4 after the 1990 census montana and massachusetts challenged the apportionment formula and the inclusion of the foreignbased military nd civilians in the apportionment population the supreme court affirmed the constitutionality of the equal proportions formula and the inclusion of the foreignbased military and civ ilians in the counts in two separate cases us dept of commerce v montana 112 sct 1415 1992 and franklin v massachusetts 112 sct 2767 1992 5 for fuller discussion of this topic see crs

house any other opti on such as changing the formula used in the computations or changing the components of the apportionment population such as omitting the foreignbased military and federal civilian employees will only affect small number of states if the house stays at 435 seats4 as noted above th 435seat limit was imposed in 1929 by 46 stat 21 2627 altering the size of the house would require new law setting different limit article 1 section 2 of the constitution establishes min imum house size one representative for each state and maximum house size one for every 30000 or 9380 based on the 2000 census in 2003 house size of 473 would result in states losing seats they held from the 103rd to the 107th congresses but by retaining seats through an increase in the house size other states would also have their delegations b ecome larger at house size of 473 californias delegation size for ex ample would be 57 instead of 53 seats5 the redistri cting process the apportionment figures released on december 28 2000 are made up of three components total resident population figu res for the 50 states and the district of columbia the foreignbased milita ry and other federal employ ees allocated to each state and dc and sum of these numbers wh ich become the apportionment population these numbers minus dc are all that is needed to reapportion the house but the states need figures for very small geographic areas in order to draw new legislative and congressional districts the census bureau must provide small area population totals to the legislature and governor of each state

created by many states in the 1990s to maximize minority representation beginning with shaw v reno 509 us 630 1993 the court ended the decade by establishing new principles c oncerning such practices 1 race may be considered in districting to remedy past discrimination 2 but states must have compelling state interest to ignore traditional redistricting principles and gerrymander to establish majorityminority districts 3 courts will apply strict scrutiny to such assertions that racial gerrymanders are necessary to determine whether such plans are narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling
