offered after the previous question has been ordered on measure but before the house votes on final passage preference in recognition for offering motion to recommit is given to member of the minority party who is opposed to the bill it is not in order for the house committee on rules to report special rule that would preclude the offering motion to recommit bill or joint resolution prior to its initial passage including motion to recommit which contains amendatory instructions motions to recommit might be organized into three categories straight motions without instructions motions with forthwith inst ructions and motions with nonforthwith instructions if adopted straight motions and motions with nonforthwith instructions send measure to committee with requirement for further consideration by the house successful motion to recommit with instructions to report b ack forthwith allows any amendatory language included in the motion to be adopted immediatel without the measure leaving the house floor motion to recommit may have various procedural effects including amending an underlying measure sending it to one or more committees providing additional time for its consideration or potentially disposing of the legislation the motion to recommit might also have political effects because motion to recommit allows recorded vote on policy alternative put forth by the minority party it may create politically difficult situation for members who support both the underlying measure and the instructions in the motion to recommit in some circumstances forcing them to choose between supporting particular policy and delaying or possibly killing the bill thus far in the 110 th congress there have been three statistical trends pertaining to motions to recommit an increase in the total number of motions to recommit disproportionate increase in motions with nonforthwith instructions and rise in the adoption of motions to recommit forthwith these trends have fostered discussion of changes to current house rules governing the use of the motion to recommit some have expressed support for changing chamber rules in way that would limit specific difficulties for the majority posed by the motion to recommit while still preserving the original intent of the motion to allow the minority to have an opportunity to get vote on policy option of their choosing others have argued that change in present rules is warranted or desirable this report provides an overview of house rules and precedents governing the motion to recommit examines the use of the motion in the 110 th congress and discusses arguments both favoring and opposing changing house procedures governing the motion this report will be updated to reflect any changes in house rules go verning

house considers legislation one of the last steps it takes is to consider motion to recommit the motion to recommit represents the last chance of the house to affect measure in practice that means either to offer amendatory language or to send the bill back to committee in practice the motion to recommit as authorized by rule xix is offered after the previous question has been ordered on passage2 for these motions the speaker affords priority in recognition to those opposed to the measure3 giving preference among those opposed to minority party member4 which has resulted in the motion being dubbed the minoritys motion among minority opponents priority to offer the motion is given first to the minority leader or his designee and then to members from the reporting committee in order of their committee seniority5 only one proper motion to recommit is in order if motion to recommit is ruled out of order second proper motion to recommit may be offered6 although uncommon in practice motion to recommit may be amended but only if the previous question has not yet been ordered on the motion motion to recommit offered after the previous question has been ordered on the bill may not be tabled7 house rules specifically prohibit the house committee on rules from reporting special rule which prevents the motion to recommit from being offered on initial final passage of bill or joint resolution8 and guarantees that the motion may include instructions which include an amendment otherwise in order if offered by the minority leader or his designee9 this guarantee does not apply to consideration of senate bill for which the text of housepassed measure has been substituted because the motion would have already been protected during consideration of the housepassed measure 1 crs intern benjamin tycz assisted in ga thering statistical data for this report 2 the motion to recommit may also be in order pending the motion for the previous question although in practice it is typically offered only after the previous question has been ordered the information in this report involves those motions to recommit in order after the previous question has been ordered on the measure the rules and practices described do not necessarily apply to motions to recommit conference reports for more information regarding the recomittal of conference repor ts see crs report rl33860

which include instructions the first type referred to as simple or straight motion to recommit includes instructions and is nondebatable if adopted by the house it returns the underlying measure to committee when straight motion to recommit is offered the clerk will report it in the following form mr obey of wisconsin moves to recommit the bill hr 3010 to the committee on appropriations10 the other two types of motions to recommit both include some type of instruction and are debatable for 10 minutes11 the majority floor manager of bill or joint resolution may ask that debate time be extended to one hour in either case debate time is equally divided between the member making the motion and member opposing it the two types of motions to recommit with instructions may be distinguished by the inclusion or absence of the term forthwith motion to recommit with instructions that co mmittee report back forthwith always contains language seeking to amend the underlying measure if the house adopts such motion the measure remains on the house floor and the committee chair or designee immediately rises and reports the bill back to the house with any ame ndments contained in the instructions of the recommittal motion the house votes on agreeing to the amendments before moving to final passage of the bill as it may have been amended the inclusion of the term forthwith meaning at once allows the motion to amend the bill without it ever leaving the floor when this type of motion to recommit is offered the clerk will report it in the following form mr hunter moves to recommit the bill hr 3159 to the committee on armed services with instructions to report the same back to the h ouse forthwith with the following amendments in subsections a1 and b1 of section 2 strike unit each place it appears and insert the following subject to section 3 unit 12 if the house adopts motion to recommit with instructions that do not include the term forthwith hereinafter referred to as motions with nonforthwith13 instructions the measure would return to the specified committee whose even tual report if any would not be immediately or automatically before the house motions to recommit that direct committee to report back to the house promptly are included in this category it should be noted that the inclusion of the term promptly conveys special parliamentary significance only the motions lack of forthwith nonforthwith instructions in motion to recommit may include amendatory language or may instruct specified committees to take some action such as conducting further research or holding hearings nonforthwith instructions in motion to recommit are 10 congressional record daily edition vol 151 june 24 2005 ph5163 11 because house rule xix clause 2b specifically provides for debate only when the motion is offered to bill or joint resolution there is none on simple or concurrent resolution 12 congressional record daily edition vol 153 august 2 2007 p h9576 13 nonforthwith is term that has been used by the pres iding officer to describe motions to recommit not including the term forthwith for example unlike the case of motion to recommit with instructions to report back forthwith motion to recommit with nonforthwith instructions would not occasion an immediate report on the floor congressional record daily edition vol 153

instructions in motion to recommit generally may not propose to do that which may not be done by amendment under the rules of the house16 for example instructions that do any of the following would be out of order propose an amendment that is not germane to the measure amend or eliminate an amendment already adopted by the house unless permitted by special rule propose an amendment in violation of rule xxi clause 24 or 5 if the motion is offered forthwith17 propose an amendment in violation of rule xxi clause 10 the paygo rule18 if the motion is offered forthwith and authorize committee to report at any time or direct committee to report by date certain19 members may sometimes prefer to offer motion to recommit with nonforthwith instructions instead of motion with forthwith instructions because of differing restrictions on each type of motion for example the restriction on language that would violate rule xxi clause 10 the paygo rule applies to motion with forthwith instructions since if successful the amendment to the bill would be reported immediately but not to motion with nonforthwith instructions whereby measure is sent to committee for further consideration and would be subject to paygo requirements only if rereported member therefore with motion to recommit with amendatory instructions that viol ate that rule might choose to offer the motion with nonforthwith instructions to avoid an i mmediate point of order an example of member providing such an explanation for offering motion to recommit with nonforthwith instructions to avoid specific point of order is presented below as the majority knows the housing fund in this bill section 139 on page 127 is violation of rule xxi clause 4 because it is appropriating on an authorizing bill the democrat rule waives this rule for the underlying bill but does not provide waiver for the motion to recommit or any amendments therefore the nority was given other option than to offer motion to recommit promptly with nonforthwith instructions and comply with house rules 20 16 house manual 1002b 17 generally these rules prohibit consideration of unauthorized appropriations legislation on an appropriations bill appropriations on bills not reported by the committee on appropriations and taxes or tariffs in bills not reported from the committee on ways and means 18 the house paygo rule requires that legislation affecting direct spending or revenues must not increase the deficit 19 house manual 1002b 20 statement of rep cantor in reference to hr 1427 congressional record daily edition vol 153 may

antecedents in the british parliament and has existed since the first congress prior to 1909 however it operated differently than it does today and priority in recognition for the offering of the motion to recommit was not reserved for member opposed to the measure instead as former speaker of the house joseph g cannon remarked the object of this provision for motion to recommit was as the chair has always understood that the motion should be made by one friendly to the bill 21 often the majority floor manager of bill would make straight motion to recommit with the expectation that it would be defeated since only one proper motion to recommit is in order this would preclude anyone else from trying to use the motion in order to defeat or amend the measure for most of the history of the house the purpose of the motion to recommit more closely resembled the current usage of the motion to reconsider recommittal provided members with final opportunity to correct errors within the measure and in 1891 the speaker ruled that bill could be recommitted forthwith meaning the committee chair would report the amendments in the motion at once without the bill having to be sent back to committee formally 22 the use of the motion to recommit changed substantially in 1909 as result of changes made in house procedures championed largely by coal ition of democrats and progressive republicans who opposed the autocratic rule of speaker cannon during debate on the adoption of the rules package for the 61st congress 19091910 the previous question was defeated allowing representative john fitzgerald to propose set of rules changes one of which guaranteed priority in recognition to offer the motion to recommit to member opposed to the bill this rules change was offered with the stated purpose of giving the minority the right to have vote upon its position upon great public questions 23 further the fitzgerald amendment prohibited the rules committee from reporting any special rule that would prevent the offering of motion to recommit this amended rules package passed 211 to 173 it was not until 1932 however that precedent definitively established giving priority in recognition to offer the motion to minority party member opposed to the bill24 this solidified the motion as minority right at the beginning of the 92nd congress the language now contained in house rule xix clause 2b was added to the standing rules allowing ten minutes of debate on motion to recommit with instructions equally divided between proponent and an opponent 25 21

of the whole in order for the first time26 causing some to question whether the motion to recommit had become redundant or unnecessary an earlier ruling by the speaker pro tempore noted that in the committee of the whole there is rollcall vote so that the only opportunity that minority may have to go on record is by means of motion to recommit in the house27 since the rules now allowed for recorded votes in the committee of the whole some argued that the motions main purpose could be achieved in other ways making the motion to recommit much less necessary28 the right of the minority to offer motion to recommit however remained intact even in light of the expanded rules on voting following the successful adoption of motion to recommit in 1984 that included the crime bill as amendatory instructions the house decided that ten minutes of debate might not always be sufficient since these motions had the potential of adding substantial portions of legislation to an underlying measure 29 at the start of the 99th congress the current language in clause 2c of the rule was added allowing the majority floor manager to demand that debate time on the motion be extended to one hour equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent to date the one hour extension has been demanded only once30 during the 1980s and 1990s the rules committee issued what the minority perceived to be an increased number of special rules restricting both the amending process as well as the motion to recommit 31 in 1995 the house added language now in rule xii clause 6c prohibiting the rules committee from reporting special rule that would prevent the offering of motion to recommit with instructions thereby preventing the rules committee from restricting the scope or content of the motion to recommit 26 hres1123 92nd congress agreed to in the house on october 13 1972 27 the ruling was made on may 19 1932 cannons precedents vol viii 2698 28 statement of stanley

g20g142g140g152g150g150g146g157g561 motion to recommit may have several procedural effects first it allows the minority to offer and obtain vote on policy language of their design an opportunity which might otherwise be unavailable if the measure is being considered under the terms of special rule that restricts or prevents the offering of amendments further motion to recommit grants the minority the last opportunity to amend legislation before final passage the motion to recommit even allows the offering of an amendment previously rejected by the house during consideration in committee of the whole32 house approval of straight motion to recomm it or motion to recomm it with nonforthwith instructions could have the effect of sending the bill back to the committee from which it was reported for further work on the measure if the underlying legislation was not first reported by the committee of jurisdiction before coming to the floor either because it was never referred to committee or because the committee was discharged from further consideration of the bill the minority might try to use the motion as way to put the legislation before the committee for their consideration 33 motion to recommit can also send measure to committee to which the bill had not been originally referred34 this kind of action could be tied to the creation of an ad hoc committee such as in the following example mr ryan of wisconsin moves to commit the re solution hres 6 to select committee composed of the majority leader and the minority leader with instructions to report back the same to the house forthwith with only the following amendment 35 an ad hoc committee like this has permanence and is not required to meet such motions to commit are frequently used in conjunction with the house rules package on the opening day of congress before standing committees have been established additionally the motion to recommit might seek to send the bill to committee to which it wasnt referred due to jurisdictional issues for example in 1975 straight motion to recommit attempted to send bill which had been reported by the committee on ways and means not only to that committee but also to the committee on interstate and foreign commerce as well this motion to recommit appeared to suggest that the goal of the underlying legislation might be achieved in additional ways under the jurisdiction of this second panel 36 32 deschlers precedents of the united states house of representatives h doc 94661 94th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 1977 vol 9 3527 p 827 33 this would technically

have the effect of providing more time for both formal and informal debate and consideration of the subject of the underlying legislation or the motion to recommit debate time for the underlying measure is often limited by the terms of special rule and the minority is provided only five minutes on motion to recommit motion to recommit with nonforthwith instructions therefore may have the effect of delaying vote on the measures final passage until further consideration has occurred in the 108 th congress 20032004 representative mike thompson stated unfortunately for americas seniors our motion to recommit will only get 5 minutes of discussion tonight 5 minutes to protect medicare from privatization 5 minutes to ensure rural seniors have benefit if the ppos do not come to their areas and for all of the members tonight who have said they are supporting the republican bill in order to move the debate the best way to do that is to support this recommit so we can promptly get measure back here in the morning to vote on 37 both straight motions to recommit without instructions and motions to recommit with non forthwith instructions could also create si tuation that would effectively dispose of the underlying measure since once the measure is recommitted committee is not obligated to take further action as speaker pro tempore stated at some subsequent time the committee could meet and report the bill back to the house 38 it could be argued however that it would be unlikely for committee to report back measure which the house has voted to remove from the floor committees decision whether to act on recommitted measure might be influenced by house and committee rules for instance speaker pro tempore observed in response to parliamentary inquiry the chair cannot say what in the rules of committee might constrain the timing of any action it might take neither can the chair render an advisory opinion whether points of order available under the rules of the house might preclude further proceedings on the floor 39

position upon great public questions40 this seems to imply that the motion was intended to have not only procedural effects but also political ones allowing members to go on record as supporting or

additional political effects motion to recommit may combine several proposed amendments providing the opportunity to package together set of views as way to create comprehensive public record to emphasize the minority partys differences from the platform of the majority further motion to recommit with nonforthwith instructions may have the effect of creating difficult political choice for members who support both the underlying measure and the amendment contained in the motion to recommit if such proponents of the measure vote for the motion to recommit with nonfort hwith instructions they are voting to send the measure back to committee delaying or potentially killing the bill and perhaps breaking with their party however if such members vote against the motion to recommit with nonforthwith instructions in order to move the underlying bill to passage they may be on public record as having voted against policy that they and perhaps their constituents strongly support this may result in the members vote being used by an opponent in political commercial 41 some have argued that motions to recommit with nonfo rthwith instructions are designed to trap majority party members reluctant to vote against the motions amendment forcing them into loselose situation42 during the 110th congress for example there were two instances in which motion to recommit with nonforthwith instructions was offered and proceedings were then postponed pursuant to special rule43 some have further argued that the use of motions to recommit with nonforthwithinstructions including specific policy amendments should not be allowed since the motion could usually be offered forthwith which if successful would immediately incorporate the motions amendments on number of occasions members of the majority have voiced opposition to motions including amendatory language that merely repeats or reiterates current law or provision of the underlying legislation such instructions some have argued have legislative value and are included solely to put the majority in losing political situation one that might be misleading to constituents for example in one instance majority member stated mr speaker the fact is that under the bill hr 3043 money in the safe and drug free schools account can already be used for exactly the same purpose 44 in other examples member of the majority argued mr speaker the issue of this motion to recommit hr 100 is redundant not necessary and i would urge its defeat and urge passage of the legislation45 41 let em move roll call november 14 2007 p4 42 the republicans continue to use the motion to recommit for political purposes not substantive purposes substantive purposes would be trying to change policy for the most part what they do with their

201646 as described above using straight motion to recommit without instructions or motion to recommit with nonforthwith instructions can also have the effect of delaying or even killing measure since committee to which the measure is recommitted would never be required to act some members in the majority have expressed concern that such motions are therefore designed not to amend or improve the underlying legislation before passage as might be done in motion with forthwith instructions but to defe at the underlying legislation in the 107th congress for example representative william m thomas stated because that little word forthwith is missi ng and it requires it to be reported promptly the effect of this motion to recommit is to kill this bill47 in the 108th congress representative john boehner stated that the motion to recommit with nonforthwith instructions refers it back to the committee and we are prom ptly to deal with it for those of you who are not that familiar with the nuance that means the bill is dead forever48 in the 110th congress representative david r obey stated the membership should also understand that this recommit k ills the bill it is dressed up in language on fees but in fact it calls for the bill to be referred to the committee and reported back not forthwith and as members know that is device that kills the bill 49 other members have voiced frustration when the issue addressed in the motions amendatory instructions could have been offered during committee hearings or during consideration in the committee of the whole but was not amendment like this was offered in our committee this was never brought up in our deliberations in fact the gentleman was very clear in his arguments for the motion to recommit he is against the bill he was against the bill in committee and he is against the bill now now i think we ought to understand that if this were serious amendment it would have been forthwith motion but it is not it is promptly motion to kill the bill 50 46 remarks of rep grijalva in reference to the motion to recommit offered to hr 2016 congressional record daily edition vol 154 april 9 2008 p h2117 47 motion to

offering motion to recommit is to achieve political goal such as slowing or defeating legislation in 2007 representative david dreier inserted into the congressional record an article that stated in part one important role of an opposition party is to oppose opposition may include not only trying to defeat bill but also slow ing it down including sending it back to committee for more work yes straight motion to recommit without instructions would accomplish this same purpose but who is to say that the minority should not be able to score its own political points by sending bill back to committee with message attached 51 motions to recommit may also have the effect of providing an outlet for the minority to express its discontent with restrictions related to the openness or fairness of the legislative process for example minority dissatisfied with the number of measures brought up under suspension of the rules or the number of amendments its members have been allowed to offer in the committee of the whole may make use of their right to offer motion to recommit with instructions as means for expressing their opposition to the policies of the majority party

recommit in the 110th congress is comparable with totals of straight motions to recommit in the recent past with the range over the past five congresses being between zero and three see table 2 motions to recommit with forthwith instruc tions fluctuated between 20 and 48 during the period from the101st congress through the 109th however the 110th congress has seen significant rise with 72 motions to recommit with forthwith instructions 50 higher than the 48 offered in the 109th and 86 higher than the average of 387 for the past ten congresses the most significant increase in motions to recommit in the 110th congress however can be seen in the offering of motions with nonforthwit h instructions between 1989 and 2006 the number of motions with nonforthwith instructions have ranged from 1 to 16 per congress with an average of 82 the current total of motions to recommit with nonforthwith instructions in the 110 th congress is 47 more than 500 higher than the average

frequently53 since champ clark of missouri speaker of th house from 19111919 made this statement in 1916 members in the majority from both parties have often expressed similar views as one of the only procedural rights explicitly assigned to one political party in house rules it is procedural motion that has frequently sparked controversy for instance in 1992 the committee on rules convened roundtable discussion centered exclusively on the motion to recommit in response to concerns from both sides of the aisle as stated during the discussion there are conflicting interpretations of what the houses standing rules do and should mean as they affect the right of members of the minority party to move to recommit bills and joint resolutions to committee and especially to propose recommittal motions directing committees to report measures back to the floor forthwith with an amendment incorporated in the motion 54 53 cannons precedents vol viii 2264 54 statement of stanley bach

increased use and perceived misuse by some lawmakers of motions to recommit with nonforthwith instructions the major concern focuses on the effect of certain motions to recommit with nonforthwith instructions which may force member supporting both the underlying legislation and the amendment contained in the motion to recommit effectively to have to choose between them this has generated controversy and fostered some discussion of options to change the rules governing its practice 55 in thinking about rules change it bears considering how the original stated purpose of the 1909 rules change to give the minority the right to have vote on its position upon great public questions fits with the current practices given all of the changes that have taken place since then some may view change options as way to pare back modern effects and restore the motion to recommit to its initial purpose as voiced in 1909 while others may view any rules change as placing limitations on what they view as the minoritys well established right 56 the proposals discussed below are broken into two categories those not requiring change in house rules and those that do there is also section that discusses potential rules changes that would enhance the potential impact of the motion for the minority

just as the changes in frequency and success of the motion to recommit came not as result of changes in house rules but through changes in strategy further changes could also be result of changes in practice if the rules of the house remain the same the minority could revert to older patterns or continue to use the motion in the same manner it has recently highlighting their preferred policy options and sometimes using motions with nonforthwith instructions with the effect of forcing members to choose between policy options that they support one important factor however is that the practices of the majority in terms of how it brings measures to the floor and how it proceeds can have an impact on the number or type of opportunities presented and the effect the minority can have through the motion to recommit

might choose to consider measure under suspension of the rules by doing so motion to recommit would be in order the disadvantages of this option would be that super majority is required for passage and that members of neither the majority nor the minority would be able to offer amendments or raise points of order 57 an advantage would be that majority would be able to get straight up or down vote on question and be able to avoid the effect of motion to recommit with nonforthw ith instructions without having to make any change in the rules change in practice like this however would likely mean using suspension to consider 55 for example in democrats again look to change gop motions roll call october 31 2007 vol 53 52 p 3 the chairwoman of the house rules committee was repor ted as saying that the committees democrats had met with both current and former parliamentarians to discuss the chambers rules and potential changes focusing in part on the motion to recommit 56 for example in rep boehner if majority restricts motions to recommit republicans will have choice but to shut down the house us fed news october 31 2007 the house republican leader was quoted as saying house republicans deserve to represent the men and women in our districts in exactly the same way the minority party has since 1822 if the democratic leadership takes th is right the motion to recommit away they can expect the most vigorous fight yet from house republicans 57 for information regarding suspension of the rules see crs report 98314 suspension of the rules in the house principal features by

democratic and republican majorities have used suspension of the rules to act expeditiously on relatively noncontroversial legislation both have used it infrequently to consider major policy or funding questions change in practice of this nature could allow the majority to avoid difficult votes on motions to recommit in some instances but the practical limitation on the use of suspensions would still leave significant number of such opportunities on other measures g3g150g142g151g141g561g157g145g142g561g15g152g157g146g152g151g561g157g152g561g20g142g140g152g150g150g146g157g561 another option not involving change in house rules would be for the majority to amend the motion to recommit in the case of motions to recommit with nonforthwith instructions an amendment could be proposed to include or subs titute the term forthwith relieving some members from having to choose between two policy options that they support amending the motion to recommit could be done either by unanimous consent or by defeating the previous question and proposing changes to the motion one disadvantage of requesting unanimous consent to amend motion to recommit to include the term forthwith would be that consensus may be hard to achieve although it is not unheard of to amend motion to recommit by unanimous consent request to change the instructions from nonforthwith to forthwith could prove to be more controversial since it is reasonable to believe that the motions sponsor purposely chose to exclude forthwith for instance on february 26 2008 the majority leader representative steny hoyer asked representative michele bachmann the sponsor of motion to reco mmit with instructions if she would agree to unanimous consent request to add forthwith to the motions instructions representative bachmann stated that she would not because the goal she wished to achieve could not be attained by motion with forthwith instructions 58 disadvantage of defeating the previous quest ion to amend the motion to recommit would be that it might be viewed as limiting the minoritys right and may violate any implicit understanding between the parties to allow the minority straight vote on the motion as they wrote it it might also arguably contradict the stated purpose of the motion to recommitto give the minority an opportunity to vote upon its policy alternative defeating the previous question on motion to recommit is rare and has not occurred since the 107th congress59

are number of ways in which house rules could be changed that would have direct impact on the form or substance of the motion to recommit rules changes could be proposed at any time during session but would more likely be proposed at the beginning of congress as part of new rules package 58 congressional record daily edition vol 154 february 26 2008 p h1056 mr hoyer i thank the gentlelady would the

recommit could be directly or indirectly restricted by special rule in the rules of the 103rd congress rule xi clause 4b stated that the rules committee shall not report any rule or order which would prevent the motion to recommit from being made as provided in clause 4 of rule xvi this was interpreted as protecting the minoritys right to offer motion to recommit but not impeding the rules committee from reporting special rules that restricting what types of motions might be offered sometimes disallowing the offering of motions to recommit w ith amendatory instructions this differs from the current house rule xiii clause 6c which explicitly states that the rules committee may not report special rule that would prevent the offe ring of motion to recommit with instructions reverting back to the past form of the house rule could have the effect of preventing or allowing the majority to avoid motions to re commit with amendatory instructions relieving members of being caught off guard by motion to recommit or having to choose between two policies that he or she supports disadvantage of this option would be that it might be viewed as regressing to period when the original purpose of the motion to recommit to give the minority vote on their policy alternative was not protected in addition under the previous form of the rule the amendment process could have direct impact on the form of motion to recommit in particular the use of amendments in the nature of substitute for the entire text of the bill under consideration could make amendatory instructions in the motion to recommit out of order given the frequency with which such substitutes are used in current house practice this form of the rule could be controversial

the i ssues resulting from motions to recommit with nonforthwith instructions would be to change house rules to allow only straight motion to recommit or motion to recommit with forthwith instructions this would disallow any motions with nonforthwith instructions and like other options involving rules change may be viewed as tampering with or restricting the noritys right it would also limit or eliminate altogether the minoritys present ability to include nonamendatory instructions in the motion such as referring it back to committee for further research or hearings the same concern might alternately be dealt with by amending rule xix clause 2a to state that any amendatory instructions within motion to recommit must provide for an immediate return of the measure to the floor this way moti on to recommit with nonforthwithinstructions might still be offered but only if its instructions are nonamendatory this would create situation in which members would have the option of attaining vote on sending the measure back to committee for further hearings or research but would not be subjected to the effects of motions with nonforthwith instructions which force them to choose between two policies that he or she supports because all nonforthwith instructions are nonbinding the issue of nonamendatory instructions might also effectively be dealt with by combining restriction on the form of the motion with house rules change allowing debate on straight motion to recommit because nonamendatory instructions typically instruct the committee to conduct hearings or research this desire might be expressed instead during debate on straight motion to recommit if this were possibility house rules could be amended to allow only straight motions to recommit and motions to recommit with forthwith instructions without eliminating the minoritys ability to httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34757g22g145g142g561g15g152g157g146g152g151

g11g151g156g157g155g158g140g157g146g152g151g156g561 majority also has the option of changing house rules to require that all amendatory instructions including both motions with forthwith instructions and motions with nonforthwith instructions be prefiled similar to the requirement sometimes set forth by the rules committee requiring that amendments to measures be prefiled in the congressional record this option might be helpful because members would longer be caught off guard by the subject of motions with amendatory instructions also if the prefiled motion contained language that majority of members would support it might instead be considered in committee of the whole as an amendment this option however might not solve all of the potential issues arising from the offering of motion to recommit with nonforthw ith instructions since such motion could still be offered even if prefiled also such rules change could be viewed as placing restrictions on the minoritys right by taking away both secrecy and the flexibility to respond to changes made in the measure during consideration on the chamber floor motion to recommit may not amend or eliminate an amendment already adopted by the house 60 if motion to recommit must be prefiled before amendments have been adopted on the floor it may unintentionally seek to amend language that was already amended during consideration of the measure in the committee of the whole in that case the motion to recommit would be subject to point of order if the motion to recommit fell to point of order the minority would then need to be given the right to offer one proper motion to recommit this may mean that more than one motion to recommit would need to be prefiled and if that were the case deciding how many could be prefiled wo uld be difficult since any number of motions might fall to point of order for instance on november 19 1993 three motions to recommit fell to point of order resulting in total of four motions being offered on one measure 61

both straight motions to recommit without in structions and motions to recommit with non forthwith instructions have the effect of sending bill back to committee however only motion with nonforthwith instructions allows th minority debate time to state their reasons for recommitting the bill if straight motion to recommit was also debatable it would allow the minority forum for communicating specifically what they dislike about the underlying measure in its final form disadvantage of this option is that some may view any change allowing more debate as tool for allowing the minority to cause delay

effects of offering motion to recommit with nonforthwith as opposed to forthwith instructions is to secure additional time for consideration of the motion as well as the underlying measure 62 allowing the minority to extend debate time to an hour on motion to recommit would achieve this goal criticisms of this option might include the view that the time extension could be used for dilatory purposes or that it gives excessive rights to the minority party it should be noted that although the majority currently holds such right they have used it only once63
