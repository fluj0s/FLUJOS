sent them an email over week ago and still have not recieved reply also brother sean mcbride told that the one in wv is near the pa border which would be in the extreme north and as i am in southern wv i was wanting to see about starting unit here but in our books it talks about starting state unit but doesnt really say anything about local unit so i was wondering about how i go about that i wont be the only one around here as my friend anthony will be joining shortly and wants to do this with 2 i was also wondering what the unit leaders rank is and what ranks are given to those people who start new unit 3 i was also wanting to know if the officers have dress uniforms because i have seen some replicas on the website wwwpgzbiz and if not i mention it because i think it might be good idea sorry to pester you with all this but i have really one around here to ask questions of concerning all these things thanks in advance 88 andrew original message from commander schoep
