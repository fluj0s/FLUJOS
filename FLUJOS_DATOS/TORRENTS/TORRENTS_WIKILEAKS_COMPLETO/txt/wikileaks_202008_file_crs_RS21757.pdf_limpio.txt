force in order to come into effect the constitution must be ratified by all 25 member states through either parliamentary appr oval or public referenda twelve states have completed ratification but the constitutions future has been thrown into doubt following its rejection by french and dutch voters in separate referenda in may and june 2005 arguments against the constitution varied in both countries some voters claimed it coul d undermine traditional social protections while other voters soug ht to register dissatisfaction with unpopular national governments the eu bureaucracy nd turkeys prospective eu membership other reasons for rejecting the constitution differed in france some feared that it could ultimately weaken paris dominant role in the eu while dutch voters complained that certain provisions of the constitution undul favored the eus bigger countries in the wake of the french and dutch votes it became unclear whether other eu member states would proceed with their ratif ication plans proponents of moving forward hoped that if most members approved the constitution such approval would help force second vote in those states that rejected it the uk however announced that there was point in continuing to plan for british referendum in light of the french and dutch rejections at their june 2005 mmit eu leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the constitution but announced that decisions about the timing of ra tification were for each member state to determine they acknow ledged that the initial ratification deadline of november 2006 was longer tenable and did not set new target date experts say this decision effectively puts the cons titution on hold until at least mid2007 after frances next general election eu leaders however are expected to discuss the future of the constitution at their upcoming summit in june 2006 some predict that the eu may be facing period of stagnation at least in the short term as members grapple with internal reforms and the eus future shape and identity they also suggest that the rejection of the constitution could impede the membership aspirations of turkey and possibly the balkans given that considerable opposition is tied to concerns about further eu enlargement1 eu enlargement with the end of the cold war the european union has sought to extend the political and economic benefits of membership to cen tral and eastern europe ten states cyprus the czech republic estonia hung ary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia and slovenia joined the eu on ma 1 2004 publicly most eu

challenges as it seeks to integrate the 10 new members whose combined economic weight remains relatively small many new members need to complete reforms in areas ranging from food sa fety to public administration enlargement will necessitate redirection of structural funds for deve lopment projects within the eu from older members such as spain and ital to newer and more needy countries like poland it will also be seve ral years before most new eu members are deemed ready to join the eus open borders system or the eus single currency the euro bulgaria and romania concluded accession negotiations in december 2004 and hope to be able to join the eu in 2007 some caution however that their accession could be delayed for one year if they fail to implement remaining reforms also in december 2004 the eu announced it would begin accessi on talks with turkey in october 2005 provided that turkey continue s to make progress on democra tic and human rights reforms and extends its customs union to the eus 10 new members including cyprus after some contentious debate among member states accession negotiations with turkey began on october 3 2005 they are expected to take at least decade to complete the eu asserts that the shared objective of the ne gotiations is accession but has cautioned that it is an openended process the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed some observers suggest that the difficulties with ratifying the eu constitution may cause the negotiations with turkey to take even longer than initially predicted and that they may be less likely to result in full membership all of the western balkan states also harbor eu aspirations in the longer term in june 2004 the eu named croatia as another candidate and opened accession talks on october 3 2005 followi ng determination that croatia was fully coope rating with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia macedonia was named by the eu as candidate country in december 20052 the european

strategy over the past decade the eu has sought to forge common foreign and security po licy cfsp to help boost its weight in world affairs and match its growing economic clout as part of this process eu foreign ministers in may 2003 tasked the eus high representative for cfsp javier solana with developing an eu security strategy to identify common s ecurity interests and joint policy responses some member states had resisted setting out common eu strategy for years fearing it could constrain their national po licies but observers suggest that the internal eu rift over iraq gave impetus to this project as way to help avoid similar internecine disputes in the future in december 2003 the eu approved the final version of its firstever security strategy secure europe in better world it outlines five key global threats confronting the eu terrorism weapons pro liferation regional conf licts failed states and organized crime and range of tool s primarily diploma tic and economic for tackling them in particular it emphasize s the importance of conflict prevention and multilateral solutions the security strategy also calls on the eu to promote stability in the european neighborhood which include s the balkans and the eus new eastern border after enlargement as well as the s outhern mediterranean and the middle east some commentators have criticized the eus security strategy as being too vague and lacking in detail eu officials counter that it merely represents the first step in developing more comprehensive security strategy and that work will now begin on specific policies for implementa tion others contend that th new security strategy is weak because it does not clearly identify the possible use of force as an option for confronting threats posed by terrorism or weapons of mass destruction wmd eu leaders dismiss this criticism however pointing out that the security strategy acknowledges that military means may be n eeded to deal with certain threats3 countering wmd following the war with iraq the eu adopted common policy on wmd in june 2003 the eus declaration on non proliferation of weapons of mass destruction recognizes wmd proliferation as growing international threat and the risk that terrorists may acquire wmd the declar ation sets out range of diplomatic tools for tackling wmd proliferation including stre ngthening multilateral forums such as the international atomic energy agency iaea and improving export controls however this wmd policy also sanctions the use of coercive measures as last resort in december 2003 the eu approved strategy ag ainst proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that further aborates on the june declara tion these wmd documents are separate from the eus overarching security strategy but are viewed as implementing mechanisms for the portions of the security strategy related to wmd4httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21757crs5 5 straw defends joint euro force bbc ne ws nov 29 2003 judy dempsey

identity outside of nato to provide military backbone for cfsp and to give itself more options for dealing with international crises this project known as esdp has led to the creation of 60000 strong rapid reaction force three defens decisionmaking bodies and ties to nato intended to ensure close links between th two organizations and prevent wasteful duplication of nato resources or structures the eu insists that esdp is not aimed at usurping natos collective defense role and most eu nato allies led by the uk say that eu efforts to enhance military capabilitie s should complement those of the alliance as part of ongoing efforts to further develop esdp the eu adopted in december 2003 new agreement on enhancing the eu s military planning capabilities this agreement represents compromise negotiate d by the uk france and germany and stems from the desire of france and some other countries to forge more autonomous european defense arm the compromise entails establishing britishproposed eu planning cell at nato headquarters shape to help coordinate b erlin plus missions or those eu missions conducted using nato assets adding new small cell with the capacity for operational planning to theexisting eu military staff which currently provides early warning and strategic planning to conduct po ssible eu missions without recourse to nato assets inviting nato to station liaison officers at the eu military staff to helpensure transparency and close coordination between nato and the eu some observers criticize the british for agreeing to this deal accusing uk prime minister blair of bowing to french dema nds for more independent esdp to help burnish his european credentials following the rift with paris and berlin over iraq uk officials are keen to point out that the deal considerably scales back the original april 2003 proposal by france germany belgiu m and luxembourg to create european military headquarters planning staff and armaments agency they claim that language in the agreement reaffirms nato as europe s preeminent security organization and stress that the eu cell will not be st anding headquarters although washington grudgingly approved this compromise some us officials still fear that the new eu planning cell of 20 to 30 officers may be the first step in driving the transatlantic alliance apart they believe this small cell will grow over time into larger staff which could duplicate nato structures 5 the eu is working to implement its new planning cell and is collaborating with nato to establish the eu cell at shape and to finalize the nato liaison arrangements in 2004 the eu also agreed to enhance its rapid reaction capabilities by creating 13 battle groups of 1500 troops each ab to deploy to trouble spots especially in africa within 15 days the eu has set 2007 as the deadline for these battle groups to be fully operational they will likely be employed mostly as spearhead forces that would seek to prepare the ground for

have sought to mend fences with the united states eu leaders have c ontinually stressed the fundamental importance of close useuropean ties and sought to portray the eu as reliable partner the bush administration has asserted that improving transatlantic relations in both the eu and nato is priority for its second term europeans have welcomed these efforts and many believe that the administration has succeeded in improving the atmospherics of the relationship at the useu summit on june 20 2005 the two sides pledged to continue work ing together on range of challenges including the promotion of transatlantic economic growth and integration the middle east nonproliferation counter terrorism and reform nevertheless transatlantic tensions have not disappeared and resolving differences will require sustained political commitment from both sides over the next several months the greater middle east and various homeland security issues such as passenger prescreen ing data

tial lifting of the eus arms embargo on china several trade disputes also persis t these include aircraft subsidies beef hormones geneticallymodified foods us antidumping practices and exemptions in us export tax legislation that leave temporary tax breaks in place for few us companies as the eu continues to evolve some us analysts worry that larger potentially more confident eu may seek to rival the united states and could weaken the transatlantic link they also contend that more uni fied eu would likely lessen washingtons leverage on individual members and could complicate us efforts to rally support for its initiatives in institutions such as the united nations or nato others suggest that an eu able to speak with one voice especia lly on foreign policy and defense matters would be more credible capable partner for the united states in managing global challenges and could shoulder greater degree of the security burden both within and outside of europe during president bushs february 2005 visit to the eus institutions in brussels he asserted that the united states wants the european project to succeed and that strong europe is in us interests6
