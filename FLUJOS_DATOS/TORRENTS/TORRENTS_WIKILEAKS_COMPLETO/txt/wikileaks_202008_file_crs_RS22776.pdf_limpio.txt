the vietnam war the air force flew c123 providers while the army used c7 caribous for intratheater airlift1 source of interservice tension c7 ownership transferred to the air force in 1966 but the air force continued to fly them attached to army units2 with funding scarce after viet nam the air force retired both the c7 and c123 without replacement in the 1980s the air force bought 18 c23 sherpas to move supplies between european bases after the cold war six sherpas were transferred to the army before 40 more were acquired and assigned mostly to army national guard units3 in 1991 the air force

approaches to the intratheater airlift mission as well as continued debate from many others including congress over the roles and missions of each service the following sections address these

cargo as its role the air force says it will use jca to provide general support airlift for all users joint publications define this as the airlift service provided on common basis for all dod agencies and as authorized for other agencies of the us government nd assigns mission responsibility to us transportation command17 under this construct the air force allocates available aircraft to all users in accordance with jo int force commanders jfcs priorities the stated goal is efficient use of every aircraft for multiple tasks requirements in 2007 rand conducted an intr atheater airlift force mix analysis iafma for the air force to determine the optimum composition of the air forces intratheater airlift fleet18 while most details were classified the study determined that c27s were an efficient complement to other intratheater platforms but were not as costeffective as operating the same number of c130js the air force has requested further study on possible mission ac tivity where the c27 may be more cost effective as well as comparisons to precision airdrop systems see next section and recapitalizing ch47s andor c23s19 in addition tactical air lift requirements are part of the

tactical airlift some suggest the air force could have more vers atile system by diver ting funds planned for jca into procuring larger tac tical airlift models such as c130s and c17s view backed up by the iafma results21 others assert that the armys helicopter modernization program may require 50 larger budg et between 20072030 compared with 19862005httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22776crs5 22 congressional budget office paper modernizing the armys rotarywing aviation fleet november 2007 p vii and suggest the army could better use jca do llars by modernizing its helicopter fleet22 accordingly the services are also pursuing joint heavy lift program that would replace current largehelicopter fleet s and could perform this l ast tactical mile mission separate but relate d possibility for accomplishing this mission is precision airdrop system several systems currently in use or under development combine cargo platforms steerable parachutes and gps receivers that allow cargo airdrops from high and relatively safe altit udes to deliver supp lies and vehicles with pinpoint accuracy and with runway needed roles and missions some members have questioned the merit of splitting tactical airlift between the army and air force while others have ex pressed strong support for this approach historically the army has argued for ownership of small fleet of tactical airlifters field commanders often state they need the responsiveness that direct support airlift provides to counter unforeseen contingencies critics char acterize this approach as inefficiently creating two air forces others state that the jca simply maintains the status quo in roles and missions for exampl it is argued that direct support army transport helicopters performing timesensitive or missioncritical movement of passengers and cargo create battlefield synergy between efficiency and effectiveness in conducting the joint fight further some point out that the army is responsible for sustaining soldiers within its joint opera ting areas and believe th army should be able to procure and use the most efficient vehicl truck helicopter fixedwing aircraft to perform this task the crux of the roles and missions debate however is command and control of these aircraft advocates of placing all jcas into the air force point out that presently jfc can apportion tactical airlift into direct support role whenever it is needed the air force has an extensive command and control ar chitecture already established for the air mobility mission in any theater centralized control of all air assets is the primary tenet of this construct army commanders however normally f unction in an environment of decentralized control that would allow them to instantly task their own assets but may leave the aircraft idle when not needed the army proposes that its aircraft would be made available to the common user airlift pool when not needed in direct support role but it is not clear that it is committe d to obtaining the necessary command and control systems architecture ntioned above to ensure the aircraft are bot h visible and usable by joint commander lastly critics may question the air forces longterm commitment to the direct support role pointing out the air force has re tired its last four sm all tactical airlift aircraft without replacement when asked about his preference in the jca debate general norton schwartz then commander of us transportation command questioned whether the air force was willing to support the army in the manner the army wants tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22776crs6 23 not our way daily report december 7 2007 online at httpdailyreportafaorgafa 24 srept 11077 senate armed services committee june 5 2007 pp 394be supported for

authorizati on act supported the army portions of the request but cut all of the advance proc urement funds and 10 million of rdte funds from the air force request house authoriz ers hrept 110652

srept 11077 also supported the funding request but transferred funds from the army into the ai r forces procurement account and questioned the armys need for an organic fixedwing airlift fleet stating if there were pattern of the joint forces air component commander jfacc providing support that did not match the pr iorities of the joint forces land component commander jflcc that would certainly ar gue for intervention of the joint forces commander to correct the situation it would not be persuasive argument that the jflcc should have his own air force24 the 2008 defense authorization act
