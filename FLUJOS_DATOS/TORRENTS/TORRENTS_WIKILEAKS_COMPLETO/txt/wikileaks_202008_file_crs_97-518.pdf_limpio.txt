summary congress is currently considering appropr iations for us contributions to the world bank and other multilateral development banks mdbs as well as separatelegislation that would require us repres entatives to these institutions to oppose all concessional loans to china the worl d bank and asian development bank adb are together the largest source of forei gn development assistance to the peoples republic of china in recent years the multilateral development banks mdbshave lent approximately 4 billion annually to china the adb makes only market based loans to china most world bank loans to china are also on nearmarketterms and lending from its concessional loan window the internationaldevelopment association ida is scheduled to end by 1999 the mdb marketbased loan facilities mainly finance the construction of infrastructure and industrial facilities agricultural development loans for socialprograms and funding to directly promot economic reform have accounted for only small portion of mdb marketbased loans environmentally oriented loans have become significant fraction in recent year s ida concessional loans on the other hand have focused mainly on social programs and on agricultural projects inimpoverished regions significant though smaller share has also gone forenvironment and economic reform programs mdb lending to china dipped substantia lly following the governments attack on protesters in tiananmen square in june 1989 the worlds largest industrialcountries the group of seven g7 which control majority of the voting stock in the world bank and adb agreed in 1990 th at they would support only mdb loans for basic human needs the united states still opposes unrestricted lending tochina but most other countries have relaxed their opposition and now supportunrestricted mdb lending to china the unite d states does not have veto or other capacity to block approval of mdb loans it does not support us relations with other ida donors have been strained in recent years over us arrears and efforts to impose us priorities on mdb lending policies in 1996 the other ida donors gave the united states chance to catch up on its payments to ida instead of making new contributions but it did not do so some haveargued that us influence in the mdbs s hould be diminished if the united states is not willing to carry its share of their costs the prospects for the future of mdb assi stance in china are uncertain in few years the world bank will have to cut its level of ibrd lending or waive its rule against lending more than 10 of its funds to one country if us influence in theworld bank diminishes japan and some other countries may want to revisit thequestion of terminating ida assistance to ch ina it is not evident what will replace ida

43 billion in both 1995 and 1996 today many debate what role the mdbs should pl ay in the worlds most populous country resources are scarce at the multilateral development banksmdbs and there are many alternative claimants for available funds china has oneof the fastest growing economies in the veloping world yet it is also the home of many very impoverished people some pe ople ask whether the united states japan and other major countries should help finance the development of country that maybe their international rival in the coming century should the mdbs stop makinglowcost concessional rate loans to china should they make these loans only for activities that promote poverty alleviation environmental preservation andeconomic reform should they lend at all given chinas questionable record asregards official respect for internati onally recognized human rights its military buildup and its apparent readiness to use force in settling international disputes alternatively can the mdbs justify not lending to china given its low per capita income the prevalence of poverty in its less developed regions and the chinesegovernments apparent orientation towards development this

loans for china are repayable over 35 ears including 10year grace period the borrower pays 34 of 1 service charge on the disbursed balancewhat is chinas per capita income there are two methods for calculating countrys per capita income both are valid but they are not interchangeable per capita gnp in dollars the first method which the world bank uses for determining ida eligibility calculates devel oping countrys per capita income in dollars through simple conversion process the per capita gross national product gnp ismeasured in local currency and converted to dolla rs using the average exchange rate for the past three years as adjusted for inflation chinas annual per capita gnp in 1995 was about 5200 yuan on the basis of this calculation the world bank said in 1996 that chinas per capita annual income the previous year was 620 this system is useful for comparing the income levels of countries when the ability to buy imported goods is an issue it gives an unrealistic picture of local living standardshowever since products not traded internationa lly services rent etc are valued by an exchange rate applicable only to traded goods actual living standards can be much higher than implied in this dollar figure the system is also subject to technical problems and relies on gnp calculations that may not be very accurate for example many transactions are outside the purview ofofficial data collection the bank made adju stments in the base data for china in 1994 and 1995 earlier world bank data reported that chinas per capita gnp stood at 370 in 1993 two years later according to world bank figures chinas per capita gnp was 620 chinas economy was not twothirds larger in 1995 than it had been in 1993 technical changes in the method of calculation account for much of the apparent change in the banks figures for chinas per capita annual income the bank made similar recalculation ofincome figures for other countries purchasing power parity the second method seeks to establish purchasing power parity ppp using fixed market basket of goods and services to compare income levelsin different countries peoples ability to pur chase the items in the basket will vary from country to country however the items are valued according to common standardregardless of their local price the world bank says chinas ppp income in 1995 was2920 slightly higher than those of salvador and the philippines the ppp system allows better comparisons of living standards among countries however it prices the income generated in countrys domestic economy as though it were useable in the international economy and it do not take the varying quality of goods sold in different countries into account thus it tends to blur the differences in countriesrelative capacity to purchase imported goods the world bank uses the per capita gnp indollars method as its benchmark for determining countries eligibility for ida aid ida loans mainly finance the purchase of foreign goods the world bank has not specified an alternative measure using the ppp methodology for determining whether countries are eligible for ida loans affiliate lends on lowcost terms mainly to countries with per capita incomes below 869 annually3 most have per capita income levels below 400 the ifc mainlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97518crs5 4 ifc loans carry commercial interest rates if c equity investments involve participation in management most ifc projects in china have focused on the industrial or mining sectors in some countries but not china the ifc also lends to or invests in private utility companies figure 1 ibrd assistance to china types of activities figure 2 ida assistance to china types of activitieshelps private domestic firms in developing countries4 miga insures or guarantees foreign investors in developing countries against various noncommercial risksexpropriation etc its exposure in china is about 112 million and is not discussed here in 1996 assistance to china comprised about 17 of all new ibrd loan commitments and 7 of all loan commitmen ts approved by the ida loans or equity investments for china accounted for less than 3 of all new commitments by theifc in 1996 china is what the world bank calls ble nd country that is it receives loans from both the ibrd and ida theoreticall the projects the bank finances in china could be funded by either the ibrd or ida depending whether the bank decides china can afford to service additional nonc oncessional debt in practice the world bank has used its marketrate loans and its concessional loans in china to financeactivity in different sectors the ibrd s concentrated mainly on infrastructure or industrial projects whereas ida has focused much more on agriculture and socialdevelopment activities between 1985 and 1997 as figure 1 indicates the ibrd targeted 68 of its funds it lent to china for the construction of infrastructure and 16 for industrymining or oil and gas production most of these projects were located in areasexperiencing rapid economic growth mainly in urban or coastal regions anotherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97518crs6 5 the agriculture share would be slightly higher if two ibrd loans in 1996 80 million for seed sector commercialization and 150 million to strengthen the animal feed industry were counted as agriculture rather than industry the world bank lists them among its agriculture loans the published descriptions of the pr ojects suggest however that they are more industrial in their focus and they have been included in that category here the parallel 20 million ida seed sector loan has been treated here similarly 6 the proportion lent by the ibrd for social sector projects in 1996 would be higher if the 250 million sewerage project in shanghai and the 125 million wastewater and solid waste disposal project in hubei were counted in the urban development category per the world bank categorization however the published pr oject descriptions show that environmental measures comprise the bulk of the activities funde d by the projects thus they are treated as environmental projects here as is the paralle l 25 million ida project in hubei control of industrial pollution was major focus of the 170 million ibrd industry sector loan in1996 but this loan is assigned here to the industrial category because improvements in theefficiency of production facilities in the steel industry was also central concern figure 3 adb assistance to china types of activity6 went for agricultural development5 these are represented by the four grey triangles having their widest points in 1988 1991 1993 and 1997 about 3of all ibrd lending to china has financed social projects 6 the main allocation of social sector lending occurred in 1995 repr esented by the striped triangle shown for that year projects oriented towards effecting improvements in the environmentcomprised almost 7 of the total loan s to facilitate or encourage economic policy reform accounted for onetenth of 1 of all ibrd lending to china the 1995 loan for this purpose is represented by small black spot at the top in that part of the graph by contrast as figure 2 shows ida has used 9 of the money it lent to china for infrastructure and 2 for industry ning or oil and gas production the latter is represented by the four small white triangles centering on 1987 1989 1991 and1996 most ida assistance to china went to finance agricultural developmentprojects 43 of total ida lending mainly in the poorer or less developed regions another 33 went for social sector mai nly

loans these are counted here as industrial loans 8 the adb made two loans in 1996 for ener gy conservation and pollution control in industry it categorizes them as energy or industrial projects environmental protection wasa major purpose of these loans in recognition of their dual focus one of them was counted here as an environmental project likewise the 28 million adb loan for environmentalimprovement in municipal wastewater treatment was treated here as an environmental project rather than as per the adb classi fication as social infrastructurethe imf and china this report does not discuss the interna tional monetary fund and china the imf is an international monetary not development assistance agency it doesnot make project loans china last borrowed from the imf during 19867 when it drew the equivalent of 777 million from its reserve tranche the loan wasfully repaid by april 1992 countrys reserve tranche is in effect its ownmoney though it must repay the money and pay interest on the outstandingbalance when it borrows these funds im f conditionality for loans of this sort is not rigorous chinas current reserve position in the imf is worthapproximately the equivalent of 13 billion marine aquaculture project7 environmental projects comprised another 11 percent8 the one social project accounting for less than 3 of the total the striped triangle in 1994 funded an urban water delivery system the adb lends to china through its ordinary capital marketbased loan window in 1996 commitments to china comprised 284 of all such loansapproved by the adb this includes some equity investments financed by that windows private sector assistance fac ility by agreement among the adb member countries neither china nor india receive concessional assistance from the asian bank though their levels of per capita income might qualify them for such aid the adb has not lent directly to fund economic reform in china the promotion of reform for example better management or accounting practices andmore marketoriented policies or procedur for state firms has been built into many adb and world bank loans and is not refl ected in the sectoral statistics the chinese government has been willing to dopt economic reforms when it sees that these will strengthen its economic situation china is particularly sensitive to anyappearance that it was compelled to adopt reforms as result of conditions in mdb loans or other leverage applied by the multilateral agencieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97518crs8 tiananmen square and mdb lending to china the tiananmen square bloodshed in june 1989 caused sharp albeit temporary break in mdb treatment of china lending fell substantially theunited states and other major member c ountries urged the mdbs to stop lending in light of the human rights situation in china although the world bank and adb have provisions in their articles of agreement specifically taking human rights conditions into account world bank and adb management justified theirsuspension of new lending for china on gr ounds they were waiting to see if the crackdown on political expression would be followed by slowdown or reversal ofchinas support for economic liberalization and reform the chinese crackdown on dissidents came in the last month of the world banks julythroughjune fiscal year time when many new projects wouldnormally be sent to its bo ard of executive directors for final approval top bank management withdrew its plans to reco mmend several new china loans that month and the volume of ibrd ida and ifc lending to china fell considerably theadb whose fiscal year runs from janua ry to december had lent only small amount to china in 1989 when further action on new loans was suspended asmanagement waited to see what was happening in china in early 1990 representatives of the group of seven leading developed countries g7 who together with othe r countries in the european union own well over majority of the world bank and adbs voting stock agreed that their representatives at the mdbs could support limited flow of lending to china so long as the loans were targeted to fund activ ities meeting basic human needs bhn the ibrd made loans to china during its fiscal 1990 while ida made six loans for earthquake reconstruction agricultural development in poor provinces vocationaleducation and afforestation between fe bruary and june 1990 the adb made only one loan to support an agricultural development bank in late november at the houston summit meeting in mid1990 leaders of the g7 countries decided to maintain their policy of limited support for mdb aid to china howeverthey added two new criteria that would garner their support loans to facilitate economic reform and loans for projects be nefitting the environment following the houston summit the volume of mdb lending to china increased substantially by 1992 it was almost onequarter larger in dollar terms than the amount lent in 1988 according to the treasury department the united states continues to support the policy approved at the houston summit to do otherwise would contradict the requirements of us law as well as ad ministration and congressional preferences other countries however have broadened their attitude towards mdb lending forchina in subsequent years two factors seem to be at work first the determination of the g7 countries to only support mdb loans that would promote basic human needs environmental protection or economic policyreform has proven hard to sustain ma ny mdb loans to chin have some link to economic

elements of us development aid policy it is not clear however whether these other criteria exemplify the concept basic humanneeds some might argue that the context is sufficiently general that any criteriapromoting growth with equity or poverty lleviation might be included in the term in recent years the clinton administration has made sustainable development akey component of us development aid po licy environmental considerations are major element of this concept since the g7 conference in houston in 1992 the mdbs have increased considerably the number of their projects in china and in other countries that arelabeled environmental the treasury department indicates though that someenvironment creep in loan titles is eviden t projects categorized under this label today might have been

activities in multipurpose environmental loan may be deemed suffici ent to justify us support providing the other components in the loan are not blatantly unacceptable in large part theprospect for us support depends on the way the mdbs package their loansthirteen of the mdb loans for china th at the us supported citing the bhn provisions in section 701a were nvironmental projects however the published descriptions of at least ten of them make mention of activities focusingprimarily on public health or assistance to the poor these include four generalenvironment projects an afforestation project watershed rehabilitation project andtwo urban environmental improvement pr ojects the adb soil conservation project was linked to rural development severa l small adb loans which the united states supported were intended to provide technical assistance to the chinese agenciesresponsible for soil or water conservation and grassland management and providedno direct assistance to the public if this trend continues the bhn waiver in section 701a could be used if the administrati on wished to justify us support for broad range of mdb assistance for china proposed legislation two bills pending before congress in 1997 would affect the future us response to any mdb or imf loans for china10 one titled the communist china subsidy reduction act of 1997 hr 2605 was introduced october 2 1997 byrepresentative gerald solomon the ot her titled the china policy act of 1997 s 1164 was introduced september 17 by senator spencer abraham hr 2605 this bill would require the us representatives at the mdbs and the international monetary fund imf to use the voice and vote of the unitedstates to oppose all concessional assistance to china china is currently eligible for concessional assistance from the ida and the imfs enhanced structural adjustment facility esaf the bill is more stringent than existing law as it allows exemptions to its requirement as noted earlier sec 701 of the international financial institutionsact allows the secretary of the treasury to waive for loans that meet basic human needs the requirement that the us representatives at the mdbs oppose allassistance

in the current bill perspectives on the future the us government has opposed long mdb concessional aid to china on grounds that it can afford to borrow more of its foreign credit on commercial terms and its potential for absorbing the lions share of existing mdb resources evenbefore the tiananmen square crackdown when us relations with china were less complicated the us administration opposed the extension of adb concessionalaid to china when lending began in 1987 other countries however were willingto see china borrow concessional funds from the adb however they eventuallyacquiesced to the us argument that asian development bank concessional funds were too scarce and that little would be ft over for the smaller asian countries if india and china were eligible to borrow those funds in the world bank the us administra tion has argued for reduction in ida lending to china in part the us vi ew has been justified on grounds that ida resources are limited and the poor countries in africa and the other lowincomecountries in asia have fewer alternatives than do china and india more pointedly though the us view has been buttressed with arguments that chinas favorablebalance of payments situation its substantial foreign reserves 75 billion indecember 1995 and its growing capacity to attract foreign investment andcommercial credit obviate chinas need for ida aid in the agreement among

world bank presented to justify the new replenishment indicated it would receiveonly about 4 of ida lending during th ida 11 period china would graduate from ida in 1999 japan was reportedly one of the countries that most stoutly resisted the effort to reduce and ultimately terminate ida assist ance to china the japanese reportedly believe that efforts on their part to facilitate strong economic growth in china andto strengthen their economic relationship w ith china should be an important aspect of their foreign policy in recent years china has been the largest single recipient of japans foreign aid for example in 199495 china received almost 20 of the net 10 billion japan disbursed annually for bilateral development aid 11 china also receives many export credits and other nearmarket

the other ida donor countri approved their comparable legislation in 1996 congressional efforts to bar ida from using uscontributed funds for china have low chance of succe ss the world bank made it clear in the past as for example the struggle in th late 1970s about ida aid to vietnam14 that it will not accept earmarked contributions that direct or restrict the way it can usethose funds congress could make the re duction or termination of ida lending to china condition for us participa tion in ida 11 the other donors might acquiesce if as stipulated in the new ida agreement this merely sought guarantee that chinas eligibility would end with ida 11 the other ida donors will likely resist however if the united states seek s to end chinese borrowing from ida any earlier than now planned the effects of termination of ida nding to china can only be surmised on the one hand if the chinese government deci des to rely more on foreign investment and commercial credit to fund chinas development it may well adopt more marketoriented economic policy and institutional reforms in order to make itself moreattractive to lenders on the other hand the chinese government may feel it needsto intervene more in the economy in order to deal with the consequences of increased economic reform private capital would pr obably flow mainly to the fastgrowing urban and coastal regions rather than to the poorer inland provinces this couldmagnify existing social and economic strains and interregional tensions oneconcern is whether the central government will have the authority and capacity to control or mitigate these tensions another is whether the exercise of such authority would be compatible with efforts to allow individuals and localities more autonomyand larger role in the economic and public policy process it is unlikely that private capital will fund the kinds of projects ida has financed in recent years 15 the question is whether china will be willing to borrow regular ibrd and adb money to fund these activities as noted before ida hasemphasized povertyalleviation agricultural development and other social sectorprograms the ibrd and adb have lent relatively little for these purposes manyother countries indonesia for example use mdb marketrate money for thesepurposes the chinese government showed little indication in 1996 that it isprepared to do this also ibrd lending for social sector poverty alleviation and agriculture projects may increase as the volume of ida lending declines thedescriptions of projects under considerati on for china however provide only slight support for this conclusion 16httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97518crs15 continued board for approval in the next two years of these 18 accounting for most of the money are for power or transport infrastructure with funding from the ibrd eight others are forenvironmental mainly pollution control projects 7 with ibrd funding and one afforestation with an antipoverty element with minority ida funding another 5 will promote enterprise reform mainly for state firm s or finance institutions two of these with discernable poverty orientation will be partly funded by ida all this seems to replicate the previous pattern possible change ma be found in the funding for planned projects in the agriculture and social sectors of th 4 planned agriculture projects three have commercial or market orientation and are scheduled for ibrd funding the last 150million poverty and environment project in the tarim basin however will be funded by the ibrd 60 and ida 40 the prior tarim basin project 1992 was financed solely byida likewise the ibrd seems slated to play larger role in funding the 6 planned projectsin the social sector two health projects will be financed solely by ida however one of the two water and sewerage projects and one of the two education undertakings for higher education reform will receive partial ibrd funding as will the qinba mountains poverty reduction project even so total ibrd funding for these social sector projects is not expectedto exceed 150 million in effect the share of ibrd lending for social and povertyorientedprojects would grow slightly to perhaps 240 million over two years if all the projects inthe mos are implemented total world bank lending for these kinds of project would fallhowever as the volume of ida lending diminishes 17 the economist concluded that the prospects for an increase in chinas loan ceiling are doubtful saying not all richcountry members of the g7 are yet convinced that chinas economic reforms are irreversible they would probably object to still greater share of thebanks lending going to china see china problem with the bank july 13 1996 pp3233it is doubtful in any case whether china will be able to replace the funds it previously borrowed from ida with in creased borrowing from the ibrd the world banks rules stipulate that country may account for more than 10 of the ibrds outstanding loans over period of time the bank has made exceptions as in the case of indonesia and mexico which accounted for 996 and 1107respectively of the ibrds outstanding loan s at the close of the banks fiscal 1997 it makes such exceptions reluctantly howev er at the end of 1997 loans to china comprised 75 of the ibrds outstanding loans however if the world bank keeps lending to china at its current rate that countrys share of ibrd lending will soon ex ceed 10 of the total at the end of the banks fiscal 1997 chinas share of all ibrd loan commitments includingloans that had been approved but not yet disbursed totaled 1065 the comparable figures for indonesia and mexi co were 975 and 97 in other words the current pace of ibrd lending to china is pushing up its share of the banks total loan balance whereas the ibrds slower rates of current lending to indonesia and mexico are gradually reducing their share of the ibrds loan portfolio if the ibrd continues lending to china at its current rate the share of its disbursed loans allocated to china will exceed 10 within two years the ibrd member countries could raise the loan ceili ng for china however this step would be controversial and number of major countries might oppose it 17 china may not wish to risk its prestige on such an application in any case given its current levelof exposure in china the world bank may have problems justifying

poverty alleviation projects in china the issue iswhether china will be willing to finance th kinds of projects with ibrd money as its access to ida resources declines china may be willing to do this if its acce ss to ibrd credit is not restricted its foreign trade situation remains positive nd its net income fr om exports to the united states and other developed countries remains strong to repay its growing debt to multilateral and commercial lenders china will need to increase its net income from foreign trade chinas debtservice ratio the ratio of its total debt payments principal and interest to its total export earnings was 99 in 1996 this is relatively lowconsidering the fact that the average lowincome country had debtservice ratio of150 and the average middleincome country had debtservice ratio of 168 that year on the other hand chinas fore ign debt burden has been growing quite rapidly between 1990 and 1995 the lowincome countries increased their aggregate foreign debt by
