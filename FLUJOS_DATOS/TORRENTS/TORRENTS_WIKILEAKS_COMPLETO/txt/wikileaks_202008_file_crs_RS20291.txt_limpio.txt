cosponsored by the international council for science an international group that includes the us national academy of sciences and the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization almost 150 national delegations endorsed nonbinding declaration and framework for action many of the controversial goals in preconference documents described in crs report rs20205 were moderated during the meeting for instance funding pledges for science aid or minimum national budget commitments for science were adopted the action guidelines focused on such issues as improving science infrastructure using science for development gender and ethnic equality in science conducting ethical and relevant science ownership of intellectual property rights including indigenous biological resources and suggesting that developing countries apply some of the debt relief offered by the g8 industrial nations to spending on science and education this report addresses issues relevant to formulating science policy and development assistance it will not be updated background the world conference on science wcs science for the 21st centurya new commitment was held from june 26 to july 1 1999 in budapest co sponsored by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco and the international council for science icsu nongovernmental organization composed of 95 national science councils or academies including the us national academy of sciences icsu was formerly called the international council of scientific unions the official goal of wcs was to analyze where the natural sciences stand today and where they are heading what their social impact has been and what society expects from them1 it sought to establish guidelines to make science responsive to developmental challenges and to write new social contract for science an unofficial and probably more realistic goal was to foster better networking and exchange 1 first announcement world conference on science science for the twentyfirst century new commitment wwwunescoorggeneralengprogrammessciencewcsengconfenhtm congressional research service the library of congress crs2 of views among scientists and between scientists and policymakers wcs discussions involved controversial issues including more funding for indigenous traditional as opposed to modern research and development rd2 indigenous ownership of intellectual property rights ipr and biological resources equitable ethics for research and for technology transfer and compensation for brain drain3 the outcome of the wcs was influenced by the history of policies for funding st in developing countries including failure to implement many recommendations of the united nations conference on science and technology for development uncstd us withdrawal from unesco us arrears on dues payments to the united nations and us caution about multilateral st development assistance the wcs included plenary and panel sessions and drew over 1500 attendees including almost 150 official national delegations4 and others representing educational and research establishments scientists the industrial sector intergovernmental organizations nongovernmental organizations the media and the general public among the us delegates were dr neal lane assistant to the president for science and technology and dr bruce alberts president of the us national academy of sciences see table 1 numerous supplementary meetings were held by interest groups the hungarian academy of science hosted youth meetings the organization for economic cooperation and development which represents the advanced industrial democracies was scheduled to hold parallel sessions on international collaboration in science and on priority setting5 the last international meeting on st the uncstd was held in 1979 in vienna with mixed results it recommended establishing large fund to support st projects in developing countries this never occurred and accorded with us policy not to contribute to fund but to use the and its agencies to play broker role bringing together potential projects in developing countries with sources of financing and projects in developing countries with sources of financing and technology in the developed world including the private sector6 also left unresolved was the issue of code of conduct for technology transfer among the more successful followup activities was creation of an intergovernmental committee on science and technology for development whose projects were administered by the development program through technical agencies such as the food and agricultural organization and through the world bank unesco and the private sector in 1992 the intergovernmental committee was replaced by commission on science and technology for development as part of the economic and social council 2 ehsan masood african faculties agree to link hands nature march 11 1999 references in this report to

president of icsu8 before the conference unesco prepared two documents that delegates would be asked to approvethe draft world declaration on science and the use of scientific knowledge and the draft framework for action they incorporated the views of background report prepared by icsu9 reflecting the notions that st should be supported as beneficial to society but that science is facing difficulties of confidence and investment as well as problems of an ethical nature and that scientists from the developing nations have less access to science than those from the developed nations10

sciences science for survival and sustainable development continued crs4 outcome the preconference declaration and framework for action reflected divisions between developed and developing nations they embodied some divisive principles and guidelines reflecting third world positions that were for the most part moderated or modified before or during the conference news reports indicate that among the major unofficial benefits of the conference were networking among scientists from developed and developing countries and giving scientists from the developing countries direct access to key policymakers and heads of funding agencies from developed countries as well as some insight into the unfamiliar worked of international diplomacy12 however delegates from the developing countries reportedly complained that the lack of official preparatory meetings that usually are held before large conferences prevented them from developing cohesive alliances to support their goals and therefore their demands were diluted13 the conference unanimously endorsed two nonbinding documents the final versions of the aforementioned declaration on science and the uses of scientific knowledge statement of policies14 and the science agenda framework for action that suggested guidelines for implementation15 the declaration espoused new social contract between science and society that endorses social support for science funding while encouraging scientists to accept responsibilities to use all the sciences including social science and engineering to improve quality of life and sustainable development it noted that some scientific advances have also led to environmental degradation and technological disasters16 and that the scientific community should engage in discussion with the public over such issues as food safety genetically modified foodstuffs and biomedical problems17 also the document emphasized that st development and national research systems were indispensable to economic development in the developing countries before the conference some sought to have scientists adopt hippocraticlike oath to conduct ethical science the declaration modified this to propose that ethics and social responsibility be part of scientific training18 the documents endorsed efforts to raise the contributions of women to science to create an international network of women scientists and special efforts to include the disabled indigenous people and ethnic 11 continued nature for documents seehttpwwwunescoorgsciencewcs httpwwwwcsbudapesthu http helixnaturecomwcs

endorsed by the 1979 uncstd20 however it did endorse national regional and international public and private funding to enable developing countries to build needed research and educational infrastructure also the delegates endorsed the idea of recent debt relief initiative by the g8 creditor countries as an appropriate mechanism for developing countries to increase funding for science and education the framework proposed that donor countries and agencies should pool resources and strengthen national research systems it also said highquality science education should be brought to remote locations via internetbased systems there was controversy at the conference about balancing protection for ipr while accommodating the views of some developing countries that ipr represents monopolistic exploitation of information21 some countries declared their ownership and share in the profits of research that uses biological resources and genetic materials within their national boundariesin conflict with the interests of some international companies22 dealing with agribusiness and pharmaceuticals others sought ipr rewards for indigenous knowledge that predated but was used in the scientific revolution the declaration compromised on this point by saying that traditional knowledge systems should be brought closer to modern scientific knowledgein areas such as the conservation of biological diversity the management of natural resources the understanding of natural hazards and the mitigation of their impact23 it avoided discussing the patenting of genetic materials but endorsed the protection of ipr while recognizing the importance of access to data for scientific progress and the need for mutually supportive measures to protect ipr and dissemination of scientific knowledge the framework said that the world intellectual property organization should constantly address the question of knowledge monopolies and that the world trade organization during new negotiations of the trade related intellectual property trips agreement should incorporate into this agreement tools aimed at financing the advancement of science in the south with the full involvement of the scientific community 24 it also called on governments to develop legal frameworks to accommodate the specific requirements of developing countries and traditional knowledge sources and products to ensure their recognition and adequate protection on the basis of the informed consent of the customary or traditional owners of this knowledge25 the framework endorsed research networks regional st parks technology incubators and assistance to small businesses before the conference developing countries were interested in compensating developing countries for their 19 robert

developed countries26 but the framework more moderately said that unesco may catalyse more symmetric and closer interaction of science and technology personnel across the world and the establishment of worldclass education and research infrastructure in the developing countries27 before the conference the president of the us national academy of sciences proposed to create an interacademy center modeled on the us national research council to assemble international expert panels to advise the and the world bank on strelated issues this expands upon the collaboration in the interacademy panel on international issues an informal information exchange network of 80 national science academies that will meet in may 200028 the british science museumbritish association for the advancement of science proposed to establish an international center for the communication of science for journalists broadcasters and exhibition organizers from developing countries29 the conference did not endorse these specific proposals but it endorsed programs to train journalists and others to increase public awareness and supported strengthening international scientific advisory processes in cooperation with agencies and international scientific organizations the framework document said icsu and unesco should followup by developing initiatives for cooperation with the organizations and bilateral donors but that national governments and regional organizations also were responsible for action if there were us followup it would probably be likely to occur via bilateral aid and through international organizations to which this nation belongs the united states withdrew from unesco in 198430 but participates in selected unesco programs deemed in the us national interest there is debate over whether the united states should rejoin unesco31 in addition the united states currently owes the more than 1 billion for its assessed contributions to the regular budget and peacekeeping accounts congress has linked funding for these arrears to reforms it expects the to carry out legislation s 886 was passed in the senate to authorize funding to pay dues32 however congress has limited the total us funds available for contributions to all international organizations making us return to unesco unlikely in the immediate future since us contribution to the unesco regular budget would have to come from the same limited state department appropriations account for international organizations 26 ks jayaraman and ehsan masood india leads call for greater protection of indigenous
