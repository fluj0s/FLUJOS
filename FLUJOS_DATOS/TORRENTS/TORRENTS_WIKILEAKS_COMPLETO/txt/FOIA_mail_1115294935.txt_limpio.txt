from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to kevin trenberth trenbertucaredu subject re ppt for la2 date thu may 5 080855 2005 apologies phil kevin finally gotten around to putting thoughts down mostly on the challenges slides at the start maybe you would have said these things 1 as well as suggesting the model chapters rank models i dont think they will go with this even though it is what we should be doing and there are whole raft of issues as to how to do it should we also be dismissing observational papers that are clearly wrong or distortion of the facts and emphasizing the wrong issues in some parts of our chapter we omit the poor papers just stressing that we are doing an assessment and not review an assessment is our expert view of the science at the present for space limitations we must omit many papers but we must do this objectively in the nrc review i made the point that most of the papers reviewed were the authors own it is difficult and we must not fall into that trap all this again comes back to assessmentreview with 341 we mustnt get caught up in having to agree with the ccsp vtt report were either doing our assessment or we might as well give up gone on for long enough on that one 2 i think we both believe we should be saying somewhere what we should be measuring how accurately where and with what if we dont say this somewhere ar5 will be in worse state susan is against this but i think on this point shes wrong ipcc has lot of clout much more than gcos andor wmo it should be saying something about what we should be doing 3 minor point just land warming more than ocean not much more 4 i guess youve expanded on linear trends enough 5 the ccsp diagrams are good but im not keen on running means i guess though they wouldnt be too different with better smoother 6 i guess youll raise map projections could add in the new one dave has done for precip to show the 30e edge the additional slides most of these are from talk i have to give in bern next month they relate mostly to issues with ch 6 maybe you can add couple of themthey relate to the issues of making full use of the instrumental records to compare with proxy records changes in seasonality was the few hundred years before 1850 always colder than the post 1920 period the first 2 are the longest european records the period im interested in is the rise up from the late 17th century to the 1730s and then the year 1740 volcanoes for 2030 year period may be factor solar also but nothing explains 1740 it is not just in cet 1730s at cet and bilt is the warmest decade until the 1990s producing these sorts of things in proxy data is key 3rd slide is just some of these longer records filtered they dont agree that well so why should proxy series agree we have more to learn from the early instrumental period 4th is just simple example of instrumentalproxy overlap highlights seasonality differences and 5th just shows how unusual the central european summer was in 2003 if we wanted figure for the box the interface with ch 6 and the early instrumental period is crucial 60 of the comments on ch 6 were on the 34 pages on the last millennium ours werent that distorted to one of our sections issues at uea and cru havent helped get to 32 yet i hope to by the end of the day cheers phil at 1526 03052005 you wrote phil did you look at and have commentssuggestion on the ppt for the last day in beijing kevin kevin trenberth email trenbertucaredu climate analysis section ncar 1wwwcgducareducas p box 3000 303 497 1318 boulder co 80307 303 497 1333 fax street address 1850 table mesa drive boulder co 80303 prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk references 1 httpwwwcgducareducas
