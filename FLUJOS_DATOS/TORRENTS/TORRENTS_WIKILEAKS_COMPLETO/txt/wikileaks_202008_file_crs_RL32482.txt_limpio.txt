funding issues of data quality june 28 2004 genevieve j knezo specialist in science and technology policy resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress federal homeland security research and development funding issues of data quality summary section 889 of the homeland security act pl 107296 requires the office of management and budget omb to report homeland security budget data annually to congress and to consult with congress to identify homeland security activities for this purpose accurate information is needed in order to set and coordinate priorities and policy for federal homeland security research and development rd pl 107296 gave the department of homeland security dhs secretary acting through the under secretary for science and technology coordination responsibilities to ensure that federal homeland security rd serves dhss internal needs supports the agencies transferred to dhs contributes to presidentially defined homeland security missions and ensures that federal homeland security rd programs do not duplicate or leave gaps according to the under secretary federal homeland security rd will be coordinated by fall 2004 legislation has been introduced to require dhs to prioritize and consolidate all of its rd activities that are not now managed by the agencys science and technology directorate hr 4141s 2285 omb data show that federal funding for homeland security rd was requested at 36 billion for fy2005 dhss rd programs constitute about onethird of total funding other agencies with large homeland security rd budgets are the national institutes of health the department of defense the department of justice the national science foundation the department of agriculture the environmental protection agency and the department of commerce omb has collected crossagency funding data on homeland security rd for several years this is difficult task on which omb is making progress data are now collected for different purposes data sets often conflict in its combating terrorism reports omb publishes summary data by agency on combating terrorism rd and summarizes some programs it describes homeland security rd as subset of combating terrorism rd and has not published data on homeland security rd funding per omb publishes data on homeland security funding by agency subdivided by programs or units in tables appended to the fy2005 budget request it is not possible to identify clearly programs for rd using these data omb has also produced an unpublished homeland security rd data table it is not widely circulated and gives only total funding by agency 2004 congressional budget office report found shortcomings in federal homeland security funding data problems with the accuracy and consistency of rd data may be caused by inaccurate reporting federal agencies use of different definitions or changing conceptions of homeland security over time among options congress could consider are requiring agencies to use standardized definitions of homeland security rd or mandating that omb or dhs prepare an annual accounting specifically of homeland security rd funding and activities see

quality introduction the department of homeland security dhs has statutorily mandated responsibilities to coordinate federal homeland security research and development rd implementation of these responsibilities depends in part on the quality of information about homeland security rd programs in dhs and in other agencies there is single published comprehensive inventory of federal agency homeland security rd activities several different types of data sets have been prepared for different purposes in its reports to congress on combating terrorism the office of management and budget omb publishes summary data on federal agencies budgets for rd for combating terrorism and gives short descriptions of some agency programs1 these data are current only through the budget request for the fiscal year when the report is published omb describes homeland security rd as subset of combating terrorism rd omb has not published data on homeland security rd funding per but using an internal crosswalk budget data base it has prepared an unpublished table on homeland security rd in data appended to the fy2005 budget request and available only electronically or on cdrom omb published information on homeland security funding by agency subdivided by programs and units an earlier version of these data current only through the fy2004 request was appended to the 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism according to the congressional budget office cbo ombs publication of these data are responsive to section 889 of the homeland security act of 2002 p l 107296 which directed omb to produce an annual report on homeland security funding to accompany the presidents annual budget submission2 it is not possible to identify accurately all agency programs for homeland security rd using these data cbo identified general limitations in the omb data on homeland security as follows the allocation of homeland security funding to almost 200 appropriation accounts within the federal budget substantially complicates efforts to track such spending in addition agencies in their accounts do not separate that funding 1 this report is required by section 1051 of the national defense authorization act of 1998 pl 10585 2 congressional budget office federal funding for homeland security economic and budget issue brief apr 30 2004 p 3 html version available at httpwwwcbogovshowdoccfmindex5414sequence0 or ftpftpcbogov54xxdoc5414homeland_securitypdf crs2 from money appropriated for their other activities indeed much of the money for homeland security activities resides within accounts that finance primarily nonhomelandsecurity spending such as departmental salaries and expenses that accounting practice makes it difficult to clearly identify homeland security funding as it moves through the appropriation process section 889 of the homeland security act of 2002 attempted to address that issue by directing omb to produce an annual report on homeland security funding to accompany the presidents annual budget submission the reports contain data on homeland security spending collected by federal agencies and updated throughout the fiscal year but those data do not always provide consistent picture of expenditures classifying and reporting spending on homeland security activities require judgments about particular projects and programs in addition under the current datacollection process definitions of homeland security and current and prioryear funding levels are continually being modified and updated3 this crs report portrays some of the data that has been collected about federal agency homeland security rd and raises issues about the availability and consistency of such information especially about ombs data4 the quality of information is important since it enters into consideration when attempting to coordinate homeland security rd programs another crs report inventories in detail specific federal agency homeland security rd programs and funding trends crs report rl32481 homeland security rd funding and activities in federal agencies preliminary inventory among the observations made are that the different data sets that the office of management and budget omb publishes about homeland security rd are not consistent and do not always include funding data for all federal agencies that are known to have homeland security rd programs in addition agencies may be using different definitions when reporting homeland security funding an implication is that dhs and congress would have clearer picture of federal commitments for homeland security rd and would be better equipped to coordinate and set priorities for such rd if more accurate and consistent information were collected and published dhss rd

research and development relevant to fulfilling the departments mission will have been identified and coordinated as appropriate5 this is daunting and complex goal given the size and complexity of the federal homeland security rd budget dhss homeland security rd was requested at about 12 billion for fy2005 the fy2005 request for total federal homeland security rd was about 36 billion more than double the resources used in fy2002 and about 63 more than enacted for fy2003 total federal agency homeland security rd including facilities and construction budget authority which numerous federal agencies6 fund was requested at about 42 billion for fy20057 while dhss rd programs account for onethird of total expenditures other agencies with large homeland security rd activities listed in descending order of funding responsibility include the national institutes of health nih the department of defense dod the department of justice doj the national science foundation nsf the department of agriculture usda the environmental protection agency epa the department of commerce doc the department of energy doe and the department of transportation dot dhss statutorily mandated coordination responsibilities dhs funds about onethird of all federal homeland security rd but has the responsibility of ensuring that all federal homeland security rd funding is prioritized properly to serve the presidents homeland security missions the secretary of homeland security is required by the homeland security act pl 107 296 to prioritize and coordinate research and development for dhs and for other federal agencies pursuant to pl 107296 the secretary of dhs acting through the dhs under secretary for science and technology has major responsibilities to coordinate rd internally within the dhs directorate for science and technology within the department as whole to support the rd needs of dhss other directorates and missions for border security infrastructure protection and combating chemical biological and radiological threats and on an interagency basis with individual agencies the under secretary is also mandated to develop federal rd strategies that support homeland security missions specifically section 302 of pl 107296 outlined these intradepartmental and interagency coordination responsibilities including 5 statement of dr charles mcqueary under secretary for science and technology department of homeland security before the us house of representatives subcommittee on cybersecurity science and research and development february 25 2004 6 one estimate is that at

section 304 the dhs secretary is to collaborate with the dhhs secretary to set priorities for homeland securityrelated human health rd and to establish benchmarks regarding achievement most of dhss rd activities are in the directorate of science and technology st directorate but some are managed by other dhs units the fy2004 homeland security appropriations conference report hrept 108280 expressed concern about the potential for duplication waste and inadequate management oversight and directed dhs to consolidate all departmental research and development funding within the science and technology programs in the fy2005 budget request dhs did portray this information in consolidated manner in the fy2005 budget request legislation has been introduced that would require dhs to prioritize and consolidate all of its rd activities that are not now managed by the agencys science and technology directorate hr 4141s 2285 the issue of coordinating homeland security rd funding among federal agencies is important for several reasons these include prioritysetting in order to produce rd and knowhow about the science and technology issues most crucial to ensuring homeland security avoid unnecessary duplication identify gaps where rd is needed and enhance the potential for exchange of information and transfer of technologies developed whether or not dhs achieves its goals relating to coordination of homeland security rd by fall 2004 and whether it has adequate information about agency homeland security rd activities may be of potential interest to congressional committees with oversight for homeland security issues those that authorize and appropriate funds for dhs and also to those that deal with the rd programs of other agencies with homeland security rd budgets crs5 rd to combat terrorism data and information sources although there is some overlap between data sets as will be explained in this report omb prepares separate information on combating terrorism rd which will be examined first and on homeland security rd which will be examined in the following section the most comprehensive single source of information about federal funding and agency programs for combating terrorism is the omb annual series report to congress on combating terrorism8 the latest report for 2003 was published in september 2003 it contains data for fy2002 fy2003 and the fy2004 request the omb report has been produced since 2001 and the series contains data starting with fy2000 information in the omb report gives funding levels and describes the objectives and activities of some federal agency programs to combat terrorism of which homeland security programs are considered subset9 the report does not give detailed financial or descriptive information about all programs the omb 2003 combating terrorism report identified two types of activities antiterrorism defensive measures used to combat terrorism and counterterrorism offensive measures used to combat terrorism both domestically and abroad10 omb divided the combating terrorism heading into two funding categories homeland security hs and overseas combating terrorism oct11 the report defined homeland security programs as follows homeland security programs focus on activities within the united states and its territories or on activities in support of domesticallybased systems and processes the homeland security council hsc coordinates these activities governmentwide homeland security is defined as concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the united states reduce americas vulnerability to terrorism and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur homeland security can include activities that occur outside the united states and its territories if they support domesticallybased systems or activities eg prescreening highrisk cargo at overseas ports12 the 2003 combating terrorism report included summary table with data on federal rd funding to combat terrorism by agency these data as depicted in table 1 show that for fy2004 the latest year for which data were available for this data set agencies requested about 32 billion for rd to combat terrorism the department of health and human services dhhs requested about 51 of this amount and also posted the largest increase in funding at 98 more than fy2003 8 reports

not include the dod oct rd data in the combating terrorism rd table in the 2003 report see table 1 above thus it appears that all of dods rd funding was not portrayed in that table even though omb did not say that the table excluded oct rd funding it is not clear what types of dod combating terrorism rd funding are included in table 1 ie whether omb reported only subset of dods rd funding most federal documents that report rd funding levels including national science foundation reports and other omb documents include all of dods rdte funding in the reporting category of research and development rd and all rdte funding is included in government totals portraying federal rd funding13 while omb separately reported dods oct rdte funding it is not clear whether the dod rd budget authority data in the combating terrorism data table table 1 excluded any part of dods oct rd or domestic rdte funding data also it is not clear if other agencies domestic rdte funding data for combating terrorism are included in table 1 this is confusing and can lead to inaccuracies in portraying funding for combating terrorism rd table 2 overseas combating terrorism oct funding by agency

terrorism identified homeland security rd as subset of combating terrorism rd as noted above it did not present any data specifically labeled homeland security rd the only summary data it presented was the table on combating terrorism rd which by implication may be for homeland security rd since it does not appear to include oct rd but as will be noted below omb and other sources have presented other data for homeland security rd there are inconsistencies among these various information sources raising additional questions about the accuracy both reliability and validity of ombs data 13 see

combating terrorism included an appendix that gave details on homeland security 14 omb staff gave crs permission to use this table staff explained omb collected this data on homeland security rd as

printed in the referenced report to congress crs9 funding by agency for fy2002 enacted fy2003 enacted and the fy2004 request these data were updated in an appendix on agency funding for homeland security programs for the years fy2003 enacted fy2004 enacted and the fy2005 request that is accessible electronically via cdrom and at the omb website for the report analytical perspectives budget of the united states government fiscal year 200515 in these appendix tables omb arrayed funding information budget authority by what it called budget account lineitems16 for homeland security activities for federal agency units or programs data for each budget account was subdivided further according to homeland security missions as defined in president bushs national strategy for homeland security july 2002 these appendix data were used to identify likely agency programs or units with responsibilities for science or rd identified from among these were programs or units that served the homeland security mission of defending against catastrophic threats the category that included most rd in presidents strategy document17 in addition since it was obvious that some agencies reported rd in the mission category of protecting critical infrastructures and key assets some budget accounts for rd programs or units that used this category were also counted18 it should be pointed out that the 2003 combating terrorism report noted that some funding for protecting critical infrastructure and key assets may be for cyber security and physical security improvements to agency facilities or infrastructure19 omb did not give enough information to differentiate between rd and physical protection activities although such cyber and physical security improvements to facilities and 15 as noted above according to the congressional budget office ombs publication of these data are responsive to section 889 of the homeland security act of 2002 p l 107 296 the cdrom material for homeland security is available at 3 homeland security funding analysis appendix homeland security mission funding by agency and budget account pdf httpwwwwhitehousegovombbudgetfy2005 pdfap_cd_romhomelandpdf 16 these budget account categories are different from those that appear in the presidents budget 17 ombs 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism p 4 defined defending against catastrophic threats as this mission area includes homeland security programs that involve protecting against detecting deterring or mitigating the terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction including understanding terrorists efforts to gain access to the expertise technology and materials needed to build chemical biological radiological and nuclear cbrn weapons in addition this mission area includes funding for efforts or planning to decontaminate buildings facilities or geographic areas after catastrophic event 18 ombs 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism p 4 defined protecting critical infrastructures and key assets as an attack on one or more pieces of our critical infrastructure may disrupt entire systems and cause significant damage programs that improve protection of the individual pieces and the interconnecting systems that make up our critical infrastructure belong in this mission area any funding for programs associated with the physical or cyber security of federal assets also belongs in this mission area this mission area also includes programs designed to protect americas key assets which are those unique facilities sites and structures whose disruption or destruction could have significant consequences including national monuments and icons 19 omb 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism p 4 crs10 infrastructure may be for rd rd funding may or may not be included in these amounts it is clear that for some agencies with large homeland security rd budgets such as the national science foundation omb reported large amounts of funding or even most homeland security rd funding in the mission category of protecting critical infrastructure and key assets issues relating to data quality pursuant to the definitions used by omb and if all combating terrorism oct rd funding was reported separately there should be identical data in ombs unpublished table on homeland security rd and in ombs published data table on funding for combating terrorism rd that was included in ombs 2003 combating terrorism report comparisons may be made for only one year fy2003 enacted because comparable data are not available for other years20 comparisons may also be made with data identified for this crs report as likely to be rd from ombs published appendix tables see table 4 comparisons between fy2003 data sets for fy2003 enacted the data from two tables ombs unpublished data on homeland security rd and published data table on combating terrorism rd were the same for only three agencies the departments of commerce transportation and the national science foundation data were similar greater than 5 difference for doe dhhs and the department of justice comparing these two sources there were major differences in funding for the departments of agriculture where the amount in the unpublished homeland security table exceeded the amount in the published combating terrorism table by 158 defense where the amount in the unpublished homeland security table exceeded the amount in the published combating terrorism amount by 182 homeland security where the amount in the unpublished homeland security table was 6 less than the amount in the published combating terrorism table and state where the amount in the unpublished homeland security table exceeded amount in the published combating terrorism table by 100 compare columns 2 and 3 of table 4 there were other inconsistencies between the data sets the combating terrorism rd data included funding for the state department but the unpublished omb table on homeland security rd did not report any funding for this agency the funding amount reported for combating terrorism rd was larger than the funding reported in the unpublished homeland security rd table for the departments of agriculture defense and homeland security it may be that some combating terrorism rd supported by these agencies went to overseas activities but such funding was not identified in the omb report it appears unlikely that dhs 20 the combating terrorism rd table also included data for fy2002 enacted and supplemental and fy2004 requested but data for fy2005 preventing comparisons fy2004 and fy2005

information excerpted by the crs author from the appendix on homeland security to the ombs fy2005 budget analytical perspectives entitled homeland security funding analysis appendix homeland security mission funding by agency and budget account pdfhttpwwwwhitehousegovombbudget fy2005pdfap_cd_romhomelandpdf published data on funding for rd to combat terrorism are from office of management and budget 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism september 2003 p 16 if the difference in dod totals between columns 2 and 3 in table 4 represents dods oct rd funding that difference 385 million is 1875 million less than the total reported for dods fy2003 oct rd as reported in table 2 while the amount exceeding 212 million see column 2 of table 4 may be for oct rd that amount would constitute only part of dods oct rd budget authority as depicted in table 2 thus it is unclear if the 385 million is for homeland security rd or for oct rd comparisons between data identified for this crs report as likely to be rd from ombs published appendix tables and ombs unpublished data on homeland security rd show that for fy2003 data were identical for one budget account usdas ars data were similar greater than 5 difference for total dod budget accounts for both fy2004 and fy2005 see tables 5 and 6 regarding data for the department of homeland security the amount reported for combating terrorism exceeded the amount in the unpublished homeland security rd table by 39 million it is doubtful that this is for oct rd which is not likely mission for dhs and omb did not identify dhs as having any budget authority associated with oct there is similar problem with respect to usda which according to omb has oct accounts but the funding reported for usdas combating terrorism rd exceeded homeland security rd funding by almost 20 million there are instances when the unpublished homeland security rd data table reported more funding than did the combating terrorism rd data set even though the two categories may be intended to be equivalent or where homeland security rd funding would not exceed the combating terrorism rd funding this occurred in data reported for the departments of health and human services justice and for the environmental protection agency see table 4 there are also major differences in data sets for dhhs for instance for fy2003 enacted ombs unpublished homeland security rd data and ombs combating terrorism rd data are almost equivalent but they are both about 900 million less than the putative homeland security rd data identified for this crs report from ombs

notable differences between the unpublished data on homeland security and data in the putative rd budget accounts identified in this crs report some agencies such as the nuclear regulatory commission

activities see table 4 similar differences appeared in data for fy2004 see table 5 and for fy2005 see table 6 as noted above it is not likely in these instances that all the homeland security funding for budget accounts which appear to be rd related goes exclusively to facilities protection these discrepancies indicate that sometimes omb uses the terms combating terrorism rd interchangeably with rd for homeland security and sometimes it does not or that at minimum different data sets count different kinds of activities comparisons among data sets for fy2004 and fy2005 comparisons between data

aaas feb 6 2004preliminary summary of major differences among data sets for fy2005 requested funding for fy2005 requested funding there were notable differences among the data sets and for the most part the data in ombs unpublished table on homeland security rd differed from the data in rdrelated budget accounts identified in this crs report that appeared in ombs published appendix tables on homeland security major differences among data sets are summarized in table 8 some of these are elaborated upon in crs report rl32481 homeland security rd funding and activities in federal agencies preliminary inventory by genevieve j knezo crs17 table 8 summary of differences in fy2005 requested data sets by agency agency issue usda ombs unpublished data on homeland security rd appear to encompass only the budget account for agricultural research service ars salaries and expenses for defending against catastrophic threats the unpublished data table did not appear to report funding for homeland security rd facilities or for the category of protecting critical infrastructure and key assets which usda also appears to support as indicated in the published appendix data identified for this crs report doc ombs unpublished data may track primarily the national institute of standards and technologys nist rd activities all fy2005 requested dod homeland security rdrelated accounts identified for this report are reported under the category of protecting critical infrastructures and key assets it is impossible to identify the actual amount of funding for noaas and nists homeland security rd activities dod ombs unpublished and published electronic appendix data identified for this crs report for dods homeland security rd differ less than 5 for fy2005 requested and funding is split between the two homeland security missions dods oct rdte funding does not appear to be included in either account ombs published combating terrorism rd data are unclear about whether oct funding is included and if excluded whether these data coincide with omb data on dods homeland security rd funding doe ombs data sets are very different unpublished data put the agencys homeland security rd total at 8 million requested for fy2005 but published appendix data identified for this report and other doe data indicate the office of sciences homeland security energy programs largely rd could total almost 68 million dhhs ombs published electronic appendix data for homeland security rd as identified for this report place dhhss total at least 439 million more than do ombs unpublished data on homeland security activities in rdrelated budget accounts these data are largely for the mission category of defending against catastrophic terrorism dhs ombs published data are about 124 million less than ombs unpublished data the published data include only rd activities of the directorate of science and technology and do not include rd in other dhs directorates most funding is reported under the homeland security mission of defending against catastrophic terrorism these data differ from those in the congressional budget request doj ombs unpublished data put dojs homeland security rd funding at 1945 million while the published appendix data identified for this report show homeland security rdrelated activities only for the federal bureau of investigation fbi at 41 million crs18 agency issue dot there is correspondence between ombs data sets for dot homeland security rd and there are large differences between dots own reports of its homeland security rd and omb reports epa ombs unpublished data on homeland security rd differ by about 82 million from the published appendix data identified for this report nasa ombs unpublished data do not report any homeland security rd funding data excerpted for this report from ombs published electronic appendix data show about 81 million for science and technology budget account of which an undetermined amount is likely for homeland security rd nsf the two data sets ombs unpublished homeland security rd data and the homeland security data identified for this report as likely rd are close differing by about 9 most homeland security rd funding is categorized under the heading largely of protecting critical infrastructure and key assets not defending against catastrophic terrorism the mission for which dhhss rd data are categorized nsfs homeland security funding goes largely to support rd and is not primarily for facilities protection and cyber security activities summary observations about data on rd the analysis in this crs report has shown that while homeland securityrelated information is collected for variety of purposes questions may be raised about the accuracy of funding data for homeland security rd issues include consistency of omb trend data over time inconsistences among data sets which appear to count the same things problems with using budget account data lineitems to count rd whether or not all overseas combating terrorism rd data are included whether or not all of dods rd is included and use of different homeland security mission descriptors for rd some of the agencyspecific observations made in this concluding section are based on data summarized in this report but discussed in greater detail in crs report rl32481 homeland security rd funding and activities in federal agencies preliminary inventory major difficulties with the data several major difficulties have been observed in the current data they are summarized next different types of information are compiled for different purposes the most uptodate and complete source of trend information about federal agency homeland security rd funding is ombs unpublished data table however that document is not widely circulated and because it gives only agency totals it is not possible to use it to identify funding for units or programs within an agency crs19 ombs published combating terrorism rd table in ombs 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism is prepared annually in response to congressional mandate this table is almost two years outofdate when published for instance the report published in september 2003 included data only through the fy2004 request in that document omb reported that homeland security is subset of combating terrorism ie the total for combating terrorism rd minus the total for overseas combating terrorism rd omb did not publish data on homeland security rd funding per in that document and it is not clear what overseas combating terrorism rd data are included or excluded from the table omb publishes homeland security information in appendix tables the most recent in cdrom and electronic appendix to analytical perspectives us budget fy2005 these data are prepared in response to congressional directive to report homeland security funding omb uses budget account data for these tabulations23 rd funding per is not listed as budget account item this crs report attempted to use this information to obtain estimates of rd data by counting data in budget accounts that appear to be rdrelated while this method permitted identification of some units that support homeland security rd the funding reported may include other than rd activities it may include upgrades for physical and cybersecurity also homeland security rd may be supported by offices or programs whose budget account does not include descriptors that are science or researchrelated or under homeland security missions that are not related to rd thus some homeland security rd activities that an agency conducts but which appear under other budget accounts that are not principally for rd may be excluded an example is the funding amount given for homeland security rd in the department of homeland security dhs the omb 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism the homeland security appendix data for fy2004 and the fy2005 request reported data only for dhss science and technology directorate even though other parts of dhs also support rd differences observed among data sets ombs unpublished homeland security rd table presents only total funding by agency and its trend data do not always coincide with the data in other omb data sets for instance except for three agencies the data in ombs table on combating terrorism rd for fy2003 enacted differed from ombs unpublished table on homeland security rd funding also with few exceptions the data in these two tables differed from the data crs identified as for homeland security rd in ombs published or electronically available appendix data on homeland security omb data do not appear to report all funding for rd omb may not have included in its inventory of homeland security rd some agencies homeland security rd programs that were described elsewhere on their websites in budget documents or in their annual plans or strategic plans sometimes in its published appendix data on homeland security omb reported funding for science or researchrelated budget accounts for some agencies but did not report them as having any homeland security or combating terrorism rd funding 23 which uses different numbers from the budget account number and data given in the appendix to the presidents annual budget documents crs20 responsibilities even though omb reported that funding for homeland security rd is subset of the category combating terrorism rd sometimes omb reported agencies as having homeland security rd funding responsibilities but combating terrorism rd responsibilities for instance it is not clear if or how much omb included for the homeland security rd programs of the national nuclear security administration the food and drug administration the centers for disease control and prevention the department of energy the department of justice the national aeronautics and space administration and some programs in the department of homeland security omb may have undercounted the amount of homeland security rd in some agencies that was described elsewhere for instance ombs unpublished data reported that dot received funding for homeland security rd for fy2004 and that 41 million was requested for fy2005 the published appendix data identified by crs indicated that dot requested about 04 million for fy2004 for homeland security and national security activities rd according to these omb data funding appears to have been appropriated for fy2004 nevertheless in dots fy2004 performance plan the agency said it requested funding fy2004 homeland and national security rd programs funding totaling 637 million similarly reports of homeland security rd funding for nasa and doj among other agencies differ whether overseas combating terrorism rd funding is included in combating terrorism rd totals combating terrorism according to omb includes both homeland security funding and overseas combating terrorism oct funding it is not clear if omb included or excluded oct amounts for other agencies in its tables ombs 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism does report separately funding for dods oct rd called rdte research advanced development testing and evaluation the amounts reported for dod oct rdte alone far exceed the total reported for dods combating terrorism rd it is not clear how other agencies oct rd funding was handled in this and other data sets this issue may require clarification in order to obtain accurate totals for federal agency combating terrorism rd responsibilities omb may not count all of dods rd as noted omb may not have included all dod homeland security rdte in its data set on dod homeland security rd or in its fy2003 combating terrorism rd table this is exemplified by the fact that dods oct rd totals which were for rdte reported larger funding amounts than were reported in the combating terrorism rd table it is not clear if the difference was due to oct activities or whether dods dte advanced development test and evaluation activities were not counted in the combating terrorism rd table it is reasonable pursuant to ombs definition to exclude dods oct rdte from funding amounts on homeland security rd however it is not clear if the dod homeland security rd data that were reported included all dt other documents that inventory federal rd funding levels including nsf reports and other omb documents include all of dods rdte in the reporting category of research and development rd furthermore in the various omb data sets surveyed omb did not report consistent figures for dods budget authority for homeland security rd funding crs21 agencies may be using different definitions when reporting funding levels to omb in its combating terrorism report omb said it allowed federal agencies to report data to it and purposefully allowed agencies to use their own definitions of activities to report although omb said it did review all responses to ensure consistency and comparability24 in detail throughout the data collection cycle agencies reported information using applicable definitions the data provided by the agencies are developed at the activity level which is set of like programs or projects that make up coherent effort aggregated at level of detail sufficient to analyze total governmental spending on homeland security and overseas combating terrorism missions the two major components of the overarching combating terrorism mission omb purposely left the definition of activity to the interpretation of respondent agencies to allow for flexibility in responses and reviewed all responses to ensure consistency and comparability25 the data presented in this report suggest that agencies may be using different definitions of rd activities when reporting to omb or that some of the data may be inaccurate this raises the issue of whether agencies are reporting homeland security rd uniformly and the accuracy of ombs statement that homeland security data were reported as subset of combating terrorism data also omb data do not include funding for the construction of buildings or facilities where homeland security rd is conducted and therefore omb data in some cases are less than data sets which include such activities such as prepared by the american association for the advancement of science aaas aaas data show major construction activities that do not appear in omb data for usda doe dhs and dhhs for both fy2003 and the fy2005 request rd funding reported under two different homeland security missions in ombs published appendix data on homeland security funding some agencies with clear rd missions such as the national science foundation appeared to report most homeland security rdrelated funding under the homeland security mission of protecting critical infrastructure and key assets and not under the mission of defending against catastrophic threats the heading that includes most rd in presidents strategy document because the mission of protecting critical infrastructure and key assets may also include cyber and physical security protection activities it is difficult to identify what part of the funding for the category goes for rd most nih homeland security rd was reported under the category of defending against catastrophic terrorism thus the following questions may be raised both nsf and nih support the conduct of rd yet most of nsfs homeland security rd activities were categorized under the homeland security mission of protecting critical infrastructure and key assets while most of nihs homeland security rd activities were categorized under the mission of defending against catastrophic threats some may ask the following questions why the difference in categorization what are the fundamental differences or similarities in the kinds 24 omb 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism p2 25 omb 2003 report to congress on combating terrorism p2 crs22 of homeland security rd supported by the two agencies for fy2005 nsf requested 27 million for activities related to defending against catastrophic threats should it be assumed that this is the amount that will be allocated to nsfs two bioterrorismrelated activities for ecology of infectious diseases program co sponsored by nsf and nih microbial genome sequencing programwith usda or is some of this program funding categorized under the heading labeled protecting critical infrastructure and key assets should it be assumed that most of nsfs homeland security rd funding is oriented primarily to improving cyber security and physical security since most of its homeland security rd funding is reported under this category nsfs own information on its homeland security rd indicates that it supports vast array of fields from the perspective of fields of science performers and so forth what is the difference between the kinds of research supported under these two different headings options to improve information about homeland security rd funding omb has collected data on crosscutting or crossagency funding on homeland security rd for several years this is difficult task and omb has made progress in establishing ways to report these data improved data collection could improve decisionmaking about policy programs and funding for homeland security rd specifically for setting priorities avoiding unnecessary duplication and assisting in transferring information and technology among agencies and first responders however as omb transitions to improve its homeland security data collection it appears to have encountered problems in data accuracy and consistency these may be due to errors in reporting changing definitions of homeland security rd and its components over time federal agencies use of different definitions and inconsistency in reporting categories omb uses for the different data sets that it prepares in 2004 report the congressional budget office cbo identified general problems with ombs homeland security data focusing on the difficulty federal agencies confront in separating homeland security funding from accounts that serve nonhomeland security purposes or are primarily for salaries and expenses cbo also observed that definitions of homeland security activities change from year to year and often require judgments by accountants or analysts these problems make it difficult to obtain consistent data and to portray funding and trends adequately even within the same data set26 many of these problems were manifested in the ombprepared rd data examined in this report raising questions about the reliability or validity of the data examined 26 congressional budget office federal funding for homeland security economic and budget issue brief april 30 2004 available at httpwwwcbogovshowdoccfm index5414sequence0 crs23 section 889 of pl 107296 requires omb to report on homeland security funding and to consult at least annually with congress27 about which activities constitute homeland security activities for budgeting purposes as one response to its data reporting requirements omb published data in an appendix to the fy2005 budget volume analytical perspectives that presents homeland security funding using special budget account categories rd funding is not specifically identifiable ombs unpublished data on homeland security rd funding cannot be reconciled easily with these data nor for the most part with the domestic component of combating terrorism rd funding that omb prepares for another purpose these data also differ from some of the data agencies use to characterize their homeland security rd programs and funding several options may be addressed to deal with these issues congress may seek to ensure that omb data on homeland security rd are adequate to enable congress to identify and oversee and dhs to identify prioritize and coordinate federal homeland security rd across all agencies oversight could be directed to whether omb should impose more conformity about the way agencies define homeland security rd and about the definitions agencies use in reporting homeland security rd consideration could be given to the option of asking omb or dhs to report separately to congress on funding for and activities of federal agency homeland security rd programs the costs of obtaining more precise data have not been estimated attention could be directed to examining the costs and benefits of whether or not the federal government should report more accurate and consistent data on federal agency homeland security rd programs 27 consultations are mandated specifically between omb and the house and senate budget committees the house and senate appropriations committees and the congressional budget office sec 889 of pl
