state 50242 b berlin 600 c berlin 625 classified by ambassador philip d murphy for reasons 14 bd 1 cnf summary in separate december 1 meetings with ambassador dan fried special envoy for closure of the guantanamo bay detention facility sgc the ministry of the interior foreign ministry and chancellery expressed willingness to consider seven new cases of guantanamo detainees for resettlement as well as three cases that had already been provided to the former government last spring all interlocutors stressed that the moi is the competent ministry handling this issue they also expressed the desire to be helpful in the spirit of the strong usgerman bilateral relationship interior ministry state secretary beus said that any decision on the cases would likely take up to two months and agreed with fried on the following way forward the interior ministry would be the only ministry addressing this issue especially in regard to sharing information on the detainees the us and germany will uphold strict confidentiality during this review phase and coordinate timing and content of any public messages while germany prefers nonuighur cases because of expected tension with china it will consider the cases of two uighurs based on humanitarian grounds germany prefers to accept detainees with connection to germany which fried explained to be the case with only one detainee tunisian whose file was previously provided the german moi will maintain direct communication with sgc at this stage in the process germany will decide on the need to interview any candidates at the end of its review process in later meeting chancellery security advisor christoph heusgen stressed his confidence in interior minister thomas maiziere to handle this issue noting maizieres close relationship with chancellor merkel end summary interior ministry is key 2 cnf based on schedule recommended by the chancellery fried and ambassador murphy met first with interior ministry state secretary beus and expressed appreciation for the new governments willingness to consider resettling detainees fried reviewed the numerous european countries which had accepted or pledged to resettle detainees at this point noting that progress has been made but more is needed he noted he would only be passing along detainee dossiers to the moi and discussing case specifics with the moi and not with other government ministries per earlier requests from the government fried handed over the dossiers of seven detainees two egyptians two syrians libyan and two palestinians he explained that if the moi has questions or requires additional information it can do so through established liaison channels and additionally offered for german team to visit guantanamo to conduct interviews with detainees under consideration while recognizing germanys preference for nonuighur detainees fried raised two uighur cases for consideration based on humanitarian grounds one who has psychological problems and the other his brother who serves as caregiver he also acknowledged the german interest in detainees who have some connection to germany noting the one tunisian case whose file had been conveyed last spring as the single detainee with those ties to germany in total fried requested that germany consider 10 detainee cases for resettlement three cases already conveyed and seven new cases 3 cnf state secretary beus expressed his ministrys willingness to consider all the cases including the uighurs and said that his experts would review the files as soon as possible shortly after he began interior minister thomas maiziere dropped in to stress his desire to be of help continuing beus underlined the importance of keeping the current discussions and review of the detainees confidential to which fried strongly agreed beus underlined germanys preference for detainees who have some ties to germany noting that this connection would provide the government with plausible explanation for accepting certain detainees when faced with the argument that the us should be resettling them beus said that he would be willing to consider the two uighur cases on humanitarian grounds but noted that they would present special difficulties because of the diplomatic row which would likely ensue beus also highlighted that even if the federal government agrees to accept any detainees it must then find german state willing to accept them he also said that german services would naturally keep an eye on any resettle detainees within reasonable resource means 4 cnf beus also expressed strong interest in coordinating the timing and content of any public message on germanys consideration of and decision on resettling detainees to prevent political pressure from those who oppose the move but regardless the government will advocate in public in favor of taking detainees if they come to positive decision he added that being able to say to the public that the us has also accepted detainees or otherwise explain why the us is not doing so would also be helpful fried expressed his readiness to coordinate and noted that the us has admitted and plans to admit the more dangerous detainees for legal proceedings process and timeframe 5 cnf beus said that he and his experts would review the files and determine if additional information is needed he agreed that additional information would go through intelligence channels and expressed his preference to communicate directly with fried on any matters at this stage of the process he said that they would decide whether interviews are necessary when the experts have completed their review of the information he estimated that decision on taking detainees would take onetotwo months mfa plays peripheral role 6 cnf it was clear from the later meeting with mfa state secretary wolf born that the foreign office would not be major decisionmaker as on this issue fried reviewed in general terms the cases of detainees that we are asking the moi to consider and also highlighted the humanitarian nature of the two uighur cases which born noted born said that foreign minister westerwelle wants to be positive but added that it is the moi which is the competent ministry on this issue born mainly asked questions about the numbers of detainees still at guantanamo us plans for addressing the various groups and the possible closing date all of which fried discussed with him chancellery confirms reticence about uighurs 7 cnf in the last meeting chancellery security and foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen expressed appreciation that fried had proceeded along the lines that the moi and chancellery had requested through ambassador murphy heusgen appeared to be already fully briefed on frieds earlier meeting that day with beus he told fried that if germany were to take any uighurs it would be best to do so in combination with other european countries to prevent china from focusing its opposition on any one country heusgen was not optimistic that china would demonstrate any understanding for the two humanitarian cases heusgen inquired as to whether any alternatives for the uighurs exists fried explained possible options while highlighting the difficulty of resettling the two individuals he is asking germany to consider comment 8 cnf the new government now in place since october 29 appears willing to renew consideration of resettling gtmo detainees and has expressed clear desire to be of help in contrast to former interior minister schaeuble current moi maiziere has not and is unlikely to flouted security concerns about cases in the press nor indicated that germany would be hardpressed to accept any detainees put forth for security reasons nor has maiziere indicated that the fact that the us itself has not resettled detainees presents an insurmountable roadblock although beus indicated that us resettlement would help germanys pr efforts to resettle all interlocutors expressed strong interest in keeping the matter confidential and coordinating the timing and content of any public message beus projected sincerity and realism noting that even if the federal government agrees it must still identify state that is willing to resettle the detainees while all interlocutors did not outright reject the two uighur cases heusgen made clear that the prospect of being the only european country to irritate china by accepting uighurs would make it difficult although it is unclear whether germany would take part in any broader european decision to resettle uighurs 9 sbu there has to
