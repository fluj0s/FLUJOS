have been adversaries and have sometimes engaged in lowlevel military hostilities since irans islamic revolution on february 11 1979 during its first term the clinton administration sought to build on earlier policies designed to contain iran and moderate its behavior the clinton administration initially placed its policy of containing iran within broader framework for keeping both iran and iraq weak terming the policy dual containment the administration maintained that dual containment was necessary departure from past persian gulf policies in which the united states has alternately tilted toward either iran or iraq to maintain stability in the persian gulf in the absence of sanctions on iran as exist on iraq in 1995 and 1996 the clinton administration and congress undertook number of new measures to contain iran foremost among these steps were expanded us economic sanctions including ban on us trade and investment in iran and sanctions on foreign firms that make substantial investments in irans energy sector us military assets in addition to those needed to deter iraq were sent to the gulf to monitor irans growing naval capabilities and to help deter iranian consideration of coercive maritime adventures similarly us arms sales and advice to the persian gulf states were designed to help the gulf states defend themselves against potential attacks by iran as well as by iraq in late 1996 debate began to develop over clinton administration policy toward iran several prominent foreign policy experts maintained that the united states and iran have some interests in common such as containing iraq and ending the continuing conflict in afghanistan others noted that differences over how to deal with iran had become serious irritant in useuropean relations this debate accelerated following the upset victory by relative moderate in irans may 23 1997 presidential election by early 1998 following the unexpected election of relative moderate as irans president consensus emerged within the administration to try to engage iran in political dialogue or in mutual confidencebuilding measures that could eventually lead to normal relations administration officials maintain that discussions with iran could yield progress in key areas of us concern which include irans attempts to acquire weapons of mass destruction its support for international terrorism and its backing for groups opposed to the arabisraeli peace process the administrations apparent policy shift has created concern among some groups and members of congress that the administration will make substantive concessions to iran in advance of clear changes in irans international behavior although some members now appear to accept the concept of us dialogue with iran some members are concerned that iran would try to take advantage of any easing of us containment policy to accelerate strategic buildup and fund middle eastern terrorist groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97231contents introduction 1 usiran relations under previous administrations 2 instruments of containment inherited from previous administrations 4 the clinton

revolution ayatollah ruhollah khomeini upon the latters death on june 3 1989 however most experts believe that khamenei lacks the undisputed authority and religious credentials of his predecessor nonetheless his position gives khamenei overall command of the armed forces and security services and the ability to make key judicial legislative oversight and other appointmentsiran us policy and options introduction the united states and iran were allies when the shah ruled iran prior to the 1979 islamic revolution but there has been animosity between the two countries since iranian radicals took over the us embassy in tehran on november 4 1979 and held 52 americans there hostage for 444 days clinton administration officials have articulated several areas in which iran continues to challenge us interests 1 irans efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction 2 its promotion of terrorism worldwide and 3 its attempts to undermine the arabisraeli peace process primarily by supporting groups that use violence to try to derail that process in public statements prior to mid1997 some us officials mentioned additional us concerns including efforts to subvert the persian gulf monarchies buildup of conventional weapons that threaten international shipping in the gulf human rights abuses and its continuation of death sentence against british author salman rushdie1 several outside experts maintain that mohammad khatemi after more than two years as irans president has been unable to fulfill his apparent intention to improve relations with the united states because he has been prevented from doing so by hardliners led by irans supreme leader ali khamenei2 even before the election of khatemi some experts believed the administration was overstating the potential threat from iran these experts saw iran weighted down by factional infighting and by outstanding debts to western creditors that slowed its military modernization programs they maintain iran has acted to maintain stability on its borders by mediating such conflicts as the 199297 civil war in tajikistan and the dispute between armenia and azerbaijan over the nagorno karabakh region many analysts believe iran is unlikely to take any actions that would threaten the free flow of oil on which irans economy depends or scare away the foreign investme nt that iran has tried to encourage in its energy sector some note that several international atomic energy agency iaea visits to iran sincehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97231crs2 3 these assessments were based on iaea visits not full fledged inspections inspections generally involve the systematic taking of samples and the performance of tests to account for the host countrys nuclear material reports about the iaea visits to iran suggest that only some of the standard iaea procedures were performed and only at some of the sites visitedfebruary 1992 have not turned up any evidence of nuclear weapons program3 and that iran was an original signer of the chemical weapons convention cwc in 1993 usiran relations under previous administrations the close us relationship with the shah of iran colored us relations with the current regime the united states assumed responsibility for defending western interests including the free flow of oil in 1971 after britain militarily withdrew from the gulf during 1971 1979 within the environment of ussoviet cold war the united states sought to strengthen iran then led by the shah as policemanof the gulf the effort to strengthen the shah was partly response to the 1968 coup in iraq which brought the leftwing bath arabic for renaissance party in which saddam husayn was senior leader to power the bathist regime had turned to the soviet union for arms and political support signing treaty of friendship with the soviets in april 1972 the shah also maintained relatively good relations with israel which looked to forge alliances with nonarab states in the region in order to keep its arab neighbors contained the united states opted to preserve stability in the gulf when it accepted comprehensive understanding the algiers accords between iran and iraq in 1975 in those accords both states agreed to share control of the shatt alarab waterway and to refrain from interfering in each others affairs however the accords also required the united states to cutoff its support for the kurds battling baghdad for autonomy in northern iraq four years of relative stability in the gulf were upset in february 1979 when the shah was overthrown by the iranian islamic revolution led by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the fall of the shah was viewed as policy disaster by the united states replacing pillar of us influence with an avowedly antiwestern clerical regime the new regime came to power denouncing the united states as the great satan the policy loss was confirmed on november 4 1979 when radical student followers of khomeini seized the us embassy in tehran and held us diplomats hostage the setback was compounded in december 1979 by the soviet invasion of afghanistan which prompted president carter to articulate the carter doctrine us threat to intervene militarily if the soviet union encroached on us vital interests in the persian gulf on april 7 1980 after failing to make headway toward achieving the release of the hostages the united states formally broke diplomatic relations with iran the us embassy remains occupied by irans revolutionary guard corps and iran has not compensated the united states for the seizure of the embassy the possibility of freedom for the hostages receded further that month following the failed april 25 1980 us attempt to militarily rescue the hostages eight us servicemen were killed when some of the operations helicopters collided upon departing the rendevous point in iran following abortion of the mission httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97231crs3 4 analysts give several explanations for iraqs decision to invade iran 1 iraq wanted to gain complete control of the shatt alarab waterway between the two nations 2 iraq sought to assume the policeman of the gulf role played by the shah until his downfall and 3 iran was weak and disorganized after its islamic revolution and the iraqi leadership felt its invasion could trigger an overturning of the islamic revolution iraq hoped thereby to blunt the revolutions effects on iraqs own shiite population much of which looks to iran for inspiration iraq cited iranian incitement efforts and border provocations as justification for its military moves although in december 1991 report by the secretarygeneral formally determined that iraq started the iraniraq war 5 for further information on the irancontra affair and its implications see crs report 92 870 f irancontra affair questions and answers november 25 1992 24 p 6 investigators found that iran had also used chemical weapons during the war see report of the mission dispatched by the secretarygeneral to investigate allegations of the use of chemical weapons in the conflict between the islamic republic of iran and iraq s19823 april 25 1988 some past administrations have tried to improve relations with the islamic regime even though us differences with irans radical islamic ideology have remained although still unable to resolve the iran hostage crisis president carter declared us neutrality in the iraniraq war which began on september 22 1980 when iraq crossed the border with iran in force4 the hostages were released minutes after president reagans inauguration in january 1981 in order to prevent an iranian victory in the iraniraq war in 1982 the reagan administration began tilt toward iraq the reagan administration opened export credits to iraq in 1982 when it removed that arab state from the list of state sponsors of terrorism formal usiraqi relations were resumed in 1984 the united states also undertook diplomatic efforts operation staunch to persuade individual governments not to sell arms to iran in the ongoing war and the united states tacitly supported the arming of iraq by other suppliers despite this tilt in 198586 the reagan administration sought to engage iranian moderates in an effort to obtain the release of americans held hostage by pro iranian groups in lebanon and to promote strategic opening to iran that initiative included 198586 us arms shipments to iran tow antitank weapons and hawk antiaircraft missiles and hostage exchanges that developed into the irancontra affair5 after the abortive dealings the united states and iran skirmished in the persian gulf several times during 198788 in the course of us effort operation earnest will to protect kuwaiti oil shipments from iranian attack at the same time iraq began to gain the upper hand in the war launching series of ground offensives in 1988 that drove iranian forces off iraqi territory iraqs ability to modify scud missiles and fire them at tehran demoralized the iranian population and undercut support for the war effort as did iraqs use of chemical weapons in the war6 the july 3 1988 mistaken us shootdown of an iranian civilian aircraft flight 655 which iran viewed as deliberate apparently convinced iran that the united states was committed to helping iraq win the war two weeks after the shootdown iran accepted ceasefire plan resolution 598 adopted the year earlier and hostilities ended on august 20 1988 httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97231crs4 7 some us statements set requirement that iranian representatives be authoritative rather than merely authorized this condition was set to avoid the situation that characterized the irancontra affair in which the united states initially dealt with intermediaries claiming to speak for the iranian government although usiran relations appeared to reach new low point us conditions for future talks with iran were established before the reagan administration ended under the policy formulation which has held since the united states welcomes an official dialogue with iran as long as the talks involve preconditions can be openly acknowledged and are conducted with an authorized representative of the iranian government7 president george bush in his january 1989 inaugural address seemed to reach out to iran referring to iran he said that goodwill begets goodwill that iranian help in gaining release of american hostages in lebanon might earn some us reciprocation the june 3 1989 death of the leader of the revolution ayatollah ruhollah khomeini also created some international optimism that irans policies might moderate under khomeinis successor ali khamenei and ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani who was elected president in august 1989 iran remained neutral during the 199091 gulf crisis although iran despite its long war with iraq criticized allied bombing of iraq as unjustified aggression that was killing muslim civilians us hostages in lebanon were all released by the end of 1991 and the bush administration publicly thanked iran for its intercession with the hostage holders the hizballah militia in lebanon in gaining their release the stage seemed set for usiran thaw but there was overall improvement in usiran relations the bush administration might have feared that trying to improve relations would open the administration to accusations that it was recapitulating the search for iranian moderates that the reagan administration was criticized for in irancontra for its part iran remained steadfastly opposed to improved relations with the united states because of the us support for the shah the us tilt toward iraq during the iran iraq war and the us involvement in the 1953 ouster of nationalist prime minister mohammad mossadeq iran also accused the united states of backing groups seeking to overthrow the islamic regime although the united states refused contact with key opposition group the peoples mojahedin which had killed five americans serving in iran during the shahs reign instruments of containment inherited from previous administrations despite occasional dealings with or outreach toward iran previous administrations established broad package of economic sanctions which served as basis from which to impleme nt containment of iran the purpose of the us sanctions was to deprive iran of the technology it needs to build up its strategic capabilities as well as to signal to iran and to other countries us opposition to irans policies httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97231crs5 8 these sanctions included the halting of us military spare parts shipments to iran november 8 ban on imports of iranian crude oil and unfinished oil or finished products made from iranian crude oil november 12 declaration of state of emergency against iran the blocking of all iranian government property in the united states and the freezing of iranian deposits in us banks and subsidiaries of us banks november 14 on april 7 1980 the president imposed ban on

2226 1998a wide range of economic sanctions on iran were imposed just after the november 4 1979 seizure of the american hostages in tehran8 the january 19 1981 algiers accords that ended the hostage crisis required the united states to lift all previous sanctions president carter implemented that commitment in series of executive orders in january 1981 but he did not restore diplomatic relations the resolution of the hostage crisis did not resolve all outstanding financial issues between the two countries the algiers accords set up process to arbitrate financial claims from the rupture in relations called the usiran claims tribunal which meets at the hague at the tribunal which convened for the first time on july 1 1981 panel of three americans three iranians and three neutral arbiters decide the conflicting governmental individual and corporate claims since the tribunal began work about 4000 cases have been resolved the overwhelming majority of which were in favor of us claimants the largest claims unresolved are by iran for us non performance on about 1200 foreign military sales fms cases in addition to military services these cases include military equipment including spruanceclass destroyers ihawk air defense batteries ch47 helicopters f16 aircraft and tongclass submarines that iran paid for but were not delivered because of irans revolution one press report says that the united states if found liable for these claims might have to pay iran 10 billion plus interest since 19799 some of the military items were resold to other buyers or were incorporated into the us arsenal one military case was settled in november 1991 when the united states paid iran 278 million for iranianowned military equipment undergoing repair or testing in the united states at the time

such monies unless the claims tribunal issues judgement in favor of iran in particular case against us contract or or supplier us officials say the potential value of the disputed letters of credit is very small compared to the issue of undelivered military equipment the united states government maintained control over about 22 million worth of iranian diplomatic property in the united states including the former iranian embassy in washington dc and associated operating accounts the united states asserts that the property was confiscated in reciprocity for irans seizure of the us embassy

december 7 1998 based on us assessments of areas in iran under cultivation the administration removed iran from the us list of major drug producing countries the removal exempted iran from an annual

katzman the clinton administrations dual containment strategy upon taking office the clinton administration stressed that it would contain iran within broader policy framework that casts both iran and iraq as rogue regimes and seeks to keep both weak17 on may 19 1993 at speech in washington former national security council senior director for the near east martin indyk first described the administrations policy as one of dual containment of iran and iraq18 the clinton administration presented dual containment as departure from previous us gulf policies that have relied on iran or iraq to restore or maintain stability in the gulf the past policies according to the administration had contributed to the downfall of the shah and the iraqi invasion of kuwait there was speculation among observers that the policy was intended to result in the overthrow of regimes in iran andor iraq but if this was the intention the administration did not state it explicitly19 in response to initial doubts among many observers that both countries could be contained simultaneously20 administr ation officials maintained that the new policy did not ignore balance of power considerations but rather sought to maintain that balance at low level of iranian and iraqi capability administration officials added that dual containment did not mean duplicate containment that us policy toward iran would be exactly the same as it was toward iraq iraq is contained by international implementation of very strict sanctions21 resulting from the august 2 1990 invasion and occupation of kuwait but iran is not subject to any or international sanctions therefore to contain iran the united states has acted unilaterally and bilaterally the iran policy of the first two years of the clinton administration relied largely on stepped up attempts to elicit cooperation from us allies and other countries in isolating iran the administrations objectives were to persuade us allies not to export arms or dual use items to iran not to reschedule any credits they have issuedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97231crs10 22 us congress house committee on foreign affairs subcommittee on europe and the middle east developments in the

pl 104107 but did not appear in the fy1997 appropriation pl 104208 to iran or to issue any new credits and not to support loans to iran by international or multilateral banks the administration said it did not seek to persuade its allies or other countries to cut off political dialogue or routine trade with iran but only to refuse to conduct normal relations with iran unless or until iran modified its unacceptable behavior22 differences in approaches to iran between the united states and its allies proved difficult to bridge the allies of the united states in europe and japan maintained that trade and contact with iran rather than isolation would succeed in moderating irans international behavior by helping promote moderate elements in iran who want greater international contact in december 1992 the european union eu countries formally adopted policy termed critical dialogue consisting of political and economic engagement with iran coupled with criticism of irans objectionable behavior some european governments maintained that the united states was excessively critical of the islamic regime in iran because of the fall of the shah key us ally and the 19791981 hostage crisis on the other hand some observers held that us allies may have overemphasized the political benefits of engagement to cover pragmatic calculation of the economic necessity of dealing with iran and its 65 million people most of irans external debt about 30 billion at its height in 1993 was held by creditors in european countries and japan and these countries wanted to ensure that iran was able to service this debt as of september 1999 and despite sharp temporary drop in oil prices during 1999 iran had reduced its external debt to about 117 billion not including an additional 10 billion in future interest payments and outstanding commercial debt over us opposing votes and diplomatic objections us allies voted with other countries in early 1993 to authorize 463 million in world bank loans to iran for power irrigation and health projects also over us bilateral protests the allies rescheduled about 14 billion in iranian debt during 19945 reaching bilateral agreements with iran rather than adhering to paris club rules that specify multilateral rescheduling with international monetary fund imf involvement administration and congressional pressure succeeded in

overthrow the iranian regime as the only policy that makes sense the administration s policy review which was completed by april 1995 reportedly found that continued us trade with iran particularly the trading of iranian oil overseas by us companies and their foreign subsidiaries was creating perception internationally that the united states was not serious about isolating iran in 1992 for example the united states and iran conducted 748 million in bilateral trade placing the united states among irans top five trading partners for that year during 1994 us oil companies purchased about onequarter of irans total oil exports for resale outside the united states in the course of the policy review the administration decided that additional steps should be taken to weaken and isolate iran the first opportunity came in early march 1995 when the us oil company conoco inc announced deal with iran to develop oilfields off irans sirri island in the persian gulf president clintons executive order 12957 of march 15 1995 barred us firms and their subsidiaries from investing in or managing the development of irans energy resources conoco although its contract was signed prior to the executive order and was not required to withdraw from the deal voluntarily canceled the contract french firm total sa in partnership with petronas of malaysia subsequently replaced conoco as the developer of the sirri fields in early october 1998 the field became operational at 7000 barrels per day of production and is expected to produce maximum of 100000 barrels per day

projects were offered to foreign investors as buyback arrangements in which the investing firm is repaid with percentage of the proceeds when the project becomes operational the us trade and investment ban on april 30 1995 president clinton announced in speech to the world jewish congress that he would ban us trade with and investment in iran the ban contained in executive order 12959 of may 6 1995 also prohibited reexportation to iran of us goods as well as any financing loans or related services for trade with iran24 the executive order prevented us firms from even negotiating with iran any investments or trade relations that would be implemented if and when the ban is rescinded however the executive order provided for the casebycase licensing of crude oil swap arrangements with iran in the caspian sea and central asia and did not prohibit the importation to the united states of iranian oil that is refined outside iran refined oil is considered product of the country in which it is refined the ban also left loophole for us products to be incorporated into goods manufactured in third country and containing more than 10 us content to be exported to iran this loophole was closed by executive order 13069 of august 19 1997 the trade ban did not immediately shift international attitudes toward iran only salvador israel ivory coast and uzbekistan expressed outright support for the measure japan and us allies in europe said they would not work to undermine it but they refused to give up their commercial ties to iran in october 1995 four months after the ban took effect administration officials testified before congress that iran had for the most part found new buyers for the oil previously purchased by us firms china and other asian countries increased their purchases of iranian oil although some were motivated as much by economic growth demands as by the desire to become closer to iran politically the relative lack of international support for the us trade ban appeared to convince the administration and many in congress that further steps were needed if iran were to be isolated and kept strategically weak imposition of secondary sanctionsilsa prior to the imposition of the us trade ban senator damato and others in congress had proposed ways to try to compel us allies to adopt us policies toward iran in march 1995 senator damato introduced bill s630 to impose us sanctions on foreign firms that engaged in business dealings with any sector of irans economy the administration opposed the measure on the grounds that such broad secondary sanctions would incur vehement european and other foreign country opposition however the administration agreed in principle with senator damato and others in congress who maintained that in order to reduce irans long term potential to fund terrorism and acquire weapons and technology the united states should act to prevent foreign investment in irans crucial energy sector the sector accounts for about 80 of irans foreign exchange revenues shortly before irans november 1995 solicitation for foreign investment in eleven major petroleum and gas development projects25 the administration and senator damato agreed on mutually acceptable version of s1228 introduced byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97231crs13 26 an amendment to s1228 applying all sanctions in the bill to libya as well as iran was

leadership was responsible for 1992 assassination of kurdish dissident in berlin however the eu diplomatic sanctions on iran were insufficient to achieve state department determination that the eu

that iran apparently is pursuing nuclear option and that it might become the next nuclear power in the middle east35 usiran relations since khatemis election although iran is still pursuing policies that are at odds with us interests the administration appears to believe that irans moderation under khatemi has been sufficient to provide an opportunity to end 20 years of mutual estrangement six days after khatemis election president clinton called the vote reaffirmation of the democratic process in iran and he said that he has never been pleased about the estrangements between the people of the united states and the people of iran one press report suggested that in the aftermath of khatemis election the united states began to send diplomatic messages to iran via saudi arabia that it wanted to improve relations36 this press article reported that the united states was responsible for the passage of the final communique of the g8 summit in denver june 22 1997 that indirectly praised irans mediation role in tajikistan us hopes for an early improvement in relations with iran increased in anticipation of khatemis cable news network interview on january 7 1998 advertised as message to the american people in the interview khatemi ruled out dialogue with the us government but he proposed that the two countries rebuild trust through unofficial exchanges of scholars athletes tourists and other cultural groups after the interview administration officials expressed disappointment that khatemi had ruled out governmenttogovernment dialogue administration spokespersons indicated that an official dialogue is the best way for the two countries to resolve their longstanding differences however recognizing the political constraints on khatemi the administration announced in february 1998 that it would accept his call for unofficial cultural exchanges and look for ways to facilitate such ties httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97231crs21 this position left some us officials outside experts and us corporations unsatisfied maintaining that the united states needed to do still more to reach out to khatemi some strategists believe that better us relations with iran can help contain iraq which has been challenging the weapons inspection regime since october 1997 and inspections have been conducted since december 1998 others believed that unless the united states were more active in reaching out to iran khatemi would progressively lose power to his hardline opponents who maintain that the united states is implacably hostile to irans revolution on the other hand some in congress opposed bolder outreach toward iran on the grounds that doing so would ultimately lead to an end to us efforts to contain irans strategic capabilities some in and outside the administration were concerned that us overtures toward iran would be politically unpopular many americans associate iran with the 197981 hostage crisis the holding of american hostages in lebanon and the failed attempt to reach out to purported iranian moderates during the iran affair in mid1998 apparently frustrated at khatemis inability or unwillingness to begin an official dialogue the administration opted for bolder approach to iran on june 17 1998 in speech to the asia society secretary of state albright called for temporary alternative to political dialogue she offered that the two countries undertake unspecified mutual confidence building measures road map that would eventually lead to normalization of relations president clinton reiterated and reinforced the comments the following day the administration has taken several other steps over the past few years to signal its willingness to improve relations with iran these apparent overtures include the following on october 8 1997 the state department officially designated the iranian opposition peoples mojahedin organization of iran pmoi as terrorist group in accordance with the provisions of the anti terrorism and effective death penalty act of 1996 pl 104132 two years later the administration designated the pmois umbrella group the national council of resistance ncr as an alias of the pmoi thus applying the same restrictions on the ncr as apply to the pmoi ban on contributions by us persons to the group and ban on entry into the united states by group members and freezing of group assets in the united states however the ncr continues to operate in the united states some in congress consider the pmoincr legitimate organization fighting the regime in tehran and that the us terrorist designation represented an unwarranted concession to tehran many experts interpreted may 18 1998 us waiver of ilsa see above sanctions against total sa and its partners in part as concession to tehran even though the official rationale focused on us efforts to prevent iran policy from dividing the united states and the eu administration statements that deal between royal dutchshell and iran to develop two iranian oil fields would take ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97231crs22 long time to evaluate was taken by many as signal that ilsa sanctions would be imposed on that or similar deals on decemb er 7 1998 the administration removed iran from the us list of major drugproducing countries the decision exempts iran from the annual certification process that had placed some economic sanctions on iran although these sanctions were generally duplicated by other laws and designations the removal from the list was based on objective criteria of area under narcotics cultivation in iran but it was widely viewed as positive signal toward iran since khatemis election president clinton and other senior officials have referred to iran as great nation and great civilization and islam as major world religion in april 1999 president clinton said that iran had been subject to quite lot of abuse from various western countries and that it had right to be angry his comments were viewed as an apology for reported us and british efforts to oust nationalist prime minister mohammad mossadeq in 1953 and for the strong us backing for the former shah of iran in april 1999 the administration announced it would consider on casebycase basis commercial sales of food and medicine to iran and libya and sudan under regulations issued on july 27 1999 private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales but us exporters cannot deal directly with iranian banks and us government credit guarantees are being provided however agriculture secretary dan glickman said in september 1999 that us credit guarantees for such sales which do not meet the standard definition of us foreign assistance since the guarantee would be paid to the us exporter not iran were under consideration on october 5 1999 the administration confirmed press reports that it had sent direct message to iran asking for cooperation into the june 5 1996 bombing of the khobar towers military housing complex in saudi arabia many viewed the direct message reportedly passed via an omani official intermediary as an overture toward iran however in confirming the direct message state department spokesman jamie rubin was also portraying continued us concerns about iran by stating that the united states had information but not proof that iranian government officials might have been involved in the bombing if it is shown that iranian officials were involved in the bombing the consequences are uncertain because the bombing preceded khatemis tenure and saudiiranian relations have since improved substantially on november
