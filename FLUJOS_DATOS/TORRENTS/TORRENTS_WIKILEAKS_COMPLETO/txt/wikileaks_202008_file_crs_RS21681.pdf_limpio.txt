taped messages to the iraqi people similar to those of the presidents weekly radio address in the united states some public diplomacy specialists have criticized imn for not dis tinguishing itself from the cpa and producing original programing observers note that saic has little experience in training journalists and establishing independent media and has previously perfo rmed defense functions
