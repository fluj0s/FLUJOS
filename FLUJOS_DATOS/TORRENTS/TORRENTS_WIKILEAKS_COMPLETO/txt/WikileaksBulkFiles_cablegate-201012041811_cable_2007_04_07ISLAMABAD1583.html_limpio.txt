pull out of iraq without tripartite political settlement ref islamabad 1517 classified by charge daffaires peter bodde reasons 14 b d 1 u on april 3 president musharraf met with senator john mccain raz and representative richard renzi raz musharrafs third us congressional delegation of the day reftel the groups discussion focused on iraq the broader middle east and the pakafghan border region muslim countries should play lead role in iraq and help solve the israelipalestinian dispute 2 c musharraf noted that he and many middle eastern leaders were worried that premature pullout of us and coalition forces from iraq would spread sectarian strife throughout the gulf region musharraf underlined the importance of increasing the capacity of the iraqi armed forces and police he noted there could be little improvement in the situation in iraq without broader political participation from the sunnis musharraf agreed with senator mccain that muslim countries needed to lead efforts to help iraqs shias sunnis and kurds reach political consensus before major withdrawal of coalition troops musharraf said he understood us public opinion was against prolonging us presence in iraq but hoped us leadership could communicate the importance of the mission in iraq turning to the future of iraq musharraf hoped that muslim peacekeeping troops including pakistanis could replace us forces under united nations umbrella 3 c conflicts outside iraq also contributed to the unstable situation in the region musharraf said musharraf noted that in addition to saudi king abdullahs work in forging an arab consensus on iraq he was working on building consensus within the muslim world on the palestinian issue work that was slowly but surely bringing syria back into the arab fold alluding to his own outreach to the moderate muslim world musharraf noted there was space for nonarab nations to play role on iraq and the israelipalestinian dispute and that pakistan indonesia and malaysia had agreed to form united voice to help promote peace in the region musharraf said he was the first nonarab leader invited to address the arab league summit 4 c musharraf said he believed syrian president bashar alassad could play positive role in both iraq and lebanon and that assad could be handled if the us understood his issues if you want him to play ball he needs comfort on other fronts namely the golan heights8 turning to another iraqi neighbor musharraf agreed with the delegation that iran could not be allowed to create further divisions in iraq the pakafghan border past decisions created present security problem 5 c when asked for his views on afghanistan musharraf islamabad 00001583 002 of 003 said pakistan was facing the fallout from security decisions made in the 1980s people who came to fight with the mujahideen against the soviets settled in pakistans tribal areas and now had families these people mostly uzbeks and arabs developed links with qaeda recently tribal groups in both south and north waziristan were taking action against uzbeks and other foreigners because of the foreigners cruel and highhanded behavior pakistans military provided covert support in the form of arms and ammunition musharraf reported that in south waziristan large group of foreign militants were surrounded on ridge and would soon surrender 6 c originally musharraf said the taliban movement was reaction against growing tribalism and warlordism in afghanistan since russia and india supported afghanistans ethnic tajik northern alliance pakistans natural ally was the ethnic pashtun taliban this all changed after 911 musharraf said and pakistan had captured and killed hundreds of qaeda fighters near tora bora were going after militants bin laden may be here but mullah omars not 7 snf echoing similar statements hed made during an earlier meeting with codel tierney reftel musharraf said that although he had direct evidence he thought qaeda leaders osama bin laden and ayman alzawahiri were hiding in bajaur agency since it was in afghan militant leader gulbuddin hekmatyars territory and bordered afghanistans konar province the landscape in videos of bin laden and zawahiri looked similar to bajaur musharraf said and the area provided comfort high mountains positive support and an absence of us troops in neighboring konar 8 c musharraf voiced concern over afghan president karzais frequent pronouncements about pakistans failure8 to capture taliban leader mullah omar in balochistans capital quetta let tell you8 musharraf emphasized omar would be mad to be in quetta he has too many troops to command in southern afghanistan to make it feasible in fact the only parts of balochistan where there are pakistani taliban are in the provinces afghan refugee camps which we are planning to shut down8 musharraf said that most pashtuns in balochistan were traders and had reason to join the taliban they want roads to increase their trade not to fight8 the same could not be said for the federally administered tribal areas musharraf said 9 c musharraf said the taliban were mainly in afghanistan karzais policies musharraf believed alienated afghanistans pashtuns by favoring ethnic tajik panshiris after coalition forces joined the northern alliance to oust the taliban government there was change in the ethnic makeup of the victors when it came to planning panshiris were disproportionately represented in the government even though they had never ruled before and were musharraf believed the natural enemy of the countrys majority pashtuns islamabad 00001583 003 of 003 new strategy in the tribal areas and the ethnic dimension in afghanistan 10 c turning to the federally administered tribal areas musharraf stated that taliban militants from afghanistan drew support from pakistan for resupply hospitals recruitment and indoctrination of new troops musharraf emphasized military force alone could not deny terrorists safe haven in the tribal areas over the long term that was why musharraf explained pakistan was pursuing fourpronged strategy that included military political development and administrative elements the fencing of the pakafghan border in some parts of the federally administered tribal areas would reduce some crossborder movement he said but it was not enough musharraf described development as the most forwardlooking and in some ways most complex part of the strategy pakistan was looking for us assistance and expertise pakistans taliban problem is an extremism issue 11 c one of pakistans biggest concerns musharraf said was the spread of talibanization especially into settled and urban areas countering talibanization required well thought out strategy to cleanse society of the taliban culture and to encourage moderation modernization and economic development were the way forward musharraf noted talibanization was even spreading to islamabad as you could see by the recent events at the red mosque reported septel afghanistans poppy industry should go legal 12 c in response to mccains question about whether musharraf was worried afghanistan would become narcostate musharraf answered that he was especially because if it did it would affect pakistan musharraf thought afghanistan could follow the example of other countries such as india where narcotics were purchased legally and channeled into the international pharmaceutical industry it was 500600 million annual industry musharraf said and the profits made from legal poppy sales could go toward poverty alleviation instead of to the taliban bodde
