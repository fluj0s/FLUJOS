6207c10 shspec169 repetitive rudiments and repetitive prepchecking part ii repetitive process is one that is run over and over with the pc answering and the auditor acknowledging it is run to precise flat point when used with ruds and prepchecking you run it to clean needle and further beginning ruds would always he done repetitive early in auditing you would also do middle and end rudiments repetitively it is kind of prepcheck in disguise thereafter you would run middle and end ruds as fast ruds you would normally run the random rudiment missed withhold as fast rudiment not as repetitive rudiment you may have to fish around for it be very sure you get it answered the repetitive rud approach was first used in sec checking where it was quite successful prepchecking using the withhold system running chains was too hard to teach auditors also this system is hard to use with poorly reading arc breaky pc it is not as successful as repetitive prepchecking the average auditor gets more done with repetitive prepchecking and the pc gets into session better with this method dont use more rudiments than you find in model session though you can make them understandable eg to child if you seem to need more rudiments you still have the solution the arc breaky pc comes to pieces on ow so ow is added to model session it can be used when the pc is so involved in some upset that he cant pay any attention to the rest of the session his attention is so fixated that any change of his attention will lead to arc breaks and upsets the other time ow is used is when pc is seriously ill too ill to be audited this situation is handled with general ow as the first rudiment general ow goes into model session right after start of session the commands are what have you done to another withheld from another it is not run against the meter it is run against the pc it can get his ta moving some pcs with highly automatic bank with everything grouped and all in motion will give you multiple picture reaction when you ask them one question the pc goes all over the time track this is not very common but when you run into it it is hard to control the pc and they cant run well on anything except ow the pc who complains of auditing result is likely to have an automatic bank you will find this out if you ask what is happening when you give the pc command however these pcs will respond to ow and get excellent ta so if you notice that you had gotten good ta on ow just move it into the body of the session otherwise run it until the pc feels much better and then do the ruds if you notice that you had gotten ta on ow when you never had much on anything else resume the ow you cant really run the ta out of it because of the breadth of the question if the pc comes into session arc broken all that would happen if you asked are you willing to talk to about your difficulties would be screams and snarls letting the pc commit overts against the auditor you dont ask what have you done to etc because you may be allergic on his terminal line besides this would be putting the pcs attention on the auditor but you can run general ow if the pc seems to be withholding things and having hard time you can use missed withhold as random rudiment thats what random means can be used at any time checked against the meter so you can use ow and the pc will eventually settle down and look calmer then go into your ruds if one of the questions may have read when you checked it and you are not sure dont pretend give the pc the rfactor that the read is equivocal and recheck ideally your metering should be so good that you use the ta to control the needle so that it is sitting exactly at set exactly at the end of your question not still bouncing back from somewhere else never try to read needle on fast rise always distrust fast rises goal doesnt have enough impulse to read down against fast rise it will show up as tiny slow if you see it read at all the needle that is flying around has inertia and slight read can get missed so be suspicious and dont hesitate to call read equivocal and recheck be sure it is clean before you call it clean or the pc will know that he is getting by the meter and will read less and less on the meter you will then have to go back over all your earlier zero questions and see that one gave tiny read dont miss it this time clean them all up and you will build the case back to reading well the only time in rudiments that you ask pc to amplify or reneat his answer is when you didnt understand it if you fake an understanding you are disturbing the knowingness button this button is the most serious one you can push in case dont fail to understand the pc while acting as though you do the onus of understanding and of making something understood is on the auditor tr4 is not q and you are asking for comprehension so that an asisness can take place you ask rudiment question until the pc has more answers without checking the meter if you get read on checking the question you use it to guide the pc who doesnt know what it was into seeing what was still there after getting the pcs answer you then leave the meter until the pc says again because he will now give you all the locks when it is clean ask do you agree that was clean and tr4 whatever he says dont go back to the rudiment if he says he doesnt agree the exact same procedure is used for repetitive prepchecking it depends on the mechanism of cycling on the track to pick up the basic pcs will stay in session quite cheerily with this it takes longer than using the withhold system but it is much easier and more certain as long as you clean all the reads you get the pc will be cheerful and easy to audit if you miss few the pc will become nattery and hard to audit by virtue of not reading well if you make the opposite mistake of asking the question again after it was clean hell hath arc breaks like the one you have thereby set up this is because thetan is closest to nothing and you have given him nothingness withhold missed withhold of nothing that is very upsetting to thetan because 1 there is nothing there so he cant spot it or asis it 2 he is closest to nothing himself so he feels as if he himself has been missed you didnt buy nothing so nothing is unacknowledged so therefore he is unacknowledged so dont try to clean read that is not there this system of repetitive rudiments and prepchecking has liability it pulls the pc thoroughly into session and builds up fantastic arc between the auditor and the pc then if the auditor speaks his mind inopportunely or goes on automatic the arc break will be magnitudinous just because of the degree to which the pc is in session this system was invented because due to the fact that pcs were not well in session auditors were having trouble getting pcs to read on the meter auditor tr1 also contributed to the problem commonly and in social context meter is inoperative the pc has to be in session to some degree for the meter to react at all social conversation wont activate meter the better arc you have with the pc the better the meter reads meters are not like lie detectors lie detector reads because of terror an emeter reads on arc the pc knows that it doesnt matter what overt he gets off you are not going to turn him in if you miss reads they operate as missed withholds and the pc ceases to read well the repetitive system gets the pc talking about his case before you read the meter so it will work where nothing else does
