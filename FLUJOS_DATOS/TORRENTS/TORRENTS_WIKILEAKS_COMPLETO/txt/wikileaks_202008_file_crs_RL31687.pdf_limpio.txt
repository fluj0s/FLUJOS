spending in half century outpaced only by the marshall plan following world war ii and the latin americafocused alliance for progress in the early 1960s administration officials char acterize the mca as representing the most comprehensive policy change ever in how the united states designs implements and monitors development assistance to w and lowermiddle income nations in particular executive officials emphasize the resultsbased aspect of the initiative in which countries will be selected based on past and current performance and programs will be evaluated on and required to show measurable achievements that impact favorably on economic growth and poverty reduction conditioning assistance on policy perfo rmance and accountability by recipient nations is not new element of us aid programs since the late 1980s at least portions of american development assist ance have been allocated by the us agency for international development usaid to some degree on performance based system what is significantly diffe rent about the mca is that the entire 5 billion money pool which is nearly tw ice the size of the fy2003 usaid core development aid budget will be tied to performance and results moreover program proposals will be base d on national development stra tegies developed by the countries themselves with us role limited to providing t echnical assistance in project design further in another ma jor departure from past policy the mca is intended to focus exclusively on developm ent goals without being influenced by other us foreign policy and geostrategic objectives that often strongly influence us aid decision making neverthele ss while new details regarding country eligibility selection criteri and organizational st ructure were announced in december 2003 many issues have not yet b een decided and remain under review by the executive branch congress plays key role in the approval of the initiative by way of considering authorization and funding gislation and in confirming the head or ceo of the millennium challenge corporation that manages the mca under the presidents plan congress will also maintain continuing oversight of the program as it is implemented and additional funding is sought in subsequent years among numerous policy issues for congress raised by the mca proposal were country eligibility should the mca target both low and lower middle income countries as proposed by the administration or should it focus exclusively on the poorest nations where the needs are the greatest and where access to other financial resources is limited and if both how should f unds be allocated between the two groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs3 1 others will argue however that of equal or perhaps more importance has been the close ties of us foreign assistance with more strategic and geopolitical goals where development results have been of secondary importance for policymakers charged with aid allocations and policy formulations 2

budgetary implications on the mca background of the millennium challenge account initiative context the concept of the millennium challeng account is based on the premise that economic development succeeds best where it is linked to sound economic and good governance policies especially where these conditions exist prior to expanding resource transfers past fa ilures of economic aid provide d by the united states and other international donors some argue have been caused to large extent by lack of attention to performance and the requirement for measurable results1 executive branch officials say that the mca abandons the process of basing aid allocations on promises by recipient governments to initiate policy changes in the future and instead will make those decisions based on achievements already made and policies that are currently working2 this view has been joined by grow ing body of literature in the late 1990s concluding that there was little relationship between the amount of development aidhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs4 3 see for example craig burnside and david dollar aid spurs growth in sound policy environment finance and development december 1997 and

us aid since 1980 had their median per capita gross domestic product gdp decline from 1076 to 994 by 20005 also influencing the debate over the launch of new foreign aid initiative are the terrorist attacks of september 11and an evaluation of their causes there remain differences of perspective regarding po ssible direct relati onship between poverty and terrorism especially given the fact that many terrorist leaders come from relatively wealthy backgrounds but most agree that poverty can be contributing factor president bush in announcin g the mca on march 14 2002 made numerous references to the war on terrorism noting that we also work for prosperity and opportunity because they help defeat terror he further emphasized that although poverty does not cause terrorism poverty prevents governments from controlling their borders policing their territory and enforcing their laws development provides the resources to build hope nd prosperity and security6 accompanying this was renewed

horizing legislation and funding recommendations in 2003 and w ill later debate th confirmation of the mcc chief officer followed by continuing oversight of program impleme ntation several key elements of the initiative have been and will continue to be closely examined these will include matters that have already been decided within the executive branch as well as issues that remain under discussion country eligibility and income levels one of the first questions addressed by the executive steering committee was where the income cutoff point should be drawn for purposes of defining potential mca participants the bate chiefly focused on wh ether only the poorest nations should be considered for mca programs as noted above the administration announced in late november 2002 that pool of 115 countries phased in over three years would compete for mca resources they are grouped into three clusters according to income level and world bank borrowing status with new cluster added to the competition each year corres ponding to the anticipated rise in mca resources in fy2004 only the 75 idaeligib countries with per capita incomes below 1415 can compete while 12 more will be added the next year8 by fy2006 when 5 billion is planned for mca progra ms countries with per capita incomes between 1415 and 2935 28 in number w ill be added since countries above 1415 per capita

avoid income bias issue income eligibility there emerged at the outset relatively broad consensus within the us development community that the mca should focus on idaeligible lowincome countries9 for policy aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing poverty most agreed that it made sense to place emphasis wher the greatest needs existed by expanding the number and income level of mca participants beyond idaeligible status some argued the amount of money available for the poorest nations would be reduced some also not ed that the 28 member lowmiddle income group includes nations that maintain strong political and strategic ties with the us egypt jordan colombia turkey and russia that would increase the possibility or at least the perception that c ountries might be sel ected on criteria other than mca performance measures it may fu rther tend to blur the distinction between mca goals and objectives of other aid pr ograms jeopardizing the unique approach of the mca and the need for programmatic flexibility10 achieving economic results as an objective has frequently taken position secondary to strategic interests in us aid allocation consider ations in the past in addition some point out that the poorest countries ve far less access to capital from private sources making mca resources even more valuable to them according to one analysis aid as percent of gross national income gni for ida eligible countries with per capita inco mes below 1415 totals 108 compared with 14 for the higher income group below 2935 gross private capital flows as percent of gdp for the poorer idaeligib countries below 1415 is 69 while those between 1415 and 2935 receive 103 tax revenues and do mestic savings as percent of gdp among lowmiddle in come countries are roughly d ouble the level of those for idaeligible borro wers below 14 15 thus providing more expansive potential source of financing11 others however argue that lowmiddl income countries deserve equal consideration in program intended to identify and partner with the best performers in some cases they assert commitments to sound po licies have enabled nations to move into the higher income range if primary goal of the mca is to maximize the effectiveness of aid res ources then nonida countries should behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs9 12 paolo pasicolan and sara j fitzgerald the millennium challenge account linking aid with economic freedom the heritage foundation october17 2002 p 2 13 the two indicators for which this would not be the case are trade policy which would be the same for each group and threeyear budget deficits however because qualification under the latter indicator is set at specified threshold less than 20 percent group medians would have impact on whether country passed this hurdle source crs analysis based on data compiled by steve radelet center for global developmentincluded12 in addition countries falling in the 1415 2935 per capita income range while maintaining higher income levels also have large numbers of people living in poverty these countries with st ronger institutions nd better capacity may also be better positioned to apply mca resources more effectively one argument of those favoring exclusiv participation of countries below the 1415 vel that betteroff economies would score higher on the eligibility indicators raise the median standards for qualification and squeeze out the poorest nations seems to be addressed by th administration based on preliminary estimate of the median scores of each gr oup the median would be higher and in some cases significantly higher for 14 of the 16 indicators for lowmiddle income countries compared with those below 1415 gni per capita13 in fy2006 when the 28 higherincome countries become eligible they will be evalua ted separately from the other 87 competing against each other to score above the group median on the 16 indicators this would allow countries to qualify based on comparisons with their incomelevel peers whether the administration will divide mca resources into two pots of money for each income group has not been determined in any case unless the administration and congress agree to increase the mca beyond the proposed 5 billion target whatever number of lowmiddle income nations that qualify will reduce the amount of resources that would ot herwise be available for those below the 1415 level congressional proposals to modify income eligibility reflecting the perspective that the mca should remain focused on the poorest countries the senate foreign relations committee r ecommended in s 1160 as adde d to s 950 to permit participation by lowmiddle income c ountry in fy2006 and beyond only if mca funding exceeds 5 billion if not mca programs could only be supported in countries that fall below the historical pe r capita income cutoff of the international development association level that is currently 1415 even in years when the mca appropriation exceeds 5 billion the nate bill would limit funding to low middle income participants to 20 of the total amount the foreign relations committee further expressed its intention that mca programs in the lowmiddle income countries should focus on poor communities in those nations the house international relations committee in hr 1950 also limited to 20 the amount of mca resources that c ould be allocated in fy2006 to lowmiddle income participants but unlike the sena the house measure did not require an appropriation in excess of 5 billion for inclusion of the lowincome group in fy2006 the committee considered two ame ndments during markup related to the income issue the first offered by c ongressman payne and approved by the house panel would have required lowmiddle income countries that are selected for mcahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs10 grants to make contribution from their own resources to whatever mca programs are funded the second amendment proposed by congressman menendez originated out of concern that few 7 latin american nations would be eligible to compete for mca resources in the first tw years despite larg pockets of poverty in these countries the menendez amendm ent which was defeated 1024 would have made lowmiddle in come nations group which includes nine from latin america eligible from the beginning similarly congressman kolbe proposed an amendment during house floor debate that would have allowed lowmiddle income countries to be eligible beginning in fy2005 rather than fy2006 the kolbe amendment failed 110313 while sympathe tic to the concerns expressed by sponsors of the amendment those opposed to changing the income eligibility structure argued that resources diverted from latin america and many other nations would come at the expense of the worl ds poorest nations where the needs are greatest as enacted in division d of pl 108199 the mca authorizing legislation follows the earlier house and senate plan of including only lowincome countries in the program during fy2004 and fy2005 beginning in fy2006 lowmiddle income nations with percapita inco above 1415 may also partic ipate but they can only receive 25 of the amount appropria ted for the mca in that year performance indicators and selection process executive branch decisions on which pe rformance indicators to use have been guided by whether the data and methodolog are transparent publically available accurate and easy to understand another key factor is whether the data source provides full coverage for as many countri as possible and is relatively current officials further sought to identify i ndicators that would be few in number but sufficient to reflect broad policy results in each of the three policy categories and valid relationships between the indi cators and economic growth and poverty reduction finding indicators that meet ll of these requirements is difficult and according to some impossible gather ing valid economic social and political statistics especially in developing nations has always been difficult often resulting in significant gaps in coverage and long lag times gaining consensus on whether given set of indicators accurately measures policy achievements unfettered of institutional bias by whatever organization or individuals collect and interpret the data is also major challenge as noted above the administration s settled on 16 indicators for measuring performance and determining c ountry eligibility as shown in table 1 six fall within each of the ruling justly and encouragin g economic freedom categories while four will determine results in the area of investing in people sources include international institutions such as the world bank imf and and non governmental and private organizations like freedom house heritage foundation and the institutional investor magazine nati onal statistics will also be drawn upon where gaps occur but none of the data sets will be compiled by the us government for aggregating country scores the admin istration decided to use hurdles approach instead of adding up the results and ranking nations top to bottom to qualify country must score above the median on half of the indicators in eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs11 policy area in other words countrys ra nking must be above the median of all 75 countries in the first year on three of th six indicators for ruling justly and economic freedom and two of the four for investing in people the one exception to the median standard is the inflation indicator countrys inflation must be below 20 percent in order to pass that hurdle fficials believe that the hurdle methodology will demonstrate that country is committe d in all three areas and more precisely identify policy weaknesses in year three and beyond when lowmiddle income countries are added to the competition th ere will be parate evaluations for countries below and above 1415 per capita incomes so that higher income countries will not drive up the median and ex clude poorer nations from qualifying importantly one indicator control of corruption will be passfail test in which any country scoring at or be low the median on this measure will be disqualified regardless of performance on an of the other 15 indicators executive officials argue that since there are strong links be tween financial accountability and economic success strong commitment to fight corruption must be demonstrated by all mca participants further after passing all the requi red hurdles countrys score will be evaluated by the mcc board of directors who will make the final recommendations to the president the board will be granted degree of discretion in selecting the final participants taking in to account such things as ssing or old data trends in performance and other info rmation that might reflect on countrys commitment to economic growth and poverty reduction moreover officials have yet to decide whether to fund programs in all countries that qualify and pa ss the final review final selection for example could hinge on the quality of program proposals submitted by the best performing nations although other selection options are also under discussi on presumably the president will also maintain flexibility as to whether to agree with the boards recommendations congressional action on performance indicators measures considered in the senate and house s 1160 as amende d and incorporated into s 925 and hr 2441 as amended and incorporated into hr 1950 did not directly legislate the list of performance indicators to be used thereby allowing the executive branch to apply the measures that it has recommended both however provided for advance congressional consultation nd public awareness s 925 required that the list of proposed indicators be published in the fede ral register and on the internet and that the administration consider public comment prior to issuing the final determination of

challenging_aidcountry20qualification20upd ate1pdfissue association of perfo rmance indicators with economic growth and poverty reduction analysts will be examining the set of 16 indicators to determine how well they pred ict successful development outcomes an initial assessment by the center for global development suggests that many of the indicators show reasonable or strong relationship with economic growth infant mortality and literacy rates although few show weak associations especially in the economic freedom category according to the centers analysis each of the six governance indicators maintains good or strong correlation to development outcomes the measure of public primary education spending as percent of gdp however is weakly associated with the three development standards three of the six economic freedom indicators trade polic days to start business and three year budget deficits are also found in the study as being weakly correlated with development achievements14 issue hurdles and median vs aggregated ranking some argue that an aggregation of scores nd toptobottom ranking rather than the use of hurdles is better way in which to determine ligibility with an bovethemedian score requirement while the administration holds that passing half the hurdles in each of the three policy areas ensures broa d commitment to both economic growth and poverty reduction it also means that countri do not have to meet each of the 16 standards to qualify this approach parts from more traditional aid requirements in which recipients must comply with all conditions associated with program framework especially those of the world bank imf and in some cases us aid agreements once country passes hurdle there are limited incentives to keep improving in those areas for countries that miss qualifying by small margin however the incentive remains use of the median also in some cases complicates efforts for country to pass the hurdle due to outcomes beyond its cont rol the median will change over time sometimes because new countries are added to the pool as will be the case in fy2005 in other instances country may improve on particular indicator but still not pass the hurdle because other countries improve more significantly and push the median higher conversely government could regress or remain stagnant over time but pass hurdle it had

according to more recent data egypt would not qualify in fy2006set specific individual thresholds that would be relevant to each indicator or to use absolute scores15 further issue in use of the median is that for three of the indicators political rights civil liberties and trade policy the range is relatively narrow for scoring country performance resulting in many fa lling at the median the freedom house assigns scores on 17 scale while the he ritage foundation uses scale of 15 for the trade policy indicator fo r example 15 of the 75 idaeligible countries are assigned the median score of 4 since country must place above the median to pass hurdle this eliminates number of candidates with limited differentiation of performance issue surprising country outcom and modifying the indicators many have been surprised by the possib ility that countries such as vietnam and china might qualify despite scoring near the bottom on half of the indicators for ruling justly both countries pass the hurdles for corruption rule of law and government effectiveness but have some of the worst scores in the categories of political rights civil liberties and voice and accountability since they score above the median for three of the six indicators and pass the corruption measure they would qualify at least in the ruling justly category one analyst attributes this to the high degree of correlation among several indicators in single category that tends to magnify existing data deficiencies when half the indicators in single category ar strongly related to one another and country scores well in those areas the othe r indicators essentially become irrelevant egypt is also cited as an example of country with poor record on regulation and trade but would have passe d the economic freedom grouping with data available in early 2003 based on the strength of macroeconomic indicators16 one modification to the cu rrent proposal that woul d address this potential weakness would be to make re that highly correlated indicators represent less than onehalf the total cluster in this way country would not pass one of the three categories based on strong showing in one respect but very poor standards for the other measures another alteration to the administrations plan would be to add an additional indicator in each category so that there would be an odd number of measurements in each category in sens the added element would become tie breaker in cases where the current indicators tended to cluster in two evenly divided highly correlated groupings one review of the mca proposal

countries like vietnam and china would fail the ruling justly test17 issue data accuracy and availability due to the difficulty in collecting accurate data especially those based on perceptions certain degree of error can be expected in each of the 16 measurements this cannot be overcome but is mitigated to some extent by the requirement of only having to pass half the hurdles in each policy area but it appears most problematic for the passfail test of corruption according to an assessment made by the au thors of the corruption index there is large margin of error and high degree of uncertainty for 25 countries that score slightly above or slightly below the dian either crosscountry data are not informative or sources disagree on country s corruption standing of the total of 25

challenges strict interpretation of the data would result in failing grade on hurdle where figures were available only 87 of the 115 possible mcaeligible count ries have been reported with regard to

contending that any discretion on the part of the board would invite unwarranted political influence and undermine mca effectiveness21 another analyst argues that one way to avoid undue foreign policy intrusion would be to channel mca funds through multilatera l entities such as the world bank22 congressional proposals to modify board of directors discretion as noted below the senate foreign relations committee initially reported an mca authorization bill that did not authorize the creation of millennium challenge corporation with board overseeing its operations instead s 1160 placed the mca within the state department under the authority of the secr etary of state and gave the secretary the power to determine eligible countries through the evaluation of governments commitment to several factors in the three areas of ruling justly economic freedom and i nvesting in people subsequently however th senate voted on july 9 2003 to modify the mcc structure and the role of the board of di rectors by adopting revised text that was largely based on proposal offered by senator lugar s 1240 the modified arrangement which was incorporated as division c of s 925 established corporation to be managed by ceo under the senate measure the ceo would report to and be under the direct author ity and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state s 925 as amended further established board of directors chaired by the secretary of state and grants the board the power to determine eligible countries by evaluating the commitment of country to democratic governance economic freedom and investme nts in people this did not however appear to limit the boards selections based solely on the results of the performance indicators in this way the senate measure seemed to permit similar degree of discretion that the adminis trations plan envisioned the housepassed measure hr 1950 was similar to the senate bill in that it required eligible countries to have demonstrated commitment to bolstering democracy investing in health and education and promoting sound economic policies but did not specifically identify how such commitment would be determined other than thr ough the creation of eligibility criteria and methodologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs18 23 see for example gene sperling and tom hart better way to fight global poverty broaending the millennium challenge account foreign affairs marchapril 2003 p 9as enacted the mca authorizing legislation follows the general themes of earlier house and senate bills eligible countries are to be determined to the maximum extent possible by objective and quantifiable indicators measuring countrys commitment to the three core po licy goals of ruling justly promoting economic freedom and investing in people the legislation directs that the selection is to be based on the consid eration of three factors th extent to which the country meets or exceeds the eligibility criteri the opportunity to reduce poverty and promote economic growth in the country nd how much money is available to carry out mca programs this appears to provide substantial flexibility and discretionary authority in the selection process where the house and senate bills diverged however regarded who made the determination of eligibility and therefor who would be in position to exercise discretion in deviating from strictly st atistical evaluation s 925 as amended on july 9 gave the board of directors au thority to determine whether country is eligible while hr 1950 placed the power with the corporations ceo the enacted legislation gives this aut hority to the board of directors implications for other us assistance programs the mca initiative will be an additional economic assistance tool of the united states and is not intended to replace or substitute for any existing channel of us foreign aid it can be expected therefore that overall american aid will continue to serve multiple national interests and foreign policy goals including security humanitarian multilateral and commercial objectives administration officials have made commitment that the mca will be in addition to existing aid activities and that regular us programs will continue even in mcapar ticipating countries nevertheless because of the priority being placed on the mca policy orientation and the size of the financial investment there almost certainly will be ramifications of the new initiative for current programs foremo st may be funding tradeoffs especially given rising budget deficits and the cost s of fighting the war on terrorism spending issues are also discussed below in the section on legislation and budgets issue commitment to global initiatives during the past year some analysts have argued that portion of th mca should be dedicat ed to effective and resultsoriented global programs operated on multilateral basis one concern is that the large amount of resources directed to the mca may limit the u s ability to maintain or expand upon commitments to such activities as the global fund to fight hivaids tuberculosis and malaria nother worry is that soundly managed high impact programs in countries with weak governance and poor corruption standards will miss out on the mca opportunity to acceler ate process that is already making contribution to longterm economic gr owth and poverty re duction proponents of this view advocate twotiered appro ach to the mca in which separate pools and perhaps multiple pools are maintained to serve several types of activities23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs19 24

multilateral programs regardless of their merits do not necessarily have the same resultsorien ted performance requirements of the mca fact that would undermine the main objectiv of the mca increased resources are only one important feature of the new in itiative and to many mca advocates the most significant feature by far is the goal of allocating the aid where it will have the greatest impact and be most readily accounted for issue policy coherence and usaid program goals in mca countries the administration says it will maintain regular development aid programs in country while it simultane ously launches far larger mcadesigned activity executive officials have not said however how this might affect the shape and goals of continuing programs mana ged by usaid missions some may argue that regular aid objectives should be reori ented to maintain po licy consistency with the mca initiative and in some cases to help facilitate the core focus of the larger pool of resources others especially w ithin usaid country missions may question whether successful projects should be abandoned with potential negative impact on the target popula tion in perhaps the clearest statement to date usaid administrator natsios told the house foreign operations appropriations subcommittee that actions may vary from count ry to country he noted that usaid missions in mcaselected countries would likely undert ake strategic review of their programs and may adjust projects to support the mca contract in other cases however missions might continue highpriority activities such as those combating hivaids or curbing trafficking in persons or terminate certain activities24 some of these same issues regarding policy coherence are being raised regarding the relationship between the mca and othe r us economic and trade tools aimed at promoting economic growth in developi ng nations one study for example concludes that there is very little overlap between countri likely to qualify for the mca and those currently eligible for debt reduction under the heavily indebted poor country hipc initiative or for trade pr eferences under the african growth and opportunity act25 congressman jim kolbe chairman of the house foreign operations subcommittee the house panel with jurisdiction over funding the mca suggests that mca qualifiers should get sp ecial consideration for expedited trade preferences that would further accelerate economic growth possibilities26 still others who support the mca framework find fault w ith the administration for not devising simultaneously an overall foreign aid strategy into which the mca fills one of several elements of comprehensive policy27 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs20 beyond us programs and policies othe r foreign aid donors and institutions are expressing concerns that the mca ma be creating additional and perhaps competing performance goals to those that already exist how mca program goals align with the millennium development goals is of particular concern organizational structures one of the most contentious issues associated with the mca policy review process has been and is likely to c ontinue to be where the mca program management will be placed th is debate has raised issues discussed for many years concerning under what auspices us foreign aid policy should be designed coordinated and managed over the ears suggestions have ranged from coordination within the national secu rity council crea tion of umbrella organizations like the illfated internati onal development cooperation agency and most recently the merger of such respons ibilities into the state department after extensive debate during the mid1990s d ecision was reached to make usaid the principal us government b ilateral aid agency totally independent but to have it operate under the guidance of the secretary of state after considering numerous options including the placement of the mca as separate unit with the stat department the administra tion proposed to create new government entity the millennium challenge corporation to manage the initiative given the innovative and nontrad itional approach inherent in the mca concept executive officials said it makes sense to establish new entity to oversee its implementation the co rporation as proposed woul d have ceo confirmed by the senate and staff of more than 100 that would be drawn largely from other government agencies and serve for limitedte rm appointments board of directors chaired by the secretary of state and include the treasury secretary and omb director would oversee the mcc althoug h it appears there is precise existing model in the us government officials said that the mcc would most closely resemble the overseas private investment corporation an organization that promotes private american investme nt overseas and the commodity credit corporation an arm of the department of agriculture that manages export credit guarantee programs for the commercial sale of american agri cultural goods an important difference between these and the mcc however is the proposal to have cabinetmember board oversee the latter and ma ke final recommendations issue the need for new organization before agreeing on the mcc the interagency steering committee reportedly looked seriously at the option of creating separate unit within the state department to manage the mca one reason for rejecting this proposal may have been the relative lack of experience of state department staff in administering ai d programs this was one of the central issues considered when the question of whether to fold usaid into the department was under debate this tec hnical shortcoming however could have been overcome by adopting the mcc principle of detailing aid experts from other agencies to staff the office broader reas on for not placing the mca w ithin the state department however may have been concern that it would be located too close to the center of the us foreign policy apparatus that would limit the programs immunity from strategic and political influences at minimum many observers believed there would be perception problem whether tr ue or not that the mca did not trulyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs21 28 see for example the arguments of inte raction raised in its may 2002 policy paper the millennium challenge account new vision for

where to put the millennium challenge account center for global development october 15 2002represent departure from the past aid enta nglements with broad us foreign policy interests at the same time many groups encouraged the administration to establish the mca as an office within usaid but apart from the normal operations of the agency various external groups have argued that usaid with its 40 years of development experience maintained the knowledge st aff and ontheground country presence to most effectively administer and moni tor the mca to place responsibility elsewhere they contend would risk duplica tion of effort competing priorities and inconsistent policies28 another businessrelated organization also opposes the creation of new instituti on rather it recommends the establishment of small core office unspecified as to where it would be placed that would identify program priorities and distribute the mca funds to usaid and the trade and development agency tda29 others are skeptical however that usaid is best suited to implement the mca concept the agency is frequently criticized as encumbered with excessive regulations managed with poor financ ial systems and time consuming planning cycles and burdened by extensive congre ssional oversight one analysis after weighing both the merits and disadvantag of placing the mca within usaid concluded that if the administration wants the mca to operate differently than usaid it should create new agency to manage it30 congressional proposals to modify the organization structure proposals considered by the senate shif ted positions on the organizational issue as bills moved through the legislative pro cess in 2003 s 1160 as reported by the foreign relations committee in may 2003 di d not authorize the creation of the mcc as proposed by the president instea d the legislation desi gnated the secretary of state as the coordinator of mca assistance and directed the secretary to designate coordinator within the state departme nt for managing the program the coordinator who would be c onfirmed by the senate would have authority to develop the list of performance indicator s select eligible countri and to coordinate mca programs with other donors the committee adopted this approach by approving an amendment offered by senators hagel and bide n approved 118 the sponsors noted that in 1998 congress had consolidated two independent agencies usia and acda in the state department in order to give the secr etary more director authority over all tools of us foreign policy to create separate entity to manage what could become the cornerstone of american fore ign assistance they argued would run counter to these recent efforts to better integrate and coordinate foreign policy decisionmakinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs22 supporters further questioned what value th omb director would provide by being on the board of directors given that the director is generally not assigned policy making responsibilities the administration strongly opposed the committees action to place the mca in the state department at the ma rkup session on may 21 2003 chairman lugar read letter from secretary powell underscori ng the value of new independent and creative entity for managing this new start to us foreign aid the secretary said that if this approach remains in the fina l bill he would recommend that the president veto the legislation senator lugar who opposed the bidenhagel amendment proposed an alternative structure in new legislation s 1240 as introduced on june 11 would create millennium challenge corporati on headed by ceo who would report to the secretary of state senator lugar intended that such an arrangement would provide the corporation with the same degree of indepe ndence and status as usaid but establish chain of command that would permit the secretary of state to exercise broad authority over the mca s 1240 created board of directors made up of the secretary of state chairman the secretary of the treasury the usaid administrator the us trade representa tive and the mcc ceo the full senate adopted the general approach proposed by senator lugar when it voted on july 9 2003 to incorporate modified text of mc authorizing legislation into s 925 an omnibus foreign policy authorization bill the approved text further strengthened the explicit relationship between the corporati on and the secretary of state by adding that the ceo shall report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary the administration did not express objection to the revised legislation the house bill hr 1950 took somewhat different approach than the modified senate proposal th at was closer to the administrations position although with some important differences hr 1950 would create new millennium challenge corporation sought by the pres ident but altered the composition of the board of directors and as noted above th authority of the mccs chief executive officer the board would include the secretary of state as chairman and the secretary of the treasury as proposed but deleted the director of omb and added the usaid administrator the us trade representative and the ceo of the mcc the bill also included four additional member s to be appointed by the president from list submitted by the majority and minority leaders of the house and senate the board would further include as nonvoting exofficio members the ceo of opic and the directors of the trade and development agency peace corps and omb

individuals will be on the board that should be named by the president from lists of candidates supplied by the majority and minority leaders in the house and senate the enacted legislation however does not require advisory council as proposed by the house issue role of mcc staff in managing and monitoring the mca one of the first concerns of aid managers is the ability of 100staff organization to maintain proper oversight and accountability standards ove r what will become 5 billion program by comparison usaid ma intains staff of nearly 2000 american directhires and several thousand more contractors and fore ign nationals based overseas to implement roughly 8 billion program few would argue that similar workforce is needed indeed ther would likely be minimal support for bureaucracy even half that size but with central mandate of performance results and accountability the mca require s strong monitoring capab ility the administration has mentioned the prospect of an outside independent auditing system but the issue appears to remain unresolved even though usaid will not manage th mca it is likely that its staff especially those located in mca particip ant countries will play supporting role in various capacities usaid administrator andrew natsios has told his staff that the agencys long record of best practices and experience will be required if the mcc is to be successful but how this will opera in the field is an open question there is concern among some usaid professionals that the time and attention of mission staff to support administrative contr acting and procurement needs of mca programs will diminish thei r ability to manage regula r aid programs and as mentioned above how the current mission portfolio relates to mca objectives is unclear issue future of usaid the creation of new agency to manage the mca is likely to be viewed by some as vote of confidence in usaid this may stimulate renewed bate over whether the usaid ma ndate should be modified perhaps limiting it to strictly humanitarian aid agency or folding it into the state department or the mcc itself at some futu re date usaid supporters are concerned that an mca managed outside the princi pal us development organization will establish twoclass aid system with usai d responsible for addressing the needs of the weaker performers while the main emphasis will transfer to the mcc the potential impact on staff recruitment and morale and eventually resources they believe could be serious an argument could be made as well however that this provides an opportunity for usaid not only to demonstrate its expertise as an aid organization and serve the mcc as valued consultant but also can serve as incentive to review its own operations and correct some of the persistent problems identified by critics31httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs24 31 continued programs much closer to broad us foreig n and strategic policy interests than the mca yet the state

could be made available for such usaid programs the senate measure also provided up to 10 of annual mca funds be available to countries that failed to qualify because of unreliable data or lack of performance on only one indicator although the corporation not usaid would provide the assistance hr 1950 also directed the mcc to consult with usaid officials regarding the contents of contract or compact between the us and an mca participant country and required that the mcc and usaid coordinate their programs to the maximum extent possible during house floor debate members adopted an amendment by congressman kolbe intended to further clarify usaids role in providing us economic assistance the language stated that the usaid administrator shall report to the president through and operate under the foreign policy authority and di rection of the secretary of state32 the kolbe amendment also authorized usaid to extend assistance to countries ineligible for mca aid so that they

of the government some advocate that the m cc solicit proposals directly from private nongovernmental groups33 the administration appears to be recep tive to the principle that mca funded activities need not support only g overnmentrun or sponsored in itiatives but also could include projects operate d directly by the private sector or ngos the draft legislation submitted to congress in febr uary 2003 allowed the mcc to issue grantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs26 34 see for example millennium challenge account pr oposed conceptual approach for eligibility us conference of catholic bi shops august 13 2002 available at httpwwwusccborgsdwpinternationalmcahtm 35 brainard compassionate conservatism confronts global poverty p 161to both private and public entities what ma be more problematic is the receipt of proposals straight from these nongovernme ntal sources this might result in an awkward competitive relationship between government and nongovernment submissions competition that might be be st settled by the country itself prior to transferring recommendations to the mcc usaid administrator natsios told the house appropriations foreign oper ations subcommittee on may 21 2003 that while the mca would likely include pr ograms proposed by nongovernmental entities the contract would need to be signed by the host government and that the government would be responsible for managing and overseeing the project another issue related to the types of programs eligible for mca resources is the capacity of both the us and participant c ountries to manage the projects budget support infrastructure and commodity assi stance most likely would be largescale activities where substantial am ounts of resources could be invested thereby reducing the total number of projects to be mana ged and monitored communitybased or ngo projects on the other hand likely would be much smaller in size and funding requirements but far more numerous in to tality while supporting the broadest array of development programs with mca funds provides the maximum opportunities us policy makers will have to decide whether they are prepared to assume responsibility for large number of projects in the mca portfolio and the associated management oversight and accountability demands key principal endorsed by numerous mca proponents is that programs must be countryowned designed by broad sp ectrum of government and civil society as noted above some have suggested that prsps that have been developed by many potential mca countries could be used as the guiding framework in devising program proposals34 recognizing however that many mca countries do not have sufficient capacity to design program proposals on their own many suggest that usaid and others assist but do not control the development of program submissions35 congressional action on program issues the enacted mca authorizing legislation permits resources to be provided to wide range of entities including central governments ngos regi onal and local governments and private groups assistance may take the form of grant cooperative agreement or contract with any of these eligible entities the legislation requires that the united states enters into compact with qualifying country that describes the program to be funded how it will be monito red and how the developmen t goals will be achieved the compact cannot ex ceed five year commitment the measure specifically prohibits assistance for military purposes for any project that would likely result in the loss of american jobs for projects that would likely cause significant environmental health or sa fety hazard or for abortions or involuntary sterilizations the legislation further sets out the pr ocess by which the ceo can suspend or terminate compact in cases where the country has engaged in activities contrary tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs27 36 for example the president may waive human rights restrictions for part 1 programs if he determines that the aid will benefit the needy people of the country section 116 likewise the president make exempt application of aid cutoffs based on national interest requirements for countries that do not cooperate on narcotics control mattersus national security interests has taken actions inconsistent with the criteria for determining mca country elig ibility or has failed to meet the requirements of the compact legislative and funding matters the administration submitted in early february 2003 draft mca authorizing legislation and sepa rately proposed 13 billion for th first year funding level program flexibility as expected was one of the key themes integrated throughout the draft bill executive officials said that while the mca should have its own statutory base separate from existin g laws including the foreign assistance act of 1961 current restrictions that prohibit us ssistance to countries would remain these include lengthy list of potential infractions including those related to human rights drug production terrorism nuclear weapons transfers and testing military coups debt payment arrears and trafficking in women and children just to name few in keeping with the desire for flexibility the draft legislation would make available mca resources not withstanding any provision of law but with notable exception countries that currently cannot qualify for us assistance under part 1 of the foreign assistance act of 1961 that part of the act authorizing programs for bilateral development aid narcotics control international disasters the former soviet union and central asia among othe rs would remain ineligible for mca funds however if the president waived any prohibition under part 1 for particular country that nation would then be eligible for mca resources36 another area of flexibility highlighted in the draft bill concerned personnel and administrative authorities the ceo of th corporation would be granted authority to establish and modify in the future human resources management system without regard to existing laws governing civil service and foreign service activities although certain provisions in cluding merit and fitness pr inciples cannot be waived the draft submission further granted the ce the authority to appoint and terminate personnel notwithstanding civil service nd foreign service laws and regulations the bill would also allow the mcc to transfer mca resources to any us agency and would permit the corporation to draw on the services and facilities of other federal agencies in carrying out the program on the funding question the administ ration expressed commitment to 5 billion mca program by fy2006 although the pace at which resources approach that figure would be influenced by antic ipated demand as well as larger budgetary considerations stemming from competing spending priorities growing deficit and other possible policy initiatives for fy2004 the president requested 13 billion figure less than onethird of the three year goal that some had expected the administration did not provide any projections for fy2005 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs28 the president further made commitment that mca resources would not be drawn from existing aid programs but would be in addition to those appropriations although of course final decisions on appropriations are made by congress the administration sought large 26 billion or 16 increase in foreign operations appropriations programs for fy2004 including the mca funds but some areas of the proposal especially for bilateral development assistance programs fell below current amounts for fy2003 issue flexibility and congressional directives and oversight an issue that has been heatedly argued between congress and all administrations for many years has been the practice of congre ssional legislative directives and earmarks in foreign aid authorization and spending laws executive officials argue that the excessive use of such directives both fo rmal and informal seriously erodes their ability to manage foreign policy and operate coherent foreign aid program most in congress view the use of directives and earmarks however as legitimate tool for congressional participation in setting foreign aid policy and spending priorities some members point to congressi onal emphasis in recent years on initiatives such as child health basi c education and international hivaids programs that both the clinton and bush administrations subsequently came to embrace and support with higher budget re quests without c ongressional pressure through earmarks us commitment and leadership on these policies would not exist to the extent they do today many argue moreover some contend that these broad sector allocation directives represent pr ioritysetting decisions by lawmakers and reflect the appropriate and constructive power of congre ss to manage the federal purse it is the far more targeted earmarks th ey contend benefitting special interests or specific organizations and firms that are problematic from the executives perspective the dispute over congressional foreign aid directives is unlikely to be resolved during any mca debate however the distinctive nature of the mca initiative provided the administration with differe nt set of arguments against earmarks because of the demandbased resultsdriven concept of the mca executive officials contended that the traditi onal pattern of congressiona l directives specifying funding amounts for selected countries or activities nd placing restrictions on certain operations would undermine the basic principles of the mca concept legislative setasides for pa rticular set of countries or for certain program activities would arguably undercut the transparent objective process of selecting the best performers in settling these differences one model to examine might be how congress authorizes and funds other demanddriven programs in the annual foreign operations appropriation bill since it is not known in advance who may request or require support under programs such as the expor timport bank the trade and development agency or international disaster assist ance congress generally appropriates amounts that are expected to be needed to meet the resource demands placed on these activities with few or setasides for specific requirements authorizing laws for these programs include some restrictions but are generally not nearly as extensive as those for regular bilateral economic and military aid programs an importanthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs29 difference however between such programs and the mca is that their purpose is far more narrowly defined than that of the mca linking existing foreign aid eligibility requirements with the mca drew broad support within congress since many of t hose requirements reflect fundamental social and political values and were congressionally initiated but the prospect of applying to an mca participant these overarching aid prohibitions especially those that require an administration discretionary determination to trigger the aid cutoff raised new set of issues would for example the extent to which the us has major financial investment in successful mca project influe nce decision on whether to declare the government in violati on of narcotics c ooperation standards congressional action on flexibility and oversight issues for the most part the enacted mca authorizing act refrains from earmarking providing authorities consistent with mca principa ls set out by the administration and permitting the executive to implement the program with degree of flexibility the measure authorizes assistance notwith standing any other provision of law however countries which are ineligib for american economic aid due to restrictions contained in the foreign ssistance act of 1961 or any other provision of law cannot be selected for mca suppor t this provision will likely eliminate consideration of number of countries although in most cases these countries would most likely be weak performers under the mca selection criteria moreover as noted above assistance may not result in the loss of american jobs displace us production pose major environm ental health or safety hazard be used for military support or finance abortions or involuntar sterilizations the statute also adds several requirements aimed at strengthening congre ssional oversight of the mca the legislation requires the secretary of state to post information about the mca in the federal register and on the internet and to submit an annual report on mca operations issue funding and possible tradeoffs following submission of the fy2004 budget mca advocates closely examin ed two funding issues the size of the mca request and proposals for othe r us economic aid programs many believed that mca resources should nd would grow in equal amounts of 167 billion per year to reach the 5 billion total in three years conflicting administration statements gave credibility to the view that this was the intention although officials have said more recently th at this is not the case for one reason since the number of qualifiers the first year is still far from certain the f unding requirements may be quite different from 167 billion in addition the budget environment was much different than it was in march 2002 when the president issued his policy st atement budget deficits had risen creating greater pressure to hold spending down in nearly all areas such pressures are likely to continue throughout future budget debates making the task of accommodating new and large f unding initiative more difficult one way to manage mca increases woul d be to rearrange overall foreign aid spending priorities and re duce amounts elsewhere but the president said the administration would not take that path while the fy2004 budget request largely maintained funding for other foreign aid pr ograms at existing levels although withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs30 37 this amount was subsequently decreased to 994 million under provision in pl 108 199 requiring 059 rescission of all accounts in the billa few important exceptions congressional appropriators faced limitations in their ability to fully provide for both the mca nd other aid accounts the effects of war in iraq and unanticipated foreign policy contingencies arising later in 2003 created new resource demands when c ongress decided on diffe rent appropriation priorities than the president and allocated smaller amount to the foreign operations funding bill it set the stage for direct tradeoffs between the mca and competing security economic and human itarian activities in addition the mca was not the only foreign operations program that wa s vying for increased spending for fy2004 the presidents budget included several ot her new initiatives including those for additional hivaids resources topping up the hipc debt reduction initiative contingency funds addressing famine and conflict needs while the overall request for foreign operations wa s well above fy2003 enacted levels up 16 these new initiatives accounted for most of the in crease leaving continuing programs with more modest 36 rise some foreign aid proponents were especia lly concerned about reductions in the presidents fy2004 budget for development assistance and global health programs compared with the administrations request for fy2003 the fy2004 budget blueprint was the same combined 296 billion total for these core bilateral development aid activities but due to congressional additions the fy2003 levels had increased to 323 billion making the fy 2004 request 8 less than enacted amounts for fy2003 some argued that th and similar reductions below fy2003 appropriations for refugees disaster and food aid broke the presidents pledge to make the mca an additional source of f unding in order to reach conclusion however one would have to know whethe r funds proposed for the mca would be made available for accounts supporting simila r activities if this new initiative was not submitted it is unclear that in the absence of the mca or any of the other new initiatives that an equivalent amount of re sources would have b een made available for other bilateral ec onomic aid programs congressional proposals to modify mca funding levels throughout the 2003 debate over mca authorizatio n and appropriation funding amounts congress struggled with the challenge of fully funding the presidents 13 billion mca request and addressing other foreign aid priorities senate bills s 1160 and s 1426 authorized and appropriated 1 billion for the mca in fy2004 the authorization further provided for 23

nations and international development or ganizations for not contributing enough to fight global poverty and promote economic growth alt hough the united states was the largest provider of official

measured as proportion of national wealth figure 1 oda performance 2002 in 1972 the united nations adopted reso lution calling on developed countries to allocate 07 of gnp for foreign economic

the united states defends its record as development aid provider arguing that contributions to global poverty reduction shoul d not be measured simply in terms ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31687crs36 39 in recent years the world bank the oecd and other institutions have substituted the term gross national income or gni for gnp in order to conform to revised 1993 system of national accounts guidelines the us government in most cases uses the calculation of gross domestic product or gdp gni incl udes gdp plus net receipts of primary income compensation of employees and property income from nonresident sources for the united states gni is slightly larger than gdp in 2000 for example gni was less than onetenth of one percent larger than gdp the calculations in table 2 and the ensuing discussion are made based on omb repor ted and projected us gdp figuresaid transfers as percent of gnp39 us officials note that in dollar terms american oda has remained substantial and is programmed on more favorable terms than that of other donors the united states they emphasize was leading voice over the past several years in the heavily indebted poor country hipc debt initiative being the first government to advocate 100 cance llation of bilateral debt owed by the worlds poorest nations american charita ble organizations and businesses provide significant proportion of annual aid tran sfers and private investment to the developing world given the large amount spent by the united states on defense and the security it provides to allies and frie nds around the world american contributions to global stability and stable environmen t in which economic development can take shape is much larger than oda expenditures suggest they contend in the coming years if congress conti nues to appropriate funds for the mca initiative that are in addition to other oda resources the dollar value of us oda will increase perhaps significantly especially if other new foreign aid programs like the global hivaids initiative proceed as planned the administration says that the mca would add 50 to us oda c ontributions and while that figure may not be reached by fy2006 it is likely to be in the 2540 range but on the other point of measurement oda as percen t of gdp the impact will not be so dramatic largely because mca appropriations are likely to be very small relative to the size of the us economy and because of projected gdp growth estimates over the next several years according to cu rrent projections assi stance would rise from the 2002 level of 012 of gdp to
