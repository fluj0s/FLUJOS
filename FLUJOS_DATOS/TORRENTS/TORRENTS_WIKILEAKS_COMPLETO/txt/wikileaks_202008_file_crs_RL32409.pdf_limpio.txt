has included legisl ative provisions in every surface transportation reauthorizati on act to remedy concerns about the equity of the distribution of federal highway aid to the states for many years some states have complained that they received significantly less federal highway aid than they paid in federal highway taxes to the highway tr ust fund these states referred to as donor states have pressed for legi slative remedies that would assure them higher share of federal highway aid in recent years 95 donee states states that receive more federal highway aid than they pay in fede ral highway taxes ve not opposed equity provisions per but have opposed any reduc tion in their existing shares providing equity remedies that keep both donor nd donee states reasonably content has been accomplished by giving more money to all st ates but giving more to donor states to bring their shares up to designated per cent share currently 905 providing equity in this way is very expensive in dollar terms the minimum guarantee under tea21 in fact became the largest highway program the current budgetary environment is mo re constrained than it was under the last reauthorization cycle making it unlik ely that the 95 goal can be achieved under the current equity framework there are however number of options that could help the options range in scope from change s that may be seen as fine tuning the existing minimum guarantee mg system to options that would eliminate the tea 21 mg framework completely during the 109th congress the house and senatepassed surface transportation bills have taken different approaches to the equity issue under the dual constraints of limited highway trust fund re sources and the bush administration threat to veto any sixyear reauthorization bill that exceeds 2839 billion supporters of major rateofreturn increase also backed away from their 95 rateofreturn goals the housepassed reauthorization bill the transportation equity act legacy for users hr 3 retained the tea21 minimum guarantee structure and rateofreturn 905 the senatepassed reauthorization bill the sa fe accountable flexible and efficient transportation equity act hr 3 as amended would achieve 92 return in the last year of the author ization through an equity bonus mechanism in broader sense the debate over quity remedies has implications for number of overarching issues an equity guarantee that approaches 95 rate of return could in the minds of some leave little room for addressing other or additional transportation needs that are uni quely federal another issue is whether the mg should be broadened as some st ates have proposed to include federal transit administration programs this report will not be updatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409contents introduction 1 recent

response to these concerns the bill provides for second fundi ng overlay the equity adjustment to assure that state loses fundi ng because of the hpp earmarks2 hr 3 includes scope guarantee of 926 of the bills tota l contract authority to achieve the 926 scope the bill includes second new funding overlay the scope adjustment the scope adjustment shifts national corrido r infrastructure improvement program funds to stp and recalculates the mg until the scope is 926 once this is done funds are restored to the corridor program w hich then remains outside the scope the mg program is funded on such ms as necessary basis and the new equity and scope adjustments add to the cost of the overall bill according to an fhwa analysis of hr 3 as passed over the life of the bill the basic minimum guarantee adjustment will cost 444 billi on the equity adjustment will cost 9 billion and the scope adjustment will cost 23 billion3 the house bill also includes reopene r provision that would cut off funding of all nonsafety pportioned programs on august 1 2006 if congress has failed by then to enact legislation that would increas states rate of return to 92 for fy2006 93 for fy2007 94 for fy2008 and 95 for fy2009 the safe accountable flexible nd efficient transportation equity act safetea hr 3 as amended in the 109th congress the senatepassed bill included most of the attributes of th equity bonus program that was in the reauthorization bill the senate passed during the last cong ress because of the less generous overall funding ssumptions however the natepassed bill includes modified language in the equity bonus prog ram provisions the goal of raising all donor states rate of return to 95 by the final year of the reauthorization has been scaled back to 92 the scope of the equity bonus program would be roughly 92 of total contract authority the senate has taken di fferent approach from the house the senatepassed bill would replace the entire mg program with an equity bonus program eb basically the individual program formulas would determine the initial apportionment and the equity bonus would be added to th levels the senate bill directs the secretary of transportation to allocate to the states for each of the fiscal years 2005 through 2009 sufficient funds to ensure that each state receives at least 92 return to eb specified programs and subject to certain rules and limitations described below on its estimated payments to the highway account of the htf the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs3 bill would keep nearly all the programs subject to mg under tea21 im nhs stp congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program cmaq highway bridge replacement and rehabi litation program hb rr recreational trails appalachian development highway system and metropolitan planning subject to the equity provision the bill protects some states that woul d lose percent share under the ebs 92 share states with population density of less than 20 peopl per square mile population under one million median household income under 35000 or fatality rate on inte rstate highways in 2002 of greater than 10 per 100 million vehicle miles traveled would get either the 92 share or their average percent share of apportionments under tea21 the eb is also subject to certain rules and limitations which taken together can be seen as placing floor and number of ceilings on the program the special rules provide that all states are to be allocated enough funds to ensure that each state gets at least 115 of its tea21 annual average negative adjustme nt may be made to any states apportionment during the eb llocation and requires that state may drop below 905 in fy2005 below 91 in fy2006fy2008 or below 92 in fy2009 eb allocations are not however to be given to states under certain conditions if states total apportionmen ts of all the designated eb programs exceeds the states average tea21 apportionm ents by the following percentages the state gets bonus fy2005 ceiling 124 of states tea21 average fy2006 ceiling 128 of states tea21 average fy2007 ceiling 131 of states tea21 average fy2008 ceiling 137 of states tea21 average fy2009 ceiling 250 of states tea21 average this is the main mechanism that phases in the 92 share goal by the final year of the authorization it also holds down the cost of the eb program because historically the environment and public works committee epw has not disclosed its high priority project earmarks until conference the state apportionment and state rateofre turn data available during debate on the floor of the senate will not reflect the impact of the pending earmarks the pattern of earmarking within the scope of the equity bonus can change the states relative share of apportionments and also the projection of total highway program size according to fhwa analysis the fiveyear cost of the senatepassed equity bonus program will be 254 billion this report begins with discussion of the mg concept and the federal highway program framework within which the mg is applied it then sets forth the legislative history of the mg since 1982 the year minimum state share provision was first enacted the current mg enacted in tea 21 and how it is cal culated is briefly discussed the report then di scusses options for raising the mg share percentage in constrained fiscal environment the report examines some of the overarching policy implications of the mg debate th report appendices pr ovides detailed step bystep explanations of the calcula tion of the tea21 minimum guaranteehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs4 4 during the 1990s devolution generally re ferred to the shifting of federal programmatic responsibility and funding resources to the statesbackground there are number of characteristics of the federalaid highway program that need to be kept in mind in discussi on of the donordonee question first the federalaid highway program fahp is really an umbrella term for all the highway programs administered by the federal highway administration fhwa most of these programs can be described as bein g either formula apportioned programs which constitute the vast ma jority of program funding or the smaller discretionary allocated programs the formula pr ograms apportion funds to the state departments of transportation based on formulas set forth in legislation the discretionary programs are programs nominally under the control of the fhwa that were designed to provide funds to proj ects chosen through competition with other projects in recent years however most of the discretionary program funding has been earmarked by congress the distinction between formula and discretionary programs becomes especially significant in the process of attempting to make equity adjustments in the funding levels among the states for example how can all discretionary programs be constructed to guarantee designated percent return to states on their payments to the htf and still remain discretionary the programs were created to fulfill perceived policy needs the separate program budget accounts were authorized based at least in part on the amounts of money each prog ram needs to meet its program goals determined in part by the budget constraint s of the time rather than by some other measure such as basing the distribution on estimates of the revenue paid by highway users in the individual states some highway needs such as ro ads on federal lands border crossing infrastructure trade corridors and interstate system maintenance have inherently federal aspects that would likely not be addressed if the federalaid highway programs were predicated on return to all states approaching 100 even advocates of devolution of much of th federalaid highway program to the states have acknowledged so federal needs4 in addition donor states themselves have in the past recognized the need for some stat to get an increased share of federalaid funds during the istea reauthorization debate for example donor states agreed that large sparsely populated states and some small states such as rhode island vermont and delaware should receive incr eased shares authorizors thought that the sparsely populated passthough states had insufficient state resources to build and maintain their parts of the nationa l highway network so they were given increased shares the size of the minimum guaranteeequity adjustment program umbrella often referred to as scope has varied since the first equity program was introduced in 1982 the major formula programs were ways under the mg umbrella but which other programs were included changed under the various surface transportation authorization acts how many of the tota l programs are covered by the mg program umbrella is important for number of reas ons first under guaranteed share mghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs5 5 this assumes all other attributes of the mg ar held constant this is not always the case for example tax changes such as change in the tax treatment of ethanol can have an impact on states relative shares which could impact the calculation of total program size which is discussed later in this report 6 httpwwwfhwadotgovpolicyohimhs02fe221bhtmthe more program dollars left outside the mg program the more likely that at least some donor states will not reach their minimum percentage return relative to the entire federalaid highway program sec ond in general the more inclusive the mg umbrella the more costly the mg program5 third earmarking of programs under the mg umbrella usually provides new dollars to the state receiving the earmarks these earmarks simply allow members of congress to set project priorities earmarks of programs outside the mg umbr actually provide more money to the state getting the earmark number of statistical issues have an impact on the mg the use of non current data ie revenue estimates from two years prior may skew the state donor donee ratios and lead to conclusions about donor or donee status that are questionable also statebystate data on payments to the highway account of the htf are estimates based on extrapolations from state tax data and may not always be completely accurate or up to date the economic cycle can also have an impact on revenues and the budgetary process that can lead to years when revenues and spending levels differ significantly from each other this can have an impact on rate of return the mg and other equity ad justment proposals ttempt to achieve specified share return on two year ol d payments data distribution equity however is almost always judged by table fe221 in the annual fhwa highway statistics report6 which compares estimated dollars paid and apportionments and allocations received for the sa fiscal year this sta tistical disconnect means that even an effective mg or eb program w ill face criticism when the same year dollar for dollar return data are released in addition the impact of proposed revenue changes on states relative shares of payments to the htf are hard to gauge over the life of the reauthorization these change s could change some donor states to donee states or vice versa over the next few years it could also impact the calculation of program size under the mg legislative history although the equity debate it can be argued goes back at least as far as the creation of the highway trust fund supporte d by dedicated highway user taxes it was the initial publication of table fe 221 in the 1972 edition of fhwas annual highway statistics that provided the statistical underpinnings of growing movement to guarantee each state fair share of federal highway dollars relative to the revenue its highway users paid to the trust fund the table showed that the receipt of federal aid for each dollar paid to the trust fund varied greatly from state to state alaska faired best and south carolina fared worst at 834 and 052 respectively during the 1970s there was still significant construction on the interstate highway system this may in the minds of some have provided ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs6 7 staa also established the mass transit acc ount of the htf but did not make it subject to the minimum guarantee although typica lly donee states in the northeast are more transit dependent some highway donor states get significant federal transit funding while some donee states especially the large pass through western states get relatively little proposals to also subject the transit program to minimum guarantee have surfaced within the context of surface transportation reauthoriza tion as will be discussed later this could have an impact on the decision of some hi ghway donor states to support or oppose highway program minimum guarantee changesreasonable justification for such dispar ities by the early 1980s however the interstate highway system was nearing completion surface transportation assi stance act of 1982 staa staa pl 94 424 authorized significant incr ease in funding for the federal aid highway system for the year s fy1983fy1986 and included provision designed to mitigate the dissatisfaction of donor states by providing that each state would receive minimum allocation from the core fhwa programs specifically the bill ordered the fhwa to allocate among the states sufficient funds to assure that each states total apportionments from th core highway and safety programs interstate highway substitution primary secondary inters tate urban bridge replacement and rehabilitation hazard elimination and railhighway crossings and section 203 of the highway sa fety act of 1973 would not be less than 85 of the percentage of estimated tax pa yments each state paid into the highway account of the htf these equity adjustment allocations could be obligated to the core highway programs7 surface transportati on and uniform relo cation assistance act of 1987 sturaa sturaa pl 10017 authorized the federalaid highway program for fy19871991 retaining the 85 minimum allo cation but altered the basis of its calculation the act revised the calcula tion to include the allocated sometimes referred to as discretionary programs with the exception of the federal lands highways programs and safety progra ms for fy1987 and fy1988 emergency relief funds and interstate construction discretionary f unds were not included in the calculation the act made permanent th minimum allocation provision established by staa intermodal surface transportation efficiency act of 1991 istea istea pl 102240 reauthorized surf ace transportation programs including federalaid highway programs for fy 1992fy1997 making major changes in the overall program structure program form ulas as well as equity

stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs7 8 pl 105178 sec 1104 also 23 usc sec 105the 90 guarantees the act raised the minimum allocation to 90 of estimated state contributions to the high way account of the htf although narrowing its calculation to the core formula programs scenic byways safety belt and motorcycle safety grants the act also included new minimum payments guarantee that assured that each states apportionments for the core formula programs for the fiscal year and allocations to the disc retionary programs from the previous year would be at least 90 of its estimated state contributions ie calculated from all programs except special projects donor state bonus for each fiscal year donor states were identified by comparing projected contributions to the ht f with the apportionments to be received that year by each state under the donor state bonus starting with the state with the lowest return each state was brought up to the level of the state with the next highest level of return this was repeated successively for each state until the istea authorized program amount was exhausted hold harmless this provision set specific percentage that each state was to receive from the core formula highway programs plus federal lands highway programs minimum allocation donor stat bonus and intersta reimbursement each state received an addition to its regula r apportionments to raise its total to the set percentage reimbursement for interstate segments istea authorized 2 billion for fy1996 and fy1997 to reimburse some states for the costs to them of building segments of the interstate system without federal assistance prior to or during the early days of the inters tate construc tion program despite these provisions significant gaps remained among states on their share return on contributions to the htf as reauthorization of istea approached dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of the equity provisions led to challenges to the istea program paradigm tea21 equity provision changes the equity changes that were part of the debate and were included in tea21 were more limited than many would have expected early in the reauthorization debate the main reason for this was the large increase roughly 40 in overall funding levels still there were equity provisions that were included in the hope that they would further narro w the donordonee divide8 for detailed stepbystep descriptions of the calculation of the fy 2003 mg see appendices i and ii at the end of this report minimum guarantee the tea21 minimum guarantee had three components guaranteed base share tea21 guarantees each state percentage share set forth in tabular form in tea21 sec tion 1104 codified in 23 usc 105bhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs8 9 for example according to this provision of w the base share of total national allocations for these programs is 15581 for arizona 03956 for the district of columbia and 49887 for pennsylvania the base shares for all states are set forth in appendix ii step 2 column 1 of this report 10 although this percentage increase was small supporters of this level argued that under the tea21 framework as opposed to the

high priority projects9 minimum 905 share on contributions each state is guaranteed at least 905 return up just 05 over istea on its share of tax contributions to the highway account of the htf based on the most recent year for which the data are available generally from two fiscal years before10 using ohio as an example of the states total fy2001 highway account c ontributions ohios percentage share contributions amounted to 37578 ohio is guaranteed 905 of its share of estimated fy2001 contributions and is thus guaranteed minimum share of 34008 of the fy2003 apportionments ie the core formula programs plus high priority projects and the minimum guarantee itself if the above base share is less than 905 return to state then the share is adjusted upward until the 905 share is reached the money to raise shares to 905 is provided by squeezing down the percentages but not the total amounts of those states that are above the minimum this process of raising donor state shares and squeezing down donee state shares is repeated until the state share requirements are met and all the state shares total 100 minimum state payment each state is guaranteed that as part of the minimum guarantee it will receive at leas t 1 million in minimum guarantee funds it is important to keep in mind that the tea21 minimum guarantee was compromise provision it is constructed in ch way as to give money to all states in the process of bringing the donor states up to the 905 minimum guarantee11 each state gets the 1 million minimum then the lowest percent share of any stateor the district of columbia under tea 21 it was always the district is used to extrapolate the total progra m funding as defi ned under minimum guarantee needed for the district to retain its total program percentage see appendix i step 7 for detailed explanation to achieve that percentage for the district total fy2003 program size of 278 billion was needed ironically the degree of the districts donor status has meant more money for all states in absolute not relative terms to provide money for this adjustment 23 usc 105 d authorizes such sums as may be necessary to carry out the mg the total minimum

program hbrrp national highway system nhs congestion mitigation and air quality improvement cmaq and again the stp the distributions to the states are based on the ratio of each core programs apportionment to the total apportionment of all five programs for each state12 the resolution of the tea21 donordonee debate in the end what many observers had predicted would be major battle over tea21s equity provisions was resolved relatively amicably13 this occurred despite the donor states only being able to achieve 05 increase in the minimum guarantee percentage and formula changes which some predicte d would have little impact on donor state returns on the tax revenues these states payed to the highway account of the htf some even argued that donor states woul d have been better off if tea21 had retained the istea formulas in the case of tea21 what alleviated the concerns of the step21 coalition of donor states and other donor state advocates was the amount of money available during tea 21s lifetime by shifting revenues generated by the 43 cent ficit reduction gas tax to the htf in 1997 congress was able to provide for large increases in high way funding for all states the extra money in turn made the donordonee debate less urgent to the donor states the central dilemma raising shares holding harmless and funding programs the tension between the goal of donor states for 95 return and the hold harmless goal of donee states has been heightened in the current surface transportation reauthoriza tion debate by the absen ce of an htf revenue base sufficient to easily fund both goals in contrast to the current reauthorization situation under tea21 the existence of rge and growing revenues allowed for more than 40 increase in the federal highway spending and an increase

finance chapter in crs report rl32226 17 for instance revenue increases from changes in the tax treatment of gasohol could under some circumstances restructure state shares re lative to each other in way that reduces the continuedfy2009 of roughly 1825 billion this is substantially less than the highway spending obligations of 1966 billion under tealu hr 3 as passed or of 2054 billion obligations under safetea as passed safeteas revenue provisions would raise the re venue total to 1894 billion even coming this close required both the house and nate bills to lower their rateofreturn targets to 905 and 92 respectively in additi on assuming revenues cannot be increased significantly because mg f unds are authorized on such sums as may be necessary basis the only ways to fund the mg programs growing needs as they rise to 95 guaranteed share are to either di p into the treasury general fund or to push down the total apportionments of all the fo rmula programs to free up revenues for the mg distribution the difficulty of providing for an increase in guaranteed share while holding most donee states harmless in the absence of large amounts of new revenue however has not stopped some advocates of change s in the mg program from pressing for change15 equity guarantee options in constrained fiscal environment despite the fiscal constraints that imped the donor state desire for 95 return on payments to the htf there are numbe r of options that by themselves or in combination with others could mitigate some of the difficulties that authorizors face in producing surface transportation reau thorization bill with equity provisions acceptable to both houses of congress the options range in scope from changes that may be seen as fine tuning the existing mg system to options that would eliminate the tea21 mg framework completely so of these options have already been included in the major tea21 reauthorization bills being actively considered by congress some have had place in the debate but have not yet been selected for inclusion in active legislation and finally so have been left out of the debate thus far the following discussion does not include revenue propos als championed earlier in the reauthorization debate and the major revenue raisin g proposals in safetea and hr 3971 are only discussed within th context of their impact on the possible program options being discussed16 statistical analysis of the mg and mg proposals can be problematic as mentioned earlier the process of calcula ting shares and projecting the federal highway program size can lead to results that appear counterintuitive17 in additionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs11 17 continued size of the projected total program target i revenue increase could reduce the size of the program 18 for detailed discussion of this process see the detailed explanations of step 7 of the calculation set forth in appendix i and appendix ii 19 although this saved money tealus quity adjustment absorbed the savingsbecause most supporting statistics set fort h by proponents or opponents of change in the mg are based on analysis of previ ous years revenue nd funding data while reauthorization legislation is for future years the analysis is limited because of uncertainty in future revenue and funding allocations there is significant degree of uncertainty in the impact of changes in the mg this is especially true prior to release of the reauthorization conference report even then the statistics of the state bystate tax contributions used in the first step of the mg calculation to the htf would not be known for the last four years of six year authorization only the federal highway administration fhwa has the data bases and expertise to project the impact of these options on equity guarantee calculations in detail and even fhwa must base future projections on assumptions that may not come to pass ways to modify the existing mg program assuming that the tea21 mg framework rvives it could be modified this section examines possible modifi cations to the tea21 framework phase in increases in th share guarantee this is perhaps the simplest money saving option safetea as passed phases in the increase to 92 over the life of the authorization although this t actic saves money it has drawbacks first it will not save enough by itself to lift the rateofreturn greatly second some of the large donor states will be unhappy with the phasein proposal believing equity delayed is equity denied eliminate or reduce the district of columbias role in projecting total highway program size as shown in the earlier description of the tea21 mg calculation achieving dcs adjusted share determined the total highway program size18 some argue that way of reducin g the size of the mg distribution needed to achieve guaranteed share percentage would be to provide dc with generous dollar amount for its road needs but eliminate it or portion of its funding from the mg calculation the housepassed tealu hr 3 included this change19 determine program size based on total annual payments to the highway account of the htf the uncertainties of projecting total program size based on share has led to some discussion of eliminating this tea21 process see step 7 in the earlier section on the mg calcu lation and simply us ing the total annual payments to the highway account of the ht f to determine the program size for each fiscal year proponents argue that this change would not only simplify the mg calculation process but would also reduce the unexpected outcomes of tax or otherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs12 20 during early discussions of redirectin g the 25 cent ethanol tax to the highway account and compensating the account for the ethanol subs idy fhwa confirmed that to the surprise of most observers that because of the role of dc which uses virtually gasohol in determining total program size the increase in revenues would actually lead to drop in total program sizerevenue changes20 having total annual payments to the highway account set the total highway program size according to supporte rs would also more effectively align state payments with their allocations there are number of possi ble disadvantages to usin g total annual payments to the htf to determine the total program size as mentioned earlier the data on contributions are not generally available until early in the second fiscal year after the contributions are made so the program size would be set according to old data also this method would in effect set ceiling on each years spending ie there is need for the such sums as may be nece ssary for the mg this could force reduction in core program au thorizations to make room for the mg distributions necessary to meet the requirements of th mg finally revenues to the htf can decline as they did in fy2001 this could put congress in the uncomfortable position of having to either draw moni from the general fund draw down the unexpended balance of the htf if there is anything left to draw down or allow spending to drop for the year eliminate the state percen tages base share table the heart of tea21s hold harmless provisi ons is the state percentages table codified in 23 usc 105 b one option which coul d save money would be to replace the percentage table with simple dollar amount base guarantee for each state these state amounts would be adjusted where nece ssary to bring states up to their dollar amount base guarantee the 95 guarant eed return would then be accomplished by bringing up the apportionment of states w hose base dollar guarantees are less than 95 of their estimated payments to the htf by guaranteeing dollar figure rather than share percentage that cannot be re duced this could requi re smaller program size to achieve the guaranteed return mo st donee states would probably resist giving up their base share guarantees in exchan ge for dollar amount guarantee unless the dollar levels were generous the savings could be si gnificantly reduced depending on how generous the dollar base levels would need to be to pass the bill restrict the program scope of the mg one way to reduce the cost of the mg is to reduce the number of progra ms covered by the guarantee assuming that other attributes are held constant the states percent share return on payments to the htf could be applied to as small number of the federal aid highway programs as needed to stay within budget unde r tea21 the scope of the guarantee was in the 9394 range in the 109th congress safetea and tealu as passed have scope of roughly 9293 to an extent tealu as introduced in the 108th congress took this approach the bill provided for 95 guaranteed return on contributions to the htf by the last year of the authorization but the mg onl covered programs that together accounted for about 80 of the bills total funding ie making the mg 95 of 80 teahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs13 21 this discussion is based on hr 2208 s 1090 is similar except that it does not include discretionary 95 guaranteelus categorization of programs unde r or not under the mg umbrella was controversial and is believed by some observers to create problems for the functioning of the mg donor states in pa rticular were concer ned that having such large number of programs outside th mg would undermine the mg programs ability to actually achieve the 95 returnon payments target donor states were also concerned that they will have to successf ully compete for earmarks in the allocated nonmg programs to achieve this level the large donor states in particular would probably see this process as in effect taking away with one hand what has been given with the other reduce the target minimum percent return below the 95 level some have begun making the case that unde r the current fiscal constraints 95 return is an unrealistic goal for this reauthorization cycle during tea21 reauthorization there was also major effort to increase the minimum return to 95 in the end as discussed previously onl 05 increase was enacted the large increase in htf revenue that was availa ble to assuage donor states in 1998 may be what is needed to provide for an increased guaranteed return such revenues are not expected to be available in the fy 2004fy2009 period in the current fiscal environment the tea21 mg cannot provide 95 return unless the tea21 mg framework is replaced or altered the minimum rate of return guarantee can only be maintained or modestly increased the donor state share proposal for 95 guarantee the highway funding equity act of 2003 hr 2208 s 1090 is proposal supported by states highway alliance for real equity share that would replace the existing mg with 95 share guarantee21 both the house and senate versions include basic minimum guarantee of 95 share return on state payments to the htf the house version of the bill also includes 95 discretionary program guarantee which covers nearly all remaining program spending this means that there are two mg program umbrellas that expand the scope of the mg to all programs except federal lands highwa ys research and the administrative takedown the bill includes some other significant attributes it holds harmless states with fewer than 50 people per square mile these states are guaranteed their tea21 base share from the table in 23 uscb the bill also requires that the secretary of dot shall allocate among the states amounts sufficient to ensure that the percentage for each state of the total apportionment for th fiscal year equals or exceeds the 95 minimum or the sparsely populated state pe rcentage mentioned above in addition for the 95 share discretionary guarantee in the house version the secretary is to allocate among the states amount s sufficient to ensure that when all of the allocations for the fiscal year have been identified each states percentage will equal or exceed the percentage that is equal to 95 of the tax payments ratio state estimated taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs14 22 intuitively because the bill does not hold all donee states shares harmless one would expect the share proposal to be less costly than tealu as reported or safetea as passed however this may or may not be the case first all other attributes held steady the broader the programmatic scope of the mg the more costly its implementation the share proposal has broader scope than either of the active legislative proposals second the bill appears to still require projection of total program size similar to that in tea21 this combined with the ethanol tax revenue changes could as with tealu lead to larger or smaller program size than expecte d the place it clearly saves money however in the unprotected donee state shares which are not held harmless although it appears that under share donee states dollar am ounts would not drop belo w their tea21 levels their shares would 23 as mentioned previously devolution during the 1990s generally referred to the shifting of federal programmatic responsibility and funding resources to the states 24 rep jeff flake introduced bill with similar attributes hr 3113 the transportation empowerment act on september 17 2003 the bill was referred to the house subcommittee on highways transit and pi pelines on september 18 2003 there has been further action on the billpaymentsall states estimated tax payments the bill authorizes such sums as are necessary to carry out the provision22 the strength of the share proposal fo r donor states is that it most fully addresses their preeminent desire for 95 rate of return that covers the broadest scope of programs possible for the unpr otected donee states its main weakness is their loss of share some observers might also argue that under share the guaranteed rate of return is so high and all encompassing that it calls into question the rational for having federal prog ram and strengthens the arguments for devolution of the programs to the states devolve the highway program to the states one approach to the mg and donordonee controversy that ttracted attention during the debate prior to pa ssage of tea21 but that has not garnered much interest in the current reauthorization debate would be to simply devolve most of the federal highway program role to the states23 the transportation empowerment act hr 1470 and s 1907 105th congress sponsored by senator connie mack of florida and representative john kasich of ohio w ould have devolved mu ch of the federal highway program role to the states24 only program for maintaining the interstate system federal lands highwa ys national security highways emergency relief and proposed infrastructure speci assistance fund would have remained federal four year phase out of 12 cents of the federal gas tax would have corresponded with the declining federal role states woul d have had the option of replacing the declining federal taxes with gas tax increases of their own states would then have had the freedom to spend or not spend on their own roads as they saw fit although this proposal garnered some support from advocates of reduced federal role in transporta tion it did not obtain broad support from many governors state legislatures or state departments of tran sportation many of whom were wary of the political implications of pushing rge replacement gas tax increases throughhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs15 their state legislatures nd at the same time keeping these funds dedicated to transportation despite the fa ilure of devolution proposals to be enacted some would make the case that the closer the mg gets to 100 the more sense devolution to the states makes they would argue that as th guaranteed rate of return increases the fhwas simply becomes more like tax coll ector for the states the need for and efficiency of the federal government as middleman comes into question at this time however there appears to be little interest at the state or federal level for any radical change in the federal role in the highway program integrate the guaranteed rate of return into all federalaid highways programs if the assumption that the penultimate goal of federalaid highway programs is to guarantee each state say 95 share rate of return then one way to accomplish this would be to eliminate all other formula criteria and weight all the programs within the scope of the mg to provide each state with the percentage share of the program funds that would provi 95 return on its share contributions to the htf congress would still authorize each prog rams dollar amount and the old core formula programs could still retain their program goals and requirements but the apportionment of program funds to the stat would be strictly determined by each states percent share of contributions to the htf funding for allocated discretionary programs within the scope of mg could also be divided among the states based on 95 share of their shares of contributions to the htf in such case however these funds would only be av ailable for funding within each states aggregate program allocations the remainin g 5 of revenues coul d be used to fund program administration the federal lands highways program emergency relief and other small programs th at do not lend themselves to strict rate of return distribution this approach has advantages and disa dvantages the main advantage is that it would achieve the goal of guaranteed pe rcentage share return to the states without requiring an expensive mg program there would be separate mg program funding per since the rate of return minimum would be integrated into the individual programs it would also have the advantage of simplicity over the existing mg program congress could set the size of the various programs without having to consider the impact on the core pr ograms of the mg distributions on the other hand such an option could limit the ability of the federal government to fund federal po licy priorities the program formulas that include such demographic and infrastructure characteristic factors as lane miles vehicle miles traveled diesel fuel used co st to repair or replace defici ent bridges or weighted non attainment and mainte nance area population are at least in part an attempt to direct federal funding where it is needed to fulf ill the formulas program goals some would also argue that basing federal f unding distribution overwhelmingly on rate of return on payments to the htf will lead to inefficiencies where states for example with relatively few deficien t bridges could receive more bridge program funds than states with relatively more or states with air quality nonattain ment areas could get more cmaq funding than some states with nonattainment areas perhaps the main disadvantage of basing all programs on guar anteed rate of return is that it wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs16 25 see highway assistance

flows under the various bills and amendment proposals there are broad policy implications of the mg pr oposals including the appropriate federal role visavis the states program purpose and possible implications for mass transit the role of the federal gove rnment visavis the states the federalstate partnership in surf ace transportation has been fundamental element of federal highway policy since th passage of the federalaid road act of 1916 39 stat 355 although the nature and extent has changed over time25 under the act funding was apportioned by formula to the state highway departments which were responsible for the c onstruction and maintenance of the federal aid highways the state and federal government s were seen as equal partne rs and this was in part the rationale for the 50 federal match for highway construction projects with the passage of the federal hi ghway and revenue acts of 1956 70 stat 374 and 70 stat 387 authorizations for the interstate hi ghway system were greatly increased over 13 year authorization it also blished the federal match for interstate construction of 90 the revenue title of the act established the htf and raised the gas and other transportation ta xes to support it these taxes were to revert back to their original rates in fy1973 the estima ted completion date for the interstate system26 however although the obligations fo r the interstate system as percent of total trust funded obliga tions began to decline after 1967 increasing obligations for noninterstate highway programs more than made up for the difference in addition with the encouragement of the st ates as well as construction and other interest groups the federa l match for the major nonin terstate programs was increased to 70 in 1970 to 75 in 1978 and to 80 in 1992 over time the financial commitment has shifted away from the states and toward the federal government27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs17 28 the issue of scope came up during the tealu floor debate on the unsuccessful isakson amendment concerning the impact of includi ng the proposed projects of national and regional significance program within the scope of the mg also referred to as mega this program would fund very large projects costing over 500 million or the equivalent of 75 of states annual total program apportionm ent to address transportation problem areas that would lead to regional or national tr ansportation improvements the amendment by including the mega projects within the scope of the mg would in effect have reduced the mg apportionments of the state which receiv ed the mega project funding this would reduce the attractiveness of such targeted federa l programs to the states as well as diluting the impact of the program by leaving it out of the scope of the mg the state or states getting the grant would receive it as additional funding see congressional record v 150 april 2 2004 p h2070h2080while the federal financial role was increasing states were pressing for increased flexibility to move their formul program apportionments among the other formula programs or to transit thereby significantly increasing state control over their spending choices under the federal aid highway programs fahp the case can be made that by the enactment of tea 21 while the federal financial role had increased significantly through higher spending and increased federal share the state control over spending decisions was also in creasing in addition the mg distribution itself which averaged roughly 6 billion per year during tea21 dilutes the impact of the program apportionment formula fact ors which were orig inally designed at least in part to help achie ve federal program goals these trends the enhanced federal fina ncial role increased state authority over spending decisions as well as calls during the current reauthorization debate for 95 mg rate of return on wide scope of fahp progra ms raises policy questions at what point does the federal role beco so limited that converting the fahp to revenue sharing or block grant programs makes sense federal administrative labor and environmenta l requirements do add to most st ates project costs on the other hand some would argue that despite state complaints concerning the costs of complying with the federal highway program requirements and donor state displeasure with their rates of return the existing federal highway programs are still seen by many as serving national purpos and continue to be very popular with most state department s of transportation program purpose and scope an issue which may be seen as being corollary to the federal role issue is whether high rate of return percentage such as 95 coupled with similarly broad program scope could constrai n federal programmatic re sponse to federal needs as they arise some federal programs such as the federal lands highways programs are accepted as being federal in nature and not lending themselves to equal distribution across 50 states for some programs there is less of consensus28 having 95 guaranteed rate of return and similar percentage scope would leave little room for targeted federal programs outside the mg given the combination of the impact of the mg distribution on apportionments and program flexibility that allows states to flex much of their core program funding among these programs or to transit the case can be made that programs that are directed towardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs18 29 for an example of state support of 95 share guarantee for transit see httpwwwmichigangovdocumentsreauthorizationbasicswashington3_7_59563_7ppt the state highway alliance for real equity share has distanced itself from advocates of transit guarantee and has policy

program funds share specifically focuses on the highway program and has made deliberate decision not to address transit equity issuestransportation infrastructure needs that ar inherently federal in nature should be outside the scope of the mg perhaps an op tion would be to rede fine scope in way that only programs that serve what are cl early federal purposes could be outside the scope of the mg these programs could be designated in law as being inherently federal any other programs whether fo rmula or discretionary would be retained within the scope of the mg the mg debate would then be focused on more clearly defined concept of scope doing this would require broad consensus among both donor and donee state members of cong ress donor states advocates would probably be concerned that pr ograms defined as being fede ral in nature could add up over time to the detriment of donor state rates of return th issue is whether the need for equity is greater than needs that are inherently federal good for the gander minimum guarantee for transit although the minimum guaranteeequity remedy debate during the current surface transportation reauthorization debate in congress has focused exclusively on guaranteed rate of return on payments to the highway account some have argued that similar guarantee should be applied to payments to the mass transit account of the htf29 the mass transit acc ount is credited with the revenues from 286 cents of federal fuel taxes roughly 80 of the federal transit ad ministrations funding comes from the mass transit account the rema ining funding is provided by treasury general funds the distribution of nearly all of these funds is by formula and by earmark from the federal government to the individual transit authorities ie it differs from the highway programs which are funded through the state dots from state perspective the program set up tends to favor states that have large cities with existing fixed guideway type transit systems heavy rail light rail dedicated bus lanes rural states and states with bus dependent transit tend to get less the top five states receiving federal transit f unding as of fy2002 california new york new jersey illinois and texas received ove r 49 of total transit obligations some transit donor states see their tax payments as subsidizing the urbanized states and argue that they have transit needs themselves that are unmet they also argue that fta programs unfairly underf und busonly transit systems and that the need for public transportation in rural areas is mostly ignored by the current funding distribution supporters of the fta programs can ma ke number of arguments in defense of the uneven geographic distribution of tr ansit funding the main argument is one of program national purpose under the statement of policies findings and purposes in 49 usc 1501 the focus is clearly on urban mass transportation with goal to efficiently maximize mobility of individua ls and goods in nd through urbanizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs19 areas and minimize transportati onrelated fuel consumpti on and air pollution for transit systems to be efficient they need to serve areas of concentrated population mass transit 95 guaranteed rate of re turn would shift large amounts of funding to less densely populated areas where the num ber of people served would be low and the costs per passenger mile would be high ie would lead to inefficiencies some would also argue that the support for tr ansit minimum guarantee is really based on the assumption by states that they could flex significant portion of their transit funding to highway programs transit donee states may argue that transit guaranteed rate of return would punish th urban areas that ve taken the initiative to build in some cases before significan t federal funding was available transit systems that are in line with federal policy goals of enhancing urban mobility reducing fuel consumption and improving ai r quality finally tran sit interests argue that the role of cities as economic centers means that urban mobility benefits not just the cities but the nation as whole the transit minimum guarantee debate has not garnered widespread public support during the current reauthoriza tion cycle but especially should 95 guarantee for highway programs be enacted it would not be surprising for some form of transit equity provision to be at i ssue in the next reauthorization cycle the big losers would be california and new yor k interestingly some states that are highway program donor states are major bene ficiaries of the transit program for example should california and new jersey support the 95 return on payments to the highway account of the htf they coul d be in the position of having to oppose transit minimum guarantee or risk loss of much more transit funding than they gained through the highway program guaran tee in addition such major shift in funding would probably require major rewr iting of the federal tr ansit programs for the programs to make sense as whole it would also overturn what many see as the great compromise of 1982 under which the transit account of the htf was created and funded with 1 cent of the fuel tax incr ease in the bill transit dependent states supported an expanded high way program in returnhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32409crs20 30 this discussion is
