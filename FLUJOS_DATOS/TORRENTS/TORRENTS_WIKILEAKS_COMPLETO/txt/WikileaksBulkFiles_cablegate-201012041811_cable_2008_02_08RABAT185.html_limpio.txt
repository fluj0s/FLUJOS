minister olmert is focused on the least bad option for his part the king expressed deep concern about the humanitarian situation in gaza lebanon 5 c turning to the continuing leadership vacuum in lebanon as welch said that we see three options 1 to continue efforts to elect president by consensus 2 to elect president with 50 percent of the vote plus one or 3 to support the siniora government welch indicated that we increasingly believe the third option affords the best means to support lebanons institutions asked about arab league secretary general amr moussas visit to beirut fassi fihri sipdis characterized it as catastrophe syria and the arab league summit 6 c noting that kings mohammed vi and abdullah ii of jordan had come to power at approximately the same time as rabat 00000185

at the ministerial level at best iran 7 c ambassador welch asked if he might say few words about iran and its pursuit of nuclear weapons the king responded that he understood that iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program welch thanked the king for the opportunity to clarify declaring that the us intelligence estimate had been misunderstood and that the reporting on this issue has been unclear welch said that we continued to believe that iran was pursuing nuclear weapons so president bush was seeking middle ground between the bomb and bombing without giving up any option diplomatic pressure is best for now when the king asked what that middle ground might look like welch said that more security councilapproved sanctions loom and that iran must accept diplomatic solution algeria 8 c the conversation then turned to algeria and welch asked if the gom had any views on president abdelaziz bouteflikas plans the king said he understood that bouteflika was amending the constitution to permit third term and welch noted wryly that bouteflika was doing so without syrian assistance the king praised the frustrated algerian ambassador in rabat for his tireless efforts to improve bilateral relations stating we have relations with algeria except for limited cooperation on security issues in spite of obvious opportunities for cooperation in agriculture energy and host of other areas president bouteflika and his government clearly prefer the status quo the king noted that he had even traveled to algiers to try to break the impasse but the goa continues to insist on the western sahara issue being resolved before proceeding with other bilateral or regional initiatives western sahara 9 c the king and fassi fihri expressed grave concern about the polisarios stated plans
