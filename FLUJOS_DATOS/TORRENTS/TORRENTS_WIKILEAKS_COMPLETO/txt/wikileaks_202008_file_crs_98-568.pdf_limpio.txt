g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the exportimport bank eximbank is an independ ent us government agency that is charged with financing and promoting exports of us manufactured goods and services to accomplish these goals eximbank uses its authority and resources to assume commercial and political risks that exporters or private financial institutions are unwilling or unable to undertake alone overcome maturity and other limitations in private sector export financing assist us exporters to meet foreign officially sponsored export credit competition and provide guidance to us exporters and commercial banks and foreign borrowers eximbank gears much assistance to smalland mediumsized enterprises the bank operates under renewable charter the export import bank act of 1945 as amended and has been authorized through september 30 2011 when it was initially established the bank was capitalized by an appropriation of 1 billion from the us treasury the bank also is authorized to borrow up to 6 billion directly from the treasury and it may draw upon substantial line of credit with the federal financing bank ffb the federal financing bank is part of the department of the treasury and obtains its funds from regular treasury issues eximbank uses its treasury borrowings to finance its short term needs and repays the treasury quarterly from loan repayments and by borrowing from the ffb on mediumand longterm basis the banks authority to lend guarantee and insure is limited to total of 100 billion eximbanks direct loans are charged at their full value against the 100 billion limitation while only 25 of guarantees and insurance are charged against the limit under the terms of the budget enforcement act of 1990 congress appropriates the estimated amount of subsidy the bank expects to expend throughout all of its credit programs including direct loans guarantees and insurance as indicated in table 1 congress longer sets separate limits on the amount of loans guarantees and insurance the bank can authorize but the bank continues to provide estimates of the amounts of activity it expects to undertake in its fy2008 and fy2009 budget requests the bush administration requested appropriations for eximbanks subsidy and administrative expenses but stated that offsetting collections would count against the appropriation from the general fund and bring it down to 0 in essence the administration requested approval for the level of expenses that eximbank would cover on its own in addition offsetting collections of up to 50 million above the approved spending levels are to be available for use in the following fiscal year g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g156g561 eximbank has three main programs it uses to finance us exports direct loans export credit guarantees and export credit insurance prior to 1980 the banks direct lending program was its chief financing vehicle which it used to finance such capitalintensive exports as commercial aircraft and nuclear power plants both the budg et authority requested by the administration and the level approved by the congress for the banks direct lending were sharply reduced during the 1980s eximbanks direct lending program is used primarily to aid us exporters in instances where they face foreign competitor that is receiving officially subsidized financing by foreign government or when private sector financing is unavailable these loans carry fixed interest rates httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98568g7g161g153g152g155g157g556g11g150g153g152g155g157g561g4g138g151g148 g497g561g4g138g140g148

under the provisions of international agreements they are made primarily to counter attempts by foreign governments to sway purchases in favor of their exporters solely on the basis of subsidized financing rather than on market conditions price quality etc and to enforce internationally agreed upon terms and conditions for export financing the bank also has an intermediary credit program it uses to offer mediumand longterm fixedrate financing to buyers of us exports but us exporters also must face officially subsidized foreign competition to qualify for this program in fy2007 eximbank made direct loans and in fy2006 it authorized only three as part of its direct lending program the bank has tied aid war chest it uses to counter specific projects that are receiving foreign officially subsidized export financing tied aid credits and mixed credits are two of the primary methods whereby governments provide their exporters with official assistance to promote exports tied aid credits include loans and grants which reduce financing costs below market rates for exporters and which are tied to the procurement of goods and services from the donor country mixed credits combine concessional government financing funds at below market rates or terms with co mmercial or nearcommercial funds to produce an overall rate that is lower than marketbased intere st rates and carries more lenient loan terms the united states does tie substantial amounts of its agricultural and military aid to us goods but it generally has avoided using such financing to promote american capital goods exports funds for the tied aid war chest are available to the bank from the treasury department and are subtracted from the banks direct credit resources applications for the tied aid fund however are subject to review by the treasury department which has not approved single tied aid request by the bank since 2002

uses to assist american exporters both programs reduce some of the risks involved in exporting by insuring against commercial or political uncertainty there is an important distinction however between the two programs insurance coverage carries with it various conditions that must be met by the insured before the bank will pay off claim guarantee is an ironclad commitment made to commercial bank by the exportimport bank that promises full repayment with few if any conditions attached in addition eximbank has working capital guarantee program that it uses to aid smalland mediumsized businesses businesses that qualif have exporting potential but need working capital funds to produce or market their goods or services for export guarantees are offered to qualified lenders primarily commercial banks in order to facilitate loans to small businesses in fy2007 the bank authorized 1257 billion in loans and guarantees to support an estimated 1604 billion in us exports according to the bank this represents 2793 transactions of which 86 directly benefitted small business about 27 of the total value of eximbank transactions went toward assisting small business

broker all allegedly conspired to misappropriate loan proceeds from an eximbanksupported loan1 fraud can waste bank resources and undermine the banks programs in response to concerns about fraud eximbank adopted new guidelines for its transaction partners lenders brokers and exporters in january 2008 to reduce the risk of fraud transaction due diligence best practices these guidelines consist of series of questions to help transaction partners undertake effective due diligence and assess the risk of fraud in their transactions applicants for eximbank assistance are under legal obligation to follow the guidelines but they are written to help the applicants prevent financial and legal losses as well as to help eximbank prevent fraud in addition to reducing the risk of fraud these guidelines aim to decrease the processing time for applications which has been concern in the business community

most countries the united states has in place procurement policies that seek to assure that most us foreign assistance funds are spent by the recipients on us goods and services since the 1970s the united states has led efforts within the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd to adopt international protocols which reduce the subsidy level in export credits by raising the interest rates on governmentprovided export credits to market levels countries that signed the oecd arrangement on export finance concluded in november 1991 agreed to tighten further restrictions on the use of tiedaid the participants agreed that projects that would be financially viable and commercial credits would be prohibited from using tied or partially untied aid credits except for credits to the least developed countries where per capita income is below 2465 moreover the agreement sets up tests and consultation procedures to distinguish between projects that should be financed on market or official export credit terms and those that legitimately require such aid funds in addition to agreements on credit terms oecd member countries have agreed to other guidelines for official export credit in 2007 oecd member countries agreed to guidelines on environmental rules and sustainable lending principles the environmental rules call for member governments to review projects for potential environmental impacts and assess them against intern ational standards such as those of the world bank they also call for more public disclosure for environmentally sensitive projects the new guidelines on sustainable lending principles aim to help developing countries avoid renewed buildup of debt after receiving debt relief us exporters and others have expressed doubts about the effectiveness of international efforts to stem officially subsidized trade financing while the oecd agreement appears to be reducing most direct government subsidies to trade financing number of countries have found way around the agreement through market windows or subsidized trade financing through ostensibly private financial institutions that are not subject to the agreement the agreement also has number of limitations including the difficulty of defining commercially viable projects and the 1 eight charged in connection with 80 million scheme to defraud exim bank us fed news october

tied aid offer despite objections by other participants if that country claims that the project is in its national interest moreover the agreement contains explicit enforcement mechanism the effectiveness of the agreement also depends on the accuracy and openness of tied aid offers reported to the oecd but the oecd does not confirm or verify the accuracy of the data provided by its members2 another issue of concern is that some countr ies outside of the oecd such as china are becoming major providers of official export credit finance it may be difficult for eximbank to compete with such export credit programs g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g159g142g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 congress does not directly approve individual eximbank transactions but has number of oversight responsibilities concerning the bank and its activities the senate confirms presidential appointments to the banks board of directors and congress authorizes the banks legal charter for period of time chosen by congress at times congress has required an annual reauthorization of the banks legal charter and at other times has authorized the bank for periods that have varied from two to four years congress also approves an annual appropriation for the bank that sets an upper limit on the level of the banks financial activities in addition congress can always amend or alter the banks governing legislation as it deems appropriate members of congress and congressional committees can request that the banks president consult with them or testify before committees with some qualifications three bills have been introduced in the 110 th congress which would affect the exportimport bank if they were passed the new apollo energy act of 2007 hr 2809 introduced on june 21 2007 would require eximbank to limit its support for fossil fuelrelated projects to less than 85 and increase its support for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects to at least 15 of its available resources for supporting transactions this bill would also create commission and an office of renewable energy promotion within the bank to help achieve these targets eximbank would also be required to report to congress on its energy efficiency activities and its overall effect on greenhouse gasses s 876 introduced on march 14 2007 would prohibit the exportimport bank from providing services to any individual who has invested 1 million or more in any project that contributes to enhancing cubas ability to develop petroleum resources off its northern coast similar bill hr 1679 was introduced in the house on july 26 2007 hr 1886 was introduced on april 17 2007 and it would prohibit the exportimport bank from providing its services to any activity connected with an oil or gas project president bush signed pl 109438 the export import bank reauthorization act of 2006 on december 20 2006 this act reauthorizes the bank through september 30 2011 and creates small business division within the bank that is responsible for conducting research tailoring products to small business needs and increasing loans to small business concerns the measure also extends the authority of the advisory committee on subsaharan africa through fy2011 in addition the measure directs the bank to submit annually to congress list of us commercial sectors and products that would suffer adverse economic impact due to eximbank support of projects abroad the measure encourages the bank to make greater use of its tied aid facility but also provides mechanism for the secretary of the treasury to

competition among nations official export financing agencies but most economists doubt that nation can improve its welfare or level of employment over the long run by subsidizing exports economists generally maintain that economic policies within individual countries are the prime factors which determine interest rates capital flows and exchange rates and the overall level of nations exports as result they hold that subsidizing export financing merely shifts production among sectors within the economy but does not add to the overall level of economic activity and subsidizes foreign consumption at the expense of the domestic economy from this point of view promoting exports through subsidized financing or through governmentbacked insurance and guarantees will not permanently raise the level of employment in the economy but alters the composition of employment among the various sectors of the economy some opponents further argue that by providing financing or insurance for exporters that the market seems unwilling or unable to provide eximbanks activities draw from the financial resources within the economy that would be available for other uses such opportunity costs
