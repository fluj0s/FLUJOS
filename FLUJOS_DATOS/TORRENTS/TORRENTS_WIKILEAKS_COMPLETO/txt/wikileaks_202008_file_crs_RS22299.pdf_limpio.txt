referred to committee pursuant to provisions of senate rules xiv xvii and xxv when the house informs the senate that it has passed bill or joint resolution that was introduced in that chamber the measure is also often similarly referred to senate committee1 senate rule xiv 2 requires that bills and resolutions have three readings before passage and that they be read twice before being referred to committee2 although senator may demand that the readings occur on three different legislative days under paragraph 2 bills and joint resolutions may be read twice on the same day for reference referral if there is objection rule xiv 3 most bills and resolutions are read twice understood in practice to occur by unanimous consent and referred to committee on the same day that they are introduced by senator or received from the house3 senate rule xvii 1 states that measure should be referred to the committee which has jurisdiction over the subject matter which predominates rule xxv contains the jurisdictions of the senates standing committees there also exist agreements between committees that might govern the referral of certain bills and joint resolutions under rule xvii 1 the presiding officer formally refers bills and joint resolutions practically the parliamentarian refers measures in behalf of the presiding officer4 the introduction and referral of bills and joint resolutions and the referral of housepassed bills and joint resolutions occurs as morning business pursuant to senate rule vii 1 5 the senate may however use provisions of senate rule xiv or unanimous consent to completely or partially bypass potential referral of bill or joint resolution to senate committee the purpose of doing so could be to have measure placed directly on the senates calendar of business which under general orders lists measures eligible for floor consideration or to immediately consider measure 1 senate rules contain procedures for the processing of concurrent and simple resolutions which are not covered in this report see especially senate rule xiv 6 2 the third reading occurs after senate consideration of measure and before the vote on final passage see us congress

every bill and joint resolution introduced on leave and every bill and joint resolution of the house of representatives which shall have received first and second reading without being referred to committee shall if objection be made to further proceeding thereon be placed on the calendar emphasis added therefore through objection bill after two readings is prevented from being referred to committee and is placed directly on the calendar it is usually the majority leader or his designee acting on his own or at the request of any other senator who objects to further proceedingcommittee referralon the measure 6 for example this procedure was used to place directly on the calendar s 287 on january 12 2007 while the senate was debating another measure the presiding officer recognized the majority leader for this colloquy mr reid i understand s 287 introduced earlier today by senator kennedy and others is at the desk i ask for its first reading the presiding officer the clerk will report the bill by title bill s 287 to prohibit the use of funds for an escalation of united states military forces in iraq above the numbers existing as of january 9 2007 mr reid i now ask for its second reading but object to my own request the presiding officer objection is heard the bill will receive its second reading on the next legislative day 7 in the next edition of the calendar on

funds for an escalation of united states military forces in iraq above the numbers existing as of january 9 2007 mr salazar mr president i object to any further proceeding with respect to the bill in order to place it on the calendar under the provisions of rule xiv the presiding officer objection is heard the bill will be placed on the calendar 8 s 287 had received its second reading but there was objection to further proceeding on it the presiding officer under rule xiv ordered that the bill be placed on the senate calendar in the calendar beginning january 17 s 287 appeared in the section general orders with other measures available for floor consideration this same procedure is followed to have housepassed bills placed directly on the senate calendar9 broadly the two purposes of preventing referral of bill to committee are 1 to facilitate the full senates opportunity to consider the measure or 2 to bypass committees potential inaction or to the sponsor potential hostile action10 while placing bill directly on the calendar does not guarantee that the full senate will ever consider it the measure is available for floor consideration and certain procedural steps like committee reporting and procedural requirements like the twoday availability of committee report may be obviated in the 109 th congress at least 119 bills were placed directly on the calendar using the rule xiv procedure11 for example s 397 the protection of lawful commerce in arms act was an important legislative initiative reason that it might have been placed directly on the calendar was that the full senate already considered related bill in the 108th congress in september 2005 11 senate bills dealing with the aftermath of hurricane katrina were placed directly on the calendar thereby allowing the majority leader to expeditiously call them up for consideration by the senate housepassed bills might also be placed directly on the calender using the rule xiv procedure when senate measure is already on the calendar an amendment to the house measure is already in discussion among interested senators support for the housepassed measure is stronger in the full senate than in the committee to which it would be referred or for another reason housepassed measures placed on the calendar in this way in the 109 th congress included hr 8 death tax repeal permanency act hr 810 stem cell research enhancement act and hr 2745 united nations reform act 8 senator ken salazar remarks in the senate measure placed on the calendars 287 congressional record daily edition vol 153 jan 16 2007 p s628 9 see for example the legislative history of hr 6 110th cong clean energy act of 2007 10 on occasion senator introduces bill which is referred to committee and later introduces an identical or similar measure and places it directly on the calendar under rule xiv the senator might do this to bypass committees hostility to the first measure alternately senator can seek to offer measure as an amendment to another measure see crs report 98707 senate amendment process general conditions and principles by walter j oleszek 11 these 119 measures were identified by search of the congressional record on the legislative information system such search of the 108th congress identified 114 measures

senator with viewpoint different on an issue from that of other senators to give added visibility to specific bills and to avoid potential inaction or hostility in senate committee democratic senators in the 109th congress for example used this procedure to put bills such as s 1062 fair minimum wage act of 2005 directly on the calendar

also be read the first and second times by unanimous consent and placed on the calendar this procedure was used in the 109 th congress for housepassed bills such as hr 3 the highway and transit bill the senates transportation bill was reported from senate committee shortly after the senate received the housepassed measure

g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g156g561 the majority leader seeks unanimous consent to expeditiously process legislation the senate uses practice called clearance to notify senators of pending noncontroversial bills to determine if any senator would object to passing specific measure by unanimous consent with little or debate12 the process of passing noncontroversial measures may include bypassing senate committee or truncating committee action although committee might well have played key role in the development of the noncontroversial measure sought to be passed or in its clearance

any statements relating to the bill be printed in the record the presiding officer without objection it is so ordered 12 measures are usually taken up during the time for morning business in period dubbed the wrapup period but also during the conduct of legislative business when unanimous consent order temporarily suspends in effect the business under consideration by the senate
