columbia the space shuttle columbia was launched on its sts107 mission on january 16 2003 after completing 16day scientific research mission columbia started its descent to earth on the morning of february 1 2003 as it descended from orbit approximately 16 minutes before its scheduled landing at kennedy space center fl columbia broke apart over northeastern texas all seven astronauts aboard were killed commander rick husband pilot william mccool mission specialists michael p anderson david m brown kalpana chawla and laurel clark nd payload specialist ilan ramon an israeli the last communication with columbia was at about 0900 est the shuttle was at an altitude of 207135 feet traveling at sp eed of mach 183 about 13000 miles per hour the space shuttle columbia and the sts107 mission the space transportation sy stem sts th space shuttle consists of an airplanelike orbiter two solid rocket b oosters srbs on eith er side and large cylindrical external tank that holds the fuel for the orbiters main engines the srbs detach from the orbiter 2½ minutes after launch when their fuel is spent fall into the ocean and are recovered for refurbishment and reuse the external tank is not reusedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21408crs2 but is jettisoned as the orbiter reaches earth or bit and disintegrates as it falls into the indian ocean at the beginning of 2003 all planned shuttle launche s other than sts107 and two missions to the hubble space telescope were scheduled to support assembly and operation of the international space station see crs issue brief ib93017 columbia was one of four spaceflightworthy reusable space shuttle orbiters in nasas fleet the remaining orbiters are discovery atlantis and endeavour fifth orbiter challenger was lost in 1986 accident another orbiter enterprise was used for approach and landing tests in the 1970s nd was not designed to travel in space enterprise now belongs to the smithsonian s national air and space museum columbia was the first spaceflightworthy orbiter built for nasa by rockwell international the space division of rockwe ll which built the orb iters was later bought by boeing it was used for the very first shuttle flight on april 12 1981 the sts107 mission was columbia s 28th flight although columbia was the oldest orbiter discovery has been used for more flights 30 nas has conducted total of 114 shuttle launches to date orbiters are periodi cally taken out of service fo r maintenance and overhaul columbia had lost undergone such an orbite r major modification omm period in 19992001 sts107 was columbia s second flight after the omm it was scientific research mission that unlike most current shuttle launches was not related to the international space station iss progra m see crs issue brief ib93017 the crew conducted research program i nvolving 59 separate investiga tions some of the research required analysis of specimens and data sets after the shuttle returned to earth and most were destroyed along with the crew and orbiter other data however were transmitted to groundbased researchers during the flight and few specimens were retrieved among the debris so some of the research surv ived quantifying the amount is difficult previous spaceflightrelated crew fatalities the united states has suffered two other spaceflightrelated accidents that caused astronaut fatalities on january 27 1967 the crew of the first apollo mission virgil gus grissom edward white and roger chaffee died when electrical arcing in spacecraft wiring caused fire in their pollo command module durin g prelaunch test apollo flights resumed after 21 months on january 28 1986 the space shuttle challenger sts 51l exploded 73 seconds afte r launch killing all seven astronauts aboard francis dick scobee michael smith judith resnik ellison onizuka ronald mcnair gregory jarvis payload specia list from hughes aircraft and schoolteacher christa mcauliffe commission chaired by former secretary of state william rogers determined that cold weather at the launch site caused rubber oring in one of the srbs to fail allowing gases to escape re sulting in catastrophic explosion the shuttle system was grounded for 32 months four soviet cosmonauts died during sp aceflights cosmonaut vladimir komarov died during the first soyuz flight on apr il 24 1967 the spacecrafts parachutes did not function properly and it struck the ground w ith great force killing colonel komarov soviet human spaceflights were suspended for 18 months three cosmonauts died on soyuz 11 on june 29 1971 when an improperly sealed valve allowed the spacecrafts atmosphere to vent into space the co smonauts georgiy dobrovolskiy vladislav volkov and viktor patsayev were not wearing spacesuits and were asphyxiated there were soviet human spaceflights for 27 monthshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21408crs3 the columbia accident investigation board caib thennasa administrator sean okeefe established the columbia accident investigation board caib within hours of the tragedy and transitioned responsibility for the investigation to it on february 6 2003 chaired by adm ret harold gehman former nato supreme allied commander atlantic caib had 12 other members see httpwwwcaibus all were appointed by mr okeefe althoug h some were added to the initial roster upon the recommendati on of adm gehman nasa revised the boards charter three times to clarify its i ndependence from nasa pr imarily in response to congressional concerns however the caib was created by nasa included nasa representatives and the board members were appointed by the nasa administrator so concerns about its indepe ndence continued title v iii of the fy 20072008 nasa authorization act pl 109155 specifies how future human space flight accidents are to be investigated caib released the results of its investigation on august 26 2003 in vol 1 of its report volumes iivi were released in october 2003 all are available at caibs website board member brig gen duane d eal wrote 10page supplement published in vol 2 providing additiona l recommendations and viewpoints the causes of the accident the board concluded that the tragedy was caused by both technical and organizational failure s the technical cause was damage to columbia s left wing by 17 pound piece of insu lating foam that separated from the external tanks left bipod ramp and struck the orbiters left wing 819 seconds after launch the foam strike created hole in reinforced carbon carbon rcc panel on the leading edge of the wing allowi ng superheated air perhaps exceeding 5000of to enter the wing during reentry the extreme heat caused the wing to fail structurally creating aerodynamic forces that led to the disintegration of the orbiter organizationally the board pointed to detrimental cultural traits and organizational practices that developed over the institutional history of the program adm gehman cited loss of checks and balances in the programs ma nagement that should have led to recognition of the danger posed by foam shedding from the external tank which had occurred on previous shuttle missions the board also cited long term budget constraints and schedule pressure associated w ith assembly of the interna tional space station as factors caibs recommendations and the staffordcovey task group the caib made 29 recommendations of wh ich 23 were technical and six were organizational of the 29 recommendations the board specified that 15 be completed before the shuttle returned to flight status see crs report rs21606 for synopsis nasa created task group chaired by two former astronauts thomas stafford and richard covey to evaluate nasas compliance with the 15 caib recommendations that were to be completed before return to flight rtf the staffordcovey task group h ttpreturntoflightorg did not address orga nizational or cultural issues and was not tasked to determine whether the shuttle was ready to fly the task group held its final public meeting on june 27 2005 concluding that nasa had met the intent of 12 of the 15 caib rtf recommendations but not the other three preventing debris shedding from the external tank hardening the orbiter against damage from debris and developing in spection and repair technique s for the thermal protection system some task group members i ndicated however that nasa had made considerable improvements to shuttle safety and considered the shuttle ready to flyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21408crs4 thennasa administrator okeefe said during 2003 and 2004 that not only would nasa comply with the caib recommendations but would raise the bar to ensure the shuttle is as safe as possible dr mich ael griffin becam nasa administrator in april 2005 at an april 18 press conference he sa id he would listen carefully to advice from the staffordcovey group but that nasa and c ontractor personnel we re those responsible and accountable for determining if and when the shuttle is ready for rtf he would not commit to meeting every caib recommendation in testimony to the house science committee on june 28 2005 he said that nasa d spent lot of money trying to meet all the recommendations but did not have the knowledge to do so in every case such as stopping all debris sheddi ng from the external tank the caib report also cited cultural issues eg the safety culture that could affect shuttle safety those issues were addressed by an internal nasa study led by then nasa goddard space flight center director diaz nasa also hired an outside consulting firm bst to assess nasa cultu re and make recomme ndations about what changes were needed february 5 2005 bst report concluded that there was improvement but significant number of pe ople at nasas field centers did not yet perceive change dr griffin terminated the contract with bst soon after becoming administrator saying that nasa could deal with these issues internally return to flight the sts114 discovery mission nasa launched the space shuttle on its firs t return to flight rtf mission sts 114 on july 26 2005 using the discovery orbiter the sts114 crew was composed of six nasa astronauts and one from the japa n aerospace exploration agency jaxa commander eileen collins pilot james kelly and mission specialists charles camarda wendy lawrence soichi noguchi jaxa steve robinson and andy thomas sts 114 docked with the international space stati on iss for most of its mission sts114 delivered supplies repaired iss components and tested in spection and repair techniques for the orbiter the sts114 mission was ex tended one day so the shuttle crew could assist the iss crew in stowing supplies inclement weather at kennedy space center fl delayed landing until august 9 and diverted it to edwards air force base ca the day after launch july 27 nasa announced that further shuttle launches would be indefinitely postponed afte r discovering that compara tively large piece of foam broke off from discovery s external tank during launch similar to what happened to columbia in this case nasa determined that it did not hit the orbiter subsequently several smaller pieces were found to have broke n off and may have hit the or biters wing cameras and other sensors aboard discovery and the iss took detailed image s to determine if there was any damage and none was di scovered however the images revealed that two gapfillers ceramiccoated fabric that fills gaps between the thermal protection tiles on the bottom of the orbiter were protrudi ng which could affect aerodynamic heating during reentry astronaut robinson removed them during spacewalk the second rtf mission was scheduled for september 2005 with the mission of continuing testing post columbia fixes and resupplying the iss nasa continues to study why the foam loss on sts114 occurred that work was slowed by hurricane damage to the michoud assembly facility in new orleans where the external tanks are manufactured it is operated for nasa by lockheed martin nasas stennishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21408crs5 space center near slidell which tests th space shuttle main engines also suffered hurricane damage the next shuttle launc h is expected earlier than may 2006 issues for congress cost in july 2004 nasa released cost estimate for rtf covering the years fy20032009 22 billion double the previous estimate of 11 billion for fy2005 nasa requested 43 billion for the shuttle program in november 2004 nasa informed congress it needed 762 million more than expected for fy2005 in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 congress approved the 43 billion requested subject to an acrossthe board 080 rescission and said that nasa could submit request for supplemental appr opriations or reprog ram funds from other nasa programs according to may 10 2005 update to its fy2005 operating plan nasa reprogrammed the following funds into rtf 55 million from the science mission directorate 20 million from space sc ience 35 million from earth science 3758 million from the exploration systems mission directorate 73 million from biological and physical research 204 million from human and robotic technology and 98 million from transportation systems and 3312 million from the space operations mission directorate 160 million from the space station 170 million from space shuttle upgrades and 12 million from space flight suppor t separately c ongress appropriated 126 million to nasa in an fy2005 emerge ncy supplemental pl 108324 for damages at kennedy space center fl from the 2004 florida hurrican nasa officials say those funds are not available for rtf the caib noted that long term budget constraints were factor in the columbia tragedy nasa requested and received 45 billion for the shuttle in the fy2006 appropriations bill that includes nasa pl 109108 subject to 028 rescission in that act and 1 rescission in another ppropriations act pl 109148 the latter act also included 350 million for nasa for recove ry from hurricane katrina the fy2006 request for the shuttle developed by thenadministrator okeefe included an outyear projection that the shuttle budget w ould decline to 24 billion by fy2010 many observers considered that unrealistic and at november 3 2005 house science committee hearing dr griffin agreed that nasa will need 35 billion more than that for fy2008fy2010 the source of those funds is unclear the shuttles future the foamshedding event during discovery s launch and the resulting decision to suspend further shu ttle launches plus th funding s hortfall in nasas outyear projection adds to the comp lexity of decisions about the shuttles future prior to discovery s launch discussion was focuse d on president bushs january 2004 directive that the shuttle be retired as part of his new vision for space exploration where nasa is to focus its attention on returning astronauts to the moon by 2020 and someday sending them to mars see crs report rs21720 under the plan the shuttle in its current form would be terminat ed in 2010 primarily so that its funding can be redirected towards achieving other aspects of the vision the 2010 date also coincides with the caibs recommendation that if the shuttle is to be flown longer it should be recertified two key issues raised by the d ecision to end shuttle flights by 2010 are the extent to which the united states wants its own ability to launch astronauts into space and the importance of completing iss construction and meeting us commitments to other iss partnershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21408crs6 the shuttle is the only us vehicle capable of taking astronauts to space today as part of the vision nasa is building new crew exploration ve hicle cev the original schedule called for it to be available for launching crews to earth orbit by 2014 meaning there would be multiyear gap between the end of the shuttle program and the availability of cev during that time nasa would be dependent on russia for human access to space dr griffin wants to acceler ate cev availability to reduce the gap as much as possible in part because he belie ves the united states should not be dependent on any other nation for human access to space nasas current target is 2012 the senate adopted an amendment to the fy2006 department of defens authorization bill s 1042 on november 15 2005 expressing the sense of the senate that it is in the national security interest of the united states to maintain preeminence in human spaceflight initial versions of the nasa authorization bill hr 3070s 1281 contained conflicting lang uage about the future of the s huttle the senate bill originally directed nasa not to terminate the shuttle until replacement was available while the house version originally directed nasa not to fly the shuttle after december 31 2010 the final version of the act pl 109155 st ates that it is us policy to have human access to space on continuous basis and dir ects nasa to submit veral related reports to congress the shuttles primary purpose today is assembly and servicing of the iss dr griffin also promised to reassess whether or not to use the shuttle for one more servicing mission to the hubble space telescope see crs report rs21767 nasas current target is to launch th shuttle 18 times to s upport the iss with one potential additional launch to hubble by the end of 2010 the n eed to complete iss assembly and meet us commitments to its iss partners and to service hubble is being weighed against the costs operating the shuttle for that many more years especially now that nasa has conceded that it will need 35 billion more than was in cluded in its outyear funding profile one consideration is that some of the iss segments waiting to be launched are those built by the other iss partners and president bush said the united states would meet its commitments to those partners another question is whether setting firm deadline for ending shuttle flights pl aces undue schedule pressure on shuttle program managers to complete as many launches as possible within whatever remaining time there is caib cited schedule pressure as factor in the columbia accident the effect on iss utilization by nasa and its partners is another issue iss was designed to be serviced by the shuttle which can carry larger crews than the russian soyuz spacecraft and larger and heavier cargo than the russian pr ogress cargo spacecraft in addition the shuttle is the only cargo spacecraft that can return large amounts of material to earth russias pr ogress burns up as it reenters th atmosphere without the shuttle the results of scientific experiments equipment needing repair and other items could only be returned if they fit within the small confines of the soyuz capsule along with whatever crew members were returning to earth unless new cargo spacecraft are developed how nasa can ensure that the shuttle system will remain safe as workers and vendors move on to other projects as the shu ttle program comes to an end is also being discussed nasa plans to develop two shuttlederived launch vehicles see crs issue brief ib93062 which could mitigate some of the shuttle workforce displacements
