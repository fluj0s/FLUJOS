6611c29 shspec82 ot and clear defined majority of scientologys major executives are now clear lrh noticed that the statistics of divisions were in roughly the same range as the case state of their heads we have tried to put together scientology dictionary it requires work from lrh to make sure that the definitions are complete he will take students requests on cards and define the words ot operating thetan operating means manipulating handling you operate car etc also oneself can operate one is operative thetan is from the greek letter theta traditionally used to mean thought the letter n is added to theta to make the noun thetan we mean by thetan life unit being an individual who is alive and who is capable of thinking and being spirit inhabiting the body in greek times theta was the thought in person as opposed to his body the thetan inhabits the clay and moves it around to that degree anyone who can move is operating as thetan but ot means someone who can operate without body being who is cause over thought life matter energy space and time someone who is being cause is being source of action or impulse as in causedistanceeffect this state is quite different from the state of clear it is someone who can operate without the encumbrances of the common clay there are degrees of operation wog common everyday gardenvariety humanoid he is body he doesnt know hes there etc he isnt there as spirit at all he is not operating as thetan the term comes from worthy oriental gentleman from the days of the british in egypt humanoid is one who has human characteristics by which we do not mean that he is human in his treatment of things he isnt it is simply that he is body he isnt there as spirit at all he will develop philosophy that says that everything is matter including the self wog is not the bottom end of the scale which would include psychotic neurotic catatonic etc this would be someone who didnt even know that he was mest ot isnt the top end of the scale either at the top you would have harmonic of the wog thetan who didnt have to operate at all in an almost unattainable absolute outside of mest altogether so he would be serene calm and dissociated with the physical universe not in the timestream someone at the bottom of the scale is the effect of everything he has to cause everything and can cause nothing someone at the top would be potentially able to cause everything but wouldnt have to but this is nogame condition and thetans are idiotic enough to like to have game going ptp exists when one has to do something about something when audited thoroughly person is longer affected by the problem similarly in serenity one doesnt have to do anything about it but one of the native characteristics of thetan is messing around he gets bored at tone 40 so just below 400 you get ot at the beginning of the universe the thetan was potentially omniscient and omnipotent but he had experience and knew nothing he was pretty stupid when you put someone back to the state of ot you are putting somebody back who is different from anyone else on the track he is operating with experience when we say ot we mean clear ot released ot is someone who is exterior and feeling great feeling powerful for just plain ot we can just call it exterior there has hitherto never been anything but released ot there are two parallel lines 1 how much is someone out of his bank and 2 how much less bank does he have using techniques developed in 1952 you can bang nearly anyone out of his head he then exhibits the characteristics of being who is not influenced by body this state can last third of second or it can last three hundred years it will make someone sane who is insane but since one has aberrations as being not just as body exteriorizing doesnt get rid of all his aberrations gautama siddhartha was exteriorizing people in 523 bc making state called bodhi we can make bodhi buddha in thirty seconds the lamas in tibet developed practices to assist exteriorization when the lamas couldnt exteriorize people they redefined bodhi to mean someone who was calm refined serene and had benign conduct it is the mental mass that prevents exteriorization this mass is composite of the thetans own pictures and aberrations that pins him to the body some people are harder to exteriorize than others it is the mental mass called the mind with its pictures and masses that prevents some people from exteriorizing thetan exterior is simply outside body this happens inevitably at death it is only the worry about getting body that makes thetan unhappy an operating thetan is thetan exterior who can have but doesnt have to have body in order to control or operate thought life matter energy space and time nirvana was added to buddhistic doctrine at later date the original idea was just to get away from the continual cycle of rebirth there is goal to operate in buddhism however someone who is thetan exterior but not clear or ot may be in very bad shape he may barely be able to get to maternity ward he has power of choice over what body he gets etc and sometimes thetan suddenly regains his ot abilities without knowing how he did it this is quite rare it frightens observers suleiman in the arabian nights produced big scare about thetans lrh describes the embarrassment of the thetan in battle who hasnt noticed that his body has been killed and who just keeps hewing away at the enemy on the battlements until he notices that what he thinks is his sword goes through the enemy without touching them then he looks down in the mud and sees his old body very aberrated ot could exist he might accidentally discover that he can move mest make sound etc he is liable to do most anything because he is operating automatically he is not able to control these manifestations eg he may produce poltergeist phenomena this would be released ot those beings can be upset this is higherscale wog amongst thetans it is also possible to be exterior knowingly but unable to move anything or cause things one eventually gets tired of this and wants new body previous released ots had one with whom to associate person who went thetan exterior had hope of anything else he had shut track therefore the game of being body became functional actually an ot could mock up body out of whole cloth how else do you have body an ot like the above with or without the ability to move objects is not clear ot he is released ot since he doesnt understand his state or what he is doing but the scientology definition of ot is clear ot clear ot knows what he has done and what he is doing he is clear who can operate like billyo clear thetan without bank in or out of body the source of the bank the being himself he is making himself the unknowing and unwilling effect of his own bank he is causing himself to receive unwillingly and unknowingly the effect of his own bank the person compulsively makes up pictures when he is bad off all hes got is blankedout picture black mass that covers up the picture or pressure that crowds the picture into oblivion the black five below that you get random pictures that flick by on automatic the word bank is taken from electronic computer terminology meaning card system file system the machine pulls out certain data cards and puts them into operation or computation in the machine so that the machine can solve problems the bankbound thetan is peculiarly affected by and operates on banks there is such thing as crazy thetan there is thetan who is mocking up craziness that he is the effect of otherwise there would be hope you can ask guy with fixed picture or chronic picture what part of that could you be responsible for this is good process for the guy who doesnt know that he has mind someone can be so notised that he isnt aware that he has mind the level of not believing in mind is below the level of not being able to see the mind or pictures above being able to see the mind is not having one all mental masses do is not furnish you with data as they seem to do but charge the area of the data up so that you cant directly recall it and you get hit by the picture or mass and you think the picture is giving you the data so therefore you mustnt get rid of the picture because if you got rid of the picture then you wouldnt have the data this is silly because if you didnt have the picture then you could recall it all without consequences clear doesnt have mind in that he is not the effect of this picture mechanism but the clear still has the mest universe around and he still uses body that isnt very strong and is made of cells that arent invulnerable so the fact that person is clear doesnt say that he wont get sick because there are such things as bacteria and viruses and the body has finite strength it is idiotic to measure clear by his health when clear exteriorizes he may be clear exterior unable to talk etc like baby having to learn to walk the state is stable since he has bank to snap him in again when person is clear he can more easily become exterior there are 140 clears as of this date according to lrh getting someone from clear to ot is job of proofing him up so that even if he mocked up bank he wouldnt be the effect of it cleared ot is proofedup being who wont hit the banana peel you could probably fix up clear exterior so he would go exterior to the physical universe you could use command like try not to be outside the physical universe this would make him exterior from the universe but that would be unstable until he was longer at effect relatively to the physical universe he would be unstable since he is still the effect of mest life and thought but person who can be at cause over something is not necessarily at total effect of it that doesnt mean however that he has nothing to do with it because you can fix car is reason why you cant enjoy one our adversary is the complexity of the wisdom of the ages suppressed and combined to keep people from doing it it takes lot of blood sweat and tears to face this sort of thing there is nothing mild about the way course supervisors continue to do their job there is probably greater distance between clear and ot than between wog and clear clear ot is walking miracle who comprehends the miracle so knowing and willing cause is part of the definition of ot it is not an accidental or automatic state you get to point where you can turn automaticities on and off doing it on an unknowing basis is far inferior if this crosses up your own reality in any way shape or form by all means dont change your own reality just run your auditing question
