guarantees these unpredictable contingent event benefits subject to certain limitations under section 403 of the act pbgc guarantees for contingent event benefits are to be calculated using the same method as benefits associated with plan amendments that are made within five years of the date of termination8 the formula to be used is the greater of 20 of the guaranteed be nefit or b 20 per month

are substantial owners individuals who own an entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business more than 10 of the capital or pr ofits interest in pa rtnership or more than 10 of the voting stock or 100 of all the stock of corporation section 407 changes two of these rules first under one of these rules as it existed prior to the act the maximum benefit guaranteed by the pbgc fo r substantial owners was phased in over 30year period specifically the maximum be nefit was determined by dividing the number of years the owner participated in th plan by 30 this number or one whichever was lesser was then multiplied by the monthly guaranteed benefit termined without the special rule if the plan had been amended to increase benefits each amendment was treated as new plan and subject to the calculation section 407 of the act amends this rule in two ways13 first it makes the rule apply to majority owners rather than substantial owners majority owner is an individual who owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business at least 50 of the capital or profits interest in partne rship or at least 50 of the voting stock or 100 of all the stock of corporation substantial owner who is not majority owner is longer subject to the special rule regarding max imum guaranteed benefits second the section changes the formula for determining the maximum guaranteed benefit under the new formula the majority owners maximum guar anteed benefit is phased in over 10year period specifically it is determined by divi ding the number of years between the plans effective or adoption date whi chever is later and the plans termination date by 10 this number or one whichever is sser is multiplied by the amount of benefits that would have been guaranteed had the par ticipant not been majority owner another special preact rule that applied to substantial owners related to the allocation of plan assets at termination erisa creates six categories of benefits to prioritize how plan assets will be distribut ed when the plan terminates the fourth category includes all guaranteed benefits not allocated to higher categories and prior to the act the benefits of substantial owners that exceeded the maximum guaranteed benefit as determined under the special rule discusse d above under secti on 407 of the act this rule applies to majority owners rather than substantial owners14 the act also provides that for purposes of the fourth category assets are first allocated to the guaranteed benefits and then to the majority owners benefits15 section 407 generally applie s to distress and involuntar terminations for which notices of intent to terminate or dete rmination are provided after december 31 2005 benefits attributable to recoveries from employers the sponsor of terminating plan and the mbers of its controlled group are liable for amounts including unfunded benefit liab ilities and unpaid employer contributi ons the pbgc is to attempt to recover these amounts and pay portion of them to plan participants as additional benefits ie be nefits in addition to the amounts guaranteed by the pbgc the pbgc would keep the rest to reduce its losseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22513crs5 16 erisa 4022c3bii 29 usc 1322c3bii 17 erisa 4044e 29 usc 1344e it appear s this should be changed to erisa 4044f and 29 usc 1344f 18 erisa 4041b5 29 usc 1341b5with respect to unfunded bene fit liabilities the plan par ticipants share is the amount of the nonguaranteed and nonallocated bene fit liabilities multiplied by recovery ratio for large plans whose outstanding benef it liabilities exceed 20 million the recovery ratio is the amount recovered from the plan over the plans unfunded be nefit liabilities on the termination date fo r all other plans the recovery ratio is not based on the amount actually recovered from the plan but rather on the pbgcs recoveries from all plan terminations that occurred during specified period specifically the recovery ratio is the amount recovered from plan s terminating during the specified period over the total amount of those plans unfunded benefit liabilitie s on their termination dates under the law prior to the act the specified period was the fivefederal fiscal year period that ended with the year immediately prior to the year in which the appropriate termination notice was given for the plan for which the recovery ratio was being determined under section 408 of the act the specified period is changed to the fivefederal fis cal year period ending with the third year preceding the year in which that notice is given16 with respect to unpaid employer contribu tions the amount that went to the plan participants prior to the ac t was based on the amount recove red from that plan section 408 of the act creates new formula that is similar to that used for unfunded benefit liabilities under the s ection the plan partic ipants share is determined by multiplying the amount of the liability by recovery ratio17 for large plans the recovery ratio is the actual recovery from the plan over the total liability for other plans the recovery ratio is the amount recovered for these unpaid cont ributions from plans that terminated during the specified period over those plans total such liability at their termination dates the specified period is the fivefederal fiscal year period that ended with the third year immediately prior to the year in which the appropriate termination notice was given for the plan for which the recovery ratio is be ing determined the terminations made by the pbgc for these rules are binding unle ss shown by clear and convincing evidence to be unreasonable section 408 applies to terminations for wh ich notices of intent to terminate or of determination are provided on or after the date which is 30 days after august 17 2006 cessation or change in memb ership of controlled group plan administrator may terminate its singleemployer plan if the plans assets exceed its benefit liabilities the pbgc may terminate singleemployer plan if the pbgcs possible longrun loss may be expected to unreasonably increase if the plan continues in both situations the plans benefit liabilities are determined by calculating the present value of the benefits owed under the plan using the pbgcs interest and mortality assumptions section 409 of the act provides that in certa in situations the interest rate used to calculate the plans benefit liabilities can not be less than the interest rate used to determine whether the plan is fully funded18 the rule applies if there is transaction or series of transactions that results in pe rson longer being member of controlled group and that person immediately before the transaction maintained fully
