work over set period of time procedures for the authorisation of the works and financial authorisation for them were not observed vendor 1 was selected to undertake the contracts without any proper selection procedure it is also alleged that the cost of the repairs to the passenger terminal apron rose from 3519 to 58000 without any work forms or other justification for the extra expenditure 3

the establishment of the investigation task force the itf investigators conducted an enquiry into the allegations raised by interviews with persons indicated to be witnesses and persons potentially i mplicated in the allegations by obtaining documents from the pristina airport admin istration and from pillar iv which were then analysed for relevance to the enqui ry at hand 5 this report details the findings resulting from these enquiries iv background information 6 pristina international airport constitutes sta owned enterprise under yugoslavian law the assets of the airport include the runways terminal buildings hanger fuel storage facilities and equi pment during the period covered by this investigation from 2001 until 2003 they were maintained by the public enterprise airport pristina peap in coope ration with military units of the kosovo force kfor pursuant to united nations sec urity council resolution 1244 dated 10 june 1999 and unmik regulation 1 1999 dated 25 july 1999 unmik is mandated to administer the territory of ko sovo including state owned and publicly owned assets this includes pristina i nternational airport 7 until the end of june 2002 responsibility for t he administration of the pristina airport was entrusted to the civil administration p illar pillar ii of unmik including official 1 and official 2 pillar ii supe rvised doti official 1 department of transport and infrastructure the doti was late r known as the transport sector of the unmik directorate of infrastructure ffairs doti official 1 left unmik at the end of june 2002 doti official 2 was recruited by the doti as an international staff member on 31 july 2000 in charg of airport operations reporting to doti official 1 and continued in this role until 30 september 2001 engineering expertise was provided by series of ngineers seconded from the armed forces of united nations member state spec ifically airport engineer 1 airport engineer 2 and airport engineer 3 and lat er by consultant from the consulting company 8 on 1 july 2002 the responsibility for the admin istration of the airport passed from pillar ii to the kosovo trust agency kta and pillar iv the divisional manager was appointed under him were the peap offi cial and the atcs official air traffic control services 9 on 1 april 2004 pristina international airport which had until that time been under the jurisdiction of kfor was handed over to c ivilian jurisdiction under icao regulations 10 it is against this background of change that pr ocurement procedures relating to the following contract have been examined 4 v investigation details 11 this part of the investigation relates to ser ies of six single source procurements emergency repair contracts for the ma intenance and repair of the runway taxiways and parking areas at pristina airp ort in the period november 2000 april 2002 the value of the contracts were s follows echo parking area 90000 deutsche marks dm taxiway delta 27000 dm antikerosene treatment for echo parking area 95 56197 dm charlie area 30000 dm golf area and runway crater 48500 dm passenger terminal apron 58000 contract for the resurfacing of echo parking area 12 an interoffice memorandum from doti official 2 to procurement official 1 central procurement entity dated 17 november 2002 i ndicates that peap tried to obtain three quotes in order to carry out urgent re surfacing work on the echo parking area however they were only able to obtai n two quotes for the work from the companies vendor 2 and vendor 3 the two q uotes were evaluated on 17 november 2000 by doti official 2 the peap offic ial and senior airport supervisor and decision taken to award the contr act to vendor 2 contract was signed between pristina airport and vendor 2 on 29 november 2000 13 the memorandum suggests that an attempt was mad to follow competitive shopping procedure although the itf has not seen d ocumentary evidence indicating that the formal provisions set out in th unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using koso vo consolidated budget funds were followed 14 this was also suggested in interview by the pea p official who stated we were at that time under the supervision of doti official 2 and we were told that it was not necessary to use finance admin istration instruction no2 1999 relating to public procurement because we we re using out own money 15 the peap officials response was contradicted b doti official 2 who stated to the itf that guidelines were followed but added that the urgency of getting some jobs done led us in c ertain cases to carry out single source procurements 16 the interoffice memorandum dated 17 november 20 00 also indicates that the two offers received from the companies vendor 2 and vendor 3 were evaluated by committee consisting of three persons whereas the procurement rules require that there should be minimum of four pers ons on evaluation committees 17 file note written and signed by doti official 2 and two colleagues whose signatures are illegible dated 1 march 2001 and m emorandum dated 2 march 5 2001 indicate that vendor 2 failed to fulfil its ob ligations under the contract as result of which the contract with vendor 2 was term inated on 1 march 2000 18 four days earlier on 26 february 2001 an off er was obtained from vendor 1 to carry out the resurfacing of the echo parking area and new small area of 382m¬≤ in the northwest corner of the echo parking rea in the sum of 90000 dm 19 letter from doti official 2 and the peap offi cial to vendor 1 dated 8 march 2001 confirms that the offer received from vendor 1 to carry out the work was accepted at extra cost to the budget 20 it is clear both from the above documentary ev idence and from evidence provided in interview by doti official 2 and the pe ap official that the failure of vendor 2 to perform the contract left the airport i n difficult position as the re surfacing work had now become urgent 21 the peap official emphasised this point in the course of hisher interview stating doti official 1 and i were in panic situation because many flights were delayed there were not many options in kosovo at this time and we hadnt lot of experience as to how we should approach another com pany or as to how to terminate this contract 22 an earlier interoffice memorandum from doti off icial 1 to procurement official 1 dated 14 november 2000 indicates that approval was sought for single source procurement to be used for the original contract wi th vendor 2 however the itf has not been able to locate any similar authority r elating to the contract with vendor 1 23 doti official 2 in the course of hisher inter view indicated there must be another document as i must have gon through procurement official 1 and doti official 1 in havin g the work authorised i do not see any supporting documents indicating permission to carry out this urgent work from doti however heshe later added the matter would have been discussed during satu rday morning airport management meeting and minutes of the meeting would record this we need to consult the following saturday minutes after 8 th march i dont recall writing memorandum to doti official 1 therefore it may have resulted from verbal discussion and been recorded in the meeting 24 in addition capital expenditure approval fo rm has been located to authorise the expenditure 25 in summary evidence suggests that the contract for the resurfacing of parking area echo became an emergency due to the failure of vendor 2 to fulfil its contractual obligations due to the situation this created formal tender procedures do not appear to have been followed in s electing vendor 1 to carry out the work or in obtaining capital expenditure ap proval evidence also suggests 6 that the offer received from vendor 1 to carry out the work did not add substantial costs to the budget contract for emergency repairs to taxiway delta 26 analysis of the interoffice memorandum from dot i official 2 to doti official 1 dated 25 april 2001 indicates that authorisation wa s requested for single source procurement to carry out emergency repairs to taxiw ay delta as in the previous instance the work to repair the taxiway was import ant since it was the main entrance to the parking ramp next to the terminal b uilding authorisation was given in april 2001 by doti official 1 to use the m ethod of single source procurement for the repairs to taxiway delta at c ost of 27000 dm 27 the memorandum from doti official 2 dated 25 ap ril 2001 states that the problem had already been discussed with vendor 1 an d recommended that vendor 1 be considered for the single source procur ement due to its reputation and the quality of the work it had already carried out on the airport this suggests that decision had already been taken to offer the work to vendor 1 prior to authorisation being sought for single source procur ement 28 fax signed by doti officer 1 to doti official 2 and the peap official dated 14 may 2001 indicates that following approval to use s ingle source procurement process decision was taken to launch the emergen cy repairs following an inspection of the taxiway delta platform the itf h as not seen any separate capital expenditure approval forms for this work 29 an invoice from vendor 1 dated 12 june 2001 sig ned by the peap official confirms that the work on taxiway delta was carried out 30 whilst in the case of parking area echo sing source tender procedure is justifiable in the case of other repair contracts an international competitive tender could have been held at an early stage to lect company to carry out repairs to the airport runway taxiways and parking areas over specified period of time it would then have been unnecessary to have series of single source procurements 31 doti official 2 in the course of hisher inter view was asked whether consideration was given to having competitive ten der for repairs to be carried out by one company over given period heshe repl ied because each of the individual repairs were d irty jobs that need to be done fast there was provision in the master plan for any of the repairs we knew all the problems existed and they were brou ght up repeatedly at the meetings they therefore ended up being dealt with in this way i was concerned with the safety aspect of the airport 32 article 31 of the unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using kosovo consolidated budget funds provides that emergency procurement may be used for goods works or services if 311 the need for the procurement is urgent 7 312 the conditions giving rise to the urgency we re not under the control of nor due to the negligence or other actions of eit her the requesting or the procuring entity 313 the urgency could not reasonably have been for eseen 33 if the problems were known to exist and brought up repeatedly at meetings it is difficult to argue that the repairs could not have reasonably have been foreseen therefore the requirements for emergency procuremen t by means of series of single source contracts were not fulfilled 34 in addition doti official 2 in the course of hisher interview was asked whether any thought was given to having an international nder in response heshe stated international companies would not come to do t hese minor jobs as the mobilisation costs would be too great we tried to use local companies but they were useless as was demonstrated by the perfo rmance of vendor 2 35 however vendor 1 was an international company therefore if the jobs had been tendered as part of package with given value of w ork it would have been more attractive to international companies 36 in summary the repairs to taxiway delta were important repair work which it was necessary to carry out whilst it is accepted t hat the work was authorised as single source procurement the circumstances giving rise to the work do not fall within the requirements of article 31 of the unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 on public procurement using koso vo consolidated budget funds contract for antikerosene treatment for the echo p arking area 37 letter from vendor 1 to the peap official dat ed 30 may 2001 suggests that vendor 1 recommended an antikerosene treatment for the echo parking area when asked about this in interview doti official 2 stated vendor 1 did recommend the antikerosene treatment but the price initially quoted for anti kerosene treatment was hi gh so it was not done however russian military aircraft used the echo pa rking area to refuel as result of which fuel was spilt on the tarmac and it was damaged we were then obliged to go ahead with the antikerosene treatmen t to repair the damage 38 an interoffice memorandum dated 11 june 2001 i ndicates that doti official 2 and airport engineer 1 sent written request to pr ocurement official 1 for permission to have antikerosene work carried out s soon as possible by vendor 1 although it does not specifically mention that t here had already been spillage on the tarmac of echo parking area the memorandum attaches two quotations to carry out the work from the companies vendor 1 nd vendor 4 the lower of which was provided by vendor 1 39 the memorandum emphasises the necessity of ensu ring that the echo area was protected against spillage of aircraft fuel in view of the fact that echo parking area was the main overspill area for parking aircra ft 8 40 an email dated 13 june 2001 from procurement of ficial 1 to doti official 2 attaching form of approval for emergency procurem ent indicates that emergency procurement was authorised and the offer from vendor 1 in the sum of 9556197dm was accepted on18 june 2001 41 an invoice from vendor 1 dated 26 july 2001 for the antikerosene treatment indicates that the work was carried out and certifi ed as having been done by airport engineer 1 42 as in previous instances it is accepted that i t was necessary to have the anti kerosene treatment carried out however it is ques tionable as to why the work was not carried out at the time when the echo parki ng area was resurfaced in addition the itf has not seen any separate capital expenditure approval forms 43 when asked about this single source contract do official 2 stated originally we didnt put antikerosene treatment n the echo parking area which was subsequently used to refuel aircra ft as result the tarmac was damaged by aircraft fuel which caused the tarmac t melt we therefore had to have an antikerosene work done on echo parking are this was bad management error on our part as antikerosene trea tment should have been used at the outset 44 in summary antikerosene treatment does appea r to have been recommended by vendor 1 but was initially rejected on grounds of cost an accidental fuel spillage then occurred causing damage to echo parki ng area necessitating anti kerosene treatment to be carried out as matter of urgency by means of single source procurement for which approval was sought 45 with hindsight the single source contract appe ars to have been due to management error in not having the treatment carrie d out at the outset as previously stated with better forward planning single source contract could have been avoided if an international competitive t ender had been held at an early stage to select company to carry out repair s to the airport runway taxiways and parking areas over specified period of time repair of charlie area 46 analysis of an interoffice memorandum from dot i official 2 and airport engineer 1 to doti official 1 dated 10 august 2001 indicates that the russian kfor who were responsible for matters concerning r unway and taxiway safety announced that the charlie area was to be closed th following monday due to the condition of the taxiway charlie vendor 1 were therefore contracted to carry out urgent repairs to taxiway charlie at cost of 30000 dem by means of single source procurement annotations at the end of the m emorandum indicate this work was authorised by doti officer 2 as in previo us instances capital expenditure approval appears to have been obtained 47 the interoffice memorandum indicates that vendo r 1 was selected to carry out the work on the basis that it had previously undert aken work in professional way 9 48 signed contract dated 11 august 2001 signed b the vendor 1 with doti official 2 and airport engineer 1 on behalf of unm ik and the peap official on behalf of peap indicates that the work was to be ca rried out during the evening and night of 1112 august 2001 49 an invoice from vendor 1 dated 18 august 2001 i ndicates that the work was carried out and certified as having been done by ai rport engineer 1 50 in summary the repair work to taxiway charlie appears to have become urgent necessitating single source procurement in order to keep the airport open whilst it is noted that it was small low value job on i ts own as stated above it could have been combined with other jobs and been the sub ject of tender given that it came only two months after the previous single s ource contract and within days of the next repair to golf area and the runway bomb damage contract for repair and antikerosene treatment to taxiway golf and repair to the airport runway 51 letter from vendor 1 to the peap official an d acts official dated 28 june 2001 indicates that an offer was made to pristina irport to undertake the repair and antikerosene treatment of an area on taxiway g olf as well as the repair of an area on the airport runway caused by bomb damag at cost of 48500 dm 52 vendor 1 originally submitted the proposal to carry out the work in june 2001 however the offer is annexed to an interoffice mem orandum from doti official 2 and airport engineer 1 to doti official 1 dated 15 august 2001 requesting authorisation to carry out the repairs 53 an interoffice memorandum dated 15 august 2001 also contains an annotation stating that an international civil aviation organi sation icao report recommends action to repair the cracks and elevatio ns in the golf area platform 54 the same memorandum requests permission to use vendor 1 due to it having carried out all previous repairs in professional way and due to the difficulty in finding estimates from other comparable companies the annotation at the bottom of the memorandum states that vendor 1 are w orking locally and are able to repair the surface without disturbing flights 55 approval to use single source procurement for the repairs was sought in an internal memorandum from doti official 1 to procure ment official 2 dated 8 november 2001 the memorandum mentions that althou gh an offer was received from vendor 1 dated 28 june 2001 kfor di d not the company access to carry out the works 56 analysis of later memorandum dated 13 novembe r 2001 signed by procurement official 2 indicates that authorisatio n was not given until november 2001 to use direct single source procurement for th work rather than competitive tendering in justifying the single source referen ce is made to inter alia the icao recommendations and the memorandum from doti offici 2 and airport engineer 1 dated 15 august 2001 10 57 further interoffice memorandum to jengr kfor hq pristina from airport engineer 2 the replacement airport engineer dated 10 january 2002 suggests that the work had not been undertaken some two mont hs later due to winter weather conditions and was not scheduled to be fini shed until 19 april 2002 58 in summary whilst the work to carry out repair s to the golf area and the runway bomb damage and provide antikerosene treatment to the golf area was clearly necessary for safety reasons and was deemed to be u rgent it took from june 2001 until april 2002 for it to be carried out 59 having regard to the time span between the init ial proposal for the work in june 2001 and the date on which the work was eventually carried out in april 2002 this work should have been the subject of competi tive tender either on its own in combination with the repairs to be carried out n the passenger terminal apron which took place one month later in may 2002 alternatively it should have formed part of an international competitive nder to select company to carry out repairs to the airport runway taxiways nd parking areas over specified period of time contract for repairs to cracks in the main passenge r terminal apron 60 an interoffice memorandum from airport engineer 2 to doti official 1 dated 23 april 2002 indicates that authorisation was reques ted for vendor 1 to carry out repairs to cracks in the main passenger terminal ap ron handwritten annotation on the memorandum indicates that approval was give to undertake the work by doti official 1 61 the memorandum states that two offers were obta ined from vendor 1 and vendor 5 to undertake repairs to cracks on the mai n passenger apron and attaches an unsigned invitation to tender and two stimates 62 vendor 1 provided the lower of the two estimate s for the optional solution in the sum of 3060 due to the fact that it was already on site with all the necessary equipment and materials therefore the charge for i nstallation of equipment was already covered by two other contracts for the repa ir of the construction of the cargo apron and the repair to the runway bomb damag 63 both the memorandum and the invitation to tend er suggest that the extent of the required repairs was not clear as they indicate it was necessary to kick out all loose material around the cracks in order to check the state of the base before effecting repairs 64 vendor 1 signed the contract for the repair wo rk on 24 april 2002 and by doti official 1 for unmik doti on 2 may 2002 in the sum of 3519 including taxes it will be noted that at article 9 the contract provi des for additional work to be carried out 11 65 letter from the divisional manager to vendor 1 dated 23 may 2003 however suggests that the extent of the repairs carried out was substantially in excess of the additional work envisaged under the contract with the result that the cost of the work increased significantly to almost ten tim the original contract price 66 letter from vendor 1 to the divisional manage r and the peap official dated 3 february 2003 indicates that the areas to be repair ed were identified and marked out in the presence of airport engineer 2 and the p eap official prior to commencement of the work the letter adds that the work was carried out under the supervision of airport engineer 2 67 the letter also indicates that work order or any other form of documentation was completed for the extra work and formal auth orisation appears to have been sought for the work to be carried out 68 when the peap official was asked about the cont ract for the repair of the passenger terminal apron in interview heshe state d i dont know details the french engineer ordered this work when heshe was asked who authorized him to order that work he she answered that heshe has the permit from doti official 1 to autho rize the company to carry out the work i dont know who authorized to carry out the additi onal work i am aware that it was emergency because part of the parking was dam aged the russians required this because they were in charge i dont know who gave the financial authorization to carry out the work at th parking 69 significantly the peap official failed to ment ion that heshe was present at the time when the additional work was identified and ma rked out as official of peap present at the time it is highly unlikely th at heshe could not have been aware of the additional work or whether it was aut horised 70 the peap officials failure to mention that he she was present when the additional work was identified and marked out is so reflected in hisher justification for the work to official 3 dated 3 ptember 2004 in which heshe states that the work was authorised by airport engi neer 2 but again omits to mention that heshe was present when the area was being marked out 71 the itf have confirmed that the peap official w as present as the airport representative in telephone conversation with ven dor 1 representative who signed the original contract with the airport 72 primary responsibility for drawing up appropria additional work plans and having them duly authorised was the responsibility of airport engineer 2 73 the peap officials statement that heshe didn t know who authorised the additional work at best demonstrates an unwillingne ss to take managerial responsibility as manager in position of respo nsibility who was present at the time the work was identified heshe should hav taken steps to ensure that the appropriate work orders and authorisation were completed by the engineer airport engineer 2 and in the event that they were not dealt with the matter himselfherself 12 74 minutes of an airport strategy meeting dated 17 november 2003 estimated the cost of the repair work to cracks in the main passe nger terminal apron to be 58000 however an email dated 14 october 2004 an d an account transfer form dated 9 october 2004 indicate that vendor 1 was eve ntually paid 51942 in settlement of its claim in october 2004 75 in summary the extent of the repair work carri ed out on the passenger terminal apron was not in accordance with the value or exten t of additional work envisaged under the contract written record was made detailing the extra work and financial approval sought for the subst antial extra expenditure thereby laying the airport open to possible civil claim for breach of contract by the contractor in the event that its invoice had t been settled 76 the person who is primarily responsible for thi s was airport engineer 2 however as the peap official and airport representative pre sent when the work was identified and marked out the peap official should have taken steps to ensure that the work was appropriately documented and auth orised other issues 77 doti official 2 was asked in interview on what basis vendor 1 were chosen to do the work heshe replied for the first one i am unclear for the other thr ee the work was carried out by vendor 1 due to them being on site and the urgency of the repairs i was not of the view that vendor 1 was selected as result of any favouritism they were good at their job we had looked at them for the apron and they were professional company they were doing major road works in kosovo and they had all the machinery and engineers for th work all these were minor works 78 this suggests that vendor 1 was chosen based up on the fact that they were on site at the relevant time and had carried out satis factory work previously vi conclusions 79 there does not appear to have been any delibera fraud in the series of single source contracts for the repairs to the runway tax iway and parking areas 80 competitive tender procedures were not observed and capital expenditure approval appears to have been obtained for the expe nditures other than by written authorisation of emergency and single sourc repair contracts 81 evidence indicates that the runway taxiway and parking area repair problems were known to exist and brought up repeatedly at etings with the exception of the repairs to parking area echo it is therefore d ifficult to argue that the repairs could not have reasonably been foreseen as resul t the requirements of article 31 of the unmik finance administrative instruction 19992 for emergency procurement by means of single source contract were not fulfilled 13 82 with better forward planning the series of gle source contracts could have been avoided either by having individual competitiv tenders for individual contracts or by organising competitive tender fo r repair work over set period of time 83 vendor 1 appears to have been selected to under take the contracts without any proper selection procedure based upon previous wor k it had carried out and the fact that it had equipment on site at the airport 84 the contract for the resurfacing of parking are echo became an emergency due to the failure of vendor 2 to fulfil its contractua l obligations as result formal tender procedures do not appear to have been follow ed in selecting vendor 1 to carry out the work or in obtaining capital expendit ure approval evidence however suggests that the offer received from vendor 1 to c arry out the work did not add substantial costs to the budget 85 whilst it is accepted that the emergency repair s to taxiway delta were authorised as single source procurement the circumstances g iving rise to the work do not fall within the requirements of article 31 of the u nmik finance administrative instruction 19992 since they were already known ab out and could have formed part of competitive tender for repairs to be carr ied out over given period 86 the single source contract for antikerosene tr eatment for the echo parking area appears to have been resulted from management err or in not having the treatment carried out in conjunction with repair to the echo parking area as previously indicated with better forward planning single source contract could have been avoided if an international competitive t ender had been held at an early stage to select company to carry out repair s to the airport runway taxiways and parking areas over specified period of time 87 whilst it is noted that the repair work to taxi way charlie was necessary to keep the airport open and was small low value job on its own it could again have been combined with other jobs and been the subject of tender given that it came only two months after the previous single sour ce contract and within days of the next repair to golf area and the runway bomb damage 88 having regard to the time span between the init ial proposal for the work to carry out repairs to the golf area and the runway bomb da mage in june 2001 and the date on which the work was eventually carried out i n april 2002 this work should have been the subject of competitive tender eithe r in combination with the repairs to be carried out on the passenger terminal apron which took place one month later in may 2002 or as part of an internati onal competitive tender to select company to carry out repairs to the airpor t runway taxiways and parking areas over specified period of time 89 the contract for the repairs to the main passen ger terminal apron ended up costing 51942 against budgeted 3517 90 the extent of the repair work carried out on th passenger terminal apron was not in accordance with the value or extent of activ ities envisaged under the 14 contract written record was made detailing the extra work and financial approval sought for the substantial extra expenditu re thereby laying the airport open to civil claim for breach of contract by the contractor 91 the person who is primarily responsible for thi s was airport engineer 2 however as the peap official and airport representative pre sent when the work was identified and marked out the peap official should also have taken steps to ensure that the work was appropriately documented nd authorised vii recommendations 92 it is recommended that where runway taxiway an d parking area repair problems are known to exist dpko and individual peacekeepin g mission management personnel should ensure that an international comp etitive tender be held at an early stage of mission in order
