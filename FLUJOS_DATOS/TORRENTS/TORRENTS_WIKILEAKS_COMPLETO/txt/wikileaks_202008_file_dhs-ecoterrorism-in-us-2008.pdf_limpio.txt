unclassified for offi cial use only 1 unclassified for official use onl 07 may 2008 universal adversary dynamic threat asses sment ecoterrorism environmental and animal rights militants in the united states executive summary the term ecological terrorists1 or ecoterrorists refers to those individuals who independently ando r in concert with others engage in acts of violence and employ tactics commonly associated with terrorism to further their sociopolitical agenda aimed at ani mal and or environmental protection the ecoterrorist movement is highly decentralized transnatio nal network bound and driven by common ideological cons tructs that provide philosophical and moral justification for acts of violence against wh at it perceives to be the destructive encroachment of modern society on the planets habi tat and its living orga nisms2 the ecoterrorist movement represents the fringe element of the broader ecological and animal rights community that argues that the traditional methods of conserving and preserving the earth are insufficient and is willing to use violence as the pr incip method of the planets defense against anyone guilty of exploiting and destroying the arth ufouo the overall strength of the movement is impossible to determine given that individuals who take part in ecoterrorist activities generally lack common profile and exercise high level of operational security nonetheless ecoterrorists are known to have global presence and are particularly active in the industrialized west north america and western europe in the continental united states conus militant ecological and animal rights activists are geographical ly dispersed and operate in both urban and rural sett ings the movement has demonstrated great deal of tactical and strategic sophistication ecoterrorists have shown high level of ingenuity through their ability to weaponize com mon objects and use them to perpetrate acts of economic sabotage and terror wit h virtual impunity ecoterrorist s have also proven to be particularly dept at using media and the internet for both propagan da purposes and to disseminate vital training technic and targeting materials ufouo from security standpoint the activities of the coterrorist movement are significant for several reasons and should be of interest to domest ic security and law enforcement officials first ecoterrorists have perpetrated more illegal acts commonly associated with terrorism on us soil than any other known group including alqaeda and radical islamic militants at present the economic cost of these acts exceeds 100 million and is likely to grow in the future in addition while ecoterrorists thus far have generally refrained from harming individuals there are indications that some within the movement are advocating more drastic measures to further their sociop olitical agenda s finally if ecoterrorists choose to target nuclear or chemical facilities in the united states as some reports suggest the ramifications of such attacks could have devastatin g consequences for the general public and us national securi ty ufouo composition the ecoterrorist movement in the united states is n elusive and highly decentralized collection of individuals and groups operating on t he fringes of the mainstream environmental and animal rights community it is comprised of li keminded individuals committed to environmental and animal protection by any means ne cessary including tactics commonly associated with terrorism although they all believ that the planet is facing impending unclassified for offi cial use only 2 unclassified for official use onl environmental catastrophe the principal forc uniting heterogeneous and geographically dispersed radical environmental and animal rights activists is willingness to engage in illegal and often violent activities in what they perceive to be defensive struggle against the destructive and exploit ative nature of profit driven society ufouo number of extreme environmental and animal rights organizations operat in the united states among those the following are known to be or suspected of being involved in activities commonly associated wit h ecoterrorism animal liberation front alf earth liberation front elf stop hu ntingdon animal cruelty shac arissa3 animal rights militia band of mercy animal liberation brigade vegan dumpster militia sea shepherd conservation society direct ac tion front ufouo alf and its sister organization elf are considered to be the most active the most dangerous and the largest domestic terrorist group s in the united states4 therefore this dynamic threat assessment dta largely focuses on what is known about these two organizations and addresses all other individuals ndor groups involved in ecoterrorism only when pertinent moreover this dta focuses primaril on ecoterrorist activities in the united states ufouo alf created in england in 1976 as an outgrowth of mainstream environmentalist organizations such as greenpeace nd the sea shepherds conservation society is predominantly co ncerned with animal rights issues5 the organization migrated to the united states in the 1980s and is acti ve in more than twenty countries6 in 2001 alfs strength in the us was estimated at approxi mately one hundred hard core members7 ufouo elf was founded in the early 1990s in england and l ike alf later migrated to the united states also like alf elf emerged as derivative of another environmentalist organization earth first ef which had abandoned its illegal and violent ctivities by 1992 and become more mainstream the first known elf act ivity occurred in 1996 when members set fire to uni ted states forest service truck in oregon8 the group has since perpetrated major attacks across the united states ufouo figure 1 one of the numerous logos used by alf figure 2 original elf logo by awest santa cruz ca unclassified for offi cial use only 3 unclassified for official use onl arissa and stop huntingdon animal cruelty shac are two splinter groups that evolved from elf and alf respectively arissa founded in 2003 by two former elf spokesmen is militant faction of elf that advocates more radical tactics including assassination of individuals and entities deemed threatening to the environment shac an alf splinter group was founded in 2000 and i s spearheading campaign of economic terror against the huntingdon life society hls pharmaceutical company that engages in animal drug testing and other corporations involved in similar activities ufouo the information available in open source material precludes accurate estimates of the number of individuals andor groups who participate in or advocate acts of ecoterrorism the principal impediment to assessing the composition f the ecoterrorist movement and its strength is that individuals are not required to join groups engaged in ecomilitant activities groups such as elf and alf are not composed of memb ers in the traditional sense rather individuals willing to engage in illegal acts including violen ce to protect animal and earth rights are considered to belong to the movement by the vir tue of their actions ufouo despite the lack of uniform ecoterrorist profile one can make certain observations about individuals involved in ecomilitant activities peo ple who tend to be attract ed to ecoterrorist activities are usually under the age of twenty five are from industrialized western nations and support animal rights and environmental causes but have nonetheless become disenfranchised with what they perceive to be the lack of progr ess among mainstream groups9 it appears that the majority of ecoterrorists tend t be caucasian middle or upper middle class individuals ufouo ideology the ecoterrorist movement does not have clearly rticulated singular ideological platform rather individuals who engage in illegal and violent activities in the name of environmentalism and animal protectionism are motivated by several verlapping and complementary philosophies designed to protect the environment an d animals from perceived peril ufouo the dominant idea behind the ecoterrorist movement is biocentrism more commonly known as deep ecology hereafter the two terms are used interchangeably the central premise of this philosophy rests on biospheric egalitarianism belief tha t all forms of life in the universe are equally valuable and have right to l ive and flourish10 deep ecology asserts that human s are merely one strain in web of life and as ch are more valuable than any other living organism on the planet earth not only does this philosophy stress equality among species but it also advocates the need for t he human race to adopt more active and critical view of its role in the overall ecosphere according to proponents of deep ecology humans need to start xperiencing themselves as part of the living eart h and find their role in protecting the planet in this approach th relationship is more of an involved participant who feels connected with and part of t he world around them11 ufouo similarly individuals who engage in violence in the name of animal liberation invoke t he principals of speciesism an ideological construct that differenti ates between humans and animals but does not adhere to the supremacy of the former followers of this ideology generally embrace the same ideological tenets outlined by biocentrism however they place particular emphasis on the need for humans to radically alter their approach toward animals radical animal liberation activists reject any notion that would place animals in subordinate role to figure 3 arissas logo clearly depicts the organizations revolutionary nature and nationwide ambition unclassified for offi cial use only 4 unclassified for official use onl humans and charge that modern western civilization is lawfully subjugating and exploiting animals they do not believe that humans should keep anima ls as pets consume andor exploit them for food or use any animal prod ucts in their daily lives12 rather radical animal rights activists advocate that animals should be accorded the same rights as humans this is clearly visible in dr steven bests13 2004 work terrorists or freedom fighters reflections on the liberation of animals when he declares that animals have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness all of which contradicts the property status that is often literally burnt into their flesh 14 ufouo perhaps the most extreme ecoterrorist ideolog is anarcho primitivism philosophy that seeks return to primitive societies based on hu ntergatherer way of life15 proponents of this view embrace individual freedom in the context of free communities living in harmony with each other and the biosp here16 according to anarcho primitivism for the symbiosis between humans and their environment to take place earths natural equilibrium needs to be restored through the systematic deindustrializat ion of modern civilization hence return to primitive society would lead to revolutionary changes that wo uld abolish the existing social and economic stratification of society and pave the way for the coexistence of all living organisms in harmony with nature ufouo all of these beliefs stand in direct contrast to the notion of individualism as promoted by western culture ecoterrorists argue that the concept of self has enabled the human race to disregard the degradation of the earths habitat and that western sociopolitical and economic concepts of c ivilization modernity and capitalism are exploitative in nature and have altered the equilibrium among species in pursuit of fiscal benefit therefore they need to be countered through direct action the concept of direct acti on as ecoterrorists prac tice it is euphemism for illegal and violent activities designed to halt the destruction of the environment and liberate animals17 it is precisely this willingness to engage in ille gal acts to further their sociopolitical aims that separate s ecoterroris ts from mainstream environmentalists and animal protectionists ufouo ecoterrorists consider themselves to be freedom fighters engaged in defensive conflict against the damaging encroachment of capitalist societies whose sole concern is profit regard less of any social or ecological costs or consequen ce18 they believe they are the voice of the voiceless and the defenders of the defense less extreme environmental and animal rights activists do not consider themselves to be t errorists rather they b elieve it is the anthropocentric19 nature of modern societies that allows the wholesa destruction of the environment for as paul watson the founder of the environmental organization sea shepherd conservation society asserts there are indeed eco terror ists exxon committed eco terrorism in alaska union carbide committed acts of eco terrorism at bhopal india the forest industries commit eco terrorism each day these corporations will not be found on any federal list of terrorist organizations becau they have money and money calls the shots in what mark twain once described as the parliamen t of whores in washington dc the wholesale destruction of our oceans and forests and the incredible assault on biodiversity is terrorism of the highest orde rterrorism that is accepted by anthropocentric culture as normal20 ufouo figure 4 one of many elf propaganda posters denouncing the damaging effects of capitalism on the environment unclassified for offi cial use only 5 unclassified for official use onl jeffrey luers an elf activist currently serving twenty twoyear sentence for acts of economic terrorism and sabotage perhaps articulated the movements ideological mind set best when he declared that radical environmentalists and animal protectionists have n choice but to fight literally fight in the physic sense of the word there is too much at stake for us to b tame in our struggles21 ufouo in sum ecoterroris ts adhere to utopian ideological construct that borrows from and merges together several compl ementary philosophies and are dedicated to the ideal of all living beings plants animals even cosystems as whole living together without being commod ified as resources or used oppressed or destroyed for econo mic reasons 22 ecoterrorists contend that the us led western capitalist system represents the single mos t important threat to the global environment and are willing to oppose it by any means ne cessary ufouo objectives and strat egy the overarching objective of the ecoterrorist movem ent is to change the prevailing social attitudes about the environment and establish biospheric equality among all species this new form of biospheric egalitaria nism as promoted by radical environmentalist and nimal rights activists not only would fundamentally alte r the nature of social norms regarding the planets habitat and its living organisms but ulti mately would lead to new system of governance and so cial relationships that is anarchist and antisystem ic in nature23 in practice this would mean return to quasi preindustrial society and the abolishment of all forms of economic social and political structures as defined by modern civilization ufouo the movement does not have comprehensive strategy to achieve this aim however rather groups such as elf and alf define their goals in mo re modest but consistent terms elf states that its primary objectives are to inflict economic damage on t hose profiting from the destruction and exploitatio n of the natural environment to reveal and educate the public on the atrocities committed against the earth and all species that populate it to take all necessary precautions against harming ny animal human and nonhuman24 ufouo as sister organization alf objectives closely mic those of elf but place particular focus on the plight of animals as such alf seeks to liberate animals from places of abuse eg laboratories factory farms fur fa rms etc and place them in good homes where they may live ut their natural lives free from suffering to inflict economic damage on those who profit from the misery and exploitation of animals to reveal the horror and atrocities committed against anima ls behind locked doors by performing nonviolent direct actions and liberat ions to take all necessary precautions against harming any animal whether human or nonhuman figure 5 this alf logo clearly depicts an emphasis on actions unclassified for offi cial use only 6 unclassified for official use onl to analyze the ramifications of all proposed action s and never apply generalizations when specific information is available25 ufouo on the other hand arissa an elf splinter group rgues that the goals of single issue organizations such as elf and alf are shortsighted and will never bring about the necessary changes the primary goal f arissa is to create social and political revolut ion in the united states26 ufouo to meet their stated objectives radical environmen tal and animal rights activists use direct action euphemism for an organized campaign of i llegal and violent ac tivities designed to inflict monetary damages on entities and individual s engaged in practices deemed detrimental to the environment and animals27 through prolonged campaign of economic sabotage and intimidation ecoterrorists hope to drive up the co sts of environmental and animal exploitation although ecoterrorist direct action campaigns oft use violence elf and alf in particular pride themselves on taking extraordinar measures to avoid any physical harm to humans and insist that their activist s act accordingly28 ufouo some individuals in radical environmental and anima lrights circles however believe that the current strategy of direct action as practiced by the majority of ecomilitants is inherently flawed and champion more radical mea sures they point out that many companies engaged in animal research or urban development have insura nce policies in place against such attacks thereby becoming largely immune to punitiv financial measures moreover certain individuals mainly within th militant animal rights community also argue that the policy of physical harm should be reconsidered and in some cases supplanted by more radical measures for example dr jerry vlasik passiona animal rights advocate and the current alf pres s officer was quoted as saying at the 2003 animal rights conference in california if vivisectors were routinely being killed i think it would give other vivisectors pause in what they were doing in their work 29 similar reference to escalating the us of violence was echoed in 2002 when an anonymous ecoterrorist c laimed that the movement will longer hesitate to pick up the gun to implement jus tice and provide the needed protection for our planet30 ufouo whatever the shortcomings of ecoterror ist direct action strategy may be the calculated nd systematic use of violence is also designed to brin g publicity to issues related to the politics of nature that otherwise would remain marginal and for eign to the public at large for elf and like minde d groups publicity is key part of their agenda and can be seen as the oxygen of the movement31 ufouo in the final analysis extreme environmental and animal rights activists feel that the legal means of affecting change have been exhausted and have opted for strategy of violent and highly visible attacks as means of forcing publi c debate on issues pertinent to the environment and animals32 through the use of illegal and violent measures coterrorists seek the publicity needed to force the public to actively tackle what they perceive to be an impending environmental catastrophe ufouo target selection broadly speaking ecoterrorists target anyone perce ived to be engaged in or benefiting from activities deemed detrimental to the welfa re of the environment and animals ecomilitants have systematically targeted both governmental and nongovernmental entities as well as private individuals despite the wide range of pote ntial targets ecoterrorists nonetheless apply two tier approach to their targeting selection process and differenti ate between primary and secondary targets33 ufouo unclassified for offi cial use only 7 unclassified for official use onl primary targets ecomilitants target p rimar ily those entities and individuals who in their view directly engage in exploit ing animals and desecrat ing the environment as such the most frequent targets of ecoterrorist groups such as elf and alf are 1 commercial enterprises andor individuals engaged i n housing and urban development 2 commercial enterprises andor individuals involved in the logging indust ry 3 sport utility vehicle suv dealerships 4 commercial enterprises andor individuals involved in the production sale and distribution 5 of animal products leather and fur producers sell ers and distributors restaurants and meat poultry and fish produc ers 6 animal research facilities and personnel 7 commercial enterprises and universities involved in genetic engineering 8 animal farms and nurseries 9 hunting clubs and associations 10 animal service facilities and personnel animal she lters and veterinary clinic s engaged in animal vivisection procedures ufouo ecoterrorists also consider certain federal state and local government entities to be primary targets ecoterrorists have targeted government departments and personnel associated with environmental preservation and food production such as the us forest service bureau of land management and the us department of agriculture on several occasions34 occasionally legislators and politicians perceived to be soft on environmental and animal rights protection have also come under attack by groups ch as elf and alf although attacks against government infrastructure and personnel have been less frequen t than those on nongovernmental entities this may change in the future as ecomilitants appear to become increasingly convinced that the government is all too willing to abandon environmental conservation and animal rights protection in favor of business interests ufouo secondary targets the secondary targets involve entities indirectly involved in activities detrimental to the environment species or any other aspect of the po litics of nature the guilt of secondary targets stems from their association with primary t argets companies and individuals engaged in business and financial relation ships with principal offenders become legitimate targets by default and are therefore h arassed intimidated and attacked by extreme environmentalist and animal rights activists the principal notion behind this type of targeting is to deprive primary targets of business partners in other words group s such as elf and alf are determined to intimidate those w illing to associate or do business with entities guilty of environmental andor animal expl oitation35 ufouo figure 6 shac sponsored protest outside congressional hearing on ecoterrorism depicts ecomilitant views on the governments impact on the environment unclassified for offi cial use only 8 unclassified for official use onl perfect example of secondary target is wachovia one of the largest banking and financial institutions in the united states in 2007 alf and shac activists repeatedly targeted wachovia bank because of its financial ties to the huntingdon life society as the second largest owner of huntingdon life society shares several wachovia branches in california were vandalized and ecoterrorists placed small incendiary device in one of the banks after hours deposit boxes36 ecoterrorist attacks against wachovia were not limited to the bank s facilities alf activists claimed responsibility for vandalizing wachovia executives vehicle in p ortland oregon37 similarly alf activists hacked the web page of lagrange capital management another investment firm and huntingdon life society shareho lder temporarily depriving three hundred mid level managers of access to the companys electronic comm unications38 in fact shac activists regularly post the names and contact information of employees from companies doing business with huntingdon life soc iety on the shac website39 while any employee may be targeted shac particularly encourages its activists to direc t attacks toward mid and high level management40 some reports suggest that at least 100 companies including security company have sever ed their business relationships with huntingdon lif society as result of being targeted by shac41 ufouo finally evidence indicates that ecoterrorist groups such as elf may intend to target nuclear facilities in the united states for example in s tatements to grand jury self proclaimed elf sympathizer declared if the bush administra tion encourages expansion of the nuclear power industry nuclear plants will be targ eted42 although targeting nuclear facilities appears to be confined to the most militant fringes of the radical environmentali st movement and does not appear to be on the movement s standard targeting list it should not be dismissed completely after all in 1989 fe deral authorities broke up one radical environmental group an d charged its members with conspiring to attack nuc lear power plants in three states arizona california and co lorado43 ufouo internal structures and organizational d ynamics the ecoterrorist movement operates as sophisticat ed and highly decentrali zed network it has overarching hierarchical structure nor does it have an elaborate organizational infrastructure rather the movement embraces the c oncept of leaderless resistance an organizational model that has uniform authority or centralized control and command structure44 shared ideology and willingness to engage in ill egal and violent activities in pursuit of environmental and animal protectionism p rovide independent actors with structural cohesion through commonality of purpos after all any individual willing to take direct action in support of the movements overall aimto counter environmental and animal exploitation is automatically considered to be part of the movem ent45 ufouo organizational dynamics are barely present and to great extent activists operate underground personal contacts may play into organi zational dynamics to the extent that individual cells or activists exchange information with each other however in the vast majority of cases individuals involved in acts of ecoterrorism are not in contact with other individuals or cells engaged in similar activities although au tonomous cells and individuals are known to take guidance from internet materials which pro vide the parameters and often instructions for an action they tend to execute their activities in dependently of one another figure 7 shac activists protest i n front of glaxosmithkline company with extensive business ties to the huntingdon life society unclassified for offi cial use only 9 unclassified for official use onl and the movement at large yet they are consistent with the overarching slogan think global act local46 ufouo external relationshi ps and interorganiza tional ties external relationships and interorganizational ties are dif ficult to assess because the groups that constitute the ecoterrorist movement have high ly decentralized structures and do not require conventional membership yet it is clear t hat there is some degree of interaction between various ecomilitant groups andor individua ls after all elf and alf are considered to be sister organizations and the newer more radi cal groups such as arissa and shac are their respective derivatives the following radical environ mental and animal rights groups share some ideological tenets and operational aims however the precise nature of their ties remains unclear elf alf arissa stop huntingdon animal cruelty shac sea shepherd conservation society animal rights militia animal liberation brigade direct action front band of mercy ufouo in addition various groups that constitute the eco terrorist movement are also believed to interact to one degree or another with mainstream environmental and animal rights organizati ons andor individuals although none of the mainst ream organizations officially endorses or participates in the illegal and violent activities championed by ecomilitants some prominent members of mainstream groups are known to sympathize with the ecoterr orist movement mainstream organizations with known or po ssible links to ecoterrorism include the following greens people for the ethical treatment of animals peta the sierra club national wildlife federation audubon society humane society of the united states hsus friends of the earth greenpeace earth first47 coalition to save the preserve csp environmental task force the frogs in defense of animals new jersey animal rights alliance fund for ani mals ufouo among the highlighted organizations peta the fund for ani mals in defense of animals the new jersey animal rights alliance and certain individuals within the hsus are known or suspected of having financial ties to individual s and groups associated with ecoterrorism48 in addition to financi ties to ecomilitancy both hsus and peta or at least individuals within those organizations have an established rec ord of supporting individuals andor groups commonly associated with ecoterrorism david martosk director of research for the unclassified for offi cial use only 10 unclassified for official use onl center f or consumer freedom in his testimony before the u s senate committee on the environment and public works in 2005 gives examples of hsuss links to ecomilitants49 according to martosko miyun park an hsus employee listed as benefactor has been named in at least six federal wiretap warrants in connection with federal animal enterprise terrorism trial martosko claims that t hese warrants also include university of texas at paso utep professor ste ven best peta grantee and terror defendant at the time joshua harper convicted ecoterrorist and peta employee joe haptas martosko further claimed that daniel andreas san diego wanted by federal authorities for involvement in the detonation of tenpound shrapnel bombs in 2003 at two california biome dical research companie s also had links had to the hsus according to martosko n fbi evidence recovery log from the search of san diegos automobile describes check written to him by aria na m huemer an employee of hsus at the time martosko recounts the story of john paul jp goodwin to illustrate another tie between the hsus and violent animal rights activists in 1997 when goodwin was the national director of the coalition to abolish the fur trade he wrote in compromise that he and his grou p support these alf actions 100 we will never ever ever work with anyone who helps the fbi stop the alf this is one of the best things to happen in long time50 in march 1997 after the alf arson of fur farmers feed co op in utah that result ed in 1 million in damages goodwin told reporters were ecstatic in 2000 the hsus sent goodwin as its emissary on tour of chinese fur farms by 2001 he was an hsus employee and remains on the hsus s fulltime staff ufouo martoskos testimony also goes into great detail about petas links to alf elf and other groups some of which are clearly ecoterrorists and others are ideologically connected but not clearly involved in violence51 publicly peta has consistently claimed to have informat ion about the identity of any alf activists yet at least twice peta has published interviews with self described alf members in its own newsletter early in its history this newsletter included full page advertisement promoting the alf as rescue organization also in this newsletter peta advertised ingrid newkirks52 first book free the animals as an intimate look at the alf and wrote that ne wkirk speaks for the animal liberation front in 2001 peta campaign director bruce friedrich told an animal rights convention audience that blowing stuff up and smashing window s is great way to bring about animal liberation hallelujah to the people who are willing to do it the current crop of alf spokespersons who now call themselves press officer s includes new jersey activist named angi metler w hom peta news once described as peta spokesperson another self appointed alf press officer is dr jerry vlasak in 2003 while acting as spokesperson for the peta affiliated physicians committ ee for responsible medicine pcrm vlasak openly endorsed the murder of doctors who use animals in their medical research for 5 lives 10 lives 15 human lives he told an animal rights convention we could save million 2 mill ion 10 million nonhuman lives when an audience member objected compa ring his strategy to that of violent criminals who bomb abortion clinics vlasak responded absolutely i think they had great strategy going in 2001 the pcrm engaged in letter writing campaign wit h the president of another terrorist threat group called stop huntingd on animal cruelty shac the letters were designed to threaten and intimidate co mpanies targeted by shac for their business dealings with biomedical research firm that uses animal testing unclassified for offi cial use only 11 unclassified for official use onl models in addition to both veiled and overt threats of dea th and bodily harm shacs tactics have included car bombings identity theft physical assault and interstate stalking shacs current us president is pamelyn ferdin who is married to vlasak ferdin carries pcrm business card ufouo beyond the highlighted mainstream organizations ec oterrorists are believed to have tentative links to the ruckus society an organization that provides environmental human rights and social justice org anizers with the comprehensive training and tools n eeded to achieve their aims some individuals involved in ec omilitant activities are suspected of attending ruckus society sponsored direct action training sessions moreover the f ounder of ruckus society mike roselle was high ranking member of earth first when this organization was involved in direct action activiti and is known to harbor sympathies toward the ecoterrorist movement ufouo geographic location and strength the ecoterrorist netw ork draws on individuals and cells from around the world despite their global presence individuals and groups involved in acts of terrorism appear to be most prevalent in north america and western europe the centers of industrialization and globalizatio n in europe the united kingdom germany france italy and the netherlands are known to host the largest number of individuals and groups commonly associated with ecoterrorist activities ufouo in terms of their geographical disposition in the uni ted states extreme environmental and animal rights activists operate both rural and urban settings around the country they are particularly active in the western and west coast states 53 in particular s tates such as oregon california and washington have wellestablished record of ecoterrorist activities and are known to host individuals and groups that both advocate and participate in such activities although the midwest and east coast have smaller percentage of eco terrorist incidents neither area is immune to nor free from ecoter rorism ufouo the strength of the ecoterrorism movement is virtua lly impossible to estimate its structural fluidity and stringent security measures have made ecoterrorism virtually impenetrable to law enforcement inf iltration thereby precluding comprehensive underst anding of the movements strength an additional obstacle in asse ssing the strength of ecoterrorists is that groups such as alf and elf frequently overlap in ac tivists furthermore not all ecoterrorists are connected to known activist groups some are kno wn to operate entirely independently or may be dormant until something triggers their activ ity nonetheless the number of activists brazen enough to commit arson and serious vandalism is believed to be quite small54 in 2001 it was estimated that alf had approximate ly one hundred hardcore members55 figures are available for groups such as elf shac and arissa ufouo perhaps the more constructive way to gauge the curr ent and future strength of coterrorists is not to think in terms of actual numbers but as growing trend the general perception that the planet is in peril and the reluctance or even refusal of some parts of the us figure 8 this map depicts the type and geogr aphical location of various ecoterrorist activities from 1996 to 2004 source oconnor t httpwwwapsu eduoconnort imagesmaps elfmapjpg unclassified for offi cial use only 12 unclassified for

generally concerned with the welfare of the environ ment may become increasingly tempted to abandon traditional methods of environmental servation and animal protection nonviolent acts of political opposition consistent with legal democratic principles and embrace militant tactics as viable alternative to air their concerns and grievances ufouo tactics and operation s ecoterrorists tactics and operations vary in scope and sophistication according to the level of expertise and determination of the individual or cell nonetheless individuals and groups engaged in acts commonly associated with ecoterrori sm do follow certain tactical an d operational patterns ecoterrorists carefully plan and train for individu and small unit attacks and primarily conduct operations against wsecurity targets 56 john lewis the fbis deputy assistant director for the counterterr orism d ivision noted the high degree of tactical and operational planning in his 2004 testi mony to the senate judiciary committee stating that elf and alf activists are believed to engage in significant intelligence gathering against potential targets including the review of industrytrade publications and other open source information photographicvideo surveillance of potential targets obtaining proprietary or confidential information about intended victim comp anies through theft or from sympathetic insiders and postin g details about potential targets on the internet f or other extremists to use as they see fit 57 ufouo elf alf and similar groups conduct operations mainly against the logging industry genetic engineering ge industry housing develope rs automobil dealerships the energy sector research laboratories food processors and retailer s and other entities perceived to be involved in the exploitation of the environment and animals58 ufouo the principal tactic used by ecoterrorists is dire ct action form of political activism that seeks immediate remedy for perceived ills and whose work can be divided into legal and illegal activities59 legal activities are usually confined to letter wr iting and call in protests and public demonstrations illegal activities range from less menacing acts of civil disobedience to more violent activities such as ars on however the term direct action as used by the extreme environmental and animal rights activists has become euphemism for illegal and often violen t activities ufouo typical ecoterrorist operations can be divided into two broad categories 1 activities aimed at causing property damage and 2 activities aime d at intimidation in both cases militant environmental and animal rights activists u the following tactics when conducting operations against their targets ufouo monkey wrenching monkey wrenching euphemism for acts of sabotage and vandalism is among the most common tactics used by extreme environmental and animal rights act ivists initially it was perceived to be prankish in nature and revolved around activi ties such as gluing locks po uring blocking agents into sewage lines tree spikin g and changing or damaging padlocks60 however it has significantly evolved and elf f and like minded organizations have used it to demonstrate the vulnerability of compan ies or government department s ufouo figure 9 caricature of monkey wrencher wellknown symbol of the movement unclassified for offi cial use only 13 unclassified

employees61 often during raids animals are released and documentation is ruined destroying years of scientific study in the majority of laboratory raids an insider was suspected of aiding the infiltrators62 activists also have obtained jobs in targeted companies to expose mistreatment of animals63 ufouo hoaxes ecoterrorists use hoaxes with considerable success threat results in the expected targets devoting time and effort to ensure its curity bomb threat can close biological laboratory empty an academic building or delay real estate development at cost to alf elf or likeminded consortium false alarms dull the analytical and operational efficiency of key security personn thus degrading readiness ufouo assaults and blackmail assaults can range from throwing pie in someones face to mailing envelopes containing razor blades coated in rat poison which in fact we re sent to more than eighty people in the united stat and canada in 1999 by ecomilitants 64 stalking harassment threat s and blackmail against those as well as their loved ones and property deemed guilty of harming animals and exploiting the environment are common ecoterrorist tactic s these tactics are designed to coerce concessions or provide support f or the movements activities and goals targets include government officials corporate officers or employees and community leaders65 ufouo arsonfirebombing arson and firebombing are frequent tact ics used by militant environmental and animal rights activists particularly elf there is an abundance of arson related material available to potential militants both in print and online these how to manuals cover vast array of fire starting components and methods such as instructions for constructing igniters and other incendiary compounds including form of napalm and crude improvised explosive devices ieds ieds can be inexpensive to produce and because of the various detonation techniques avai lable may result in low risk to the perpetrator other advantages of ieds include their ability to g enerate publicity and to control casualties through timed detonation and c areful placement of the device66 while the use of molotov

radicalization and r ecruitment the principal motivating factor behind th ecoterrorist movement is the perception that contemporary society does not take the underlying i ssues concerning the environment and animals seriously not only is society largely ambi valent toward the impending environmental catastrophe ecoterrorists c harge but mainstream environmentalist and animal rights groups whose principal purpose is to tackle these i ssues are unable or unwilling to take adequate measures to ensure environmental and anima l protection the fact that the primary motivating factor behind the ecoterrorist movement is the failure to effect social and political change through mainstream means is clearly visible in an anonymous communiqué posted on the internet following an arson incident at the us forest service northeast research station in 2002 unclassified for offi cial use only 24 unclassified for official use onl in pursuance of justice freedom and equal conside ration for all innocent life across the board segments of this gl obal revolutionary movement are longer limiting their revolutionary potential by adhering to flawed inconsistent nviolent ideology while innocent life will never be harmed in any action we undertake where it is necessary we will longer hesitate t pick up the gun to implement justice and provide the needed protec tion for our planet that decades of legal batt pleading protest and economic sabotage have failed so drastically to achieve72 ufouo similar sign of increasing radicalization within the ranks of the environmentalist and animal rights community was echoed by ingrid newkirk fo rmer marylan d police officer turned cofounder and president of the animal rights organization people for the ethical treatment of animals peta when she asked rhetorically perhaps the alf exi sts because of complacency after all if peaceful dialogue wor ked there would be nothing for the alf to do it would not have job so when hundred year s or more of writing polite letters fails to effect vital change should we condemn those who ar compelled to try something stronger or condemn those who refused to change 73 ufouo although media reports and propaganda are used to ttract the attention of potential recruits most ecoterrorists are self recruited as result of preexisting interest in or commitment to one or of the movements multiple pri nciples the int ernet in particular is potent tool in the extreme environmental and animal rights recruitment arsenal because it offers an abundance of information ranging from ec oterrorist ideology and strategic aspirations to tactical and operational methods t only is the internet an effective facilitator for the proliferation of ecoterrorist material but it also serves as excellent platform for like minded individuals to develop contacts and exchange information ufouo it is believed that extreme environmen tal and animal rights activists are also recruited through universities some analysts aptly point out that certain academics routinely incorporate the politics of nature in their curricu lum and assign material that encourages or at the very least justif ies environmentalist and animal rights extremism thereby introducing their students to the world of environmental milita ncy the primary example of this is dr steven best passionate animal rights advocate and activist and the former chairm an of the p hilosophy department at the university of texas paso not only is best known to assign material that some may consider inflammatory and inappropriate for university setting but he has also sponsored animal liberatio n awareness day events at the unive rsity for number of years which are heavily advertised by alf and are known to attract environmental and animal rights militants74 arguably the greatest contribution of academics such as best to the ecoterrorist movement is their willingness and desire to legitimize ecomilitancy in the eyes of the youth on moral grou nds thereby making institutions of higher education potential ecoterrorist breeding gr ounds ufouo perhaps the most important recruitment tool is the movements ability to provide lone activists with sense of belonging ideological an d organizational fluidity of ecoterrorist groups such as alf or elf enables individuals conce rned with the politics of nature to feel part of broader movement thereby legitimizing th eir personal concern s and channeling their energy and activities through an institutiona l framework however loose this structure may be this is clearly visible in statement by rodney co ronado seasoned environmental activist and convicted ecoterrorist when he declar ed that young disempowered person who may feel alone fighting urban sprawl in their c ommunity now can do so under elf75 ufouo unclassified for offi cial use only 25 unclassified for official use onl training while extreme environmental and animal rights activists generally do not undergo any type of formal training myriad training materials are readily available in the uni ted states printed materials offering detailed instructions on how to destroy billboards sabotage heavy equipment climb and unf url large banners clog waste and sewage pipes deliver waste produ cts and dead animals to corporate offices and conduct othe r sorts of direct action techniques can be found in books such as the monkey wrench gang ecodefense field guide to monkeywrenching the black cat sabotage handbook earth first direct action ma nual the alf primer earthforce an earth warriors guide to strategy ufouo similar literature is available and easily accessib online76 most common among online publications are arson around with aunty alf your guide to putting heat on animal abusers everywhere setting fires with electrical timers an earth libe ration front guide memories of freedom declaration of war killing people to save animal s and the environment77 search destroy tactical guide for intelligence gathering the final n ail destroying the fur industry guided tour earth tool kit field manual for citizen activist s ufouo online sources also offer variety of additional i nformation pertinent to the lifestyle of an ecomilitant such as going underground and dealing with grand jury78 this type of information is available on websites sympathetic or directly linked to the ecoterrorist movement such as compromise magazine wwwnocompromiseorg bite back magazine wwwdirectactioncom alf website wwwanimalliberationcom ufouo finally potential activists can also find training information commonly associated with ecoterrorist activities on general purpose websites such as wwwyoutubecom and wwwfacebookcom ufouo figure 14 this book is one of several instructional manuals on sabotage techniques available in print to ecomilitants unclassified for offi cial use only 26 unclassified for official use onl on occasions when activists come together there ar opportunities for sharing skills and information venues such as the national conference on organized resistance and the annual animal rights conference as well as local environmental and animal rights gatherings most notable among them liberation now offer venues f or activists to exchange personal experiences at one such gathering at american university in washington dc convicted ecoterrorist ron coronado demonstrated before an audience of more than hundred college age activists how to build crude incendiary device using household materials for cost of about 279 it is also likely that some individuals have received training from the ruckus society which sp ecializes in teaching direct action techniques most of the actions ecoterrorists carry out are rel atively easy and inexpensive yet difficult to defend against ufouo logistics individuals and cells engaged in acts of ecoterrori sm are generally self sufficient in terms of logistics operations are generally carried out eit her by individuals or smal l localized cells precluding the need for elaborate support in addit ion most operations use inexpensive readily available materials the internet serves as the main vehicle for transfer of ideological technical and operational information the only l ogistical support ecoterrorists are believed to receive is financial however limited it may be ufouo weapon acquisition as previously noted how to ecoterrorist field manuals are available on many websites books containing detailed guidance on turning common materials into weapons and are found in many bookstores direct action operations general ly rely on objects that are easy to obtain transport and modify arson and incendiary devices do not require unusual or difficult to obtain materials n onetheless few animal rights extremists and eco terrorists have been known to possess firearms for example members of the family group of ecoterrorists responsible for nearly twenty acts of economic sabotage in multiple states had small weapo ns cache in the pacific northwest ufouo communications the internet and electronic communications are the lifeblood of this movement information on tactics techniques and targets is readily avai

most important among them is ecodefense field guide to monkey wrenching an instruction manual on sabotage and other dire ct action techniques regularly practiced by ecoterrorists in 1989 federal

disobedience both legal and illegal roselle was so successful in his endeavors that he rapidly rose through greenpeace ranks to become member of the organizations board of directors he is also viewed as the driving force behind the ruckus society an organization that provides environmental human rig hts and social justice organizers with the comprehensive training and tools needed to achi eve their goals ufouo miscellaneous data na culture members of the ecoterrorist movement see themselves in spiritual relationship with the earth and other living things115 the more extreme activists believe that humans hav desecrated the planets habitat and that direct vi olent action is necessary to halt this destruction the activists exhibit strong nonconformist streak that can be interpre ted as belligerent antisocial antiestablishment trend individual initiative is applauded and encouraged partly to avoid dete ction by law enforcement ufouo threat to the continental unit ed states conus currently ecoterrorist movement activities do not represent serious threat to us national security although some elements in the ecomilitant community have broader re volutionary tendencies and strive to bring about conditions for the violent overthrow of the us government their ambitions remain largely unrealis tic given that their militant ideology does not have popular appeal nonetheless the acti vities of elf f and other groups and individuals involved in acts of ecoterrorism should not be disregarded and do merit the attention of security and law enforcement officials for several reasons ufouo first the nature and frequency of ecoterrorist attacks poses public safety threat to specific segments of american society and the general public at large ecomilitants have demonstrated figure 41 dave foreman figure 42 mike roselle unclassified for offi cial use only 35 unclassified for official use onl both the willingness and ability to strike vast rray of targets across the united states with virtual impunity their campai gn of violence shows signs of slowing down and i s likely to lead to an increase in monetary damages while their actions are clearly and explicitly designed to cause property damage and af fect the ability of commercial organizations to operate ecoterro rists use of violence always carries the potential for hu man death and injury federal and state authorities hav repeatedly warned that if militant ecoactivities are not stopped there will be loss of life at some point in the future116 ufouo althou gh extreme environmental and animal rights groups such as elf and alf have been adamant that their ideological and operational etiq uette strictly prohibits harming humans and that their activists have gone to extreme pains to avoid human casualties there are indications that some elements within ecomilitant c ircles favor more drastic measures influential individuals such as craig rosebraugh nd jerry vlasak have repeatedly evoked moral justification for taking lives and suggested that killings may be necessary step in the ecomilitants struggle to rescue the environment an d animals from decadent and unyielding business interests whose actions are leading toward an environmental catastrophe therefore the potential for more radical attacks aimed speci fically at taking lives should not be excluded ufouo an additional point of concern is the potential for ecomilitants to attack nuclear or chemical facilities in the united states at least one group has consistently planned actions against nuclear po wer plants t he evan mecham eco terrorist international conspiracy emetic was charged with conspiring to attack nuclear power plants in three states in may 1989 key members of the group were arrested and charged with planning to attack the central ariz ona project and palo verde nuclear generating station i n arizona the diablo canyon nuclear power plant in california and the department of energy rocky flats nuclear facility in colorado several members of the group served jail sentences ranging from thirty days to six years117 other ecomilitant groups have not targeted nuclear facilities although they have conducted operations against energy facilities however according to one report elf may expand its target list to include nuclear sites thereby si gnificantly elevating the threat to homeland security118 while attacks against nuclear installations could lead to environmental disaster and therefore seem to signal fundamental contradi ction of ecomilitant aims radical environmentalists could see such disaster as short term sacrifice in pursuit of their long term goal of total abandonment of nuclear energy nuclear disaster could turn the public at large against nuclear power forcing both the government and private industry to pursue more ecofrie ndly energy sources ufouo although law enforcement authorities have recently been able to penetrate elusive ecoterrorist cells and arrest scores of activists the majority of environmental and animal rights militants still remain at large as of may 2 005 thirty five fbi field offices d more than 150 pending investigations associated with ecoterrorist activit ies ecoterrorist tactical and operational methods coupled with the structural fluidity have made the movement virtually impervious to police monitoring surveillance and infiltration efforts119 ufouo more important however the general perception tha t the planet is in peril and the reluctance or even outright refusal of some parts of the us government to acknowledge the damaging effec ts of global warming is likely to play into the han ds of extreme environmental and animal rights activists and groups120 individuals sympathetic to the ecoterrorist ideolo gy or those generally concerned with the welfare of the nvironment may become increa singly tempted or willing to abandon the customary methods of political dissent consistent with legal democratic practices and embrace ecomilitancy as viable and acceptable alternative for addressing their concerns and grievances uf ouo unclassified for offi cial use only 36 unclassified for official use onl end
