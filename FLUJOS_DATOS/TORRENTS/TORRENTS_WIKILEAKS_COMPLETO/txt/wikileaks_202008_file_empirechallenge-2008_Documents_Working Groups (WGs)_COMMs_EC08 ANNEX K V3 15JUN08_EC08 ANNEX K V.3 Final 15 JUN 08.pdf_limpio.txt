the tactical targeting network technology ttnt is the primary data transport network for the losblos initiative in empire challenge the losblos initiative uses combination of and blos ip capable radio systems to achieve ip data connectivity between airborne platforms and the ground based c2 systems there will be three ttnt capable c2 airborne platforms flying at any one time in the losbl scenarios awacse3 e2xhawk and paul revere there will also be two ground base nodes with ttnt at china lake and ttnt inmarsat relay on echo range the ttnt terminal is modular system providing et hernet connectivity between terminals it is high throughput lowlatency solution for data linking the sensortos hooter or other data linkingdigital communication needs capable of transmitting at data rates up to two megabits per second mbps and with low latency mode of two milliseconds per packet for ttnt access protocol tap messages only ttnt enab realtime communication and netcentric technologies to correlate information among multiple platforms at empire challenge 08 the e2 xhawk will use ttnt radio to participate in an airborne network and to establish ip c onnectivity between both air and ground stations it will connect applications such as jadocs to the radio in or der to send and receive th associated data and chat messaging over an internet protocol ip connection the radi can transmit over 16 frequencies across 3 bands and the xhawk inte nds to transmit over band 1 frequency which covers the uhf spectrum from 1763167 mhz 1841883 mhz the c2 platforms in losblos will operate at the cfe level while the ttnt network itself is operating at the unclass level thus ip inline encryptors are used to crypt the c2 data over the ttnt and blos systems the ttnt will be the primary path for data between platforms while the path to the ground network entry point nep may vary based on dynamic routing across the combined ttnt and blos systems proving out and studying this dynamic routing capability is one of the primary goals of the losblos initiative enclosures 1 ec08 link16 network diagram 2 ec08 ttnt network diagram 3 ec08 optask link instruction 4 ec08 aircraft special
