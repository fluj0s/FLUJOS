funds for the exportimport bank an activity that is regarded as trade promotion program rather than foreign aid in recent years funding for food aid has run somewhat higher than for the eximbank so foreign operations is slightly smaller than the official foreign aid budget nevertheless throughout this report the term s foreign operations and foreign aid are used interchangeablythe senate

department usaid or other agencies managing appropriated foreign policy appropriations when c ongress does not pass these authorization measures which was the case in the 109th congress the appropriation bills must waive authorization requirements for fo reign policy agencies and programs to continue to function4 in some cases this results in the attachment of foreign affairs authorizing provisions to foreign opera tions and state depa rtment appropriation measures adding increased importance to the appropriation bills in terms of both funding and setting policy prior ities for us foreign policyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33420crs5 5 although congress has not approved broa d comprehensive foreign aid authorization individual foreign aid components have been authorized including legislation for the millennium challenge account the presidents hivaids initiative afghanistan reconstruction assistance for the former soviet states freedom support act and eastern europe seed act microenterpris programs and the peace corpsthis has been the situation especially for foreign operations for two decades the foreign operations appropriations bill has been the principal legislative vehicle for congressional oversight of foreign ffairs and for congre ssional involvement in foreign policy making congress has not enacted comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985 leaving mo st foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations originating from the legislative oversight committees5 as result foreign operations spending m easures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded thei r scope beyond spending issues and played major role in shaping authorizing and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives it has been largely through foreign operations appropriations that the unite d states has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the cold war the legislation has also been the channel through which the president has utilized foreign aid as tool in the war on terrorism since the attacks of september 11 2001 and launched afghan and iraqi reconstruction operations these appropriations measures have so been key instrument by which congress applies restrictions and conditions on the admin istrations management of foreign assistance

policy issues the fy2007 budget request posed several key matters that the congre ss considered for foreign operations programs major issues included the overall size of the request 143 increase over regular fy2006 foreign operations funds and whether comp eting budget proposals for domestic programs an d efforts to reduce the deficit will permit full funding of the 2369 billion recommendation foreign aid in support of the global war on terror and whether the fy2007 proposal fully addresses this high national security priority congress was expected to focus on reconstruction and other aid in iraq for which the administration sought 771 million this was in addition to 24 billion fy2006 emergency supplemental proposal for iraq and other purposeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33420crs6 the

2006 and whether the change will result in better coordination and policy coherence of various us foreign aid programs on state department ope rations key policy and f unding issues included

end of world war ii until the early 1990s the underlying rationale for foreign aid and diplomatic efforts was the defeat of communism us aid programs were designed to promot economic developmen t and policy reforms in large part to create stability and reduce the attraction to communist ideology and to block soviet diplomatic links and military advances other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to american allies and friendly states some of which faced soviet or sovietproxy threats aid programs also were used to help the united states gain acce ss to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy american armed for ces diplomacy emphasized strengthening alliances and building coalitions to isolate and confront the soviet threat foreign aid and diplomatic programs so supported number of secondary us policy goals in the developing world ch as reducing high rates of population growth promoting wider access to health car expanding the availability of basic education advancing us trad interests and protecting th environment if these secondary goals were also achieved us aid programs could be promoted as delivering more bang for the buck with the end of the cold war the focus of american foreign policy shifted to support more extensively other us nati onal interests including stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass

while these and other new elements of american foreign aid emerged broad consensus veloped over what the new overarching rationale for us aid programs should be throug hout the 1990s policymakers and congress explored number of alternative strate gic frameworks around which to construct revised foreign assistance po licy rationale not only did policy consensus fail to emerge but repeated efforts to overhaul the largely cold warbased foreign aid legislation also did not succeed during this period the clinton admin istration emphasized the promotion of sustainable development as the new

most defining change in us fo reign policy however came following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states since 911 american foreign aid and diplomatic fforts have taken on more st rategic sense of importance and have been cast frequently in terms of contributing to the war on terrorism in september 2002 president bush released his administration s national security strategy

programs in afghanistan and iraq which totaled more in fy2004 than the combined budgets of all other aid programs are also part of the emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism state department efforts focused extensively on building coalitions to assist in the war on terror and finding new and more effective ways of presen ting american views and culture through public diplomacy at roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of us foreign policy the bush administr ation announced other significant initiatives that have defined and strengthened tw additional key foreign assistance goals promoting economic growth and reducing poverty nd combating the global hivaids pandemic the millennium challenge corporation mcc is new aid delivery concept

swings in budget levels ar not the result of policy decisions but are due to technical budget accounting changes involv ing how congress scores various programs the large increase in fy1981 for example di d not represent higher funding levels but rather the fact that export credit programs bega n to be counted as appropriations rather than as offbudget items part of the substantial rise in spending in fy1985 came as result of the requirement to appropriate the full amount of military aid loans rather than only the partial appropriation required in the past beginning in fy1992 congress changed how all federal credit programs are scored in appropr iation bills which further altered the scoring of foreign aid loans funded in foreign operations all of these factors make it very difficult to present precise and consistent data tre nd line in foreign operations funding levels nevertheless the data shown here can be regarded as illustrative of general trends in congressional decisions regarding foreign opera tions appropriations over the past 30 yearsrarely met and according to usaid ex ists today only as an unimplemented provision in the faa12 as with any restructuring initiative the creation of the dfa raises number of questions with regard to implementation many appla ud the restructuring initiative as marking the beginning of what they percei ve as long overdue effort to reform cumbersome and fragmented us foreign assistance program some supporters of the plan however believe it does not go far enough and that the administration is missing an opportunity for launching mu ch bolder and necessary reform effort some critics have expressed strong concern that the new initiative may lead to greater degree of aid politicization and that usaid will be further marginalized as key decision maker of us developmen t policy congress is not required to legislate the restructuring plan althoug h key congressional committees are likely to maintain close oversight

surprising that foreign aid and defense resources from time to time are the major reason for considering and appr oving emergency supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle

fy2007 the administration requested 455 million in economic support and 13 billion in military assistance some lawmakers believe that us assistance to egypt has not been effective in promoting political and economic reform and that foreign assistance agreements must be renegotiated to include be nchmarks that egypt must m eet to continue to qualify for us foreign aid others have periodica lly called for restrictions on us aid to egypt on the grounds that egypt indirectly supports palestinian terrorism suppresses its own population including minority chris tians and continues to allow egyptian stateowned media outlets to publish unsubsta ntiated conspiracy theories regarding israel and the jewish people for years congress has specified in annual foreign opera tions appropriations legislation that esf funds to egypt are provided with the understanding that egypt undertake certain economic reforms and lib eralize its economy more recently however congress has begun to attach c

education and democracy and governance programming the conference report on the fy2006 spending measure hrept 109265 stated that not less than 50 percent of the funds for democracy g overnance and human rights be provided through nongovernmental organizations fo r the purpose of strengthening egyptian civil society organizations enhancing their participation in the political process and their ability to promote and monitor human rights congressional action hr 5522 as passed in the house fully funded the administrations 176 billion egyptian aid package for fy2007 455 million in economic aid and 13 billion in military assistance but included 200 million rescission of previous year esf funds on the floor the house defeated an amendment by representative obey then ranking member of the appropriati ons committee to redirect 100 million in military aid to egypt to two other accounts 50 million for international disaster and famine assistance for darfur and 50 milli on for the global hivaids initiative during debate obey and supporters argu ed that egypt had not made sufficient progress with regard to human rights election procedures and other matters members expressed particul ar concern regarding the detention of democracy activists the obey floor amendment was similar to an amendment he offered in full committee markup and that also failed that would have delayed 200 million of egypts military aid until congress enacted future legislation approving the withheld assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33420crs26 it was also during full committee mar kup that the house panel approved an amendment offered by subcommittee chairman kolbe adding report language clarifying the terms of section 578b of the bill provision requiring the rescission or cancellation of 200 million of previous ly appropriated ec onomic support funds the kolbe report language specified th at the 200 million would be drawn from cash assistance appropriated for egypt in fy 2003fy2006 the language noted that such cash aid was conditioned on egypt meeting certain financial re form benchmarks while many have been met the committee report points out that some benchmarks have not been implemented and that usaid has not released the associated cash assistance beyond these two amendments and similar to last years language hr 5522 stipulated that 50 million of esf money shall support democracy and human rights programs half of which should be provide d through nongovernmental organizations the bill also required 50 milli on for education activities the senate bill approved the adminis trations request of 1758 billion for egypt but reallocated some funding to different accounts such as the democracy fund and child survival and health of the total 13 billion as requested remained in the fmf account the bill also maintained restrictions from previous years regarding economic and political reforms including determination from the secretary of state that certain benchmarks have been met the bill also rescinded 300 million in prior year esf funds cr provisions the continuing resolution provided 13 billion in foreign military financing to egypt as well as 455 million in economic

core velopment aid accounts president bush pledged in 2002 when the mcc concept was first announced that spending on the new initiative would be additional and not substitute for existing foreign assistance resources it is usually impossible to attribute an increase in one program with reductions in others given the compli cated process through which budgets are compiled and the multiple but not necessarily directly li nked tradeoffs that occur the fy2007 foreign operations request is the first budget proposal since establishment of the mcc where compacts have been signed in countries where usaid maintains programs in each of these six countries armenia benin honduras georgia madagascar and nicar agua usaid resources decline in some cases decisions to reduce regular aid programs are most likely unrelated to mcc resources for example the admin istration has been trying to reduce assistance to armenia and georgia for num ber of years but congressional earmarks keep levels higher for other countri however executive officials have not explained why traditional assistance has declined especially for economic growth programs that are the primary focus of mcc compacts congressional action the house appropriations committee provided 2 billion for the mcc 1 billion under the reque st while expressing strong support for the mcc the committees report noted the constraints imposed by reduced section 302b allocation and the lack of fl exibility to fully fund the administrations request the senate b ill provided 1877 billion reduction of 1123 billion from the request cr provisions the continuing resolution maintained funding for mcc at the fy2006 level of 1752 billion other key items beyond these specific and prominent issues the foreign operations proposal for fy2007 sought to increase aid activities in few areas while cutting resources for several programs significant requests for increases include the following usaid administrative costs would grow substantially under the request with operating expenses climbing by 9 and capital investment costs nearly doubling the largest new expense would be for overseas construction in burundi ethiopia madagascarhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33420crs37 serbia philippines congo kinsh asa and zambia where usaid will colocate within new us embassy compounds the house bill provided 641 million

appropriations xcluding supplementals with most of the increase planned for refugee admissions into the united states and for the emergency refugee and migration assistance erma contingency fund over

75 million in the fy2007 proposal funds could also be used to establish us civilian ground presence in post conflict situations in the past congress has been reluctant to approve this type of continge

iation requests proposals that were rejected in ach case both house and senate bills again did not provide parate conflict response fund and neither did the final cr debt restructuring spending would nearly triple in from 64 million in fy2006 to 183 million in fy2007 the additional resources would be used largely to cover the costs of canceling debt owed to the united states by the democratic republic of congo estimated at 175 million and to provide for additional contributions to the heavily i ndebted poor countries hipc initiative the house bill signifi cantly cut funding for debt relief providing total of 20 million wh ile the senate bill provided 21 million the administration argued that such level would prevent the united states from meeting its commitment to complete bilateral debt reduction for the democratic republic of congo while the committee report noted that c ongress had provided 200 million over the last three years for debt relief for congo the final cr included
