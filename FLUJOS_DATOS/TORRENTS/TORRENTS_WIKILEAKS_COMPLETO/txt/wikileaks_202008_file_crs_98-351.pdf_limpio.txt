could be waived by congress when declaration of war is in effect or when the united states is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious threat to national security and which is declared by joint resolution and enacted into law if any proposed constitutional amendment to require supermajority vote for certain tax measures were to be approved by twoth irds of each house of congress and ratified by threefourths of the states it would join relative handful of existing constitutional provisions which expressly im pose supermajority voting re quirements for actions such as passing bill over presidential veto or approving treaty although there is constitutional provision requiring that the house and senate act by majority vote3 in instances not governed by one of the pr ovisions mandating supermajority both bodies do in most instances opera by majority rule4 in the last seven years the house has considered constitutional amendments to require twothirds vote on certain tax gislation in 1996 on tax day the house considered but did not approve hjres 159 104th cong in 1997 also on tax day the house debated but did not approve similar measure hjres 62 105th cong

was violative of the cons titution which except in few instances in which it specifically provides otherwise seems to imp licitly incorporate the parliamentary principle of majority rule of course constitutional amendment mandating supermajority vote for tax increases would not be vulnerable to comparable legal attack 11 whereas the house rule applies only to measure carrying federal income tax rate increase emphasis added hjres 50 and hjre s 54 would apply to any measure changing the internal revenue laws 12 145 cong rec h2081 daily ed apr 15 1999remarks of rep bliley 13 hrept 10550 105th

stringent than the present house rule in several respects in contrast to the rule the am endments would apply to both chambers not just the house b would im pose supermajority requirement of twothirds rather than threefifths c would be subject to wa iver only on the grounds specified in the amendments and d would apply to broader range of measures11 the national commission on ec onomic growth and tax reform chaired by former housing and urban development secretary jack kemp maintained that an extraordinary majority requirement would lead to greater public confidence in the predictability and stability of the tax system proponents of th twothirds voting requirement argue that since it would make raising taxes more difficult it would compel congress to be more fiscally responsible12 and to
