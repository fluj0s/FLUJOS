strategic concept nato has found difficulty in draw ing the line between missions that directly threaten their security and ones that require less robust intervention or that can be left to other international organizations some allies also wish to discuss the strategic ramifications of enlargement in that coming debate afghanistan above all natos effort to st abilize afghanistan is proving test of allied capabilities and political will under mandate nato has an international security assistance force isaf in afghanistan that is simultaneously combating resurgent taliban and attempting to stabilize the country through an ambitious rebuilding program2 some allies have proven reluctant to send combat forces to engage the taliban and have their forces instead in more secure areas of the country this reluctance has led to sharp criticism by allies such as the united states canada britain the netherlands and denmark which have suffered casualties to their forces that are frequently engaged in combat the allies now have approximately 42000 troops in afghanistan as well as 25 provincial reconstruc tion teams prts prts are the core of natos effort to rebuild afghanistan by constr ucting schools roads and hosp itals and urging national and local leaders to improve governance tinuing problem is af ghanistans narcotics trade which continues to expand and to fuel the taliban

republic opposes the sites warsaw is insisting that the united states provide resources to upgrade polands air defense system in the event that the interceptors presence provokes an attack6 at the summit the united states and the czech republic signed an agreement to place the radar site on czech territory the allies agreed at headofgovernment level to positions on missile defense that they had previously taken more informally the summit communiqué recognizes that ballistic missile proliferation poses an increasing threat to nato and that us missile defense assets could make substa ntial contribution to protection from longrange missiles but did not name the country or countries from which the threat might come nato has been studying several ballistic missile defense systems for protection largely of forces in the field nato will continue to study how these systems might be bolted on to the us sy stem to provide protec tion for all allied space but did not make final determination whic h system if any mig ht be appropriate nor was any decision made on how the nato systems might be funded7 some critics contend that the us system is too rudimentary to counter possible ballistic missile attack and that extensive further testing is warranted before the system should be put in place at congressiona l hearing on april 23 one member questioned why the europeans

accession talks should resolution occur to complicate possible progress the macedonian government fell after the summit and some time may pass before it can be reconstituted contentious discussion at bucharest occurred over whether to admit georgia and ukraine to the map us state department officials have conte nded that only germany opposed the map for the two governments because berlin was concerned about negative reaction in moscow to putting two neighboring countries on the road to membership14 however interviews of representatives of allied governments indicate more complicated discussion and broader opposition nato makes decisions on the basis of consensus and vote is sometimes not taken on an issue that cannot be fully resolved th at was the case in this instance according to crs interviews in addition to germany representatives of france and at least two other governments indicated that they wish the map process to go more slowly they opposed georgias and ukraines entry into the map at this time several other governments also opposed the map for georgi and ukraine but would not have blocked consensus had it been within reach which it was not while some governments indicated desire not to antagonize russia they said that larger issues were also considered15 majority of ukraines population opposes nat membership some allies believe that kiev must persuade its population of the va lue of membership before the map process can begin some allies also believe that georgia must first stage its parliamentary elections in may and achieve acceptable

agreed today that these countries georgia and uk raine will become members of nato the allies apparently wished to signal their c onfidence in the ability of the two countries governments to make the necessary reforms to qualify for membership the statement was also an obvious message to moscow th at it may not determin which governments enter nato the allies did not provide time frame for

nato secretary general jaap hoop scheffer calls sullen nationalism european union defense the allies acknowledged the value that stronger and more capable european defense brings providing capabilities to address the common challenges both nato and the eu face this acknowledgment may ssist in preparing the way for frances return to natos integrat ed military structure which it left in
