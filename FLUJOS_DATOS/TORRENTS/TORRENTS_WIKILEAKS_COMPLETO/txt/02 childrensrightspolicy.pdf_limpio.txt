gives children who are capable of fo rming their own views the ri ght to express their views freely in all matters affecting them for this purpose the child shall be provided with the opportunity to be heard in any judicial or administrative process affecting them historically the voices of children have often been too weak to be heard often with disastrous consequences articles 14 and 17 give children and young people the right to hold their own opinions and to access information article 3 states that par ties should ensure that the child is afforded such protection and care as is necessary for his or her wellbeing taking into account the rights and duties of parents and those with parental responsibility cafcass is committed to promoting the pr inciples of the uncrc and
