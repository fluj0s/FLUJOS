advancing justice th rough dna technology act of 2003 hr 3214 sectionbysection analysis summary the federal bureau of investigation fbi maintains an automated information processing system the combined dna i ndex codis of dna profiles of certain convicted criminals and dna analyses of samples recovered from crime scenes from unidentified human remain s and from missing persons the national dna indexing system ndis one of the three inde xes that make up the codis enables participating laborat ories to exchange and compar state and federal dna profiles state legislation has increased the number of qualifying offenses for which convicted offenders must submit dna samples such as offender samples plus case samples from crime scenes creating bigger pool of dna samples needing to be analyzed as the pool increases and new samples are co llected the states ar finding it difficult to complete the dna analysis therefore resulting in backlog on november 5 2003 the house passed hr 3214 aimed at mode rnizing the laws relating to the use of dna technology in the criminal justice system the bill would provide states with training funding and guidelin aimed at eliminating the backlog title i of the act would expand the eligibility provisions of the dna backlog grant program by adding units of local government as potential grantees and proposes to change the program to formul grant program among other things it would expand the types of dna records th at may be included in the codis to include records of persons who have been indicted or who have waived indictment for crime and would also broaden the list of federal and military qualifying offenses furthermore it would increase the authorized funding levels for the dna analysis backlog elimination program to 151 million annually title ii of the act would amend the dna identification act of 1994 to require that laboratories that provide dna reco rds for the codis be accredited by nationally recognized nonprofit professional association of forensic scientists within two years of the enactment of the act and undergo external audits at least once every two years to show compliance with specifi ed standards it provides for enhanced criminal penalties for knowing misuse or unauthorized disclosure of dna information and authorizes grants to be awarded for dna training education research and development sexual assault forensic examination programs using dna technology to identify missing persons and tribal domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions additionally it establishes new national forensic science commission expands the paul coverdell fo rensic sciences improvement grant program and provides funds to the fede ral bureau of investigation for the administration of its dna programs title iii would establish the rules governing the applications for postc onviction dna testing by inmates in th federal system it woul d require the preservation of biological evidence in federal criminal cases while the inmate is in prison and would establish grants to states for improving the quality of capital litigation also it would provide funds for postconvic tion testing and increase the

clear suspects and exonerate persons mistakenly accused or convicted of crimes2 the advancing justice through dna technology act of 2003 hereinafter the act hr 32143 was introduced to ddress several problems facing state and federal government in dna collection and analysis it addresses three problems 1 the elimination of backlogs of samples from crime scenes and convicted offenders that have not been analyzed 2 the improvement and expansion of dna testing capacity of federal stat and local crime boratories and the development of new traini ng programs regarding collection and use of dna

state and local governments for the purpose of developing and impr oving dna technology and analysis of dna evidence grants are awarded by the attorney general and require states to have in place

increased the num ber of qualifying offenses for which convicted offenders must submit dna samples11 this has created backlog in the analysis of such samples as samples must be drawn from individuals currently incarcerated and then analyzed in additi on since the pool of convicted offenders is continuously growing the states have d difficult time eliminating the previously existing backlog of convicted offender samp and analyzing new samples as well as analyzing forensic samples12 as result the senate passed bill in the 107th congress to analyze the extent of the back log in dna analysis of rape kits and to improve the investigation and prosecution of sexual offenses using dna evidence13 hr 3214 aimed at modernizing the laws relating to the use of dna technology in the criminal
