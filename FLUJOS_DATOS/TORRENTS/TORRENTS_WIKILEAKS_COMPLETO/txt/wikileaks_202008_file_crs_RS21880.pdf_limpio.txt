responses and especially the programs and options for protecting the interface before the next wildfire strikes wildfires have made national headlines in recent years with major fires in the west and south killing firefighters burning homes and threatening communities federal funding for fire protection has more than doubl ed in the past decade and administration and congressional leaders have urged additional wildfire protection see crs report rl33990 wildfire funding by ross w gorte attention has focused on protecting people homes and communities in the wildlandurban interface wui but opinions vary over how to protect the interface what is the wildlandurban interface the term wildlandurban interface wui has been used for more than two decades to suggest an area where homes are in or near wildlands forests or rangelands the report from 1986 conference on fire protecti on defined the wui as where combustible homes meet combustible vegetation1 in january 2001 the forest service

nearly 4500 interf ace communities with 11 states not providing data in particular the agencies defined an interface community as where wildlands abut structures with clear line of demarcati on between houses and wildland fuels while an intermix community is where houses are scattered and intermingled with wildlands and fuels recent research has found that the area of intermix communities is large and is growing faster than the area of interface communities3 in 2000 intermix communities in the three pacific coast states totaled 98 million acres almost three times the 33 million acres in interface communities in thos states the 10year growth in area of intermix communities was 141 compared to only 25 for interface communities however the study acknowledged that termining the area of wui communities was imprecise mapping the federal register definition of the wui using data and operational definitions we developed we arrived at one possible representation of the wui4 the intermingled nature of intermix communities poses significant challenges for fire protection efforts fire suppression in most of the unites states wildfires ar inevitable biomass plus dry conditions equals fuel to burn add an ignition source eg lightning or thrown cigarette and wildfire happens fire is selfsustaining chemical reaction that perpetuates itself as long as all three elements of the fire triangle fuel heat and oxygen remain available fire control focuses on removi ng one of those elements there are two principal kinds of wildfire although an individual wildfire may contain areas of both kinds5 surface fire burns the needles or leaves grass and other small biomass within foot or so of th ground and quickly moves on such fires are relatively easy to control by removing fuel with fireline essentially dirt path wide enough to eliminate the continuous fu els needed to sustain the fire or by cooling or smothering the flames with water or dirt crown fire burns biomass at all levels from the surface through the tops of the trees crown fires do not consume all the biom ass rather crown fire quickly burns the needles or leaves and small twigs and limb s on the surface and throughout the crown of the trees because the needles and leaves in the crown are green they require more energy to burn than dry fuels on the surface furthermore because of the green fuels and the often discontinuous biomass of the canopy wind is usually needed to sustain crown fire once burning vigorously crown fire can create its own wind the strong upwardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21880crs3 6

why houses burned forest trust quarterly report 13 dec 2000 p 11convection of the heated air can draw in c ooler air from surrounding areas thus creating wind that feeds the fire the strong upw ard convection can also lift burning biomass firebrands and send it soaring ahead of the fire creating spot fires and accelerating the spread of the wildfire thus crown fires are difficult if not impossible to control firelines are often ineffective especially if winds are causing spot fires water or fire retardant slurry dropped from helicopters or airpla nes can sometimes knock crown fire down back to surface fire if the area burning and the winds are not too great often however crown fires burn until they run out of fuel or the weather changes the wind dies or it rains or snows fires burn structures in one of three ways through direct contact with fire the fire burning right up to the structure through radiation heating from exposure to flames and through firebrands nding on flammable roof6 surface fires generally only burn houses through direct contact and protection is relatively simple matter of break in the continuous burnable material in observing houses that burned in alamos in 2000 one researcher stated in several cases scratch line that removed pine needles from the base of wood wall kept the house from igniting7 crown fires however can burn houses in any of the three ways the opport unity and ability to prevent structures from burning during crown fire is small ccasionally water or some other wetting agent sprayed on walls or roofs can prevent ignition or extinguish firebrands from an advancing wildfire but the firefighters could die of heat exposure or smoke inhalation from the approaching fire in the aftermath recovery and efforts to support recovery af ter severe wildfire vary depending on the nature of the damages for burned st ructures insurance payment is the standard means for homeowners to pay for recovery repair if that is possible or replacement depending on the insurance policy in seve re event presidential declaration of an emergency in response to request from governor initiates process for federal assistance to state and local governments and to families and individuals to help with recovery the nature and exte nt of the assistance depends on several factors such as the nature and severity of damages and the insurance cove rage of the affected parties for burned areas site rehabilitation is sometimes warranted in many temperate ecosystems wildfires including crown fires are natural events and the ecosystems are adapted to recover from the fire often in verely burned areas grass seed is spread to try to accelerate growth of ground cover and sl ow erosion but grass often inhibits tree seed germination and growth and thus may slow forest recovery rehabilitation efforts commonly focus on the firelines created to try to control the fire since firelines are exposed bare earth that often run uphill and thus can readily erode into gullies if left untreated some severe ly burned areas particularly in coastal southern california are susceptible to landslides during the subseque nt rainy season monitoring

structures nd wildlands from some of the damages of wildfires see crs report rl34517 wildfire damages to homes and resources understanding causes and reducing losses by ross w gorte protecting structures structures characteristics and landscaping significantly affect its chance of surviving wildfire evidence from models experiments and case studies demonstrates that structural charact eristics especially the roofing materials largely determine whether home burns in w ildfire homes of br ick or adobe with non flammable roofs eg tile slate metal are far less likely to burn than homes with wood siding and flammable roofs eg wood shingles8 burnable materials such as trees shrubs grass pine needles woodpiles w ood decks and wooden deck furniture within 40 meters 131 feet of the structure also st rongly influence whether the structure burns in wildfire9 furthermore the structure and landscape characteristics are more important than the intensity of the fire in determining whethe r house burns the hayman fire in colorado in june 2002 burned 132 houses 70 houses 53 were surrounded by crown fire while 62 houses 47 were surrounded by surface fire10 in addition 662 homes 83 of all homes within the fire perimeter survived the fire even though 35 of the area was severely burned and 16 was moderately burned11 this suggests that at least some of the structures survived despite crown fi re around them why these structures survived was not reported protecting wildlands the impact of wildfires on wildlands depends largely on the nature of the ecosystem some ecosystems are adapted to and recover from periodic crown fires perennial grassl ands chaparral lodgepole nd jack pines and more in these ecosystems the plants have evolved to resprout or reseed the burned areas and thus recover from crown fires by outcompeting other plant species eliminating crown fires could eventually eliminate these ecosystems however eliminating crown fires in these ecosystems is probably impossible since the plants contribute to the development and spread of crown fires grasses burn quickly chaparral has high volatileoils content and lodgepole and jack pines grow in dense evenaged standshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21880crs5 12 w wallace covington director the ecologic restoration institute northern arizona university prepared statement national fire plan hearing before

has been moderately successful in controlling surface fires and thus the needles twigs and other fine and small fuels have been accumulating for three or more fire cycles this abnormal fuel accumulation combined with fuel ladders of brush small trees and low limbs many of wh ich would have burned in surface fire have led to crown fires where such fires were historically rare fuel reduction treatments can restore conditions in freque ntsurfacefire ecosystems to again make crown fires rare occurrences reducing damages to resources protecting the wui reducing fuels in the wui has been controversial aspect of congressional debate s over fire protection legislati on the evidence discussed above indicates that fuel reduction provides little protection for structures however some observers have noted that the wui is more than just collection of houses12 town is not just the place where people have homes communities are in the forest because they are emotionally economically and socially linked and dependent on the forest when we consider the areas that need immediate treatment we should consider the human community impact area the entire area that if impacted by catastrophic fire will undermine the health and livelihood of community at minimum most would agree on the need for an area of defensible space around homes that needs to be cleared of burnable materials at least 10 meters 33 feet and possibly as much as 40 meters 131 feet one observer recommended that protecting communities should include inte nsive treatment to reduce fu els and burnable materials in the home ignition zone up to 200 meters 655 feet around structures with less intensive fuel treatment in the community protection zone generally up to 500 meters 1640 feet or about third of mile from structures13 the healthy forests restoration act of 2003 hfra pl 108148 16 usc 6511 established somewhat broader sta ndard for fuel reduc tion activities under its authorities section 10116 of hfra defined the wui to include an area out to ½ mile from the boundary of an atrisk community or 1½ miles from the boundary if sustained steep slope could cause dangerous fire behavior or to an effective fire break such as road or ridge top hfra included gu idance on how to apply these standards in intermix communities with definitive boundary issues for congress as more acres and homes have burned in recent years and more people are at risk from wildfires congress is facing increasing pressures for wildfire protection congresshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21880crs6 decides what programs to authorize and f und many programs exist and other options are possible firefighting uses the majority of wild fire management funding accounting for 11 to 19 billion annually including emer gency supplemental funds since fy2003 appropriations for fire suppre ssion have risen in nearly every year for decade going from 277 million in fy1999 to the requested 133 billion for fy2009 given the difficulty in suppressing crown fires one mig ht question the effec tiveness of continued increases in suppression funding although the agencies also clearly need to show the public that they are doing all they can to stop the threatening and damaging fires federal programs to protect homes are currently limited to in formation primarily through firewise for homeowners on how to protect their homes programs could be expanded to educate homeowners state and cal governments and the insurance industry about the ways to protect homes through actions planning and zoning and building regulations congress could create and f und new programs to assist homeowners in renovations to make their homes firesafe and to create defensible space around their structures through direct federal assistance or through the states congress could also consider expanding protection for defensible space beyond the home ignition zone to community protecti on zone hfra authorizes an expedited review process for activities on federal lands in the wui perhaps other changes could further accelerate action funding for fuel reduction in the wui could also be expanded appropriations for fuel reduction have averaged500 million annually since fy2006 but only portion is used in the wui and fundi ng is far below the estimated amount needed to treat the lands at risk s ee the discussion in crs report rl33990 wildfire funding by ross w gorte state fire assistance fundi ng through the forest service could be used for fuel reduction in the wui at the discreti on of the states but funding has averaged 88 million annually and the states ve many wildfire priorities additi onal funding through the states for fuel reduction on private lands in the wui is possibility that congress could contemplate in addition congress might debate c hoices for compensating homeowners for property losses due to wildfires one option might be to restrict compensation to those who had acted to protect their homes but got burned anyway another option might be to require that compensation for rebuilding be used only for firesafe building designs and materials alternatively congress could establish national wildfire insurance program with premiums based on fire threats the fire safety of the structures and the defensible space being maintained finally congress could consider compensa tion for landowners that suffer resource losses from wildfires an emergency refo restation assistance pr ogram has existed for many years although it has not been funded since fy1993 see crs report rl31065 forestry assistance programs by ross w gorte in the 2008 farm bill congress included forest restoration assistance in an existing emergency conservation program see crs report rl33917 forestry in the 2008 farm bill by ross w gorte these programs can provide assistance in rec overy from wildfire disaster but do not compensate landowners for losses in the wa that homeowners are compensated for the loss of their homes congress might c onsider such additional compensation
