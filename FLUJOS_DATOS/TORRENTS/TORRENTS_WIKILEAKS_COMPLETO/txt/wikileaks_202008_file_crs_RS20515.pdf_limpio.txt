precision agriculture is an emerging hightechnology agricultural management system congressional interest centers on federal support for research on precision agricultural and its enabling technologies this report includes brief description and background overview of the current status and development trends of precision agriculture in the united states it also contains glossary of related terms to assist readers unfamiliar with this topic which is of growing importance in production agriculture this report is designed to provide basic information on this method of production and is not expected to be updated regularly2 background description rapid technological change is central characteristic of us agriculture and major force in the industrialization of contemporary commercial agriculture the pace of that change is partially dependent on public policies and societys institutio ns growing competitive pressures stemming from globalizing agricultural markets improving yields and new environmental concerns contribute to the reliance of farmers on technological innovation increased acceptance and reliance on emerging information technologies are becoming part of us agricultural production precision agriculture pa also called sitespecific crop production prescription farming and soilspecific crop management refers to suite of technologies that use sensing and georeferencing innovations to apply more precise inputs based on fields biophysical variability producers first determine the variability within their fields by relating crop production andor soil attribute data to geographic coordinates using global positioning system receiver these data become the basis for digital soil fertility and variability mapping the objective of pa is to quantifyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20515crs2 3 precision agriculture in the 21st century geospatial and information technologies in crop management national research council national academy of science press washington dc april 1997and manage spatial and temporal variability that exists in virtually every field rather than applying fertilizer seed pesticides or water at uniform rate across an entire field growers use computer technologies to continually adjust their input applications as they operate their equipment based on the biophysical variability of their land best estimates suggest that less than 4 of us farmers are using pa technologies the twin goals of pa are increased yields and reduced costs pa is foremost management system that may do for agriculture essentially what justintime production has done for manufacturing costs associated with precision agriculture farmers face significant but not prohibitive startup costs before they achieve potential longterm efficiencies these costs include yield monitoring crop scouting and soil testing over multiple growing seasons and learning how to use remote sensing gis and variable rate application technologies vrt individuals may either buy this technology directly or contract for various services with vendors including crop consultants and input suppliers yield monitor for corn wheat or soybeans could cost 40007000 soil sampling has been estimated at 37 per acre considerably more if samples are deeper and taken on sampling basis of 12 acres truckmounted computer system and gis software could add an additional 3000 service costs including soil sampling yield monitoring crop scouting gps receiver and depending on the region of the country satellite signal subscription and vrt controllers and fertilizer application additional cost over uniform application rates have been variously estimated at 1326 for grower and 2501450 for dealer on per acre basis3 soil grid sampling could become an annual expense but spread over sufficient acreage this cost has been acceptable to adopters other sensorbased applications sometimes referred to as on thego sensing are evolving technologies although development research is underway few such commercial sensors have been developed to date this barrier could limit pas development individual farm returns on pa investment will vary by the managment skills of operators by the biophysical properties of each field and by the interactive effects of altering various inputs the limited data on economic returns to date show mixed results which is not unexpected given the difficulty of maintaining any consistency of the system between comparative sites potential profitability of pa is highly correlated with the biophysical variability of the setting to which it is applied research has examined the economics of pa for an agroecological region type of production system or across all dimensions of production system the limited economic research available is based largely on relatively lowvalued crops and inexpensive inputs variables that are less conducive to producing significant profit advantages under pa system changes that might give less wealthy growers incentives to invest in pa include cooperative arrangements to share technology equipment leasing and standardization of pa technology pa is likely to attract farmers who are comfortable with computers and the information intensity of pa as the technology matures however more growers may be likely to consider at least some of the pa technologies either through direct purchase or through contracting for pa services httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20515crs3 use of precision agriculture information on the adoption of pa is fragmentary and unsystematic adoption rates also are difficult to determine because pa is cluster of different techniques that may be adopted in different combinations and at different times rather than single farming system published usda data indicate that about 64000 farms about 32 of total farms used computeraided chemical application or gps technologi in 1995 more recent usda data 1998 indicate little growth in acquisition of these technologies larger farms seem to be among early adopters although there is hard evidence of consistent size bias for pa techniques the rate of adoption does not appear to be uniform among crops either farm press articles and various regional agricultural meetings suggest that many adopters of yield monitors have been corn and soybean growers casestudies in the farm press and anecdotal information reveal that some florida tomato growers california vegetable and grape growers arkansas cotton growers and northwestern foresters have also adopted pa techniques based on experience to date pa seems to offer the greatest potential benefits where input costs are high field variability is high highvalued crops are grown and environmental effects especially affecting water resources must be reduced environmental aspects of precision agriculture proponents of pa have emphasized its potential to reduce environmental effects of production agriculture fieldlevel studies suggest that more accurate calibration of inputs can reduce overfertilization or excess use of pesticides the lack of experience with pa as well as more extensive experience with other technologies such as irrigation however suggest that pa might produce less environmental improvement in commercialscale agriculture than individual field tests at this time indicate growers who find they can reduce certain inputs could be offset by other growers who learn they are underfertilizing or using suboptimal levels of pesticides and opt to increase their inputs current status of pa at the federal and state levels although the technologies undergirding pa are being developed and promoted largely by private companies there has been public presence in pa development the 104th and 105th congresses considered several bills to promote agricultural research and extension targeting precision agriculture and precision agriculture technologies three bills were introduced in the 104th congress to amend the competitive special and facilities research grant act and one to amend the research categories in the fund for rural america although none of these bills was enacted interest in the congress continued three additional bills were introduced or reintroduced in the 105th congress an original bill s 1150 to address high priority national agricultural concerns and to reform extend and eliminate certain agricultural research programs was enacted as pl105185 the agricultural research extension and education reform act of 1998 section 402 sets research priorities and authorizes grants to study and promote components of pa technologies and to integrate research education and extension efforts in pa section 401 further addresses pa in the context of natural resource managment to implement section 401 the cooperative state research education and extension service csrees hashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20515crs4 recently announced new program entitled the initiative for future agriculture and food systems ifafs which was authorized by congress in 1998 about 113 million is available for research grants through this initiative in 2000 section 401 also gives priority to the concerns of small and midsized producers especially in natural resource management and farm efficiency congressional appropriators however decided in 1999 to prohibit usda from using any csrees funds to pay salaries and expenses of personnel to carry out the provisions of section 401 the secretary then tried to use funds from fy1999 to fund staffing for the initiative in fy2000 funding this initiative is currently an issue in the fy2000 house appropriations committees supplemental appropriation bill at least seven universities have established pa research institutes or laboratories purdue university of georgia oregon state university of minnesota university of arizona texan am and north carolina state in 1996 about 9 million was reported as csrees funding to parelated research at landgrant universities the coastal plain experiment station in georgia received 34 million between 19911993 from csrees to construct the national environmentally sound production agriculture laboratory where pa is major element of the research program in addition the agricultural research services ars subtropical research laboratory in weslaco texas is the site of resource21 project designed to launch four solarpowered satellites for remote sensing this publicprivate venture is developing under usda cooperative research and development agreement crada involving six partners and the agricultural research service in 1995 the ars invested 44 million in parelated research in 15 locations according to the ars budget office its spending on precision agriculture from 19961999 totaled 204 million for 2000 it has allocated 77 million for pa related research other federal agencies conducting research and development with pa applications include the department of energy eg idaho engineering laboratory and the national aeronautical and space administration eg landsat commercial remote sensing program at stennis space center glossary digital soil mapping fields are divided into grid cells of approximately 23 acres defined by gps receiver larger scale resolution is possible soil sample data from each cell are transferred to digital map that is then used to manage precise input application geographical information systems gis combination of computer hardware software and geographic data designed to capture store manipulate analyze and display data that is referenced to specific points on the earths surface the capacity to perform many sophisticated spatial operations on these data differentiates gis from simple mapping software global positioning system gps most pa will make use of the us department of defenses 24 earthorbiting satellites to assign map coordinates these satellites emit radio signals at precise intervals accurate to billionth of second through triangulation groundbased receiver translates the time lag between emission and reception of the signals into precise geographic coordinates on the targeted croplandhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20515crs5 groundbased sensors sensorbased application of inputs implies that sensors on the vrt can measure information in realtime and make the necessary precise adjustments the technology is not as advanced as mapbased applications at this time although research is underway in soil nutrient sensors soil property sensors and optical plant sensors precision agriculture pa an emerging set of farming techniques whose fundamental feature is assigning computerbased geographic coordinates to subfield variability of cropland for improving efficiency of inputs pas technology consists of four major components global positioning system gps receiver yield monitor digital soil map and variable rate application technologies vrt data from these components are integrated through geographical information system gis remote sensing data from light reflectance collected by instruments in airplanes or orbiting satellites the data can estimate vegetation characteristics on small areas within field high resolution eg 15 meters satellite images are currently available to producers from private vendors eg space imaging inc is offering to sell high resolution satellite images from ikonos during the 2000 crop season variable rate application technologies vrt computercontrolled equipment continually readjusts the application soil grid data provide the prescription for the particular fertilizers or pesticides to be applied to each grid gps receiver in truck enables the computer to recognize where it is in the field computercontrolled nozzles vary the types and amounts of inputs according to the soil fertility or pest population maps yield monitoring systems areaspecific yields in the field are measured using combinemounted sensors or volume meters gps receiver mounted on the combine supplies the spatial coordinates so that estimates of yields can be assigned to small areas of field to create yield map
