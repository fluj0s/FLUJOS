with the rights holder the owner of lawfully made copy of the collection could sell or otherwise dispose of the copy use or extraction of genealogical info rmation for nonprofit religious purposes and use of information as part of lawfully authorized investigative protective r intelligence activities individual use or extraction limitation in determining whether or not th individual use or extraction limitation applies hr 354 lists five factors to be weighed in evaluating the reasonableness of the use 1 commercial or nonprofit purpose 2 appropriateness for purpose 3 good faith purpose 4 incorporati on of the copied material in an independent work or co llection and the degree of differences between the protected collection and the subsequent w ork or collection and 5 whether the protected collection was primarily developed for marketing to persons engaged in the same field or business as the database userhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20361crs4 hr 354 s pecifies that in case can
