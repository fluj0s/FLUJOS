dg t rade vademecum on access to documents january 2009 this vademecum will be updated on regular basis on the basis of the practical experience gained in handling requests for access to documents article 255 ec treaty any citizen of the u nion and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in member state sha ll have right of access to european parliament council and commission docu ments content 10 things to remember on access to documents i overall principles ii access to dg trade documents iii practical implications for dg trade 2 10 things to remember on access to documents 1 all documents including mails held by the commission even if we get them from third parties are in prin ciple subject to disclosure 2 we must give reasons for any refusal based on the exceptions of the r egulation ie public securit defence and military matters harm to international relations economic policy protection of privacy and integrity of i ndividuals protection of commercial interests cour t proceedings and legal advice investigations and harm to decision making which includes negotiating processes 3 type of documents held by dg trade can be automatically excluded from access eac h document has to be examined caseby case on the basis of its actual content and not of its status as to whether any exception applies this include s negotiating directives for example 4 if only parts of document are subject to an excep tion th rest of the document must still be rele ased partial disclosure 5 it is for the commission to decide whether document is released or not third parties can be consulted in case of doubt but the commission has the last word 6 deadlines to r eply are very t ight ie within 15 working days failure to reply is equivalent to refusing access 7 remedies refusal s or partial disclosure can be appealed confirmatory application to the secretary general if the refusal is upheld the applic ant can go to the court of first instance or complain to the ombudsman 8 when you request information from third parties eg industry questionnaires do not forget to mention that the information they provide is subject to the u rules on access to d ocuments 9 make sure your filing is reliable so that it is easy to find documents even after people have left the unit 10 be aware that your documents and especially meeting reports and emails can potentially be disclosed this must be kept in min d when writing such documents 3 i overall principles legal obligation article 255 ec treaty regulation 10492001 of 30 may 2001 regarding pu blic access to european parliament council and commission documents oj l 145 3152001 p 43 in the process of review currently first reading in ep implementing decision adopted by the commission on 5 december 2001 oj l 345 29122001 p 94 beneficiaries any eu citizen or legal person residing or having its regi stered office in member state art 1 f the regulation and also citizens of third countries not residing in an ms and legal persons not having their registered office in one of the ms art 1 of the impl ementing decision the latter catego ry does not have the possibility of ap pealing to the mbudsman though what documents the right of access applies to all documents held by the commission art 23 ie not only those produced by it but also those r eceived from third pa rties whatever the medium1 this also includes emails in so far as they may be considered relevant for instance official exchanges between the commission and outsi organisations institutions or business are commission documents within the meanin g of the regulation the same applies to mails with substance that are essential for given file this includes mail which we receive only in copy for example one recent case covered detailed exchanges between dg dev and outside organisations where we were in copy dev were consulted prior to release by us howe ver day today mail traffic providing contacts at desk levels are considered by the secretariat general as being personal to desk officers and are therefore not considered documents within the meaning of the regulation hence the need f or proper filing system for mails see further category of documents is excluded priori from the right of access including classified documents2 each application for access and each requested 1 the regulation art 3 defines document as any content produced or received by the commission and its departments concerning matter re lating to the policies activities and decisions fa lling within the institutions sphere of responsibility in connectio n with its official duties and whatever its medium written on paper or stored in electronic form or as sound visual or audiovisual r ecording 2 documents classified as sensitive top secret cret or confidential according to the rules of comm ission decision 2001844 are not excluded from the scope of the regulation however there are specific rules as to the handling of such re quest s they must be handled by authorised persons usin g protected procedures art 9 moreover decision by the commission to declassif document is required before transmission can take place this is relatively straightforward process however only the lowest level of classification eu restricted is used in dg trade mainly in the case of negotiating guidelines see further 4 document must be treated separately and examined thoroughly case by case this would include for examples responses to public co nsultations or questionnaires this implies that we can not easily guarantee the confid entiality of information shared with us access does not have to be given to documents that dont exist this may sound obvious but we do not have to create documen ts to meet given request other than for example simple lists of meetings or documents nor reply to requests for information rather than documents per exceptions article 4 of the regulation access to document can be refused for reasons of protection of public interest as regards public security defence and military matters international relations and the financial monetary or economic policy of the community or an ms art 41a for reason of protection of privacy and integrity of individuals ie community legislation on protection of personal data art 41b for reasons of protection of commercial interests court proceedings and legal advice investigations unless there is an overriding public interest in disclosure art 42 for reasons of decision making which includes negotiating processes art 43 ie for 1 documents drawn up by an institution for internal use or rece ived by n institution which relates to matter where the decision has not been taken by the institution 2 document s containing opinions for internal use as part of deliberations and preliminary consultations within the commission even after the decision has been taken if disclosure of the document would seriously undermine the institutions decision making process unles s there is an overriding public interest in disclosure the grounds indicated in bold are those most releva nt to dg trade the public interest test in arts 42 and 43 implies that refusal to disclose document on the basis of the exceptions must be jus tified on case bycase basis according to the documents content and not its status an unjustified refusal could give rise to complai nt on the grounds that the commission is not meetin g its commitments with regard to transparency see articl 6 of the detailed rules for application annexed to the commissions rules of pr ocedure timelimit the xceptions only apply for the period dur ing which protection is justified on the basis of the conte nt of the document with maximum limit of 30 years however t his limit does not apply in the case of documents c overed by exceptions relating to privacy or commercial interests and in the case of sensitive documents where exceptions can continue to apply after this period art 47 if document has already been transmitted to lar ge number of people in the course of our usual contacts or put onto the commissions web site it is clearly out of the 5 question to refuse access to it even if the document may initially h ave been intend ed for internal use any refusal to grant access must be based on one of the exceptions in the regulation in case of refusal to grant access the applicant is inf ormed of the type of documents withheld and the reasons for the refusal must be properly stated this is important for the court in reviewing the legality f the decision the reply must be accompanied by list of all the documents which have been consid ered in the context of the applicants request including those which have not been disclosed even in case of complete refusal the reply should indicate the document identified and the reason why access is refused if only part of the document request ed is covered by one or more exceptions the other parts of the documents must be disclosed partial release art 46 see below refusals must effectively be based on the legal exceptions bear in mind that refusals can not only be subject to co nfirmatory request handled by the sg but that at the end of the day party may seek the intervention of the ombudsman andor the court both of whom can verify whether the exceptions have been invoke d in justified manner and possibly request the do cuments to be released if it then appears that the commission has abused the grounds for exception of art 4 this may have severe consequences for reputation of the dg and the institution partial release of documents under certain conditions documents can be partially released when the released document also covers issues which were not mentione d in the applicants request the parts that are not relevant to the request will not be disclosed for example an applicant asked for report related t negoti ations with country x if such report also refers to negotiations with country tho parts of the document relati ng to country can be deleted as not relevant to the request recent cases concern requests for information about meetings with individual companies on our ftas which have allowed u s to exclude business federations on the same points or about meetings with dg trade officials which have allowed us to exclude meetings on the s ame point with the commissioner or the cabinet in ca parts of the documents are covered by any of the ex ceptions the remaining parts of the documents must nevertheless be released the parts that are not relevant to the request or which are covered by article 4 should be deleted if the document is electr onically available with an indication that non relevant text has been deleted and an indication of the length of the length of the deleted text eg two lines deleted 2 words leted 1 paragraph deleted or whiten ed if the document is only ava ilable in paper format practical experience shows that one of the more dif ficult elements is how to handle personal comments or reflections in notes meeting reports or flash mails in order to limit the deletions in released texts it is recommende d to separate the factual reporting of meeting or phone call 6 from any personal assessment of the meeting or list of follow up points see part iii of this vademecum third party documents documents received from t hird part ies held by the commission ar also subject to the disclosure requirements there are specific exceptions for third party documents other than those of art 4 ie the exceptions under article 4 apply to commission documents and to third party documents it is for the commission to decide whether third party document can be disclosed or not without obligation to consult third party except when there is doubt as to whether the exceptions of article 41 and 42 app ly in which case the third party shall be consulted only r easons given by third parties which correspond to ne of the exceptions of art 4 of the regulation can be taken into consider ation in any event the commission will have the final judgement on the release of third party documents in practice it is ve ry rare for dg trade to consult third party forma lly regarding release although as matter of good practice we inform co rrespondents of the commissioner before their letters and the commissio ners replies are made public when third party is consult ed it should be given at least 5 working days to reply if the commission intends to disregard the third party authors refusal to disclose document because the ground for refusal was not based on rt 4 or because in the commissions view none of these grounds apply it must inform the author 10 days before releasing the document the deadline for reply will then need to be extended the author can then bring an action before the cour t of first instance requesting the suspension of the commission s decision and the deadline see article 5 of the detailed rules for application the dg trade practice is that when the third party is third country we will always ask its authorisation to disclose i f such authorisation is refused it is consider ed that the exception of article 41a international relations applies when the third party is private entity an industry company or person it will only be consulted in case the commission has doubt as to whether the conditions for excepti ons under the regulation apply avoid giving any impression that the third party has veto right in any event the commission has the last word as courtesy measure you can if you wish alway s inform this third party of the full or partial release f its correspondence but bear in mind that this causes delays to the answer and does imply some paperwork in case of correspondence between the commissioner and private entity the cabinet will alw ays by way of c ourtesy inform this third part of the full or partial release of its correspondence 7 documents originating from member states can be treated in the same way as t he third party category nonethe less article 45 of the regulation provides that member state may request the institution t to disclose document originating from that member state without its prior agreement however such non disclosure must be justified by one or more of the exception ground s of article 4 the commission consults the member state concerned in cases where it intends to disregard prior request from the member state not to disclose document originating from it article 9 documents originating from other institutions are also treated like all third party documents but the other insti tutions re always consulted memorandum of understanding processing of applications and t ime limits applications for access must be handled promptly incoming requests are registered by the sg or trade 01 an acknowledgment of receipt must be sent to the applicant ither by the sg in case of applications via the eu ropa website or by trade 01 if the request is directly addressed to dg trad if request is addressed to unit other than trad 01 trade 01 must be promptly informed so it can duly register the app lication and send an acknowledgment of receipt for model replies see annex all replies even positive ones should be checked with unit 01 before they are sent out to ensure coherence of our overall approac h how to identify an appli cation for access to documents m ost applications carry reference to regulation 10492001 but there is obligation for request to mention the r egulation any request that refers to documents sh ould therefore be considered as an application within the meaning of re gulation 10492001 in case of doubt trade 01 should be consulted applicants are not ob liged to state the reasons for their application when an application is insufficiently clear we can ask the applicant for clarification or narrowing down of the request providing time parameters etc and if necessary help the applicant therein in which case the 15 days term only start s when the request is clarified art 62 the request for clarification should be discussed with unit 01 and sent out via u nit 01 within 15 working days ie 3 weeks from registration of the application the commission must either 1 provide access or 2 in written reply state the reasons for the total or partial refusal this implies giving fair explanation of why the invoked exceptions apply and not just indicating the legal ground for refusal in exceptional cases eg in case of an application for very large document or for very large number of documents this time limit can be extended by 15 extra days for complex requests for instance those which involve numerous documen ts andor various files andor concern different units andor consultation of another dg andor of third parties we usually try to leave the timeline open after discussion with the app licant and giving the applicant an explanation why in such cases art 63 of the regulation gives the commis sion the possibility to confer 8 with the applicant informally with view to findi ng fair solution dg trade has already had to resort to such solution several times failure to repl within the 15 day period is equivalent to refusing access giving the applicant the right to make confirmatory application to the sec retarygeneral documents are made available to the applicant eithe r in the fo rm of copy if necessary in electronic format and in exceptiona l cases if there is very large volume of material or if documents are difficult to handle via consultation on the spot the latter has not yet been the case for requests for access to dg trade documents in case the commission is consulted by another inst itution as provided by the memorandum of understanding further to request t that institution for access to commission document the commission has 5 days to r eact this can b done informally simple mail and is coordinated by trade 01as provided in remedies refusal to provide access to all or part of reque sted document gives the applicant the right to submit confirmatory application to the secretary general within 15 working days 3 weeks of receiving dg trades reply in case of refusal of confirmatory request or failure to repl by the sg the applicant is entitled to bring an action in the court of first instance or to make complaint to the ombudsman for further info see the sgs access to documents websi httpwwwcccechomedgservsgdocinterindex_en htm 9 ii access to dg t rade documents the basic rule is that every document has to be assessed on case by case basis on the basis of its content single type of dg trade document is automaticall excluded from the right to access negotiating directives negotiating directives as such are not necessar ily excluded however in practice in reviewing the annexes to the negotiating mandates we ve until now always found that they fall under the exceptions of decision making proces s and international relations the explana tory m emorandum and the recommendations need to be looked at carefully on case bycase basis parts of them may be factual and already of public knowledge and therefore should be made available b ut other parts may be covered by the exception of decision making process3 negotiating documents negotiating positions and documents exchanged betwe the commission and negotiat ing partners as well as information notes to the college on th state of play of negotiations can under certain circumstances also be covered by the exceptions of ar t 41 protection of international relations and ar t 43 documents for internal use relating to matter where the decision has not yet been taken but this has to be assessed on case bycase basis for each document in case of documents originating from negotiating partners the exception of international relations applies if that c ountry does not agree with its disclosure see above on documents from othe r states the time factor is very important here d epending on the state of advan cement of negotiations past positions may already be publicl known ie longer have any news value in which case disclosure will longer have an impact on decisi on making anymore on the other hand t he removal of the 30 years timelimit on the exception provided for in art 47 for sensitive documents may in certain exceptional circumstan ces also apply to negotiating documents which can therefore be protected both before and after the conclusion of negotiations reports and m inutes of meetings reports or m inutes of meetings are not excluded per it has to be assessed on case bycase basis whether the exceptions apply to all or part s of the document the full document must be considered including c omments summaries follow up points etc for the minutes of meetings between the commissioner and his opposite numbers the exception in article 43 decision making process can be invoked only if the 3 where access is being given to parts of an eu restricted document for com documents 01 asks the s g to declassify those parts of the document for sec documents 01 declassifies relevant parts and informs the sg which in turn updates sg vista and the register 10 content has news value at the time of rel easing the documents ie contains positions facts viewpoints which are not yet know n to the general public and therefore shed new light on th decision taken or to be taken but cf the public interest test and the time limits content of documents business secrets and names of p ersons business secrets that industry shares with us fall under the protection of commercial interests in the case of reports or minutes of meetings with industry only those parts of the minutes that fall under one or m ore exceptions will be protected obviously we will not always be in position to d etermine whether something is business secret in wh ich case it is better to take cautious approach or to cross check with the co mpany concerned name of the company and its representatives date of the meeting and factual elements should nor mally be included unless we can prove that releasing that in formation could affect their business interest names of persons eg participants to meeting signatories to l etter etc are not deleted unless we can show that revealing such name may harm that per sons integrity art 41b and court jurisprude nce for instance ther would be reason to delete the names of persons whose daily business is to defend their company s or their industrys interests nor the names of c ommission staff copied in an email it is for the commission to provide evidenc that revealing name would be harmful to the person in question industry consultations and other consultations the right of access applies also to documents held by the commission and received from third parties hence replies to industry consultation s or consultations of other stakeholders for instance in the context of market access pre parations of fta negotiations identification of offensive and d efensive interests etc also fall under the regulation at the same time those replies though bject to individual review can also be covered by the exceptions and most notably commercial interests art 42 first indent which can potentially apply to sensitive i nformation provided in that context or in cases where the disclosure of the fact that given company has participated in consultation andor given specific information coul d harm their interests or their competitive position in the eu or in trading part ner however the bottom line is that we can not offer 100 guarantee of confidentiality to third parties participating in consultations you may wish to add disclaimer to any consultation document or questionnaire where the results are not intended to be public explaining that contributions received are subject to eu rule s on public access to documents and the exceptions provided within those rules briefings information notes to the commission briefings also need to be assessed on case bycase basis however we receive relatively few requests for briefing material and this may often fall under the decision making exception of art 43 the news value of the content is also key element here in assessing whether the exception applies we often receive requests for information notes to the college which are usua lly drafted by the cabinet there is per exclusion of such notes which often are carefully drafted in any event key factor will b whether the information contained in the note is still relevant to any decision the c ommission still has to take or might 11 impact our relations with third parties if released as general rule if information notes are more than year old we may have relative ly few concerns about their release documents of the 133 and other council working part ies not per exclud ed 3 categories need to be considered i documents originating in the commission which are marked public or which are available on the internet can be consider ed public for documents marked as limited or eu restricted disclosure of all or part of the documents must be assessed on case bycase basis ii documents originating in the member states treated as third party documents with the specific rule in article 45 the member state is consulted and justification for non release must b based on one of the grounds of article 4 iii report s of the 133 or other council or ep committee s in principle excluded under arti cle 43 timing and news value are also important criteria here dispute settlement procedures and legal opinions legal opinions on potential cases brought compatibility of third country measures with wto rules or bilateral rules or defended in t he wto compatibility of community measures with wto rules or bilateral rules automatically falls under the exception of art 42 only i f it originates from the legal service notes from opinions by the dg trade unit on legal aspects of trade policy can not be excluded on the basis of art 42 however notes to prepare the decision to seize the wto or relating to cases under way or concluded at the wto can fall under the exception of international relations art 41 andor decision making art 43 submissions received from other parties to dispute at the wto are cov ered by the exception in art 41 internati onal relations since they are governed by article 18 of the wtos dsb regulation which obliges us to maint ain confidentiality staff and budget issues partly covered by the exception in article 41 protection of privacy partly by the exceptions in article 43 documents for internal use relating to matter where the decision has not yet been taken and in very speci fic cases where retroactive transmission could seriously undermine the decision making process tender dossiers are in principle covered by the exception in article 42 protection of commercial interests rules on tender files apply dg budg antidumping anti subsidy safeguard and tbr proceedings the documents received in this context are mainly c overed by the exception in art icle 42 protection of commercial interests of natural or legal person court proceedings and legal advice and of the purpose of investigations and partly by the exception in article 41 protection of public interest as rega rds international relatio ns information received from third party during an investigation is covered by the exception in article 42 which includes all the in formation received pursuant to 12 regulations or decisions in the field of trade defe nce instruments throughout proceedin gs initiated in accordance with the basic regulatio ns in this field and until the conclusion of any court proceedings andor disp ute settlements at the wto which may result from these administrative procedures t his corresponds to the practice adopted si nce 1994 the exception in article 43 first sub paragraph applies to internal or preparatory documents produced in the c ourse of proceedings the exception in article 43 second sub paragraph may be applied to internal or preparatory documents produ ced in the course of proceedings which contain poli cy positions of horizontal nature and are not case specific information received from thirdparty during an investigation is covered by the exc eption in article 41 since it is governed by article 6 of the wto anti dumping agreement which obliges us to maintain confidentiality under article 47 even after proceeding is term inated the exception can continue to apply to documents that might disclose business secrets investigation practices or methods or personal positions that could jeopardis the internal decision making process which are not to be disclosed horizontal documents policy notes procedural or investigation manuals are closely linked to investigations and can be included i n the general category of documents preparatory to decision but are not necessarily exempted from the regulation they have to be examined on case bycase basis so far access to most policy notes and clarification papers has been reje cted and parti access has been granted to some however case is now pending wit h the ombudsman and the court of first instance the same holds for all documents relating to the eu s defence against the actions of third countries they can remain protected even aft er the initiation of court proceedings or dispute settlement and if necessary even longer after these procedures under one of the statutory exceptions in force case bycase decision where tdi cases are pending before the cfiecj the file related to t hat case is considered to fall fully under the exception in art icle 42 second indent for the trade barriers regulation the same type of exclusion s apply nonpublic commission documents put on third party webs ites request s for non public documents w hich have been leaked to the public or have even been put on web sites by third parties must be handled as if the document s were not yet public studies studies carried out for the commission by n external consultant should be treated in the same way as any internal commission document the letter accom panying the positive reply to request for access to study must specify that the study was carried out by independent experts and that the com mission cannot be held responsible for its content 13 iii practical implications for dg t rade drafting of documents each official must be aware that all hisher documents including meeting reports and emails can potentially be disclosed you should keep this in mind when writing such documents this is particu larly the case for meeting reports and mails with third parties eg industry which are favourite targets of requests for acc ess to documents especially by ngos therefore all relevant documents must be drafted with utmost care bearing in mind t hat they may be made public at some point few tips when writing meeting report separate factual elements ie neutral account of what actually happened in the meeting and what was said by the participant s from assessments and personal subjecti ve comments or opinions eg your personal evaluation of the meeting your opinion on the real intentions of one or more participants your assessment of the situation etc and follow up points this would allow us to have to release only the fa ctual par t of the report and avoid partial release the best thing to do is to make two separate documents ie one factual report and separate one with the assessment of t he report and possibly suggestions for follow up by doing this we avoid having to whiten certain p arts of the report which creates an additional work burden scrutinise the documents determine what has to be deleted and justify why it has been deleted and which always carries risk of confirmatory action or even recourse to the ombudsman or the court who may ultimately find that the invocation of exception grounds was n ot justified and even order the deleted parts to be disclosed when writing report avoid recording statements which may turn out to be politically em barrassi ng for those who have made them and avoid adding such comment s to the report itself avoid making personal comments in emails with third parties which may be the object of disclosure for instance when writing an mail to an external contact w hich you happen to know personally or have contacts with outside the professional sphere refrain from any message that may be of personal nature eg dont refer to the great lunch you have had with an industry representative privately or add ps askin g if heshe would like to meet for drink filing and registration of documents given the very short time frames in which documents have to be found and the request has to be handled it is of utmost importance that such documents can be easily identifi ed and found some of our biggest headaches have related to meeti ngs or correspondence before 2006 where responsibiliti have shifted between units or where people have join ed or left posts in the meantime hence the importance of proper filing and regis tration of documents according to the rules and guidelines of the commission and of dg trade see httpwwwtradececeuintintrahowdocmanaginde xcfm the principal tools are 14 likely to be adonis ares tsar where all records reports of meetings should also be stored outlook to establish possible meetings and the units own filing system registration of key documents incoming and outgoing letters mails notes is done through the adonis system important emails must also be registered the general rule is that any mail containing important information which is not shor tlived and which is likely to require action follow up or reply from the commission or to involve the responsibility of the commission or dg must be registered but non registered documents in particular meeting reports and certain emails may also have to be disclosed in that case proper filing system which allows to trace back all types of documents including mails even after the official which has drafted them has left the unit is key s is the case for registration criteria for filing of emails are the same as for any other document in particular it is of utmost importance to ensure that files of colleagues which have left the unit remain ac cessible in the public folders as far as meeting reports are concerned putting reports of meetings in tsar at least in cas where meetings have been bject through briefing request greatly facilitates the task of tracing meeting reports we wo uld advise each unit to set up functional mail box to which all meeting reports are ccd the trade coordination team has created new functional mail box where you can copy records of meetings phone calls where the director general participates trad dos meeting reports the dg s team will then attach these records to the corresponding tsar request for future reference while for meetings with the ddgs this box will act as repository which can be accessed for searching in t he future in case of p roblems in tracing documents which have been written or received by an official who has left the unit or the dg the norma l practice is to consult those colleagues who are still in the commission but not those who have retired or left it is up to each u nit to ensure that its current filing and archiving system is reliable so that it is easy to find documents in th very short time limits laid down by the regulation internal organisation for access to documents in
