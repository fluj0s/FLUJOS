the leading kmt candidate ma yingjeou this report will not be updated taiwans january 12 2008 legislative elections were the first held under new electoral rules adopted in 2005 under an amendment to the republic of chinas taiwans constitution under the old electoral rules voters had only one ballot to cast in multimember districts where as many as 12 candidates competed against one another even if they were from the same party this system functioned at cost to party discipline and was thought to encourage radicalism with candidates able to be elected with as little as five percent of the vote in given district the 2005 electoral changes halved the size of the legislature to 113 members from its former size of 225 and increased the term of office from three years to four the new rules also instituted new singlemember district system employing two ballots for voters similar to systems used in germany and japan one to be cast for candidate and one to be cast for political party as expected the new system has appeared to favor larger wellorganized parties and to put smaller parties and fringe elements at disadvantage in the previous legislature the opposition kmt had held bare majority by joining with partner the people first party pfp in coalition that became known as the panblue coalition while the dpp partnered with the taiwan solidarity union tsu in the pangreen coalition of nearly equal strength but in the january 12th vote the kmt emerged with solid controlling crs2 majority of 81 seats against the ruling dpps anemic win of 27 seats the former coalition partner parties the pfp and tsu were effectively wiped out under the new electoral rules suggesting the end at least temporarily of panbluepangreen coalition politics five seats were gained by independent and smaller party candidates all of whom are expected to side with kmt positions while kmt legislative victory was expected under the new electoral rules the wide margin surprised most analysts and dealt serious blow to dpp aspirations to be victorious in the march 22 2008 presidential election president chen shuibian stepped down as head of the dpp party saying he took full responsibility for his partys loss he is termlimited as taiwans president and will be stepping down in may 2008 adding to the dpps misfortune voters also failed to pass two referendum measures one dpp measure asking whether the government should attempt to seize assets the kmt is alleged to have embezzled during its unbroken rule on the island from 1949 2000 and one kmt measure asking whether the legislature should be given power to investigate official corruption the two referenda which needed to reach threshold of 50 of the participating electorate for passage were seen as litmus tests for more controversial referendum proposed by president chen for the upcoming march 22 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22791 presidential election asking whether taiwan should apply to the united nations for full membership under the name taiwan rather than its formal name of the republic of china1 beijing considers the referendum to be tantamount to public poll on taiwan independence prospect china has vowed to prevent by force if necessary the united states has called taiwans proposal provocative the kmt historically is party of mainlanders who fled to taiwan from mainland china in 1949 it is politically conservative and strongly anticommunist although it is credited with engineering taiwans vibrant economic growth and transformation during its more than 50year rule on the island the kmts inability to offer clear and creative vision for taiwans future ultimately made it vulnerable to the proindependence dpp party which was able to elect its candidate chen shuibian to the presidency in elections in 20002 since then the kmt has portrayed itself as more responsible steward than the dpp for taiwans future it has soundly criticized the dpps posture toward beijing as unnecessarily confrontational and has promised to replace it with policy of engagement and cooperation the party also has gotten political mileage out of portraying president chen as insufficiently attentive to the needs of taiwans economy and business community as in the economic disadvantages taiwan business interests continue to face due to taiwans restrictions on contacts with mainland china3 implications for the march 2008 presidential election the kmts overwhelming victory in the legislative elections suggests that the party is now well placed to win the presidency back from the dpp in the presidential election scheduled for march 22 2008 kmt victory in march would leave both taiwans legislature and the 1 the referendum expected to be voted on in march also has to meet the 50 threshold for passage bar widely seen as out of reach for controversial measures 2 the traditional kmt policy held that there was only one china that taiwan was part of china and that one day taiwan would retake the mainland and china would be reunified 3 see crs report rl33510 taiwan recent developments and us policy choices by kerry dumbaugh crs3 executive in the hands of one party ending the legislativeexecutive split in taiwans government that has created political gridlock throughout the chen administration optimists suggest that this would lead to the kind of policy achievements that have eluded president chen more pessimistic observers allege that this development could return taiwan to quasi oneparty state leaving the dpp too weakened to function as the kind of robust opposition voice that vibrant democracy requires others have warned against the temptation to see geostrategic outcome in what they say is the very local and tactical nature of taiwans legislative elections4 they say that the islandwide contest that will elect taiwans next president will be very different process and that the electorate may seek to balance the overwhelming kmt legislative victory by seeking to hand the presidency to the dpp still even if the dpp is the winning party in marchs presidential election and divided government continues the kmts substantial legislative margin enough to veto legislative proposals or recall the president would appear to put the kmt in the drivers seat of taiwan policy implications for the united states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22791 while carefully stating they have preferences in taiwans political races officials in the bush administration have been vexed by president chen shuibians unpredictable political style his confrontational tactics with the peoples republic of china prc and by the difficulty of getting substantive action out of taiwans former gridlocked legislature as result us policy may seem to be wellserved by any developments that could tend to calm taiwans political waters and facilitate mature policy discourse such developments would appear to include more effective legislative process but more skeptical observers point out that while the kmts new legislative super majority will give it stronger voice taiwans gridlocked legislature also had kmt coalition majority mere numbers according to this view do not necessarily translate into compromise political unity or an active policy agenda even while the dpps new chairman frank hsieh has promised to pursue less confrontational approach toward china if the dpp is victorious in the march presidential election it is likely to continue to embrace the proindependence views that its radical base supports therefore confrontational politics and stalemate still could continue in the event of dpp victory in marchs presidential contest others have suggested that there may be different potential complications should the kmt win the presidency in march 2008 and gain full control of the taiwan government they point out that the kmt has long pledged to improve taiwans relations with the prc supporting closer cultural and economic ties and that kmtdominated government is thought to be welcomed by chinese leaders in beijing5 while any improvements in crossstrait relations are likely to support shortterm us goals some 4 yates steve comments during
