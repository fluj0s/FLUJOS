perman ent international criminal court of the more than 160 nations tha t participated in the rome conference 120 nations voted to adopt the rome statute of the international criminal court 7 nations voted against it while 21 nation s abstained the united states rejected the final document primarily because of th broad jurisdictional powers granted to the court the courts powers would include the authority to prosecute people fro m countries that do not sign and ratify the icc treaty as result us militar personnel stationed on foreign soil might be subject to in vestigations and prosecutions by the icc even if the united states does not become p arty to the icc treaty due to the fact that the global deployment of us military personnel exceeds any othe r country us officials are apprehe nsive over whether american armed forces may be likely candidates for frivolous or politically motivated referrals advocates of the icc treaty assert that sufficient safeguards exist to limit the courts jurisdiction notwithstanding this ssertion the clinton administration is not prepared to sign the icc treaty in its current form ultimately the administration will have to determine wha t role

tribunal began as response t world war ii and the disruption it brought to international peace and security individual criminal responsibility for war crimes genocide and crimes agains t humanity was first adjudicated in the nurember g and tokyo military tribunals these trials determined that individuals have international dut ies that transcend their national obligations and as resu lt should be held accountable for their actions recognizing the international dimension of these crimes in conjunction with these historic trials there were calls to create standing war crimes tribunal to adjudicate futur incidences of such atrocities many envisioned permanent tribunal as perhaps partial solution to deter future violation s and punish those responsible for committing widespread and systematic killing bringing per petrators of war crimes to justice was also intended to diminish the threat their actions pose to international peace an d security t he legacy of internal civil wars in the 1970s and the subsequent creation3 in the 1990s of security council ad hoc tribunals fo r the former yugoslavia and4 rwanda exemplified the necessity for deterrent judicial institution to ensure tha t5 perpetrators of war crimes could longer act with impunity these events coupled with the political convergence of internationallyminded groups includin g humanitarian legal and non governmental organizations helped forge transnational pressure to enhance international humanitarian law the international community initially attempted to address war crimes through agreements aimed at mitigating wartime behavior the codification of international rules to govern armed conflict and to outlaw attacks on civilians began in th nineteenth century these efforts significantly progressed in 1899 when twentysix6 sovereign states convened at the hague for the international peace conference and again eight years later in 1907 wh the second hague peace conference was held these

world war i the 1919 treaty of versailles provided for the creation8 of multinational tribunal to try the german emperor kaiser wilhelm ii for supreme offense against morality and the sanctity of treaties this treaty als granted the allies the power to try 21000 german citizens for war crimes9 however transnational tribunal was created and limited war crimes trials wer conducted by german courts only 13 out of the 901 accused were convicted kaiser wilhelm ii fled to holland and was never tried because the dutch refused to extradite him contemporaneously the treaty of sèvres attempted to expand war10 crimes trials to include crimes against humanity this treaty contained provisions11 allowing any state to prosecute these crimes regardless of its involvement in world war i this was unprecedented the treaty of sèvres however was never ratified and ultimately was superceded by the 1923 lausanne peace treaty which abandoned12 these penal provisions these early attempts to create international tribunals to address criminal act s committed during wartime did little to deter such crimes or encourage complianc with the laws of war the lack of enforcement of the hague conventions couple d with the reality that judicial body existed to adjudicate these international crimes led the league of nations to consider establishing high court of internationa l justice to try individuals

war crimes nd crimes against humanity individual responsibility for egregious14 violations of human rights was adjudicated for the first time in history th recognition of crimes against humanity was one of nurembergs legacies as was the development of substantive norms and principles of international criminal law however the principles of internatio nal law recognized by the charters and the tribunals of nuremberg and tokyo remained to be adopted by the rest of th international community in 1947 the general assembly established th international law commission ilc designating the ilcs objective as th promotion of the progressive development of international law and its codification the ilc was directed to formulate principles of international law that wer recognized in the charter of the nuremberg tribunal and to prepare draft code of offences against the peace and security of mankind shortly thereafter the 15 general assembly invited the international law commission to study th desirability and possibility of establishing an international judicial organ for the trial of persons charged with genocide or other crimes and requested th international law commission to pay

being an avid proponent of past ad hoc war tribunals the military tribunals of nuremberg and tokyo and more recently the icty and the ictr were us bac ked efforts during the formation of these tribunals the united states consistently worked with its european and security council allies t bring perpetrators of war crimes to justice the united states continued this effort during the preparatory drafting of the icc statute and played significant role i n formulati ng numerous provisions of the draft statute the aim of the united states along with its allies was to develop permanent international criminal judicia l institutio n to replace ad hoc war crimes tribunals to augment the existing rule f international law and to p revent the repetition of the types of outrages committed in bosnia rwanda cambodia and iraq the clinton administration endorsed the general idea of an icc during th preparatory stages of the courts formulation while speaking at the united nations

particularly apprehensive over the iccs jurisdiction over the us armed forces they are concerned that u s military personnel will be targeted41 for criminal investigation by adversaries this is d isconcerting since the united states has the largest number of troops deployed overseas who are often the first to b utilized in troubled areas around the globeperiodically at the request of th international commun ity this makes possible situation in which the united states would be drawn into hostile region and then become subject to court action therefore this places us servicemen potentially more at risk for frivolous referrals or politically motivated attacks visàvis the icc the jurisdictional provisions of the court are pivotal to many of the interrelated us concerns the provisions of the icc treaty extend the courts jurisdiction to nonparticipating countries therefore if the uni ted states does not ratify this treaty its troops could still be subject to the courts jurisdiction hypothetically suc h complaints could be lodged against us personnel serving in multinationa l peacekeeping oper ations overseas for instance if us peacekeepers stationed in foreign country are alleged to have committed war crimes that country could refer the case to the icc th country would have the authority to refer the case because the alleged crimes occurred on its territory therefore the court could clai m jurisdiction over us nationals because the country where the alleged crime s transpired is party to the icc treaty or if it is not party to the treaty voluntarily consents to the iccs jurisdiction for that particular case 42 the united states has ma intained that countrys consent to the prosecution of its nationals should be required unless the security council

the icc so it could exercise i ts veto power when deliberating over potential cases this case referral deference to the security council was one of the assurances the united states sought to void what it feared could be the politicization of the court in the us view granting case referral authority to countries without the consent of th nationals government and to the independent prosecutor dilutes

1969 entered45 into force jan 27 1980 articles 3438critics contend that allowing us veto authority would have created the ver politicization the united states finds objectionable the ineligibili ty of nonparticipating states to adopt 7year immunity from the prosecution of war crimes is another effect of the statutes jurisdictional provisions stated plainly countries that are bound by the treaty are given the option of adopting transitional provision this provision allows them to optout of any investigations or prosecutions for war crimes for the first 7 years after the treaty enters into force conversely nationals of states not party to the treaty are immediately subject to war crimes prosecutions because nonparticipating states are not entit led to this transitional optout provision fo r instance if country is party to the treaty it can choose to adopt the transitional provision anytime during the first 7 years the treaty is in force and its citizens will be immun from war crimes prosecutions via the icc during that 7year period whereas if the us does not participate in the treaty it will not b eligible for this immunity r esulting in possible war crimes prosecutions by the icc of us citizens if the treaty enters into force furthermore the amendment procedures would allow states that are bound to the icc treaty to reject jurisdiction on crimes that may subsequently be added to the treaty again countries that are not bound to the icc treaty would be subject to the courts juri sdiction over these new crimes ambassador scheffer maintains that the icc does not afford nonparticipating nations the same jurisdictional protections as party states related point of contention for the united states was the scope and timeframe of the optout provision the united states supported longer transitional provision so countries could assess the effectiveness and impartiality of the court 10year time period was advocated in which countries could elect to opt out of the war crimes and crimes against humanity provisions this would give countrie s sufficient time to make such determination finally the jurisdictional provisions of the court raise questions about th international treaty regime one of the basic tenets of international treaty law is that treaties are binding on parties to the agreement to assert that treaty extend s45 beyond the parties as is proposed by the icc treaty essentially nullifies th ratification process required to assent to the terms of treaty international response to us concerns international perspectives regarding the us positi on on the icc vary but many feel that us fears are overblown some countries contend that even if unwarranted charges were lodged the icc treaty has sufficient builtin safeguards to protec t against such frivolous claims freq uent references are made to the predominant us role in meting out justice in the military tribunals following wwii as well as it s advocacy of the ad hoc tribunals

disagreeing wit h responsible us military actions on their territory could lodge charges agains t american troops in an ttempt to avert international attention from the conflict or to hamstring us military or foreign policy initiatives another possible politica l manipulatio n could arise if failing leader levied charges in an attempt to energiz support or regain political power hypothetically

assertions the potential tha t nations may elect to wage their political battles in this judicial forum has the united states assessing how to safeguard american legal rights over seas one outcome might be the restriction of future us foreign policy initiatives involving military alliance obligations and multinationa l operations protection of us troops from frivolous false or politically motivate d accusations is paramount to the current us position proponents perspectives towards the icc proponents of the court while acknowledgi ng that the rome statute is flawed nonethe less hail it as an historic agreement that can be amended to improve it s effectiveness advocates of the court als maintain that there are enough safeguards to allay us concerns some observers have commented that the interests of us citizens would be better protected if the united states became party to the ic c treaty under this scenario the united states could adopt the optout provisio n protecting us citizens from war crimes for 7 years and be eligible to reject th courts jurisdiction over newly added crimes seven years after the icc treaty enters into force amendment s to the treaty may be proposed at that time they argue the united states could work within the framework of the agreement to address it s concerns over contentious provisions currently the united states does t52 consider this viable option backers of the icc treaty additionally contend that us adamance during the negotiations strengthened many provisions sp ecifically the priority given to nationalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs14 signing treaty is an indication of states preliminary intent to assent to the provisions of the53 document it must be followed by ratification in accor dance with each countrys domestic procedures for ratification frequently cited example is countrys laws pertaining to extradition for example som e54 countries have very strict laws regarding extradition while others countries are not parties t extradition treaties andor conventions this conside ration is significant because the court will have to rely on intern ational cooperation when it requests the delivery or transfer of alleged perpetrators for prosec ution recent illustration of the complexities of extradition is the case of forme r president augusto pinochet of chile pinochets extradition rests on whether the requirements of british extradition law are met considerat ion will be given to whether the offenses are extradition crimes whether the request is properly authenticated whether the offenses are of politica l character and any comp assionate circumstances for more about the pinochet case see supra 50 one frequently cited example pertains to israel the inclusion of the transfer directly r55 indirectly emphasis added by the occupying power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies in the definition of war crimes would arguably make israels settlement in the west bank and gaza strip war crime article 82bviii courts to prose cute cases due process protections and pretrial chamber approval of the actions of the prosecu tor these factors in conjunction with the assertion that the crimes to be adjudicated before the icc are not t hose typically committed by us forces further reduces the probability of the prosecution of us nationals advocates also point to three factors that threaten to weaken the court i n bringing alleged perpetrators to justice the first is us nonparticipation in thi s international criminal judicial institution the second is the problem of travelin g dictators and the third is the 7year optout clause for war crimes without us backing many fear that the icc will not achieve the legitimacy needed to carry out its mandate additionally the rome statu lacks provision to allow country that has custody of an accused perpetrator to initiate case heads of state or forme r heads of state may be free to travel to other countries without fearing capture and surrender to the icc for instance if saddam hussein commits war crimes against his own people in iraq and then travels on vacation to neighboring state or seeks medical care in sympathetic country the custodial state has authority t surrender saddam hussein to the court for prosecution because the crimes wer committed in iraq saddam hussein would either have to consent to his ow n prosecution or iraq would have to be party to the icc treaty both scenario s appear unlikely finally allowing countries to opt out of war crimes prosecutions for 7 years gives governments immunity from these crimes during the 7year period as mentioned pr eviously if country were party to the icc treaty its citizens could arguably commit war crimes for the first 7 years of the courts existence and the would be immune from prosecution for these crimes by the icc in spite of the provisional weakness of the icc treaty the internationa l community overwhelmingly voted to adopt the rome statute although 71 state s have signed it rati fication by the requisite number of states may be complicated and time consuming some outstanding factors that may prove decisive include whether53 the icc provis ions comply with the municipal law of states and whether countries54 are willing to confront the political implications presented by the provisions of the55 icc treatyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs15 this information has been gathered from documents state department materials and th e56 nongovernmental organization community precedents for the definition of crimes against humanity can be found in the nuremberg charter57 the tokyo charter the yugoslavia tribunal statute and the rwanda tribunal statute precedents for the definition of w ar crimes can be found in the 1899 and 1907 hague conventions58 and regulations and the four 1949 geneva conventions and additional protocols in accordance with article 8 war crimes may occur during international armed conflicts article59 82b as well as internal conflicts article 82cf the united states along with majority of countries supported the inclusion of internal conflicts but differed as to the circumstances unde r which the icc would have jurisdiction for comparison see appendix the final act of the united nations diplomatic conference of plenipotentiaries on th e60 establishment of an international criminal court otherwise referred to as the addendum to th rome statute rec ognizes that the crimes of international terrorism and illicit drug trafficking pose serious thre at to international peace and security based on the lack of consensus during th rome negotia tions on acceptable definitions for these crimes the final act recommends that review confer

brought before the icc sub ject matter jurisdiction are limited to serious crimes of concern to the international community namely genoci crimes against humanity war crimes57 58 and aggression if the icc treaty enters into force these crimes will not be subject to any statute of limitations article 29 for complete listing of the actual acts that determine these crimes see appendix d in addition to these core crimes 59 international terrorism and illicit drug trafficking may come within the purview of the court 7 years after the icc treaty enters into force60 us rational while the united states supported th core crimes of genocide wa r crimes and crimes agains t humanity as within the court s jurisdiction it opposed th inclusion of the crime f aggression because of the lack of generally accepte dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs16 the importance of this definition should not be overlooked it might ultimately redefine or modify61 both the concept and conduct of warfare general assembly resolution 3314 xxix is frequently cited as source for the definition f62 aggression this resolution only determines acts of aggression by states and not individuals article 13a states situation in which one or more of such crimes appears to have bee n63 committed is referred to the prosecutor by sta party in accordance with article 14 article 13c states the prosecutor has initiated an investigation in respect of such crime in accordance with article 15 three types of jurisdiction are evid ent in this provision 1 inherent jurisdiction 2 jurisdiction by64 state consent and 3 iversal jurisdiction article 121 is an example of inherent jurisdiction state automatically accepts the courts ju risdiction over the core crimes upon ratification of the icc continueddefinition pursuant to the charter acts of aggression fall within the mandate61 of the security council as result the application of this crime whe n62 determining an individuals accountability is problematic the united states als sought to exclude the crimes of international terrori sm and illicit drug trafficking from the courts jurisdiction assertin g that the courts scope should be limited to the most egregious crimes us opposition to the inclusion of these crimes was als predicated on the position that national law enforcement efforts to adjudicate these crimes are more effective in this view nations are better equipped to investigat these complex crimes by using their own domestic legal agencies and intelligenc resources to uncover crime organizations the iccs jurisdiction and us sovereignty jurisdiction over an indiv idual is dependent on whether the icc can exercise its authority to prosecute the allege d perpetrator of the crime the manner in which the icc would be able to employ its jurisdictional powers is based on the thre preconditions set out in article 12 of the rome statute 1 state which becomes party to this statute accepts the jurisdiction of the court with respect to the core crimes referred to in article 5 2 in the case of article 13 paragraph or c the court may exercise63 its jurisdic tion if one or more of the following states are parties to thi s statute or have accepted the jurisdiction of the court in accordance with paragraph 3 the state on the territory of which the c onduct in question occurred or if the cri was committed on board vessel or aircraft the state f registration of that vessel or aircraft b the state of which the person accused of the crime is national 3 if the acceptance of state which is not party to this statute i s required under paragraph 2 tha t state may by declaration lodged with the registrar accept the exercise of jurisdiction by the court with respect to the crime in question64httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs17 continued64 treaty article 124 referred to as the optout provision gives states parties the option f temporarily opting out of war crimes if s tate chooses to adopt this provision the icc would have inherent jurisdiction over genocide and crimes against humanity for that state until the optou t period lapses thereafter it would have inherent jurisdiction over all core crimes articles 122 and 123 are comprised of consent jurisdiction and form of universal jurisdiction state consent jurisdiction mandates that interested states give their consent to be bound while the principle f universal jurisdiction extends the power to exercise jurisdiction over state regardless of whether it voluntarily accedes to jurisdiction it is this form of facto universal jurisdiction that the united states vehemently opposes during the negotiations this position was reserved by the united states pending the decision on65 the role of the security councilus position during the rome conference supported consent of nonparty state s prior to the prosecution of thei r nationals supported automatic jurisd iction only for the crime of genocide for states tha t ratify the icc treaty proposed 10year trans itional provision to optout of the courts jurisdiction for crimes ag ainst humanity and war crimesus ratio nale the most contentious issue the unite d states addressed in rome wa s the preconditions to jurisdic tion because it directly affect s national sovereignty the us position was advocated t protect us military personne l stationed on foreign soil fro m prosecution wi thout the consent of the us governme nt allow ing case investigations of us citizens based on the consent of other countries was an unac ceptable outcome f or the united states the requirement f nonratifying state consent was to prevent the court from proceeding if th government of the accused refused to accede to icc jurisdiction the us 65 positions on automatic jurisdiction and the optout pr ovision were advocated to allow countries to as sess the effectiveness and impartiality of the court before committing to its absolute jurisdicti on the united states position that automatic jurisdiction be applicable only to genocide was based on its belief that the most egregious crim should not be subject to state consent support for assenting to automati c jurisdiction for the most egregious crime whi providing transitional period for war crimes and crimes against humanity also had national sovereignty implications it was argued that by preserving voluntary acceptance of the courts jurisdiction for 1 0 years countries would be given sufficient time to objectively observe the neutrality of the icc the united states proposed that at the end of this period states party to the icc would have to either 1 accept automatic jurisdiction over all core crimes 2 cease to be party to the icc treaty or 3 seek to amend the optout provision limits

twice another effect of this provision should not be dismissed th possibility for potential manipulations of the judicial process some have questioned whether this challenge will be used by governments to shield alleged perpetrators by either delaying an ic c prosecution or conducting socalled sham trialsus position during the rome conference advocated that the icc should b prohibited from proceeding with situation that the securit council is addressing under its chapte r vii powers unless the securit council expressly states otherwise declaring the court as complementary to national criminal jurisdictions thi s concept of complem entarity basically holds that countrys national criminal system has the principal responsibility for adjudicating alleged perpetrators of war crimes cases will only be brought befo re the icc when national systems are not functioning or are ineffective thereby complementing not replacing natio nal courts for instance when state is unwilling to administer the law or unable to do so due to stat collapse the icc can step in to adjudicate 66 article 18 of the rome statute grants states the right to challenge the courts jurisdiction this right can be asserted if state that has primary jurisdiction i s currently prosecuting or investigating the case this challenge is also applicable for previously investigated or prosecuted cases the statute requires that any challenge67 must be made prior to the iccs trial of the accused the power to defer prosecutions for period of twelve months is granted to the security council under article 16 of the rome statute the five permanen t members of the security council must unanimously agree to defer prosecution fo llowing agreement resolution must be adopted in accordance with chapter vii of the charter of the united nations these deferral periods ar renewable on an unlimited basis us rationale to protect american military personne l from politically motivated pro secutions the united state s sought to assure that the security council maintain cas referral aut hority charter chapter vii powers pertain t threats or breaches of inter national security since suc h situations would come before the security council the united states as ne of five permanent members could withhold approval thereby vetoing and ultimately halting an investigation thi s would gra nt any of the permanent security council members veto power over caserelated investigations additionally the united states wanted to preserve th security council s role and its powerful position on the council in the work of the court without marginalizing the permanent members powers httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs19 this position is perhap s an international reflection of the domestic debate occurring in the united68 states over the prosecutorial powers of the independent counselus position during the rome conference advocated that only the securit council or state party to the ic c treaty should have the authority t trigger investigations the prosecutor s role is to investigate cases that have been referredthe iccs procedural structure some procedural aspects of the cour t were patterned after its predecessors but many procedural provisions were expanded to enhance the effect iveness of the judicial process for comparison of the iccs rganizational and procedural structure with prior tribunals see appendix case referrals in accordan ce with article 13 cases may be referred to the court by stat party to the icc treaty the security council or the prosecutor although the prosecutor is granted authority to trigger an investigation thi s authority is constrained by compulsory judicial approval prior to proceeding with an investigation th prosecutor must present case evidence to the judges in the pretrial chamber fo r review us rationale prosecu torial autonomy was rejected by the united states on th grounds that one individual with so much power may take u p frivolous or politically moti vated complaints an analogous contention was that legitimat actions taken by responsibl governments should not b subject to case determination s made by potentially over zealous prosecutor furthermore the possibility of overwhelming the court wit h complaints is also likely because information for alleged crimes may come fro m various sources ie case referrals are longe r limited to states or the security council consequently the prosecutors office could become embroiled in political decisionmaking68 rights of the accused articles 20 55 63 66 and 67 grant criminal justice safeguards to the alleged perpetrator many of which were modeled after the due process protection s guarant eed to defendants by the us judicial system although the united state s fervently advocated the inclusion of these rights potential problems may arise as to whether these rights afford synonymous rights as those guaranteed to us citizens under the first and fourth amendments of the us constitution under the rome statute the rights of the accused become effective once an investigation by th prosecutor is commenced such assurances include the right not to incriminate ones self httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs20 article 68 provides for an exception to the right to confront ones accusers witnesses may b e69 protected when the alleged crime involves sexual violence gender

reservations are specific qualifications or stipulations which change countrys obligations to treaty without altering the actual language of the treatyus position during the rome conference supported the icc as an independen t treatybased organization supported the position that the ic c should be funded by states party to th icc treaty during the rome conference advocated close relationship between the icc and the united nations arguing that such relationship would enhance the court s effectiveness but consensus among the delegations was reached another factor that will influence the iccs relationship with the united nations is the sourc of the iccs funding articles 115117 of the treaty adopted hybrid approach whereby financing for the court may come from three sources 1 assessed contributions from by states parties 2 funds provided by the united nations which is funded by member nations and 3 voluntary contributions made by governments international organizations individuals corporations and other entities th assessment of contributions from st ates parties is to be in accordance with an agreed scale of assessment predicated on the scale adopted by the united nations for it s regular budget us rationale primarily the united states sought t avoid subjecting the court t possible political manipulation court closely linked with th united nations might becom mired in its bureaucracy an d give the united nations poli tical institution some contro l over judicial institution ad ditionally any dependence n the regular budget fo r funding might compromise the independent

s81 beyond the scope of this report however the treatment of extradition proceedings under unite d states law is frequently cited as an example of the constitutionality of us citizens being charged and adjudicated by foreign legal systems of particular concern is the possible eligibility of individuals from rogue countries to sit i n82 judgment of americans article 364 of the icc treaty maintains that only nationals of states party to the treaty can be nominated to be judges rogue countries would first have to consent to th jurisdiction of the court additionally b efore representatives of these countries could judge citizens of other nations they would have to be deemed qualified article 36 3 and elected by other states parties to the icc treaty article 3656sen helmss concerns were based on his objections to the internationalization f justice and encroachment upon the constitutional liberties of us citizens he81 reiterated these concerns prior to the rome conference in letter to secretary of state madeline albright he gain raised the issues of constitutional due process and the judicial makeup of court that would have the power to sit in judgment of us82 citizens implications despite us efforts some observers contend that many of the compromise s made to finalize the key provisions of the rome statute place us national interests at risk as result the clinton administration is not prepared to sign the icc treaty in its current form additionally any subsequent consideration is unlikely unles s corrective measures are taken to amend the jurisdictional powers of the court the political paradox created by the icc provisions may have direc t consequ ence on us military alliance participation the united states as majo r contributor to international peacekeeping missions is often called upon to commi t us forces to such missions because the jurisdictional reach of the icc may extend to american citizens without us consent us military leaders may be apprehensive about future commitment of troop s legal assurances by us allies not to surrender us citizens to the court via protective sof provisions might abate this concern how might this affect our nato military commitments what effect will this have on future us peacekeeping and military operations how will this effect ou r relationship with allies or other treaty obligations how will america respond if its citizens are summoned before this international judicial institution the gap in international criminal justice has been repeatedly acknowledged s have the complexities of creating transnational tribunal melding various legal an d political systems the efforts in rome were testament to these difficulties although there is widespread agreement that individuals responsible for genocide ethnic clea nsing mass killings torture and other crimes against humanity should be punished the outstanding question is whether the rome statute in its present form creates the proper judicial body to adjudic ate these cases if the icc treaty does not come into force or takes years to establish the sole international avenue to address occurrences of war crimes or future cases of egregious international crimes remains security council establishment of ad hoc tribunals as was done in the cases ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs26 the united states

impetus from the nuremberg trials the concept of permanent icc has been discussed since wwii however the effort was derailed by cold war politics recent events such as the security council forming war crimes tribunals after the atrocities in rwanda and the former yugoslavia provided momentum fo r creating permanent court president clinton in two speeches at the an d recently in kigali and senior administration officials have publicly supported th creation of the court 5 military equity the primary military equity is to protect troops and commanders from inappropriate investigation and prosecution unlike most treaty regimes th icc would directly affect individua l troops vice governments individual servicemen and women could be vulnerable to inappropriate investigation and prosecution even if country had not joined the treaty and even if th eir own military justice system hadhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs31 investigated and acquitted or determined not to prosecute them therefore troops of all militaries could be affected not just of those countries that sign the treaty 6 the following talking points are provided to highlight critical issues and the us positions on them in your discussions with counterparts preventing and prosecuting war crimes crimes against humanity an d genocide is critically important priority for the us every nation s responsibility to prevent and punish war crimes we should all take our national and international responsibilities seriously and hold other s accountable for doing the same we should also support international efforts in this regard for example the us and others have provided important resources and personnel in support of the bosnia and rwanda war crimes tribunals the us is committed to replace the ad hoc approach to international wa r crimes tribunals with standing court that can address future cambodias r yugoslavias b states bear primary responsibility for prosecuting nd punishing these crimes but this international system has be supplemented by ad hoc international tribunals the us supports complementing this system by establishing permanent tribunal for these crimes which could f ill gaps in national jurisdiction in those situations such as bosnia or rwanda where functioning national legal syste m is not available whether because of civil war collapse of government or other breakdown the icc would be availabl in such circumstance helping to deter war criminals who migh t otherwis believe that the breakdown of government will allow them to evad accountability c negotiations for an icc are being conducted in new york 16 march to 3 april and will culminate in diplomatic conference to conclude treaty in rome in july 1998 the us is committed to the successful establishment of court but we are also intent on avoiding the creation of the wrong kind of court d we are co ncerned that an icc lacking appropriate limits and checks an d balances could be used by some governments and organizations for politicall motivated purposes since war crimes make up the majority of offenses subject to the jurisdiction of the court actions of armed forces are th most likely target of frivolous referrals or politicallytargeted or otherwise inappropriate prosecutions we ar concerne d about proposals that could subject military personnel of countries tha t abide by the laws of armed conflict and have national mechanisms to enforc complianc with them by their service members to icc criminal investigation fo r actual or threatened military action we must preclude the creation of socalle d proprio motu independent prosecutor with unbridled discretion to star t investigations we are also especially concerned that some delegations hav supported overly broad and vague definitions of war crimes we strongly recommend that you take an active inter est in the negotiations regarding an international criminal courthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs32 we have several specific concerns in the current negotiations jurisdiction states with highly developed natio nal legal systems who have the right and duty to investigate and if appropriate prosecute crimes the icc will deal with should not be overruled by the court the rel ationship of states to the court is one of central importance to th united states we have reserved on whether the state of the nationality of th accused should have prior right of consent to prosecution the draft treaty must ensure that citizens are protected from arbitrary or frivolous charges or any othe r form of inappropriate investigation or prosecution appropriate jurisdictional provisions complementarity would require that the icc defer to responsible states right and duty to investigate and if merited prosecute its nationals we ask that you support our positions in this regard overall the icc scheme must ensure that the icc cannot be vehicle fo r interfering with r esponsibilities of states with demonstrated ability to investigate and discipline their service members who break the laws of armed conflict or fo r advancing politicized or controversial charges for example many nations have welldeveloped systems of m ilitary and civilian justice and they take seriously preventing and prosecuting war crimes if th negotiations yielded structure that allowed these nations personnel to be brought before the icc in spite of the determinations of these nations justice systems the would not have produced wellconce ived court we would oppose structure that yielded such result there should be an appropriate role in the exercise of icc jurisdiction for the security council on which the members of the united nations have conferre d primary responsibility for the m aintenance of international peace and security these are crimes which by their nature implicate issues of international security the prosecutor should act only on cases that have been properly referred to the icc however he or she should have the necessary leeway to fully investigate and prosecute cases that have been properly referred definition of crimes we also must protect the legitimacy of the court by limiting it to crimes that are universally recognized as crimes and are firmly established in international law it must not be used to push the envelope of international law or to advance th definition of crimes that are themselves politically controversial the list of crimes must be limited to 1 war crimes 2 genocide and 3 crimes against humanity moreover mere reference to customary norms i s insufficient and fosters excessive am biguity we ask that you specifically support the inclusion of an annex listing specific elements for each crimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30020crs33 we understand the laudable intent of some who would support inclusion of the offense of aggression in th statute however this offense is necessarily political in nature and its inclusion only encourages use of the court as political tool the concept of aggression as crime by person inevitably would be the subject f dispute aggression can best and most effectively be handled by the securit council and international structures currently in place state cooperation and national security the draft statute for an icc naturally encourages state cooperation with cour t requests for documents and evidence however the iccs jurisdiction is primaril over individuals not states states legitimate right to assert national securit reasons for refusing to turn over sensitive material should not be subject to contravening court order by the icc we encourage you to support strong national security exception to the statutes state cooperation regime rules of evidence and procedure obviou sly this court will represent an amalgam of various criminal law traditions rules of evide nce and procedure are the nuts and bolts of justice regardless of the substance of rules we ask you to support us in recommending that they be made constituent part of the statute prior to its opening for signature so that the rights of potential defendants are not left to the vagaries of disparate judges f we ask you to support these critical positions mod engagement i s particularly important because military personnel would be significantly affected by an icc end talking points 7 there remains only short amount of time before the rome di plomatic
