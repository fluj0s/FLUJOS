fernandes analyst in social policy domestic social policy division missing adults background federal programs and issues for congress summary adults may go missing due to choice an abduction foul play mental or physical disability or natural catastrophe among other reasons although accurate estimates exist of the number of missing adults the federal bureau of investigation fbi reported that as of january 1 2008 over 50000 missing adult cases were pending in the national crime information system ncic federal computerized index with data on crimes and locator files for missing and unidentified persons certain adults are particularly vulnerable to missing episodes for example those with dementia are at risk for wandering adults who engage in highrisk behaviors including involvement in gang activity may also be more prone to going missing unlike children adults have the legal right to go missing under most circumstances as result families of missing adults may receive limited assistance from state and local law enforcement entities in recovering their loved ones the federal government has not been involved in assisting law enforcement entities with missing adult cases in the same way it has with missing children cases further cases of missing children and young adults under the age of 21 must be reported to the ncic while reporting missing adults to the database is voluntary in recent years however the federal government has increasingly played role in 1 preventing certain types of missing adult incidents and 2 working to recover adults who go missing including those who are deceased and for whom only remains can be found recognizing the needs of growing aging population congress authorized funding for the missing alzheimers disease patient alert program under the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 the program has awarded funds to the alzheimers association of america since fy1996 to protect and locate missing individuals with dementia through patient identification program as well as outreach and education efforts in 2000 congress passed kristens act pl 106468 to permit the department of justice doj to make grants to establish national clearinghouse for missing adults and provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies in locating these individuals from fy2002 through fy2006 doj made grants to the national center for missing adults ncma for these purposes both doj and ncma have established databases to collect and disseminate information to law enforcement on missing adults their relatives and unidentified human remains the presidents dna initiative has also supported efforts to recover missing persons and identify unidentified human remains by funding dna analysis and providing technical assistance on using this analysis policymakers and other stakeholders have increasingly focused on two issues related to adults who go missing whether to provide federal assistance to states and localities to develop alert systems and technology to locate missing adults and possibly expanding federal involvement in cases of missing adults with diminished mental capacity another issue is the coordination of

remains 29 missing adults background federal programs and issues for congress introduction adults may go missing due to choice an abduction or foul play physical or developmental disability natural catastrophe that displaces individuals such as hurricanes katrina and rita and certain highrisk behaviors including gang involvement or drug use among other circumstances state and local laws govern how criminal justice entities respond to missing adult cases this response is complicated by number of factors unlike children adults have the legal right to go missing in most cases and may do so to seek protection from domestic abuser and other related reasons1 further law enforcement agencies may be hesitant to devote resources to missing adult cases given competing priorities law enforcement agencies within and across states also respond differently to missing adult cases some states mandate that law enforcement officials take reports without waiting period while other states require at least 24 hour waiting period after the person is believed to be missing2 the federal government has not been involved in assisting state and local law enforcement entities with missing adult cases in the same way it has with missing children cases federal law requires law enforcement to report missing children and young adults under the age of 21 to the federal bureau of investigations fbi national crime information center ncic federal database of crime and missing person information reporting missing adults to the database is voluntary in addition since 1985 congress has appropriated funding to the missing and exploited childrens program to coordinate federal response to missing children cases and to create and maintain national clearinghouse that assists law enforcement and families with these cases3 in recent years the federal government has increasingly played role in both 1 preventing certain types of missing adult incidents and 2 recovering adults who go missing including those who are deceased and for whom only remains provide clues to their identity and circumstances surrounding their disappearance in 1994 1 guardians and the court system may limit the autonomy of some adults through conservatorship or guardianship arrangements 2 for differences among some states regarding waiting periods for taking reports see httpwwwfindthemissingorgstatesindexhtm 3 for further information see crs report rl34050 missing and exploited children background policies and issues by adrienne l fernandes crs2 congress authorized the missing alzheimers disease patient alert program under the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 to assist in locating missing individuals with alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia through patient identification program as well as outreach and education efforts in 2000 congress authorized the department of justice doj through kristens act pl 106468 to make grants to establish national clearinghouse for missing adults and provide technical assistance to law enforcement agencies in locating missing adults the federal government has also supported efforts to establish databases to track and identify missing adults their relatives and unidentified human remains some advocates of missing adults and policymakers have called for the federal government to expand its role in missing adult cases for example these advocates and policymakers would like the federal government to assist states by creating or expanding missing adult alert programs that serve as warning to the public about cases of missing adults much like the amber americas missing broadcast emergency response alert program for missing children the first section of this report discusses demographics and record keeping of missing adults and unidentified remains and some of the factors that may contribute to the disappearance of adults this section also discusses federally funded databases that are used to track data on missing adults and unidentified individuals the second section of the report describes the federal programs and initiatives to assist in locating missing adults including funding data for fy2002 through fy2008 where applicable final action has been taken to fund these activities for fy2009 finally the third section discusses issues about the federal role in missing adult cases why do adults go missing certain circumstances can make adults vulnerable to going missing adults may go missing because of an abduction or foul play physical or developmental disability or cognitive disorder such as alzheimers disease and other forms of dementia may also contribute to missing episode adults with dementia have been identified as highrisk for going missing by advocates for older adults according to the alzheimers association as many as five million people in the us suffer from alzheimers disease and related dementia and about 60 of those will wander away from their homes or health care facilities4 further natural catastrophe can displace individuals and make their whereabouts unknown to others approximately 13000 adults were reported missing in the days following hurricanes katrina and rita in 20055 finally other adults vulnerable to missing incidents may include those with 4 ashlen anderson issue kit public policy responses to wandering behavior alzheimers association of america september 2006 hereafter referenced ashlen anderson public policy responses to wandering behavior for discussion of the incidence and prevalence of alzheimers disease see crs report rl32970 biomedical advances in alzheimers disease by michele m schoonmaker and laura b shrestha 5 this information was provided to the congressional research service by the national center for missing adults on may 1 2008 crs3 highrisk lifestyles such as individuals who abuse drugs or are gang involved and those that have history of victimization including domestic violence6 data on missing adults and unidentified decedents there is definitive estimate of the number of adults who go missing because some adults are not known to be missing or are not reported to databases that compile data on missing persons however three federally supported data sources provide some insight into this number the missing person file at the fbis national crime information center the fbis national dna index system ndis which stores information on offenders and arrestees forensic evidence as well as individuals believed to be missing their relatives and unidentified human remains and the national missing and unidentified persons system namus administered by dojs national institute of justice nij the national center for missing adults ncma clearinghouse in glendale arizona that assists the families of missing adults and law enforcement agencies also has database on missing adults ncma was funded with doj grant authorized by kristens act from fy2002 through fy2006 profiles of missing individuals entered into one database do not necessarily populate other databases although some missing individuals may be reported to more than one of the databases therefore numbers of missing persons should not be added across any of the databases the ncic unidentified person file namus and ndis contain information about unidentified decedents however the true number of unidentified missing adult cases is unknown because remains can go undiscovered or if they are recovered they may not be reported to the databases or retained in census conducted by doj in 2004 medical examiners and coroners reported total of 13486 unidentified human remains on record though about 51 of medical examiner and coroners offices lacked policies for retaining records such as xrays dna or fingerprints that could identify missing individuals7 the report also found that 90 of offices serving large jurisdictions did retain such records further medical examiners and coroners estimated that about 4400 unidentified human decedents were reported in an average year with approximately 1000 230 remaining unidentified after one year another doj study estimated using death records reported to the centers for disease control from 1980 through 2004 that as many as 10300 of these records were for unidentified decedents this number is an approximation as states do not uniformly specify on the death certificate when persons identity is not known8 in addition 6 these groups have been identified as vulnerable to going missing by the national center for missing adults 7 matthew j hickman et medical examiners and coroners offices 2004 us department of justice bureau of justice statistics june 2007 at httpwwwojpusdojgov bjspubpdfmeco04pdf 8 kristen hughes unidentified human remains in the united states us department of justice bureau of justice statistics november 2007 at httpwwwojpusdojgovbjspub crs4 the criteria used by doj to search the death records may have included individuals whose identities were known as well as unidentified individuals who were later identified the discussion below will show that the databases range in the number of profiles they contain as well as the type of information they collect eg basic demographic profiles dna profiles etc the discussion also raises the question about whether these databases can or should share data or indicate that data about an individual profile is available in another database some crossreferencing between the databases now occurs though on limited basis national crime information center missing person and unidentified person files the ncic within the fbis criminal justice information services cjis division maintains statistics on missing adults and unidentified decedents9 the ncic is computerized index of documented information concerning crimes and criminals of nationwide interest and locator file for missing and unidentified persons since october 1 1975 the ncic has maintained records of missing persons known as the missing person file who are reported to the fbi by federal state and local law enforcement agencies foreign criminal justice agencies and authorized courts the missing person file was created in response to request in 1974 from the ncic advisory policy board apb10 the apb is composed of local state and federal criminal justice and national security agencies and advises the fbi on criminal justice information matters the missing person file includes records for individuals who are missing because they have proven physical or mental disability are missing under circumstances indicating that they may be in physical danger are missing under circumstances indicating their disappearance may not have been voluntary are under the age of 21 and do not meet the above criteria 8 continued pdfuhrus04pdf 9 unless otherwise noted this information was provided to the congressional research service by the us department of justice federal bureau of investigation criminal justice information services division on january 25 2008 for further information about the current ncic advisory policy board see httpwwwfbigovhqcjisdadvisorypolicy boardhtm the fbi is authorized to maintain the ncic under 28 usc 434 10 the missing children act of 1982 affirmed the need for the missing person file by requiring the fbi to acquire collect classify and preserve any information which would assist in the location of any missing person including an unemancipated person as defined by the laws of the places of residence of such person and provide confirmation as to any entry for such person to the parent legal guardian or next of kin of that person 28 usc 534a the fbi amended ncic entry procedures in may 1999 to replace the phrase unemancipated person with person who is missing under the age of 18 crs5 are missing after catastrophe or are 21 and older and do not meet any of the above criteria but for whom there is reasonable concern for their safety these categories are presented in further detail in table a1 in the appendix pursuant to the national child search assistance act of 1990 title xxxvii of the crime control act of 1990 pl 101647 records of missing children under age 18 must be immediately entered into the missing person file the act also requires the attorney general to publish an annual statistical summary of the missing person file suzannes law under the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act of 2003 protect act pl 10821 requires law enforcement to also immediately submit information about missing adults to the ncic ages 18 through 20 law enforcement agencies are not mandated under federal law to submit missing person records of adults over the age of 21 into the missing person file therefore although records of missing adults are captured the ncic does not include the complete number of adults who go missing and are not reported to the database missing person data for 200711 in calendar year 2007 approximately 815000 individuals of all ages were reported missing to the ncic also in that same year approximately 820000 missing person records were cleared or canceled some of these records were entered prior to 2007 of all individuals reported missing in 2007 over 171000 about 210 were ages 18 and older table a1 summarizes the number of missing cases entered in 2007 for individuals ages 18 and older under the six missing person categories nearly half of all missing adult cases involved persons missing under circumstances suggesting that they might be endangered the next highest number of missing adults went missing for another unspecified reason but for whom there was reasonable concern for their safety of all adults ages 18 and older reported missing in 2007 most were male 571 compared to 429 who were female12 the majority 679 of missing adults were white followed by individuals who were black 259 of an unknown race 27 asian 26 and american indian or alaskan native 09 african americans appear to be overrepresented compared to their share of the general population by more than ten percentage points13 the ncic does not report on the hispanic origin of missing individuals and ncic users are instructed to enter records for hispanic individuals using the race code american indian or alaskan native 11 unless otherwise noted this information was provided to the congressional research service by the us department of justice federal bureau of investigation criminal justice information services division on may 6 2008 12 the gender of three individuals was unknown 13 for information about demographics of the general population see us department of commerce census bureau overview of race and hispanic origin census 2000 brief march 2001 crs6 asian or pacific islander black or white that most closely represents that individual as perceived by the law enforcement official14 as of january 1 2008 there were 105229 individual records entered in 2007 and other years remaining in the missing person file15 of these 50581 481 were for missing adults ages 18 and older unidentified missing persons some individuals who go missing may be deceased and their remains intact or not may be the only available clues concerning their identity and circumstances surrounding their disappearance since 1983 the ncic has taken reports of unidentified missing persons pursuant to the passage of the missing children act of 1982 pl 97292 the act required the fbi to acquire collect classify and preserve any information which would assist in the identification of any deceased individual who has not been identified after the discovery of such deceased individual16 pursuant to this requirement reports are taken of unidentified deceased persons persons of any age who are living and unable to determine their identity and unidentified catastrophe victims reports may include information about bodies found shortly after death when persons remains may be fairly intact as well as skeletal remains as of january 1 2008 information on 6945 unidentified persons were recorded in ncic of these 1788 257 were entered in 2007 nearly all 6822 of the active entries were for deceased unidentified bodies the remaining were for unidentified catastrophe victims and living persons who could not be identified either because they could not identify themselves or refused to disclose their identity also in 2007 nearly 1000 records were canceled or cleared by law enforcement agency for such reasons as the subject being identified or the records being invalid the total number of unidentified persons in the ncic may represent just fraction of the true number of missing remains 14 in october 1997 the office of management and budget published revised standards for the reporting by federal agencies of statistics on race and ethnicity the standards specify the racial categories of american indian or alaska native black or african american native hawaiian or other pacific islander and white and ethnic categories of hispanic or latino and not hispanic or latino however the fbi received an exemption from this reporting requirement for the ncic according to the fbi states are not required to comply with the racial and ethnic classifications due to the uniqueness of crime data and the fact that the data are reported by state and local jurisdictions this information was provided to the congressional research service by the us department of justice federal bureau of investigation criminal justice information services division on may 6 2008 15 this information was provided to the congressional research service by the us department of justice federal bureau of investigation criminal justice information services division on may 23 2008 16 28 usc 534a crs7 national dna index system17 second federally funded database that stores dna records on missing adults and unidentified remains ndis was authorized under the dna identification act of 1994 as part the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 pl 103322 pl 103322 specified that the fbi could establish an index of dna identification records of persons convicted of crimes analyses of dna samples recovered from crime scenes and analyses from unidentified human remains18 fourth category of records for relatives of missing persons was added in 1999 by the consolidated appropriations act of 2000 pl 106113 dna laboratories may enter dna information into ndis that involves one of the four categories of records as well as the records of missing adults the data are first entered by authorized users into the local dna index system ldis which can then populate the central laboratory for each state known as state dna index system sdis only sdis laboratories may upload dna profiles directly to the ndis ldis or sdis laboratories can conduct searches of their own databases prior to uploading the data to ndis searches of data entered by other states into ndis are conducted by the fbi laboratory which automatically searches new dna data when profiles are submitted by the states ndis contains over six million profiles in five databases offenders and arrestees database forensic evidence database missing unidentified human remains database missing person database and biological relatives of missing persons database19 the three missing person databases are part of the fbi laboratorys national missing person dna database nmpdd program which works to identify missing and unidentified persons based on available dna profiles and other clues20 the unidentified human remains database contains dna profiles from the remains of individuals that cannot be identified by fingerprint dental medical or anthropological examinations and of individuals who are living but are unidentifiable using typical investigative methods eg children and others who cannot or refuse to identify themselves the relatives of missing persons database contains dna profiles that are voluntarily submitted by the relatives of known missing individuals finally the missing person database contains dna records of 17 unless otherwise noted this information was provided to the congressional research service by the us department of justice federal bureau of investigation office of congressional affairs on june 18 2008 and july 16 2008 18 according to the fbi the authority to include dna from missing persons is derived from pl 103322 because in order to identify unidentified remains search of missing person records must be conducted that compares those records to the records for unidentified remains this information was provided to the congressional research service by the department of justice federal bureau of investigation office of congressional affairs on august 8 2008 19 the other two databases the convicted offender database and forensic database can be searched against one another to assist law enforcement personnel in solving crimes 20 in addition to conducting dna analysis the fbi laboratory also assists state and local law enforcement agencies with investigations of missing persons involving examinations of anthropology trace evidence facial reconstruction fingerprinting and toolmarking these services are provided at cost crs8 missing persons obtained from their belongings or derived from the profiles of their relatives the three missing persons databases can be searched against one another the combined dna index system codis is the software in ndis that compares various dna profiles and if match is made between two sets of dna profiles the software sends an electronic message to the laboratories that contributed the samples dna analysts at the laboratories review the data to confirm the match the laboratories are responsible for alerting the investigating law enforcement agency medical examiner coroner or medicallegal authority of the results the fbi is continuing to develop technology including software to conduct kinship dna analyses and is using metadata eg sex date of last sighting and age that is intended to assist in locating missing persons21 most of the dna profiles are those stored in criminal and forensic evidence databases as of july 2008 ndis contained the dna profiles from 528 missing persons 4641 biological relatives of missing persons and 1600 unidentified human remains 61 million offenders and arrestees and 227048 forensicrelated profiles the fbi does not maintain statistics on the number of samples or profiles maintained in the ldis or sdis the national missing and unidentified persons system22 namus was established in july 2007 as an online repository for information about missing persons and unidentified remains23 the system was created as part of the presidents dna initiative24 described below out of concern that state and local law enforcement agencies medical examiners and coroners are not required to report missing adult and unidentified decedent cases to the ncic and therefore the true number of missing adults is unknown25 to further investigate this issue doj appointed an expert panel of medical examiners and coroners which ultimately confirmed the need for central reporting system for unidentified human remains these efforts also led doj to establish and fund namus namus is composed of two databases one for missing persons and the other for unidentified remains 21 us department of justice federal bureau of investigation codis combined dna index system at httpwwwfbigovhqlabpdfcodisbrochurepdf 22 unless otherwise noted this information is provided by us department of justice about missing persons database namus at httpwwwnamusgovindexhtm 23 according to the department of justice there is specific statutory authority for namus however the agency derives its authority to establish the database from statutes on the general authorities of the national institute of justice nij 42 usc 37213723 which manages the database to support research and develop tools and technologies as well as statutes concerning the general authorities of nijs office of science and technology 6 usc 161165 this information was provided to the congressional research service by the us department of justice office of justice programs on june 16 2008 24 the presidents dna initiative was created under president george w bush 25 us department of justice about missing persons database namus at httpwwwnamusgovindexhtm crs9 the missing person database is under construction the site currently includes information about each states statutes on recovering missing persons as well as links to state missing person clearinghouses which are maintained by state law enforcement agencies or advocacy organizations and provide information about missing adults the unidentified remains database is available for medical examiners and coroners to upload their cases26 website users members of the public law enforcement coroners and medical examiners may view profiles of the unidentified remains however only law enforcement agencies and other authorized entities may enter information and review additional information and photographs that are not available to the public some of the profiles are fully intact whereas others include pieces of the missing persons body or information about the remains and where they were found users can also search based on characteristics such as demographics anthropologic analysis the ncic record number dental information and distinct body features doj anticipates that the two databases will be linked in 2009 and law enforcement and the public will be able to search for matches between missing persons and unidentified decedent records during the development of namus representatives from ndis ncic the violent criminal apprehension program vicap described below and integrated automated fingerprint identification system iafis described below were involved as partners in working groups and focus groups that developed requirements for the system27 also according to doj state and local practitioners participated in developing the requirements of the system and made recommendations for specific technology upgrades that were incorporated the database was funded in fy2007 with 25 million from dojs justice assistance account and 500000 from the community oriented policing cops account28 the justice assistance funds were awarded to the national forensic science technology center to develop the missing person database and to implement namus the cops funds were awarded to the university of central floridas national center for forensic science to complete the development of the unidentified decedent database and to administer the database for 18 months 26 the database was initially developed in 2005 and 2006 as public service project by the national association of medical examiners occupational research and assessment inc orainc and the international association of coroners and medical examiners 27 this information was provided to the congressional research service by the us department of justice office of justice programs on june 16 2008 28 congress specified in the science state justice commerce and related agencies appropriations act of 2006 pl 109108 that funds from the cops account were to be used for dna analysis and capacity enhancement program and for other state local and federal forensic activities the revised continuing appropriations resolution of 2007 pl 1105 continued funding for these activities crs10 national center for missing adults database29 the national center for missing adults has received funding from doj for its efforts to work on behalf of missing adults and their families as described below ncma maintains database of the number of adults who are reported missing to the organization by family members or law enforcement the organization takes reports of missing adults from family members after reports have first been made to law enforcement30 according to ncma from 2003 through april 2008 the organization received nearly 25200 reports of missing persons ages 18 and older of these entries about 700 have been resolved and about 300 are pending most of the missing individuals entered into the database since 2003 are women 607 these figures differ from those reported to the missing person file which consists mostly of missing adult profiles for males 571 nonhispanic whites comprise the largest share 421 of individuals entered into the database followed by hispanics 26231 nonhispanic blacks 21 and other racial groups 110 these figures suggest that nonhispanic blacks and hispanics appear to be overrepresented relative to their share of the general us population of approximately 120 each32 note however that these figures may not be representative of the racial and ethnic composition of missing persons generally because the true number of missing adults is unknown in 2005 ncma added several collection fields to its missing person database to include such characteristics as disabilities history of domestic violence homelessness missing from group homes and other categories among the 3921 missing adults since 2005 who have been reported to have disabilities nearly 1800 about 450 had diagnosed medical condition that required care or medication about 1300 or 350 had mental illness or diminished mental capacity which includes general depression post traumatic stress disorder ptsd bipolar disorder schizophrenia attention deficit hyperactivity disorder autism and other genetic conditions the balance had alzheimers disease or related dementia about 80 alcohol or chemical dependency about 70 or another unspecified disability about 50 data are not available for characteristics other than disabilities 29 this information was provided to the congressional research service by the national center for missing adults on may 1 2008 30 for further information about the reporting process see httpwwwtheyaremissedorg ncmacontentphpwebidsearch 31 hispanic includes individuals who were entered into the database as hispanic white hispanic or black hispanic 32 for information about demographics of the general population see us department of treasury census bureau overview of race and hispanic origin census 2000 brief march 2001 crs11 other federal databases that can store information about missing persons integrated automated fingerprint identification system iafis iafis is an electronic database that stores information on fingerprints and corresponding criminal histories this information is submitted voluntarily by state local and federal law enforcement agencies the database includes more than 55 million subjects in its criminal master file nearly 50 records are for missing persons law enforcement agencies that submit electronic fingerprints receive electronic responses to criminal tenprint fingerprint submissions within two hours and within 24 hours for civil fingerprint submissions ie background checks for employment and other non criminal justice related purposes the response indicates whether an individual has criminal history iafis is administered by the fbis criminal justice information services division for more information see httpwwwfbigovhqcjisdiafishtm violent criminal apprehension program vicap vicap is data center that collects and analyzes information on crimes including missing person cases where the circumstances indicate strong possibility of foul play and the victim is still missing however few missing adult cases are actually entered because according to the fbi the ncic does not automatically populate the vicap database cases with an arrested or identified offender can be entered into the vicap system by law enforcement investigators for database comparison and possible matching with unsolved cases once case is entered into the vicap database it is compared continuously against all other entries on the basis of certain aspects of the crime the purpose of this process is to detect signature aspects and traits of the crime to allow vicap personnel with the fbis criminal justice information services division to identify crimes that have been committed by the same offender for additional information see httpwwwfbigov hqisdciirgncavchtmvicap source congressional research service the database also includes data fields to indicate if the investigating law enforcement agency or medical examiner has dna samples or dental records33 ncma previously worked with families of missing adults to collect reference samples comparison and interaction of databases table a2 in the appendix summarizes some of the features of the databases on missing persons and unidentified remains as well as the entities that may access them as described above ndis includes dna profiles and iafis includes fingerprint records whereas some of the other databases only indicate whether these records are available these other databases also tend to include more general information about missing persons and the circumstances surrounding their disappearance further iafis and vicap have broader mandate to store criminal justicerelated data and do not focus per on missing adult cases none of the 33 this information was provided to the congressional research service by the national center for missing adults on july 14 2008 crs12 databases is linked or populate one another34 this has been identified as concern of dojs national missing persons taskforce records are submitted to most of the databases by authorized law enforcement agencies state missing persons clearinghouses medical examiners and coroners or dna laboratories nearly all of the databases can be accessed exclusively by the federal government or authorized law enforcement and other personnel however records in namus and the ncma database can also be reviewed by the public though sometimes only on limited basis for namus federal role in recovering missing adults efforts to recover missing adults are primarily under the jurisdiction of state and local governments these efforts may be complicated by number of factors unlike children adults have the legal right to go missing in most cases and can do so to seek protection from domestic abuser and other reasons35 further law enforcement agencies may be hesitant to devote resources to missing adult cases given competing priorities in addition law enforcement agencies within and across states respond differently to missing adult cases some states mandate that law enforcement officials take reports without waiting period whereas other states require at least 24hour waiting period after the person is believed to be missing36 in recent years the federal government has increasingly played role both in preventing certain types of missing adult incidents and in working to recover adults who go missing including those who are deceased and for whom only remains provide clues to the circumstances surrounding their disappearance in addition to funding or operating databases that track information about missing adults and unidentified remains the federal government has undertaken other related efforts including support for 1 the presidents dna initiative which has focused on identifying the remains of unidentified deceased individuals 2 national missing persons task force with its emphasis on achieving greater cooperation among the various federal databases 3 the missing alzheimers disease patient alert program to prevent missing episodes and locate missing individuals with alzheimers disease and related dementia 4 activities funded under kristens act to locate missing adults and 5 the national center for missing and exploited children ncmec which works to recover missing children and adults ages 18 to 21 who are reported to the agency as missing by law enforcement officials the missing alzheimers disease patient alert program and activities funded under kristens act have specifically received congressional appropriations for missing adult activities the 34 this may be due in part to concerns with protecting the privacy of individuals registered in the databases for example the dna identification act of 1994 pl 103322 limit the accessibility of the profiles in ndis for certain purposes 35 guardians and the court system may limit the autonomy of some adults through conservatorship or guardianship arrangements 36 for differences among some states regarding waiting periods for taking reports see httpwwwfindthemissingorgstatesindexhtm crs13 other activities have been funded under appropriations for initiatives or programs that encompass more than missing adult

that the attorney general may use dna technology to identify missing persons and unidentified human remains sec 308 further requires that each state or unit of local government that receives funding under the section is required to submit the dna profiles of missing persons and unidentified human remains to the ndis national missing persons database according to the department of justice specific appropriation has been made pursuant to this section of the act 39 laboratories that participate in ndis conduct these sample analyses and the dna results are forwarded to the relevant missing person

meetings have been held to date the forums provided attendees including medical examiners coroners law enforcement personnel managers of state missing children clearinghouses family members of missing persons forensic scientists and policymakers with information about resources to solve missing person and unidentified human remains cases in their jurisdictions the forums addressed topics including model state programs for recovering missing persons and unidentified remains reference sample dna collection kits and evidence repositories the national strategy meeting was convened with the same groups of attendees described above to identify policies and practices including the use of dna to solve missing person and unidentified decedent cases the task force also created model state legislation to encourage states to adopt laws that improve the ability of law enforcement to locate and return missing persons identify human remains and provide timely information to family members of missing persons41 national missing persons taskforce42 as part of the presidents dna initiative in 2005 nij and fbi were directed by doj leadership to establish national task force to assess how to

an amendment to the bill introduced by representatives maxine waters sheila jacksonlee and adam schiff to reauthorize and expand the missing alzheimers patient alert program was adopted more specifically the amendment would have subject to available appropriations provided competitive grants to states local governments or nonprofit organizations to pay for programs to protect and locate missing persons with alzheimers disease related dementia or other missing elderly the amendment would have also authorized appropriations of 5 million for each of fy2009 through fy2015 to carry out these grant activities on june 11 2008 the bills were approved by the judiciary committee and ordered favorably reported as amended on july 30 2008 the house judiciary committee held markup hearing

alzheimers disease patient alert program to the alzheimers association of america in each year since fy1996 these funds have been used to establish and carry out the safe return program which works to protect and locate missing individuals with alzheimers and related dementia wandering may pose significant if not life threatening danger to the personal health safety and welfare of those with dementia46 this may occur from exposure to the elements lack of food dehydration or lack of medication for extended periods of time and general inability to think act or communicate in way that could assist them nevertheless it is not uncommon for persons with dementia to wander from their homes sometimes repeatedly the alzheimers association reports that six out of ten people with alzheimers disease will wander during the course of the disease the safe return program provides enrollees with bracelet indicating that the individual is memory impaired and includes tollfree 24hour emergency response number to call if the person is found wandering or lost the call is routed to the nearest local chapter of the organization which works to reunite the person with his or her caregiver including longterm care facilities the local chapter obtains information through the organizations central database that includes personal and medical information and sometimes picture of the enrollee about the individual and then contacts the caregiver or local law enforcement agency family members or caregivers with loved one or care recipient enrolled in the program may also contact the alzheimers association in the event that he or she goes missing the alzheimers association reports that in two thirds of cases the enrolled missing individual and caretaker are immediately reunited in the onethird of cases that are truly missing persons incidents local law enforcement agencies are involved and the local chapter provides assistance during search and rescue efforts the chapter also provides emotional support to the family and can serve as media contact in addition to these services the alzheimers association works with families to identify needed resources to prevent missing incidents and support the caregivers of individuals with alzheimers and dementia approximately 120000 individuals are enrolled in the safe return program47 the program reportedly has helped in the safe return of over 8000 people since 1993 the organization also provides training materials to law enforcement agencies about individuals with alzheimers and how to recognize wandering behavior or individuals with dementia who are engaging in unsafe or uncharacteristic behavior such as driving or shoplifting some chapters have partnerships with local law 45 unless otherwise noted this information was provided to the congressional research service by the alzheimers association on november 21 2007 46 ashlen anderson public policy responses to wandering behavior 47 on november 1 2007

fee 25 to include medicalert information crs17 enforcement agencies to educate them about wandering behavior but the level of contact varies across the country most chapters coordinate with state units on aging to make them aware of the organization and safe return program kristens act in 2000 congress passed kristens act pl 106468 named after kristen modafferi who has been missing since 1997 kristen was 18 when she disappeared and her family was unable to access services through the national center for missing and exploited children because at the time the organization only provided assistance to missing incident cases for children under age 18 ncmec now provides services for missing young adults ages 18 to 21 pursuant to suzannes law which requires law enforcement to also immediately submit information about missing adults to the ncic ages 18 through 20 kristens act authorized 1 million in funding for each of fy2001 to fy2004 and permitted the attorney general to make grants to assist law enforcement agencies in locating missing adults maintain database for tracking adults believed by law enforcement to be endangered due to age diminished mental capacity and

senate on september 25 2008 overview of services provided by the national center for missing adults49 ncma began in 1995 as the missing adult division of the nations missing children organization ncma received funding under kristens act to expand its efforts to recover missing adults beginning in fy2002 and received this funding through fy2006 although the organization has continued to operate since fy2006 it does so on more limited scale than when it received funding through the grant program ncma is not an investigating agency and only accepts missing adult cases that have first been reported to law enforcement agency missing adult case can be registered with ncma by law enforcement official or family member or significant other friend and certain other individuals of the missing individual the reporting parties complete registration form that requests any available descriptive information circumstances of disappearance law enforcement case number ncic number investigating law enforcement agency contact information and other information the reporting party may also submit photo case manager is assigned to the missing person case and will enter any relevant information including answers from the registration form types of services provided and dates and summaries of all conversations with the reporting party among other information the case manager contacts the law enforcement agency to verify case information and that the missing person has been entered into the ncic missing person file if the law enforcement agency does not enter the record into the ncic the case manager will offer to assist with referrals and resources the case manager then determines which services will be provided by the organization and contacts the family to let them know about these services ncma may also add the missing persons profile and picture to its website wwwmissingadultsorg send missing person flyers to the family and law enforcement assist with press releases help generate or manage media attention and maintain routine contact with the family 48 us congress house committee on the judiciary subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security national clearing

displacing hundreds of thousands of adults and children to coordinate efforts to recover individuals believed to be missing as result of the hurricanes doj requested that ncma and ncmec coordinate services to track and recover individuals missing as result of hurricane katrina which made landfall first in response ncmec managed missing person hotline and forwarded all cases of missing adults to ncma on the basis of an approximation that ncma would need to handle between 1000 and 2000 missing person reports the organization submitted draft budget of 50000 to doj for services that would be provided for up to two months doj provided this level of funding within the first two days of operation the number of reports exceeded 2000 ncma ultimately took 13502 reports of missing adults of which 89 cases remain active the costs for funding these efforts was approximately 270000 ncma received 50000 from doj and used some funds from its fy2006 doj grant to cover the costs because of funding constraints resulting from the hurricanes ncma reports that it has scaled back operations and now employs one fulltime employee down from 13 in 2006 and relies on assistance from volunteers support to secondary victims51 ncma assists the secondary victims of missing persons cases the families and friends of the missing to cope with the temporary or longterm loss of their loved ones since 2003 through april 2008 over 75000 secondary victims have been added to the ncma missing person database52 according to ncma secondary victims suffer anxiety depression and post traumatic stress disorder ptsd53 the loss of loved one may also result in lost income and benefits unless the missing person is located deceased family members may have difficulty obtaining social security benefits or managing his or her estate ncma staff provide these family members with support and referrals to support services and victim assistance programs ncma also maintains an online support group

investigators and first responders training for chief executive officers ie police chiefs sheriffs and policymakers from law enforcement and criminal justice agencies teaches them how to create community wide response to missing adult cases the training addresses family issues legal considerations for developing law enforcement protocols and public policies the role of the chief executive officer and developing resources for communitybased response among other topics the training for investigators and first responders focuses on the perspective of the secondary victims effective use of

training advisory committee in consultation with fox valley technical college developed model policy on taking missing adult reports for law enforcement to implement within their agency the policy states that the agency is to accept every missing person report and where threat or risk exists the agency is to conduct thorough investigation the model policy also includes definitions of missing adults and subcategories of missing adults58 including those with alzheimers disease and dementia procedures for taking missing person reports and the response by an officer or investigator and protocols for completing missing person reports including entering information into the ncic and the recovery or return of missing adults data tracking as detailed above ncma maintains descriptive

exploited children the national center for missing and exploited children is primary component of the federally funded missing and exploited childrens program59 although ncmecs mission is to recover missing children under age 18 it also provides services for missing young adults ages 18 through 20 pursuant to suzannes law which requires law enforcement to also immediately submit information about missing adults to the ncic ages 18 through 20 this law changed the upper age limit of individuals who must be entered into the ncic ncmec processes young adult cases differently than cases for missing children60 ncmec will accept young adult case only if it is reported by law enforcement entity and not by parents spouses partners or others because the organization relies on law enforcement personnel to verify that the young adult is missing due to foul play or other reasons that would cause concern about the individuals whereabouts such as diminished mental capacity ncmec then assists in recovery efforts for these adults as it would for children under age 18 case manager in the missing childrens division is assigned to serve as the single point of contact for the searching family and to provide technical assistance to locate abductors and recover missing children and young adults issues the various federal data systems to record information about missing adults raise the question about the need and ability for the systems to share this information further federal and state policymakers and other stakeholders have increasingly focused on two issues related to adults who go missing 1 assisting states with building the capacity to develop both alert systems to inform the public about missing older adults and technology to recover these individuals and 2 extending federal protections to missing adults with diminished mental capacity where applicable this section discusses legislation that was pending in the 110th congress to address these issues 59 ncmec

coordination of federally funded databases on missing persons and unidentified decedents the first section of this report discussed the various federally funded databases that store information on missing persons and unidentified decedents these databases do not currently populate one another although some of the databases indicate whether information about particular individual is available in another database this limitation raises the question about whether the federal government can and should develop technology to enable the databases to coordinate although concerns about privacy and funding would likely need to be addressed doj appears to have begun initial discussions about the interactions of the databases through its missing person task force further the namus database is expected to be fully operational in 2009 and could ultimately serve as central repository on missing adults and unidentified remains alert systems silver or senior alerts61 alert systems known as silver or senior alerts reportedly have been established in at least eleven states colorado georgia illinois kentucky michigan new mexico north carolina oklahoma ohio texas and virginia to alert law enforcement or the public through various media outlets about vulnerable adults who are reported missing62 these alert systems were created out of concern for the safety of seniors and other atrisk adult populations who are prone to wandering due to physical or cognitive disability or medical condition such as alzheimers or other forms of dementia some missing adult alert programs including those for oklahoma and virginia are modeled after the states amber alert system63 issuing alerts to law enforcement agencies and the public for missing vulnerable adults in some of the states appears to be at the discretion of the law enforcement 61 this section was coauthored with kirsten j colello analyst in gerontology 62 these states were mentioned as having missing adult alert systems in news articles and policy publications including ben schmitt silver alerts could help pinpoint missing seniors location usa today july 8 2008 kelly wilkicki silver alerts sound the alarm when certain

january 2008 and national center for assisted living ncal focus american health care association washington dc august 2006 the congressional research services held informal discussions with officials in six of the 11 states colorado georgia north carolina oklahoma texas and virginia in march 2008 we did not conduct our own search of state statutes or survey states that may have adopted alert systems for missing adults through administrative rules or other mechanisms 63 amber systems are voluntary partnerships among law enforcement agencies broadcasters and transportation agencies to activate messages in targeted area when child is abducted and believed to be in grave danger for additional information see crs report rl34050 missing and exploited children background policies and issues by adrienne l fernandes crs23 agency local or state or both and is not required of the agency64 in addition state alert systems vary in terms of the target population for issuing an alert ie older adults with dementia versus any adult with disability most law enforcement agencies have the ability to disseminate the alert to law enforcement agencies and media in the local area region statewide and other states for example the texas division of emergency management disseminates information within the alert advisory area to local state and federal law enforcement agencies primary media outlets the texas department of transportation the texas lottery commission and the independent bankers association of texas however illinois issues alerts only to law enforcement agencies and does not involve the public or media some states also have the ability to issue regional or interstate alerts some advocates have raised concerns that alert systems may not be useful for some adults who go missing for example it is reported that nearly all 94 persons with alzheimers disease who wander are found less than 15 miles from home and almost 30 are found among makeshift shelters under brush or briar65 further there is concern that alerting the media repeatedly about missing adult case could desensitize the public to the issue of wandering some advocates suggest that policymakers may wish to consider silver alerts in combination with combination of other policy approaches66 legislation in the 110th congress on april 24 2008 representative gus bilirakis introduced the silver alert grant program act of 2008 hr 5898 hr 5898 sought to authorize the attorney general to award grants to states to implement stateadministered notification system silver alert system to help locate missing individuals with alzheimers disease and other dementiarelated illnesses or make improvements to states existing silver alert system the bill would have also required the attorney general to prepare an annual report to congress on state silver alert systems on may 16 2008 representative lloyd doggett introduced the national silver alert act hr 6064 which would have authorized the attorney general subject to the availability of appropriations to establish and administer national silver alert communications system that provides assistance to regional and local search efforts for missing seniors the attorney general would have been directed to assign an officer to serve as the national coordinator of the network and coordinate with states to encourage the development of silver alert plans establish voluntary guidelines for states to use in developing plans develop proposed public safety and 64 this information is primarily based on the congressional research services review of authorizing legislation in addition the congressional research service held informal discussions with six states colorado georgia north carolina oklahoma texas and virginia in march 2008 65 ashlen anderson public policy responses to wandering behavior 66 for example one such approach might be providing support to the caregivers of individuals with dementia to better ensure that adults with the disease do not go missing for information about current federal funding to assist caregivers see crs report rl34123 family caregiving to the older population background federal programs and issues for congress by kirsten j colello crs24 other protocols to recover missing seniors and establish an advisory group to assist states and other entities with developing silver alert plans among other duties the coordinator would have also been required to develop minimum standards for issuing alerts and the extent that alerts should be issued through the network hr 6064 specified that the standards would have been adoptable on voluntary basis and would not have included specific age requirements like hr 5898 the bill would have established grant program to support the development and enhancement of programs and activities for silver alerts hr 6064 would have also required the attorney general to prepare an annual report to congress on state silver alert systems the judiciary subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security held hearing on july 15 2008 concerning hr 5898 hr 6064 and the kristens act reauthorization act of 2007 hr 42367 the bills sponsors asserted the need for federal support of state efforts to develop silver alert systems and the need to authorize funding for programs to locate missing adults generally with grants authorized under kristens act on july 30 2008 the judiciary committee marked up and favorably reported hr 6064 with two amendments one of the amendments introduced by representative bobby scott modified hr 6064 and incorporated parts of hr 5898 and hr 42368 the other amendment introduced by representative sheila jacksonlee sought to authorize doj after consulting with the department of health and human services hhs to award grants to states and local governments to carry out programs that provide electronic monitoring services to elderly individuals that would assist in their recovery if they go missing this amendment would have authorized 2 million for each of fy2009 through fy2014 for these services on september 17 2008 the house passed hr 6064 by voice vote under suspension of the rules on september 25 2008 senator mel martinez

the bill was not marked up because quorum was not present 68 the amendment made changes to hr 6064 including adding information to the guidelines that would be issued to states requiring the coordinator of the silver alert program to consult with state and local officials in establishing minimum standards for issuing alerts specifying the authorization of appropriations for the grant program separate from the communication network activities and making technical changes the amendment incorporated from hr 5898 the information that would be included in the report to congress about the program the amendment incorporated most of hr 423 except that it omitted one of the findings in the bill about the work of ncma further the amendment added that the attorney general would periodically solicit applications for grants to maintain national resource center for missing adults among other activities by publishing request for applications in the federal register and by posting the request on the doj website crs25 this service the organization works with law enforcement when child disabled individual or vulnerable older individual is missing after being contacted by local law enforcement about missing incident the organization sends recorded message by phone and text about the missing child or adult to residences and businesses in an area where the individual is suspected of going missing the message asks the community to call the police with any information they may have about the missing person between fy2002 through fy2008 congress appropriated funding to

missing alert and recovery center to expand its operations maintain and expand technologies to recover missing individuals and establish and maintain regional centers to provide training and distribute information to law enforcement about utilizing the services of the center among other purposes the law defined missing child as an individual whose whereabouts are unknown to federal state

localities 70 this information was provided to the congressional research service by project lifesaver on march 18 2008 71 according to project lifesaver international the cost for implementation is 7680 continued crs26 project lifesaver grew out of local law enforcement experience with search and rescue efforts for missing persons with alzheimers and other forms of dementia the target population of the program has expanded to include children with special needs such as autism and downs syndrome and to anyone else that may be at risk of wandering for medical reason in addition to providing the technology the program trains the designated agency to communicate with persons with alzheimers disease and other disorders project lifesaver international reported that as of march 2008 the tracking technology was used by 711 law enforcement agencies in 42 states and in some parts of canada according to project lifesaver international the benefits from the program include saving law enforcement and search and rescue response time and resources in locating missing persons due to wandering the organization reports that search times have been reduced from hours and days for searches without radio technology to minutes in searches that use the technology in over 1500 searches there have been reported serious injuries or deaths and recovery times have averaged less than 30 minutes72 legislation in the 110th congress as referenced above hr 6064 as approved by the house judiciary committee would have authorized doj after consulting with hhs to award grants to states and local governments to carry out programs that provide electronic monitoring services to elderly individuals that will assist in their recovery if they go missing this amendment would have authorized 2 million for each of fy2009 through fy2014 for these services further amendments to hr 1783 and hr 5352 which were approved by the house judiciary committee would have subject to available appropriations provided competitive grants for the missing alzheimers disease patient alert program grants would have been available to states local governments or nonprofit organizations to pay for programs to protect and locate missing persons with alzheimers disease related dementia or other missing elderly special federal protections for vulnerable missing adults there is currently federal mandate to locate missing adults who function cognitively as children one bill in the 110th congress sought to extend the same federal assistance to these adults that is provided for missing children on may 9 2007 representative ginny brownwaite introduced the audrey nerenberg act hr 271 the legislation proposed to change the definition of missing child under the missing childrens assistance act as amended to include individuals determined to have mental capacity of less than 18 years of age as determined by an appropriate medical authority the act did not specify which adults with 71 continued which includes the equipment and training of search and rescue teams in how to use the technology monthly cost of about 9 per transmitter covers the costs for replacement of the battery and band some agencies may pass this monthly charge on to clients enrolled in the program 72 for further information see httpwwwprojectlifesaverorgsite crs27 diminished mental capacity would be protected for example the legislation could have included disorders as diverse as downs syndrome and alzheimers and if left for states to decide the definition could have varied widely from one state to another the bill also did not define the rights of adults with cognitive disabilities who want to go missing and may choose to do so for legitmate reasons hr 271 would have essentially required the national center for missing and exploited children which receives most of the funding from the federal missing and exploited childrens program authorized by the missing childrens assistance act to work to recover any missing adults deemed eligible under hr 271 in response to the possibility that ncmec would need to focus its work on certain vulnerable adults ages 21 and older the organization has said that it would prefer to initially take on missing adults cases on pilot basis to assess the issues and problems that may arise such as varying state law definitions of diminished capacity73 according to ncmec we would only take diminished capacity cases if requested to do so by law enforcement agency and given that these are cases of missing adults who are not like children whose disappearance is presumed to be involuntary we would likely need limited civil and criminal liability to prevent costly and burdensome lawsuits 73 this information was provided to the congressional research service by
