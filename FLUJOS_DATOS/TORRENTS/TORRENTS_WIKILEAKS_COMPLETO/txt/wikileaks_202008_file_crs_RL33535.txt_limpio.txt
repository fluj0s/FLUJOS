mccarthy specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry division mercury emissions from electric power plants states are setting stricter limits summary in march 2005 the us environmental protection agency epa promulgated the first national emission standards for mercury emissions from electric power plants epa studies conclude that about 6 of american women of childbearing age have blood mercury levels sufficient to increase the risk of adverse health effects especially lower iqs in children they might bear power plants account for 42 of total us mercury emissions according to epa thus there has been great interest in the agencys power plant regulations the regulations established capandtrade program to address power plant emissions but the program would have little impact on emissions before 2018 at that time the regulations call for 69 reduction in emissions as compared to the 1999 level in setting the limit so far in the future epa stated in part that mercury control technologies were not commercially available and would not be generally available until after 2010 many observers disagreed with that conclusion including growing number of states as of february 2007 18 states arizona colorado connecticut delaware florida illinois maryland massachusetts minnesota montana nevada new hampshire new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania and virginia have established more stringent emission limits which take effect sooner than will epas and four other states are developing regulations that would do so the state standards vary in stringency in effective dates and in numerous other details but number of generalizations can be made most of the state programs will require reductions of 80 to 90 in mercury emissions when fully implemented by comparison the federal program requires 22 reduction in its first phase and 69 when fully implemented the effective dates of the state programs range from 2007 at the earliest to 2015 the federal requirements will not be fully implemented until at least 2025 the state programs generally prohibit interstate trading of mercury credits and many also prohibit instate trading the trading prohibitions address the concern that hot spots with high concentrations of mercury might persist if individual plants could avoid installing controls by buying credits this report reviews the state standards for mercury emissions from power plants and discusses issues raised by the promulgation of such standards among these are whether states can prevent the sale of credits generated by compliance with state regulations in epas national credit trading program and the potential impact of state programs on court challenges to epas national regulations contents background 1 which states

electric power plants states are setting stricter limits background on may 18 2005 the us environmental protection agency epa promulgated the first national standards for mercury emissions from coalfired electric power plants1 mercury is potent neurotoxin that can cause adverse health effects principally delayed development neurological defects and lower iq in fetuses and children at very low concentrations2 the principal route of exposure to mercury is through consumption of fish mercury enters water bodies often through air emissions and is taken up through the food chain ultimately affecting humans as result of fish consumption according to the environmental protection agency epa as of december 2004 44 states had issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury3 twentyone states primarily in the midwest and northeast have issued advisories for mercury in all their freshwater lakes andor rivers twelve states in the southeast and new england have advisories for mercury statewide in their coastal waters and hawaii has statewide advisory for mercury in marine fish mercury reaches water bodies from many sources including combustion of fuels containing the substance in trace amounts in the united states coalfired power plants are the largest emission source accounting for 42 of total mercury emissions according to epa epas 2005 regulations referred to as the clean air mercury rule camr establish capandtrade program for power plant mercury that will take effect in 2010 camr will have little impact on emissions before 2018 1 70 federal register 28606 2 for

httpwwwepagovwatersciencefishadvisoriesfs2004pdf crs2 however4 at that time the regulations call for 69 reduction in emissions as compared to the 1999 level in setting the limit so far in the future epa stated in part that mercury control technologies are not commercially available and will not be generally available until after 2010 many observers disagree with that conclusion including growing number of states this report describes what those states that have chosen alternative forms of regulation are requiring which states are setting standards as of february 2007 18 states have established more stringent emission limits that will take effect sooner than will epas and four other states are developing regulations that would do so the states with regulations already promulgated or laws enacted represent broad crosssection of states including arizona colorado connecticut delaware florida illinois maryland massachusetts minnesota montana nevada new hampshire new jersey new york north carolina oregon pennsylvania and virginia 5 together these states have 177 coalfired power plants with total of 414 electric generating units the combined generation capacity of these units is estimated at 97138 megawatts mw 32 of total us coalfired electric generation the four states that have proposed but not yet finalized mercury standards georgia michigan washington and wisconsin have an additional 51 plants their combined generation capacity is estimated at 33986 mw an additional 11 of total us coalfired generation 4 the conclusion regarding the rules lack of impact is based on epas analysis the rule establishes cap of 38 tons of emissions from affected units between 2010 and 2017 but the agency estimates that actual emissions will be reduced to 31 tons in 2010 as the result of pollution controls installed under other nonmercury regulatory programs emissions will continue to decline according to epa reaching 28 tons in 2015 while the cap remains at 38 tons thus the camr rules cap in the period 20102017 serves primarily to generate credits that will be used to delay full compliance with the 69 reduction otherwise required beginning in 2018 full compliance with the 69 reduction according to epas analysis will not occur until after 2025 for additional information see crs report rl32868 mercury emissions from electric power plants an analysis of epas capandtrade regulations 5 many earlier discussions of state mercury requirements including previous crs reports list wisconsin as being among the states requiring more stringent limits wisconsin adopted regulations in 2004 to require 40 reduction in emissions by 2010 and 75 reduction by 2015 the regulations required however that if federal standard limiting mercury emissions from utilities were promulgated under section 111 or 112 of the clean air act wisconsin would adopt it wisconsin has therefore adopted the camr rules budget and is longer to be counted among those states with more stringent limits in august 2006 however the states governor directed his department of natural resources to develop regulations to achieve 90 reduction in utility mercury emissions as soon as possible crs3 what the standards will require rates dates compliance and trading as shown in appendices and b the specifics of the state standards vary in stringency in effective dates and in numerous other details nevertheless at least four generalizations regarding rates dates compliance measurement and allowance trading can be made first at least 15 of the state programs will require reductions of 80 to 90 in mercury emissions when fully implemented second the effective dates range from 2007 at the earliest to 2015 with majority of the programs imposing at least first phase reduction by 2010 the camr rule as noted earlier also imposes cap in 2010 but it calls for 22 reduction in that year whereas most of the state requirements call for 80 to 90 reductions by then third in general the programs provide some flexibility by measuring compliance as rolling 12month average of emissions rather than setting an emission limit to be met at all times camr of course is even more flexible allowing utilities to exceed the standard at individual facilities and even companywide provided that they obtain allowances for each pound of mercury emitted fourth unlike the camr program key feature of which is the trading of emission allowances the state programs generally prohibit interstate trading of mercury credits many prohibit instate trading as well these prohibitions address the concern that mercury hot spots might persist if individual plants could avoid installing controls by buying credits also the states that prohibit interstate trading are insuring that emission reductions within their state not generate credits that could be used to delay reductions by plants in other states ie states participating in the camr program measurement issues and other complications beyond the four generalizations there are number of aspects to the state mercury control programs that vary from state to state for one there are varying forms in which the emission limits are expressed the most commonly used being 1 as percentage reduction from the amount of inlet mercury or 2 as fixed emission limit either pounds per gigawatthour of electricity produced or pounds per trillion btu of energy consumed at least one state montana plans to vary the emission limit depending on the type of coal used allowing substantially higher emissions for lignite others set different limits depending on the size of the plant or of the company that owns it thus it can be difficult to compare the stringency of various state requirements the common rule of thumb in press accounts describing these programs seems to be the percentage emissions reduction that they would require but it is important to ask first compared to what and second whether there is an alternate fixed limit or alternate method of compliance that provides less stringent standard further complicating the emission reduction math are two other factors first the mercury content of coal varies making it difficult to estimate inlet mercury and second many power plants are already achieving substantial emission reductions as result of their existing emission control equipment epa estimates that existing controls are already reducing mercury emissions as compared to inlet amounts of mercury by about onethird nationwide with substantially greater reductions at some plants thus to achieve 90 reduction of inlet mercury does not require crs4 reduction of 90 in current emission levels in some cases particularly at plants with baghouses fabric filters 90 reduction may require little additional control6 data on current mercury emission levels are not generally available in any comprehensive fashion either the best national data come from survey conducted by epa in 1998 which relied on sampling at 80 of the nations more than 1000 coal fired units rather than continuous emissions monitoring at them all7 the mercury content of coal is known to vary even within given coal seam until better monitoring equipment is installed which will be an effect of the state and federal programs it will be difficult to establish with any precision both current emission levels and the exact reductions one can expect from emission control programs other aspects of state laws other complicating features unique to some of the states laws and regulations are worth noting new jersey for example which has the earliest compliance deadline december 15 2007 would extend its deadline to 2012 for half of companys capacity if the plants also make major reductions in sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and particulates virginia has different requirements for the states largest utility which controls 63 of the states coalfired generating capacity than it has for others minnesotas law only applies to facilities with capacity above 500 mw most other states apply requirements to units 25 mw or larger pennsylvania would presume that units with specific combinations of control technology are in compliance with the regulations emission limitations other facto state limits states with allowances in addition to the states that have enacted laws or are developing regulations to control mercury three other states and the district of columbia have facto limits of zero for mercury emissions as result of the federal camr rule an irony of the federal rule is that because it grants allowances to each state based on current emissions of mercury from power plants larger than 25 mw in that state states that have coalfired power plants or that only have plants smaller than 25 mw are given allowances the district of columbia and the states of idaho rhode island and vermont fall into this category and thus have limit of zero for power plant mercury emissions under camr states are not required to adopt the federal capandtrade program but if they do not do so they are required to show that state regulations are at least as stringent as the federal if dc idaho rhode island and vermont do not join the federal program they have to demonstrate that they have limited emissions through instate controls to zero this would effectively prohibit the siting of new coalfired power plants in these jurisdictions 6 us epa office of research and development control of mercury emissions from coalfired electric utility boilers undated posted march 2 2004 available at http

connecticut delaware massachusetts new hampshire new jersey oregon and washington have allowances below 01 ton but as shown in appendices and b are opting out of the camr program __________________________________________________________________ by joining the federal program on the other hand these states and dc would become part of the federal allowance trading program new coalfired power plants would be able to operate in these jurisdictions by buying emission allowances from facilities outside the state that have reduced emissions sooner or to greater extent than camr requires as of february 2007 idaho rhode island and vermont had all decided not to participate in the camr program effectively prohibiting the construction of new coalfired power plants in their jurisdictions states with few allowances five additional states alaska california hawaii maine and south dakota have so little coalfired generation that their combined 2018 allowances under camr are 118 pounds substantially less than 1 of the national total table 1 shows the 2018 allowances under camr for each of these states for these states also there would be little alternative to joining the camr program if the state wished to preserve the option of coalfired power plants since state program would have to show that it would limit emissions to as little as 2 pounds in the case of maine or 32 pounds in the case of california thus alaska hawaii and south dakota have decided to participate in the camr program maine has decided to let epa administer the program california however is reported to be considering state program and is unlikely to consider participating in camr8 model state program in addition to the programs developed by individual states the state and territorial air pollution program administrators stappa and association of local air pollution control officials alapco developed model rule in 2005 to encourage more stringent controls on power plant mercury emissions stappa and 8 see national association of clean air agencies state mercury programs for utilities december 7 2006 at httpwww4cleanairorgdocumentsstatetabledoc crs6 alapco are now known collectively as the national association of clean air agencies nacaa the model which was publicly released november 14 2005 offers two options the first option calls for an average 80 capture of inlet mercury from existing units or an equivalent outputbased emission standard of 0010 lbsgwh based on 12month rolling average beginning december 31 2008 during this phase owners or operators could comply by averaging emissions from all their existing units within the state second phase beginning december 31 2012 would require 9095 capture of inlet mercury or an outputbased emission standard of 0006000025 lbsgwh during this phase averaging would be limited to units located at single electric generating plant the rule would prohibit interstate trading of allowances second option in the stappaalapco model rule like provision in new jerseys law would provide more flexibility to electric generating units in return for the installation of control technologies designed to capture additional pollutants under this option an owner or operator could delay compliance with the mercury emission limits for four years at up to 50 of its generating capacity if it agreed to meet stringent standards for emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides and particulate matter in addition to mercury by the end of 2012 while state has adopted the stappaalapco model intact the model serves as window on what state and local officials closely involved in regulating power plant emissions believe is feasible nineteen of the 22 states that have proposed or adopted programs more stringent than the federal camr rule have done so since the model rules unveiling conclusions with few exceptions it is general precept of federal environmental laws that more stringent state standards are not preempted relying on this authority some states particularly california and number of northeastern states have adopted various environmental requirements that address problems that are judged to be unique to their state or more severe in their state than elsewhere thus state actions to set more stringent limits on mercury emissions are not considered unprecedented or unusual nevertheless the degree to which states are opting out of the federal program and the speed with which they are doing so appear noteworthy in part the development of these state programs reflects judgment by state regulators or legislators that the camr rule is not sufficiently stringent9 in part it reflects judgment that epas assessment of the availability and cost of technology to control mercury emissions are unduly pessimistic10 9 for example see statement of eddie terrill director of the oklahoma air quality division and president of stappa epas approach would allow too much mercury for too long state local government officials unveil model rule to clean up toxic mercury stappaalapco press release november 14 2005 10 for example new jerseys regulatory package written in late 2004 stated usdoe has been studying mercury control on coalfired boilers for more than decade technologies continued crs7 state actions were also dictated by looming deadline for submission of programs for epa approval under the camr rule states had until november 17 2006 to submit their programs either programs adopting camr or programs at least as stringent to epa failure to submit can leave states liable to imposition of federal implementation plan fip which would impose the camr rules requirements on state through an eparun program epa officials have aggressively promoted camr and the threat of fips testifying before state legislatures against the adoption of more stringent state programs and questioning the authority of states to prohibit interstate trading of allowances at the same time many of the states adopting more stringent requirements are pursuing legal action to overturn epas rule and force the agency itself to adopt more stringent requirements11 it may be some time before these issues are resolved in the meantime if state programs with stringent control requirements are successfully implemented it will become more difficult for epa to argue that technology is unavailable to more aggressively control power plant mercury emissions conversely if the technology fails to do its job or proves to be more expensive than emissions control industry 10 continued like aci activated carbon injection are available now usdoe has goal to get costs of aci down to 14th current costs however the current costs of activated carbon injection are justified now there is over decade of successful use of activated carbon injection for municipal solid waste msw combustion in new jersey msw incinerators with baghouse control and aci have achieved 99 percent mercury control transfer of such technology is clearly feasible from an engineering and cost perspective the usdoe cost analyses indicate that retrofitting the coalfired boilers with activated carbon injection aci and baghouses or polishing baghouses can achieve 90 percent mercury emission reduction aci has low capitol sic cost it also has low operating costs if baghouse technology is used see new jersey

httpwwwnjgovdeprulesadoptionsmercury_rule727pdf 11 epa fighting state adoption of strict mercury control regulations inside epa clean air report may 4 2006 the question of whether states may prohibit interstate trading of allowances is an interesting one in the only case law on the question clean air markets group v pataki 338 f3d 82 2d cir 2003 the second circuit held that new york states air pollution mitigation law which restricted instate electrical generating units abilities to transfer emission allowances to upwind states under title iv of the clean air act was preempted by the federal clean air act the court explained that federal preemption results when notwithstanding that the federal and state law have the same goal the state law interferes with the methods by which the federal law was designed to reach that goal by effectively prohibiting the transfer of allowances to electric generating units in other states the new york law interfered with the nationwide allowance transfer system contemplated by the clean air act whether clean air markets provides basis for arguing that state prohibitions on trading mercury allowances are preempted is slightly different question however the wording of the camr rule and its preamble leave some uncertainty as to whether states can retire excess allowances or whether they revert to epa in the latter case allowances generated by more stringent state standards could be sold to electric generating units in other states effectively negating state efforts to prohibit trading of their allowances crs8 spokespersons have asserted epas hand will be strengthened since the earliest state requirements take effect at the end of 2007 and early in 2008 these questions may continue to merit congressional oversight at
