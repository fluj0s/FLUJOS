divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883us automotive industry recent history and issues summary more than one million americans are employed in manufacturing motor vehicles equipment and parts but the i ndustry has changed dramatically since the us big three motor vehicle corporations general motors ford and chrysler produced the overwhelming majority of cars and light trucks sold in the united states and directly employed more than that many people themselves by 2003 most passenger cars sold in the us market were either imported or manufactured by foreignbased producers at new north american plants socalled transplant facilities the big three now dominate only in light trucks and are being challenged there by the foreign brands the big three have shed about 600000 us jobs since 1980 while about onequarter of americans employed in automotive manufacturing nearly 300000 work for foreignowned companies and that excludes chrysler which was acquired by daimler benz of germany in 1998 these changes have had major effects on the structure and location of the us motor vehicle industry michigan has been the state most directly and adversely affected losing about 100000 auto industry jobs since the late 1970s most other midwest auto belt states have either held steady or pos ted gains in total industry employment even if they have lost big three jobs some southern states notably kentucky and tennessee have been the larg est net gainers of jobs in the industry the transplant vehicle manufacturers virt ually all began and have remained non union the united auto workers uaw union has lost more than half its members since 1979 from 15 million to less than 700000 big three representatives state that they are now burdened with health care and pension costs of as much as 1500 per vehicle in competing with foreignba sed companies and have sought tax relief from congress to alleviate this disadvantage the global industry also has changed in north america there has been regional consolidation enabled by trad policy changes leading to the north american free trade agreement of 1994 congress approved federal bailout of chrysler in 1979 and forced the reagan administration to negotiate quotas on imports from japan in the 1980s neverthele ss the overall us deficit in automotive trade widened from 9 billion in 1979 to more than 100 billion annually since 2000 acting under world trade organization rules the united states has pressed japan korea and china among others to reduce their automotive trade and investment barriers fuel economy and environmental issues in the automotive industry have also been subjects of major concern in congre ss and these issues have had important effects on the motor vehicle market currently the manufacturers are suing california to prevent its regulation of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which they claim is preempt ed by federal statute this report will be updated as

findings in the immediate postworld war ii era the auto industry was seen as both pillar and beneficiary of american growth and economic achievement general motors chairman charles wilson procla imed in the 1950s whats good for the country is good for general motors and vice versa more than half the automobiles sold in the united states were then produced by general motors gm its organizational genius alfred sloan had succeeded in creating company that built cars for every purse and purpose as opposed to the original concepts of ford the first icon of automotive mass production whos sole major product for 20 years the model t was any color you wanted as long as it was black1 the other big three producers of the postwar era ford and chrysler together with the still surviving lesser domestic manufacturers merican motors studebakerpackard and kaiser built range of vehicles that met every consumer need among foreign producers only volkswagen and few luxury and sports cars had even small niches in the us marketplace from this oncedominant position in the domestic market the big three today produce less than 60 of all au tomobiles and light trucks sold in the united states their market share has been steadily declining the big three developed consumeroriented light tr uck product the sports utility vehicle suv which market they still dominate but japanese and germanbased

of why gross output rather th an value added is used to measure the total size of the automotive manufacturing s ector see below in this report p 12domestic market by transplanted its of japanese german and korean companies which now build in north america significant and increasing shares of their vehicles that are sold in the united states most of the major companies now compete globally through crossownership and investment in manufacturing plants more than through trade in finished vehicles they also compete through what 2004 commerce department report described as g lobal supply chains whereas us automobile manufacturers once provided ready market for many domestic suppliers of parts and components the manufacturers now operate on global basis thus automotive parts suppliers must now find niches in the global supply chains of us auto comp anies or their foreign competitors to succeed in todays market the possib ility of relying on increased auto sales that automatically translate into in creased orders and components for us suppliers simply longer exists3 developments in the us domestic automotive industry the us automotive manufacturing sector is large and dynamic but its structure is changing whatever changes are occurring globally or within the domestic market production and sales in the united states remain at historically high levels the overall picture of north am erican production is however accompanied by tension within the industry created by the entrance of new international competitors as domestic manufacturers growth has been due in part to internationally based companies transplants especially from japan investing in the north american market initially as substitute for importing while the big three struggled with downsizing issues with growing automotive manufacturing capacity elsewhere especially in asia ther are concerns that the motor industry may be creating problem of global overcapacity the result could be accelerating rationalization and industry closures wh ich could have especially negative consequences for the big three and their us employees such changes do not necessarily portend declining automotive industry in the united states gross output in the us automotive manufacturing sector in 2004 including motor vehicle parts trailers bodies and heavy trucks was 424 billion current dollars that was the larges t output of any durable goods manufactured product grouping measured by the comme rce department bureau of economic analysis bea4 although annual us motor vehicle output has moved up and down since 2000 the au tomotive industry still grew faster than domestic manufacturing overall in 19902003 real output has increased 55 since 1990 compared to 35 for manufacturing as whole but the balance of production between traditional big three manufacturer s and foreignowned transplants has been shifting in favor of the latter and that shift has recently been acceleratinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs3 5 the full name is the united automobile ae rospace and agricultural implement workers of america but its shorter abbr eviation and title are commonly usedthe automotive sector employs mo re people than in 1990 while employment in overall domestic manufacturing significantly declined the big threedominated automotive manuf acturing sector struggled in the 1980s and shed hundreds of thousands of jobs but between 1990 and the end of that decade while employment growth in the re st of manufacturing was just about flat automotive manufacturing employment increased almost 25 or about 250000 jobs despite an employment decline in th industry in 20012004 there were still 55000 more people employed in automotive manufacturing than in 1990 while manufacturing in general st more than three million jobs over the whole period this report examines how the strategies of both the big three and the transplants have contributed to maintain ing or increasing employment there appears increasingly to be two us automotive industries based on organization of the labor force the traditionally unionized big three and the foreignowned trans plants which are mostly non union the big three assembly plants are all organized by the united auto workers uaw union5 the big three have reduced direct employment by about 600000 jobs since 1979 many of these jobs ve been shifted to specialized parts suppliers who employ far more people th an the vehicle manufacturers the two largest are the parts manufacturing spinoffs from formerly integrated big three companies delphi from gm visteon from ford both companies are still organized by the uaw the uaw has also obtained benevolent neutrality agreements whereby the big three promis not to encourage suppliers to oppose unionization and agreements under which the big three promise to give fair consideration to sourcing manufacturing activities inhouse rather than from outside suppliers as the big three have lost market share in recent years the uaw has experienced serious membership dec line from 15 million in the late 1970s to less than 700000 today there are few union shops among the transplant assembly operations the transplants have encouraged direct i nvestment from their traditional home country suppliers into the united states as well as development of local supplier networks based on us official foreign investment data we estimate that foreignowned automotive companies by 2002 employed about one quarter of the 11 million workers in automotive manufacturing in the united states not counting the employees of the chrysler group of daimlerchrysler the bifurcation of the industry h as led to serious competitive cost issues for the big three manufacturers the big three maintain that paying pension and health care costs for retirees as negotiated under union contracts over past decades may cost 1500 or more per vehicle produced today the big three have supported both health car and tax policy changes in congress that would have alleviated this burden but such chan ges have not been passed into law moreover the big three have contracts w ith the uaw that require them to pay employees and provide benefits even when production lines are not operating in thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs4 period after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington they kept their factories producing vehicles and used big consumer incentives to keep selling those vehicles but gm and ford have begun to lose market share in the united states nevertheless this strategy was initially profitable and helped the country pull out of the recession of 2001 but now ford and gm have begun to lose money in their north american automotive operations the three largest japanese owned companies in the united states to yota honda and nissa n are all currently profitable and have held or increased market share in recent years card checks are key strategy for the uaw in trying to regain members the uaw is seeking to maintain its active membership level by insuring that the big three do not outsource part s supply jobs to nonunion operations they are aggressively using card check approach to try to expedite organizing activities at independent partsmaking companies under card check system employers may recognize union as representing employees at facility for collective bargaining purposes once majority of the employees have signed card authorizing the union to represent them as opposed to formal elections supervised by the national labor relations board nlrb the uaw so far has failed to organize any transplant assembly operations that are independent of links to the big three the use of card checks is also under legal challenge before the nlrb the uaw nd the aflcio have supported legislation in congress that would clarify the legality of the use of card checks in establishing union representation the changes in the st ructure of the us automotive industry and the decline in the market share of the big three has most adversely affected michigan and the northeast the core of the us industry including its major supplier base is shifting from the traditional midwest auto belt to the sunbelt and to other locations in the sout h and west michigan has lost minimum of 100000 jobs since the peak of automotiv manufacturing employment in the late 1970s losses in other midwestern states app ears to have been offset by the shift of production jobs from the big three to outsi suppliers and by increased inward foreign direct investment ohio illinoi s and missouri may have marginally gained or lost automotive jobs and indiana appears to be significant net gainer major northeastern industrial states particularly pennsylvania new york and new jersey have lost automotive jobs as the big three have rationalized suppliers and assembly plants kentucky and tennessee have been the biggest job gainers while south carolina alabama north carolina and texas have all gained automotive employment shift of jobs away from th midwest may have been reduced by the widespread adoption of justintime manufacturing modern trucking supply strategies and the developmen t of interstate highways which typically enable parts manufacturers to supply assembly plants up to 400 miles away the automotive industry in the international context the domestic automotive industry is completely integrated within north america trade barriers affecting vehi cles and parts production within north america have been eliminated by successive trade agreements culminating in the north american free tr ade agreement nafta after producing about 12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs5 million vehicles annually in the late 1970s the us domestic industry went through cyclical periods of decline and recovery and next reached that level again in 2000 it has subsequently declined somewhat from that total canada during this period has increased production from less than two million its per year to an average of nearly three million mexico has increased from ss than half million to about two million annually each of the big three and now most of the transplants have vehicle assembly plants in each of the three countries the us automotive trade ficit in 2004 wa s nearly 150 b illion the deficit has grown from less than 10 billion in 1979 to 150 billion despite high levels of inward investment by foreignbrand manufacturer s and decline in imports relative to vehicles built at transplant assembly facilities us policies in the 1980s aimed at requiring foreign owned companies to produce he re more of the vehicles that they sell in the united states and other policies aimed at heightening consumer awareness about imported vehi cles and parts such as the american automobile labeling act appear to have had little effect on the growth of this sectoral trade deficit about 40 billion of the automotive trade deficit is with the nafta partners the united states has large deficit in ve hicles with these two countries though as of 2004 it had small surplus in automotive parts the united states had deficit of more than 30 billion with the european union where exports of usmade vehicles and parts of more than 10 billion we re more than offset by imports in both categories the largest component of the deficit was bila teral trade with japan from which us imports were more than 48 billion and us exports were about 2 billion the united states also imported n early 12 billion in vehicles and parts from korea with less than 1 billion in exports chinas role in the automotive trade deficit in 2004 was relatively insignificant though imports of parts from that country are rising automotive trade issues have had high priority in us trade policy since the early 1980s in the wake of the chrysler bailout and the unsuccessful effort of ford and the uaw to request that the us international trade commission itc establish import safeguards protection the focus of this policy was on rising levels of im ports responding to cong ressional pressures and the request of the reagan administration the ja panese government formally agreed to voluntary export restraints ver and japanese companies began to undertake investments here the polic shifted in the 1990s to focus more on opening the japanese market to imports of motor vehicles and parts from the united states and other countries this effo rt culminated in usjap anese bilateral agreement in 1996 with the establishment of the world trade organization wto in 1995 us policy shifted again to focus more on multilateral pressure against traderelated investment measures and other barriers aimed at creating protected automotive markets for domestically established manuf acturers in many of the industrializing countries the united states has brought or participated in trade cases against such countries as brazil india indonesia ko rea and the philippines criticism from the united states and other wto members of chinas official policy on the automotive industry led to establishment of new au tomotive development policy in 2004 in thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs6 country though it is not clear if implement ation of that policy will be free from all violations of wto rules the united st ates has also proposed that elimination of nontariff barriers to trade in motor vehicles and parts be added to the agenda of the wto doha round of negotiations on revised trade rules meanwhile inauguration of free trade talks between the united states and thailand has led to concerns in congress that one result could be dutyfree entry into the us market of pickup trucks made in that country the worlds secondlargest producer since 1963 the united states s maintained high tariff on imported pickups many in congress are concerned that japanese and korean manufacturers could evade this duty by importing trucks made at their thai facilities globalization means major changes for the us automotive industry and its suppliers the largest motor vehicle markets for the foreseeable future are the advanced industrial countries where vehicle sales have been slow or even negative during the past fifteen years the fastest growth has been in certain large developing countries or countries in transition from planned to capitalist market economies namely china india and russia some analysts believe that there is already excess capacity in the global market and that capacity will increase out of proportion to new dema nd from developing markets the major motor vehicle manufacturers especially including ford and gm increasingly source their vehicles from manufacturing facilities in the regions where they are sold in part due to differing customer demands and tastes as the vehicle manufacturers globalize and rationalize their supply base the impact on the us auto parts manufacturing base which employs several times as many people as the vehicle manufacturers themselves could be the closure of many companies and facilities with the ford and gm market share in north america ving declined large number of major us automotive suppliers are in financial difficulties moreover many of the historically independent supp liers who sold directly to the big three or indirectly through tier 1 suppliers may lack the scale to be competitive in the global market impact of fuel economy and emissions standards environmental issues including vehicle emissions fossil fuel consumption and resource use have played an increasing role in shaping the us auto industry environmental decisions play key part in automotive design research and development of new vehicles nd marketing to consumers fuel economy standards have been effective in reducing energy consumption but have had significant effect on us auto manufacturing corporate average fuel econom cafe standards are estimated to have reduced fuel consumption by as much as onethird from what it otherwise would have been undoubtedly the standard s have significantly affected vehicle design as well as manufacturing and mark eting decisions however because of separate standards fo r passenger cars and light trucks as well as distinction between imported and domestic vehicles the current standards likely ve had differential effects on various manufacturers further any future changes to the cafe system would likely leave some manufactur ers better positioned than othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs7 while individual manufacturer s may have been advantag ed or disadvantaged by the current cafe system the total ffects of cafe on us auto industry employment and output seem to be limited acco rding to an analysis by the national research council however cafe standa rds have affected the ownership of us manufacturing plants if not th total level of employment emissions standards have directly affected the automotive industry over the past four decades and this effect may increase highway vehicle emissions have dropped dram atically over the past few decades for example allowable nitrogen oxide emissions from passenger cars have been cut by roughly 70 from 1980 levels they will be cut fu rther with the introduction of the tier 2 lightduty vehicle standards set by epa like cafe standards the emissions standards may give competitive advantage to some manufactur ers over others on average smaller vehicles with smaller engines tend to emit less than larger vehicles with larger engines therefore those manufacturers that produce larger vehi cles may have more difficulty and may likely need to invest more to comply with the standards furthermore as the tier 2 standards eliminate separate treatment for passenger cars and light trucks the effects on large vehicle producers may increase therefore auto makers that focus on small cars may have competitive advantage over manufacturers that pr oduce larger proportion of light trucks californias greenhouse gas rule may be the most significant current issue regarding automotive fuel economy and emissions standards california adopted regulations in 2004 to require reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of 30 by 2016 in passenger vehicles there are current federal standards for greenhouse ga s emissions and critic s of the regulation maintain that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide are not pollutants under the federal clean air act thus they ar gue that the greenhouse gas standard is facto fuel economy standard and they main tain that reducing emissions of carbon dioxide the key greenhouse gas requi res reductions in fuel consumption opponents of the rule argue that authority to set fuel economy st andards rests solely with the federal government the california rule has been challenged in court the big three and many international auto manufacturers oppose the california rule california officials maintain that they have the authority unde r the clean air act to regulate vehicle greenhouse gas emissions the outcome of th is case could have major effects on the us auto industry as california is major vehicle market and so other states are likely to adopt the califor nia standards if upheld automotive industry outlook and policy issues the prospects for the automotive industry in the united states are mixed sales have been maintained at high leve l since 2000 although only by liberal use of manufacturers incentives and neither sa nor total producti on has grown since then heavy use of incentives especially by gm and ford have promoted saleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs8 6 business week borrowing from the future analys is of automotive sector in special outlook section jan 10 2005 p 100 7 gm stock values and

7 2005since 2001 but at the price of reducing current profits and future demand if companies continue promoting sales through financial incentives then higher interest rates which are widely expected in financial markets will raise the cost of incentives and further reduce earnings big three earnings have also been adversely affected by legacy costs such as rising contributions to pe nsion funds and retiree health care thus the prospects for this indus try as 2005 began were not as robust as in many other sectors6 however gm and ford were profita ble overall in 2004 despite declines in

them however their incentives were much lower per vehicl than those offered by gm and ford8 among foreignbrand motor vehicle manuf acturers only volkswagen which does not assemble cars in the united states and mitsubishi have experienced major declines in sales in 2004 these two co mpanies problems are linked to global competition and management issues not confined to the us market recent

in crisis the 109th congress may address numbe r of policy issues that deal with the subject of equitable competition both internati onally and in the domestic market pension and health care issues report issued on behalf of the big three stated that their ageing work fo rces increasing numbers of retirees and generous health care benefits impose an average cost of at least 1200 per vehicle in 2004 compared to little or legacy cost s of this type for transplant producers the big three along with the uaw suppor ted amending tax legislation in the 108th congress to give manufacturers tax credits for health care payments for older workers and retirees but such amendment or parate legislation was introduced this subject could again become legislative issue in the 109th congress currency exchange rates the automotive trade policy council representing the big three has complained that exchange market intervention by japanese monetary authorities has frequently prevented market forces from appreciating the yen and thus make it easier for the big three to compete against imports from japan at the end of 2001 th value of the dollar was about 132 yen it fell to nearly 100 by the end of the fi rst quarter in 2004 the last period of publicly acknowledged intervention by japan the dollar by april 2005 was little above that level more broadly many us manufacturer s including automotive suppliers have pressed for revaluation of chinas currency the yuan which has been fixed at 828 per dollar for decade as chinas bilate ral trade surplus has risen with the united states rapidly during this period they have pressed to secure currency realignment that would be more reflective of chinas competitiveness at least ten legislative measures were introduced in the 108th

previous year figure 2 illustrates the growth of us automotive industry output on real basis since 1977 and compares it to overa ll us real growth in manufacturing output13 the figure illustrates that us automotive manufacturing did not grow as strongly as us manufacturing overa ll between 1979 and 1990 but did outperform manufacturing in general from 1990 to 2000 the principal reason for this higher relative rate of automotive growth detailed examination later in the report will show is increased output from new plants owned by foreignbased manufacturers the so called transplants inflationadjusted output in the automo tive sector increased about 75 between the late 1970s and 1999 some of which ma be accounted for by the definitional change from sic to naics the figure shows the sensitivity of the industry to the business cycle with declines in the real value of output during recessionary periods in the early 1980s the early 1990s and 2000 01 starting even before the recession in the latter year growth resumed in 2002 but real output again fell slightly in 2003 leaving the industry 13 behind wher it was in 1999 overall from 1977 to 2003 the inflationcorrected real dollar value of the sector increased by less than 2 per year but as the number of major motor vehicle assemblers operating in the united states increased significantly this implies possibly smaller profit margins and downsized workforces for some manufacturers before 1990 the growth in real domestic automotive output was weaker than the rate of overall real ma nufacturing output growth the industry barely recovered from the recession of the early 1980s before the next recession was upon it since 1990 automotive industry output has outperfo rmed the rest of the manufacturing sector of the economy the inflationadjusted index for all manufacturing increased by 315 between 1977 and 1990 for the automotive sector the net change was essentially zero from 1977 to1990 it is true that automotive output peaked one year earlier than total manufacturing but even at the 1989 peak the level was less than 10 higher than in 1977 both automo tive and general manufacturing sectors did much better in the 1990s but the auto s ector significantly outperformed general manufacturing in 1999 it peaked at 75 bove the 1990 level compared to level for all industry of about 40 above the 1990 base

logic to locating the manufacture of certain products or components for the us market in mexico and as some analysts note some maquila dora operations have moved into more sophisticated manufactur ing

the industry created by the entr ance of new international competitors as domestic manufacturers growth has been due in part to internationally based companies especially from japan investing in the north american market initially as substitute for importing while the big three struggled with downsizing issues as will be reviewed in later secti on together with growing automotive manufacturing capacity elsewhere especially in asia there are concerns that the motor industry may be creating problem of overcapacity the result could be more serious rationalization and indus try closures

per year in 2000 gm produced 56 million vehicles and by 2003 despite slow economy that level had fa llen only minimally to 53 million however this level it can be argued was artificia lly maintained by high leve ls of discounted fleet sales and expensive customer incentiv of up to 6000 per vehicle37 ford production at the end of the 1970s was just over half the gm level in 1990 it had reached nearly 70 of gms total and in 2000 ford pr oduced more than 80 of the number of vehicles produced in north america by gm but with the economic recession and an aging ford lineup of models the ratio declined somewhat to 71 in 2003 similarly chrysler also gained on gm in north american production totals it produced less than quarter of the number of vehicles manufactured by gm in 1979 but by 200003 its north american output was about half the gm level as will be shown later some of this change is becau of greater relative success of ford and chrysler in producing light truc ks including

in vehicle output within the big three is the increasing role of canada and mexico in fi nal vehicle assembly appendix table 2 illustrates that the us production level of 98 million vehicles in 2000 wa s about one million below the level of 1979 and was nother one million less in 2003 meanwhile canada had substantially higher produc tion levels in 200003 than in 1979 or 1990 and mexicos big three production in 200003 was double the level of 1990 before nafta this relative decline of the us role in big three north america production appears solely due to decline at gm particular ly at its us plants in 1990 2000 and 2003 gm produced at least two million fewer vehi cles in the united states than in 1979 both ford and chrysler produced more ve hicles annually in the united states in 200003 than in 1979 or 1990 although ford ve hicle output by its us factories in 2003 was barely higher than in 1979 foreign transplants have increased their share of north american motor vehicle production from virtually nothing to more than quarter of the total in 25 years as shown in figure 7 and in more detail in appendix table 2 volkswagen was the only foreignbased producer in 1979 when it produced 175000 units at its plant in new stanton pennsylvania that plant proved to be unsucce ssful and has since been closed with subsequent vw producti on in north america located in mexico by 1990 most japanese manufacturers d vehicle production facilities in north america some transplants were built in direct collaboration with the big three but most of the production came from plants i ndependently designe d built and operated by the japanesebased producers the initial decisions of japanese manufacturers to locate in north america was in part function of usjapan trade relations as will be described in subsequent section of this report but whatever the cause by 1990 more than two million vehicles were assembled each year by the transplants in north america and more than twothirds were built in the united states this total doubled to more than four million annually by the end of the decade moreover while big three output dr opped by 16 million units between 2000 and 2003 transplant output continued to increas despite the economic slowdown from 41 million to 47 million units assembled in north america with all the net gain coming at us plants the japanese producers were joined by bmw and mercedes benz which opened their first north american production fac ilities in south carolina and alabama respectiv ely in 1994 and 1997 the german

permanent new competitive force in north american vehicle manufacturing one which in general has ties to the big three by contrast big threelinked transplants primarily represent an effort by the big three to defend market share in some segments through vehicles produced by controlled or allied foreign producer s but this effort has had li mited ccess and impact on the north american vehicle

shift of the former from cars to light trucks this shift is summarized in figure 7 with more statistical detail provided in appendix table 3 the latter adapted and updated from the earlier crs report as of 1990 despite its substantial dow nsizing in the 1980s gm still produced more than 26 million cars in the united states compared to 147 million trucks cars represented 64 of its us motor vehicle output somewhat surprisingly perhaps given its acquisition of jeep and its minivans chrysler in that year produced about 40 more cars in the united stat than trucks 730000 against 530000 only ford whose pickup trucks had been outselling chevrolet since 1968 and which in 1990 began producing the highly successf ul explorer suv on truck chassis produced more light trucks than cars at its us assembly plants in that year43 and overall despite the popularity of some models produced at us transplant facilities by the 1990s honda accord in ohio toyo ta camry in kentucky more than 78 of all cars produced in the united states were still made by the big three as well as more than 95 of all light trucks by 2003 the big three product mix had ch anged dramatically in favor of greater focus on truck output from us plants most notable was reversal of the ratio at gm whose us output was 64 trucks in 2003 exactly the opposite of the 1990 ratio the ratio of trucks to cars fro m ford and chrysler was even higher fords explorer continued to register str ong sales despite sa fety controversy over rollovers and firestone tires trucks represented 74 of fords us output in 2003 chrysler dedicated almost 80 of its us production in 2003 to the light truck segment in particular as both big three and japanesebased companies struggled to launch models competitive in the minivan segment that chrysler invented chrysler dominated the market for minivans from 1984 until the late 1990s capturing half the total sales44 overall according to study prepared for the alliance of automobile

product declined in sales and is set to be discontinued46 on the other hand it should be added that the big three have not given up on the passe nger car segment for example gm has launched new luxury cadillac models from modernized plant in lansing michigan ford is launching several new models for the 2005 model year including completely redesigned mustang and chrysler has d recent initial

transplants changing faces figure 8 total car and truck production by company type however foreignbased motor vehicle manufacturers have not been content only to gain increasing shares of the car segment they have also rolled out new products from their domestic us production facilities to challenge the big three in the light truck segment by 2003 transpla nt production of light trucks had reached 14 of total us light truck output see figure 8 and every indication is that they intend to compete vigorously in that segment mercedes benz specifically designed its alabama plant to

three together employed almost one million persons in the united states 618000 at gm 240000 at ford and 109000 at chrysler gm also employed 39000 persons in canada and ford employed 18000 there they may be considered as integrated with domestic us production in addition 28000 persons were employed by american motors in the united states and canada so the total employed by u sbased nameplate manufacturers was more than one million in the two countries48 the 1980s witnessed dramatic downs izing of big three employment especially domestically the rise of imports and the recession of the early 1980s resulted in much lower big three producti on and largescale layoffs employment levels did not recover to pr erecession levels after prosperity returned to the domestic industry by 1990 gm had shed more than half its total number of us employees with total of 279000 listed in its annual report of that year ford and chrysler each reduced domestic employment by about quarter to 181000 for ford and 79000 for chrysler as shown above the production focus of th big three shifted to the light truck market in the 1990s and particularly to th suv and minivan segments but this did not prevent further substantial decline in direct employment levels despite decade of strong market growth as also noted earlier gm and ford both downsized especially by spinning off major parts operations in the late 1990s the location breakouts reported in corporat annual reports are not c onsistent over time but for 2000 gm reported total north american automotive employment of 212000 compared to 365000 on similar basis n years earlier for 2003 the total employment level reported for north am erica for gm automotive operations was down to 1900 00 fords tota l reported decline in 19902000 in us

dcx but it seems probable that it has also downsized though by lesser number annual reports indicate that the comb ined chrysler and amc totals in 1979 were 162000 employees worldwide mainly us and canadian the chrysler worldwide total was 110000 in 1990 the latter would mainly represent both chryslers automo tive operations and those it acquired with amc in the united states and canada the

benchmark and 58000 on the basis of sic 371 in 1992 howeve r most of the net gain in 19972002 is presumably due to the dcx merger and the chrysler group is not counted in the industry as transplant chrysler groups employment total was 95000 in 2002 including some employees in canada and mexico meaning that only about 50000 of the net 19972002 increase of 140000 employ ees of foreignaffiliated automotive companies was due to employment expans ion by other manufacturers another feature of this data is the primary line of business rule which means that foreign owned companies with multiple us operations need report all their corporate data under only one line of business thus foreign automotive companies with both importing and manufacturing operations in the united states may report their investment data not as manuf acturing but as wholesale trade motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and supplies in 1992 this item added 71000 employees to the total for us affiliates of foreign companies in the motor vehicle industry or more than the 58000 reported as working in mo tor vehicle manufacturing in 1997 the motor vehicle wholesale activities busin ess number went up to 88000 but in 2002 it declined to 54000 implying that the pr imary line of business for some foreign companies may have shifted from importing to manufacturing this number could be added to the total for motor

were essentially within this delivery distance for most midwestern suppliers even though they may have stretched the definition of the auto belt to the south thus klier in 1999 defined the principal location of us automaking including the transplants as reconcentrating from dispersed locati ons around the country to the i65i75 interstate corridors60 reconcentration of the industry along the

addressed this issue by developing an industrial park at the s ite of its mississippi facility and requiring designated tier 1 direct suppliers to locate there toyota is considering the same option in

decisions he believes that such continued capacity reductions are likely64 divergence in labor relations organization whatever the impact of recent developments in the location of auto manufacturing on state and regional employme nt levels there can be question but that employment trends in recent decades have been adverse for union membership and specifically for the uaw according to 2004 press report the uaws active membership dropped to 624000 at the end of 2003 the lowest level in more than six decades and down from peak of 15 milli on in 197965 the same source contains chart showing that this decline s not abated in recent years as the latest annual total compared to more than 762000 members in 1999 and 702000 at the end of 2002 this decline is not isolated from devel opments in other industries where union membership both absolutely and as sh are of employees in industry sectors has tended to fall since the early 1980s66 the overall decline in total membership may be seen as an aspect of productivity ga ins and the steady decline recorded in the us automotive industry of the hours require d to build motor vehicle and thus relative decline in production workers on the factory floor but productivity alone cannot explain the relative fall in the sh are of employees who are unionized in an industry while the unionized big three have downs ized the unions have been generally

uaw union contract covered 58000 employees69 womack et present the view in the machine that changed the world that union organization of the work force in both the united states and abroad is an artifact of old style mass production in the mo tor vehicle industry the nature of the organization and quality of work under fordi sm led to stratification of factory operations with little opportun ity for advancement by production workers in terms of skill development or possibility of achievement of management positions consequently the critical determinant of worker advancement and security became purely matter of seniority with the union as the buffer between workers and management on issues such as contract term s and disputes within highly formalized system of work rules such system was considered unaccepta ble in the context of lean production as it evolved in japan and then was transf erred by japanese companies to the united states and canada in transplant operations key features of the system became known throughout the automotive manufactur ing world by their japanese names such as kaizen continuous improvement andon ability of single worker to stop an entire production line when qua lity problem is observed and kanban justin time inventory management the mit team who wrote the machine that changed the world reported that toyota author of lean production in its most refined form the toyota production syst em tps studied big three methods in the 1940s and 1950s and concluded that sma ller market volumes and higher material costs in japan would not

concluded that they needed tighter control of quality th roughout the manufacturing process and even beyond from customer order to supplier relations to order fulfilment they also needed system of flexible manufacturin g which enabled them to alter production output among different models and to in troduce new models off existing platforms in fashion that was faster more efficient and less costly than big three retooling and design procedures in all facets of lean production as operated by the japanese companies and their competitors key ement is closer and more continuous relationship between engineers and produc tion staff at both assembly operations and parts suppliers than was consid ered possible in bifurcated union management dichotomy in the mass production system70 many representatives of the big three and the uaw today challenge such an analysis the big three have become hi ghly sensitive about plant visits being concerned that they actually originated many tps and

has been skeptical about the goals of flexible manufacturing the outsourcing of parts and components by nameplate manufacturers and other big three work reorganization tactics which reduce reliance on

losses as the big three have downsized their core automaking operations one approach has been to use card checks by which companies agree to recognize and bargain with union whenever majority of workers has signed union recognition cards card checks are generally considered easier and cheaper for unions to organize than formal election under national labor relations board nlrb auspices as well as being more reliable in terms of the anticipated result gm along with delphi in the 1999 and 2003 contract negotiations agreed to allow cardcheck recognition process in determining representation at manufacturing facilities they further agreed to inform suppliers of their positive and constructive relationship with the uaw in order to signal that big three companies are not seeking to move sourcing to nonunion shops or to discourage union organization of suppliers76 the use of card checks has been challeng ed before the nlrb as the uaw has sought to regain membership by organizing supplier plants the uaw had gained recognition through use of card checks at plants operated by two auto supplier companies dana corp and metaldyne corp but some workers at the plants petitioned to decertify the uaw on the grounds that card checks do not constitute secret ballot on union representation as guaranteed under the national labor relations act by 32 vote reportedly on political party lines the nlrb on june 7 2004 decided to take critical look at whether the process of card checks with management neutrality agreements constitute fair system in determining whether employees desire union uaw president r on gettelfinger has sa id that he does not believe that the nlrb will overturn the widespread practice of card checks77 however the uaw has suspended organizati

contested in automotive industry labormanagement relations is modularization which has been utilized by motor vehicle manufacturers in an effort to improve efficiency while reducing their upfront costs but it has been considered as form of outsourcing nd therefore controversial to the uaw modularization was pioneered by volksw agen in south america particularly at new bus and truck factory that the company built in brazil vw did not build or operate the factory alone key suppliers not only manuf actured complete component systems on site but also invested directly in the parts of the complex that they operated81 the itc report notes that modular ization was derived from studying how dell revolutionized computer manufacturin g and contrasts it with traditional assembly line manufacturing as follows although the traditional model for auto manufacturing is to have the vehicle move down an assembly line as components are installed piece by piece modular assembly shifts large portion of the supply chain management and component integration responsibility to tier 1 suppliers which deliver complete module eg cabin cockpit fitted with instrument clusters airbags audio equipment and wiring to the automaker studies have reportedly shown that outsourcing of basic parts assembly to module producers could save automakers as much as 20 on production costs82 modularization may remove the na meplate assembler from directly manufacturing much of the product it become s rather the marketer coordinator and distributor of the final vehicle notwithst anding

when imports again were slightly higher than transplants as both surpassed the threemillion mark in unit sales101 foreignbrand vehicles now are the dominant market force in passenger car sales if one

actually higher than in 1979 28 of sales compared to 21 then part of the reason for this is that the big three have focused more on the light truck market annual us car sales have been surpasse d by light trucks 94 million in 2003 and the position of the big three is relatively stronger in this category nevertheless foreign nameplates are growing here as well imported light trucks have exceeded

nearly 4 of the market in 2003 even nissan which registered much more modest sales gain over the entire period has done well to increase its share af ter virtual bankruptcy as company and serious

market share by gm and ford particularly in passenger cars reflects more than issues such as exchange rates or health care costs or cyclical trends these critics argue that there is qualitative difference in corporate management and organization which means that foreignowned companies seem to be able to identify consumer needs and tastes more readily than the two largest big three auto manufacturers107 moreover through flexible manufacturing techniques pioneered by the japanese car manufacturers other companies have been able to respond to changes in market demand in manner more agile than the big three with highquality products even as they have been also able to ramp up volume nine of the top 10 choices in the 2005 annual ranking of cars and trucks by consumer reports

levels p eaked in the early 1980s the number of foreignbrand vehicles made domestica lly now roughly equals the number of imported units for both cars and light truc ks moreover encouraged by provisions in federal legislation such as the amer ican automotive labeling act and corporate average fuel economy requireme nts as well as the busine ss realities of justintime inventory control and manuf acturing processes foreig n investing companies have steadily increased the local content of their transplant vehicles nevertheless as shown in figure 10 the us trade deficit in auto motive products including vehicles engines and parts has continued to in crease steadily over the past two decades figure 10 presents the automotive trade bala nces as reported annually by the commerce department on an end use basis for selected years over recent decades as illustrated by the figure the deficit s increased steadily although part of this increase is due to price inflation of motor vehicles the increase in the deficit is mainly due to the fact that exports grew at less than half the rate of imports in both the 1980s and 1990s thus us defic it of 9 billion in 1979 became deficit of 50 billion in 1990 and more than doubled again to 117 billion in 2000 even though the domestic automotive market gr ew slowly after 2000 and exports did not fall the automotive trade deficit increased further to more than 140 billion in 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs52 109 note that the numbers in the table do not exactly match those in figure 11 because they were calculated by the commerce department on the basis of the harmonized tariff schedule hts as reported by the international trade commission instead of enduse trade data however the amounts and direction of the balances are essentially similar data for 1979 on this more detailed basis are not available 110 for example fords third great commercia l success of the preworld war ii era after the t and models was the model which was never introduced in the united states it was designed and built for the british and european markets and manufactured only there brinkley wheels for the world pp 39799 4067the details of how this defi cit has grown and changed nd trade patterns with other countries are shown in appendix table 5 109 the detailed data indicate that the us automotive deficit is structural the global auto market is not integrated and is shaped on the regional level by different tastes and priorities notably much hi gher emphasis on fuel economy in major european and asian markets than is shared in the united states and canada when the big three pioneered the mass production and marketing of automobiles in the early years of the twentieth century both ford and gm from an early date expanded internationally by direct investment and bu ilding vehicles in other markets more than they did by exporting110 but even in trade with canada the us deficit has been steadily increasing over the long term indeed more than half of the approximately 100 billion increase in the automotive trad deficit since 1990 is due to increases with the nafta trading partners the following subsections review us automotive trade on detailed basis with major trading partners the data are drawn from appendix table 5 figure 10 us trade balance in automotive productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs53 nafta automotive trade us exports of motor vehicles and parts have mainly gone to the nafta trading partne rs both before and after the agreement went into effect in 1994 although the au tomotive deficit has widened with both countries in 2004 65 of all us moto r vehicle exports and 78 of all parts exports went to the nafta partners whic h are about the same shares as in 1990 the value of us vehicle exports to mexico did increase from 300 million to more than 4 billion as mexico liberalized its import substitution rules and parts exports more than double d from 43 billion to 113 billion canada remains the largest single foreign market for the united states in both categories with more than 18 billion in vehicle exports and nearly 30 billion in parts more than half the total us exports in both cases both totals were more than double the 1990 levels but the united states in 2004 ran automotiv trade deficits with both countries even though it did have 10 billion surplus in parts with canada thus in addition to being the largest us automotive export market nafta also plays dominant role on the import side nafta now supplie s 46 of all us vehicle imports and more than 50 of all parts imports thes facts are possibly not widely publicized because to major extent this is due to the operations of the big three and their suppliers in the two countries while in 1990 the value of us vehicle imports from canada were 35 billi on less than from japan by 2004 imports from canada were about 50 ahead of both japan and the european union and accounted for third of all imports mexico supplied less than 5 of us total vehicle imports in 1990 but more than 13 in 2004 mexico is also the leading supplier of motor vehicle parts imports just ahead of cana da the united states in 2004 imported ten times the dollar value of parts imports from the two nafta neightbors in roughly equal shares than it did from china which has been of such concern to many people as new competitor trade with other countries the us automotive trade balance with the european union eu formerly known as the european community in recent years has shifted more than with any other non nafta partner us trade with the eu has been historically unbalan ced in favor of the european side in both cars and parts however the level of motor vehicle imports from the eu mostly germany has increased since 1990 dramatically faster than the rate from japan the national competitor traditionally of greatest concern to the us motor industry in recent decades with 31 billion in total vehicle imports in 2004 the eu is now challenging japan for second place behind cana da in this category moreover with total surplus of 42 billion in cars and parts the eu is also now beginning to approximate japans bilateral automotive surplus which was 48 billion in 2003 on the other hand us exports of vehicles and parts was 107 billion to the eu in 2003 compared with only 20 billion to japan korea has also become significant factor in the us automotive trade deficit as the bilateral us defic it in vehicles and parts rose from just 15 billion in 1990 to 11 billion in 2003 moreover among all major trading partners the korean market remains most restrictive in rms of us exports only about 500 million in total in 2004 as mentioned above automotive imports from japan are widely believed to be the

nnually senator robert dole of kansas then chairman of the finance committee117 reportedly informed the new reagan administration that this legislation would be passed in the senate by vetoproof majority the reagan administration pressed japa n instead to take action on its own by enacting voluntary restraints on its au tomotive exports to avoid possible conflict with us antitrust rules by pu

year this socalled volunt ary export restraint ver avoided further action on the quota bill being considered in the senate however as the us auto industry continued to struggle in the early 1980s the house twice passed domestic content legislation that would have fo rced japanese automotive manufacturers to produce vehicles in the united states for the local market to discourage such measures the japanese export restraints were extended annually for several years with some upward adjustment in the volume numbers the three leading japanese manufacturers in terms of sales in the united states toyota honda nissan all established manufacturing plants in the united states by 1985 this result had been sought by both the uaw and the big three their view was apparently that in taking such step the japanese manufacturers would have to hire us workers would t hus face the same competitive manufacturing conditions as the domestic big three and would also lose the export advantage of currency that was then falling substantially against the us dollar but things did not play out exactly as the us auto interests had planned forced to manufacture in the north american market the japanese

section 301 of the 1974 trade act in the mid1990s in an effort to open the japanese market wider to us auto and automotive parts exports the increase in both japanese imports and japaneseowned motor vehicl manufacturing in the united states had led japan to become the biggest supplier of auto parts imports into the united states by 1990 furthermore japan had not only ove rtaken canada in that category by substantial margin 104 billion to 91 b illion but usjapan trade was much more unbalanced thus the united states d surplus with canada in parts and though it ran an overall automotive twoway trade deficit canada was also the biggest us export market for vehicles by comparison us exports of cars and parts to japan were each less than 1 billion the reagan and george hw bush

trade account president clinton updated this approach in an effort focused on two industrial product sectors aut and parts and photogra phic film where it was felt that us manufacturers could

was again seri ous concern to the big three and they still believe that the yen is undervalued while much of us industry has been most worried about the value of the chinese currency which they believe the chinese government has maintained at level that is too low to the dollar given the large and growing us bilateral trade deficit the auto industry re mains fixated on the yen the recent report of the atpc cited above illustrates declining share of us auto market shares held by the big three that parallels decline in the dollar exchange value of the yen especially in the late 1990s

expanding faster us automotive manufacturers abroad or fo reign manufacturers in the us domestic market to measure expansion on comparable basis these two figures are based on sales of affiliates it might have been preferable to measure relative changes in direct investment positions but these data might be misleading in part because us manufacturers have increasingl used finance affiliates in third countries in equity transactions and this practice may distort statistical reporting on the destination of investments135 the two figures cover the pe riod from 1983 when the earliest data on comparable basis are readily available to 2002 which is the latest year for such complete data figure 11 shows the value of sales of direct investment affiliates abroad of us companies 10 or more

in the united states was reported under ma nufacturing and in 2002 about twothirds of the sales of japanese motor vehicle affiliates was still reported under investment in wholesale trade us companies operating through affiliates abroad could make the same choice in reporting outward data but sales by the big three under this heading do not seem to be significant looking at the sales figures for this 20 year period as whole there seems to be relatively little difference in the magnitude of sales in the two directions foreign sales by us multinational affiliates of us automotive companies cars

not see way to generate homegro wn demand for full industrialization moreover expanding the availability of motor vehicles may validate successful development strategies through the achievement of enhanced personal mobility at the mass level these authors argue that most industrializing countries thus cling to model of motor vehicle industry developm ent which seeks to capture technology from established international manufacturer s through joint venture arrangements enforced by facto or jure protectionism that require technology transfers furthermore given the low levels of income per capita in such countries their usual highly unequal nature of in come distribution and the strain that largescale automotive import levels would place on the balance of payments the authors state that policy of satisfying motor vehi cle demand through imports would not be politically or economi cally feasible maxton and wormald conclude owning pr ivate automobile or light truck for personal use as in north america remains essentially an accouterment of citizens of wealthy countries requiring curre nt minimum income level equivalent of 10000 per year for the vehicle owner t hus although by their calculations 11 of global gross domestic product is connected with the motor vehicle industry and 15 of all steel 40 of all rubber 25 of all glass and staggering 40 of annual oil output in the world are consumed by motor vehicles 70 of all vehicles produced are still sold in western europe north america and japan nor do they see the balance changing except at slow pace and one at which new capacity is brought on stream faster than the ability of markets even fastgrowing ones in developing countries to absorb product at rate that is both economically efficient and profitable for producers165 the key market in their analysis as well as in that of most major motor vehicle manufacturers is china alone among all national or regionally integrated markets in which more than one

agreements between national companies and overeager foreign investment partners but they are sk eptical that even china with coherent statedeveloped industry plan and the wo rlds largest market potential can achieve this goal within reasonable market plan time frame each additional one million vehicles per year sold in china they not is only about the equivalent of weeks sales in the advanced indus trial countries and even if china succeeds in creating an export industry they hypothesize its greatest impact on export markets by the end of the present decade will be in small vehicles with an emphasis on lowpriced products167 among other producers these two authors rate russia india and surprisingly iran as having some chance of creating new competitors with global impact russia now produces about 15 million cars annually or about half the total in the former soviet union eastern european countries the key issue that the authors saw there was the overall economic organization of society and the economy iran which in most recent data produced about 600000 car s or more than 80 of the middle east total with technology acquired from peugeot was rate d by the authors as having chance of expanding its lowend production and export base in the middle east and central asia region and perhaps beyond168 india produces less than one million cars annually but is

india170 the global automotive supplier industry as noted earlier in this report the u s motor vehicle parts and equipment industry employs far more people than th brandname motor vehicle assemblers this industry has been under increasing pr essure as motor vehicle manufacturers seek both to rationalize and globalize their supply chains the us auto parts industry in recent years has thus faced pressure from two directions first while pr oliferating models in hopes of filling more market niches the major vehicle manufacturers have also sought to reduce costs by driving model designs off smaller number of vehi cle platforms emphasizing greater commonality of parts but with more distinctive features while reducing the number of suppliers ford and gm have also stre ssed that they intend to source more parts from cheaper production locations especially china as the vehicle manufacturers especially the us big three have incr easingly deintegrated their manufacturing processes relying more on outside supp liers who must compete to supply parts components and modules they have used their market power to force cost down model of everdecreasing unit prices on suppliers171 this pressure has been exacerbated by the growth of japanese and european based transplants which s increased the presence of foreignbased auto suppliers in the us market and added to competition and capacity in market that is already mature for example three of the five japanese suppliers among the top 25 globally have about quarter or more of their sales in north amer ica one of them yazaki sold nearly as much in north america in 2003 as it did in japan172 the second factor that has squeezed this industry is the rising cost of materials especially steel motor vehicle parts manufacturers were

in production facilities near assembly plants typology that s eeks to explain supplier location as outlined by the two british authors is summarized in table 5 this global analysis is interesting to compare with discussion above of the auto parts supply business by the chicago federal reserve bank both appro aches stress that changes in location of parts manufacturing operations would move incrementally but the chicago fed emphasized that the key determinant would be the location of the assembly plant itself and the associated transportati on infrastructure maxton and wormald emphasize instead the size complexity nd specificity of the part component or system these authors believe that as with the vehicle manufacturers the parts industry will move in the direction of consolidation following the recent trend of deintegration from the vehicle assemblers but if ownership is consolidated at the global level the typology outlined in table 5 may help determine to what extent local manufacturing operations are c onsolidated globally or regionally notwithstanding the arguments put forward for globalization via exporting direct foreign greenfield investments or mergers and

the absence of fuel economy st andards fuel consumption would have increased at an even faster rate according to the national research council while it is difficult to say what fuel consumption would have been had there been cafe standards it is clear that if lightduty fuel use had continued to grow at the same rate as lightduty vm t vehicle miles traveled the united states would be consuming approximately 55 billion more gallons of gasoline each year184 this 55 billion gallons would represent roughly 40 increase in gasoline consumption while there is guarantee that fuel consumption would have risen this much it is clear that the cafe standards have been effective at reducing fuel consumption from what it otherwise would have been one of the most significant environmental standards

cases this is due to significant banking of cafe credits including alternative fuel vehicle credits 189 49 cfr 523fines the structure of cafe and manufact urers responses to it have shaped the evolution of the auto industr over nearly three decades structure of cafe system for given model year each manufacturers vehicles are divided in to three fleets domesticallyproduced passenger cars foreign produced passenger cars and light trucks each of these fleets must meet the applicable cafe standard separately for my2005 the passenger car both domestic and foreign standa rd is 275 miles per gallon mpg while the light truck standard is 210 mpg the specific definiti ons of passenger car vs light truck and foreign vs domestic have had direct eff ects on vehicle design and plant location as will be discussed below if manufacturers fleet fails to meet the average standard the company is assessed fine of 550 per vehicle for each 110th of an mpg below the standard for example if manufacturer sold 1 million light trucks in my2005 with an average fuel economy of 208 mpg 210 below the standard the total fine would be 11 million however if ma nufacturers fuel economy exceeds the cafe standard in given year that manufacturer may bank credits for future use up to three years likewise manufacturer may borrow credits from future years up to three years if the manufacturer expects to exceed the standard in the future186 manufacturers may also generate cafe credits through the manufacture and sale of alternative fuel vehicles credits may not be traded among manufacturers nor may manufacturer trade credits among its various fleets eg manufacturer may not transfer credits from its domestic car fleet to its light truck fleet since 1983 the national highway traffi c safety administration nhtsa which administers the cafe program has assessed over 500 million in fines on european auto manufacturers187 to date american or asian auto maker has ever paid cafe fine188 but regardless of whether ma nufacturer has paid fine the cafe program has had noticeable effect on the us auto industry as has the specific structure of cafe light truck and passenger car fleets the distinction between light trucks and cars under cafe has directly affected the us industry especially the ways in which new vehicles are designed vehicle is classified as light truck if it has offroad capability or has significan t trucklike features these features include an open bed an enclosed loading area or loading area that can be made flat through the removal of rear seats189 under this definition all pickup trucks vanshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs87 190 vehicles which are similar in design to both cars and suvs frequently referred to as crossover utility vehicles cuvs may fall

sport utility vehicles minivans and light trucks an overview of fuel ec onomy and emissions standards by brent yacobucci 192 there was similar twofleet rule for light trucks but this rule was eliminated after my1995 193 pl 94163 sec 503band minivans qualify as light trucks as do the majority of suvs190 the original justification for the separate standards is that when cafe was enacted light trucks were used mainly as commercial and agri cultural work vehicles and needed more hauling capacity and would thus be less able to meet the car standard further these vehicles were relatively small portion of the us automobile market in the 1970s191 the distinction between cars and truc ks under cafe has drawn criticism by some environmental groups because light trucks are used more and more as passenger vehicles as opposed to work vehicl as evidenced by the fact that light trucks claim more than half of the passenger vehicle market further critics of the auto industry are concerned that ma nufacturer may be able to make minor modifications to passenger car to turn it into light truck they argue that if the original car has fuel economy below the passenger car standar d but above the light truck standard then an au to maker could improve both its cafe averages without improving its overall fuel economy in fact some vehicle models that were originally declared passenger cars by automakers are now considered light trucks for cafe purposes the twofleet rule in addition to the distinction between passenger cars and light trucks there is also distin ction between domesticallyproduced passenger cars and those produced in foreign countries192 if 75 or more of vehicles parts and labor originate in the united states or canada and xico under nafta it is considered part of manuf acturers domestic fleet otherwise it is considered part of its foreign fleet except in some specific cases the ownership of the manufacturer does not affect whether the vehicle is considered foreign or domestic this distinction was enacted by congress to keep us manufacturers from relocating small car production abroad and closing small car plants in the united states193 if manufacturer were to do so th the relocated production could not be counted in the average with vehicles produ ced domestically in the case of smaller cars which tend to have higher fuel ec onomy this became major disincentive to relocate those plants outsi of the united states however this twofleet rule also created barrier preventing foreignowned manufacturers from using americanmade parts in

that manufacturers import cafe average is just meeting the standard reclassifying one vehicle from import to domestic could suddenly take that manufacturer out of compliance and make them subject to

s manufacturers may petition nhtsa to claim usproduced vehi cles as part of their import average as long as doing so would not harm us auto industry employment195 this waiver allows foreign manufacturers to build plants in the united states and use amer icanmade parts without the risk of cafe penalties in 2004 nissan petitioned to include vehicl produced in plant in mexico as part of its import average as re sult of nafta those vehicles which were previously classified as imports were reclassified as domestic however as these were smaller more efficient vehicles the reclassification made their import fleet noncompliant with the sta ndard nhtsa concluded th at denying nissans request would result in the use of fewer american made parts which would lead to fewer jobs in the us auto industry196 alternative fuel vehicles in addition to the credits generated by exceeding the cafe standard in given year auto makers may also generate credits through the sale of alternative fuel vehicles t hose that run on fuels other than gasoline or diesel fuel the alternative motor fuel s act of 1988 was enacted to promote the expanded use of alternative fuels and establish market for alternative fuel vehicles197 alternative fuel vehicles are treated as having significantly higher fuel economy than their conventiona l counterparts however there is limit to the level of cafe increase attributable to the sale of alternative fuel vehicles 09 mpg in my2004 and thereafter in 2002 the department of transporta tion dot concluded that the cafe incentives have been successful in stimulating significant increase in the availability of alternative fuel vehicles198 the majority of these vehicles are dual fuel and flexfuel vehicles which have the capability of fueling on alternative fuelshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs89 199 dualfuel vehicles are capable of operating on either an alternative or conventional fuel depending on which mode is chosen flexfuel vehicles

for transportation is still low compared to petroleum see figure 16 and the majority of alternative fuel use in the ited states is as blending component in conventional gasoline not as fuel in alternative fuel vehicles202 safety concerns one of the key policy concerns over cafe has been its effect on vehicle safety key criticism of the cafe standards is that more traffic fatalities have resulted from the enactment of the standards cafe critics argue thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs90 203 it should be noted that traffic deaths measur ed as ratio of the number of vehicles the number of vehiclemiles traveled or populati on have dropped significantly since the 1970s the area of debate is whether the number of deaths would have been even lower in the absence of cafe standards 204 national research council op cit p 117 205 ibid p 4 206 ibid p 119 207 ibid p 22one of the cheapest and easiest ways to make vehicles compliant with cafe is to reduce their size and weight thus reducing fuel consumption they argue that as result of the standards vehicle size and weight rapidly decreased from the early 1970s to the late 1970s and that mo re traffic deaths have resulted203 opponents of this view argue that other factors suc h as size as opposed to weight may have played role in the number of fatalities and that the effects of cafe on safety are more limited204 the conclusion that traffic fatalities have increased from an earlier downsizing or downweighting of the passenger car fleet could inform any future policy discussion on cafe such conclusion does not necessarily mean however that any future increases in cafe would result in more traffic deaths the national research council concluded th at given sufficient lead time and with proper design cafe can be improved significantly wit hout jeopardizing overa ll passenger safety they argue that new technologies can be implemented to improve fuel economy without changing other vehi cle specifications if manufact urers are given sufficient lead time205 further in the case of collision between to vehicles of different weights passengers in the lighter vehicle are more likely to be hurt or killed it has been argued that if the heaviest vehicles were downweighted larger light trucks while keeping the weight of smaller vehicles constant any increased risk to passengers in the heavier vehicles could be offset by decreased risk to the passengers in the smaller vehicles therefore the specific structure of changes to cafe would likely affect the safety of the vehicle fleet206 effects of cafe on the auto industry it is difficult to separate the economic effects of the cafe standards from other factors affecting the auto industry however the total effects of cafe on industry employment and output seem to be limited according to the national research council examination of the data shows little evidence of dramatic impact of fuel economy regulations general economic conditions and especially globalization of the automobile industry seem to have been far more important than fuel economy regulations in determining the profitability and employment shares of the domestic automakers and their competitors207 however cafe standards have affected th ownership of us manufacturing plants if not the total level of empl oyment as was stated above the twofleet rule has had noticeable impact on the parts used in foreignowned us facilities this effect seems to be even more likely in the future as more and more foreign manufacturershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs91 208 it is argued that some manufacturers subsidiz the sale of their smaller vehicles in order to improve their fleet fuel economy and avoid paying cafe penalties 209 carolyn whetzel california agency dopts nations first rule to

the twofleet rule may choose to assemble vehicles using fore ign parts instead of parts made in north america further it is likely that the cafe standards have given competitive advantage to some manufacturers over others those auto makers with history of building smaller and more efficient vehicles have had less need to adjust their design and manufacturing as well as marketing208 in response if cafe standards were tightened the advantage for small car producers would likely be expanded in addition to competitive effects of th cafe structure the alternative fuel cafe incentives have undoubtedly motivated auto makers to produce more alternative fuel vehicles then they might have otherwise whether or not these vehicles have helped reduce petroleu m consumption severa l automakers have focused on producing flexfuel and dualfu vehicles to increase their cafe averages in some cases the result has been the use of additional components to make the vehicle flex fuel compatible capability consumers may not even know their vehicles have and thus never use current issues several issues have domin ated the discussion of fuel economy standards over the past few years at the federal level these include proposal by nhtsa to examine the structure of the cafe system legislative proposals to increase cafe standards for car s andor light truc ks and debate over whether to continue the cafe alternativ fuel vehicle incentives other relevant issues include state actions to contro l greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and actions by other countries to set fuel

not pollutant under the clean air act213 california officials maintain that th ey have the authority under the clean air act to regulate vehicl greenhouse gas emissions the outcome of this case will likely have major effects on the us auto industry if the standards are upheld new york and other states are likely to adopt californias standards the state of ca lifornia estimates that complying with

1970s created market for the catalytic converter now standard component in any passenger car or light truck an entire category of auto parts suppliers emission control manufacturers has evolved since the 1960s further the emissions profile has become key component of new vehicle s design especially in terms of the vehicles engine and exhaust systems as can be seen from figure 18 highway vehicle missions have dropped significantly from the 1970s and they can be ex pected to continue to decline with the introduction of new technologie s to meet the tier 2 light duty vehicle standards and the 2007 heavyduty standards despite cerns about costs of meeting increasingly stringent emissions standards in the past auto makers have succeeded in meeting the challenge even when the technology to m eet the standard had not necessarily been identified at the time the standards were initially promulgated the costs of meeting the standards have likely limited auto manufacturers profits but by and large the costs of compliance have been lower than those predicted by policy makers when the standards were promulgated however whether this will be true of the new standards remains matter for speculationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs96 it should be noted that there are diff erential effects from emissions standards on average smaller vehicles with smaller engines tend to emit less than larger vehicles with larger engines therefore those manufacturers that produce larger vehicles may have more difficulty and likely need to invest more to comply with the standards as the tier 2 standards eliminate the separate treatment for passenger cars and light trucks the effects on large vehicle producers may increase therefore auto makers that focus on small cars may be better positioned than manufacturers that produce larger proportion of light trucks in addition to the above distinctions parate emissions sta ndards for california as well as other states that adopt th california standards could expand the competitive advantage for small vehicle producers as the california standards are even more stringent than the tier 2 standards fuel quality improved fuel quality is key component in the success of any technology to improve vehicle emissions the elimination of lead in gasoline paved the way for the use of catalytic converters in automobiles in addition to eliminating lead itself as source of air pollution to meet more and more stringent vehicle emissions standards even cleaner fuel is necessary to allow the use of advan ced catalysts and othe r technologies fuel must be virtually sulfurfree as part of epas tier 2 and heavyduty engine emissions strategies by 2010 gasoline sulf ur content will be reduced by over 90 while diesel sulfur content will be reduced by 97 it is expected that these reductions in sulfur content will improve the durability of new emission control systems potentially reducing the cost to the auto industry it should be noted however that these improvements have costs and that fuel prices will likely increase as result it is possible that if fuel costs increase too much miles driven will decrease limiting demand for new vehicles current issues while epas management of the implementation of new emissions regulations is matter of congressional oversight there has been limited congressional action on auto emissions in recent yearshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32883crs97 appendix table 1 north american vehicle production by country millions of units yearunited states canada mexico total vehicle production vehicles of
