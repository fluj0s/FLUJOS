classified by ambassador philip d murphy reasons 14 b and d 1 c summary chancellery national security advisor christoph heusgen told eur as phil gordon and ambassador murphy in november 10 meeting in berlin that germany strongly preferred that the proposed international conference on afghanistan be held outside the country to make it easier to press karzai to commit to the necessary reforms on the middle east heusgen thought netanyahu had to do much more on settlements if there was to be any hope of restarting negotiations on iran heusgen hoped for some conclusion by early next month on whether the diplomatic track was going to bear fruit so that this issue could be discussed at the december 10 eu summit heusgen said germany was ready to discuss taking guantanamo detainees but stressed the importance of dealing directly with the ministry of interior and keeping the negotiations confidential while arguing for being rhetorically supportive of the medvedev european security proposal heusgen shared us skepticism about new treaty and an osce summit hosted by kazakhstan heusgen distanced the chancellery from the proposal to remove all remaining tactical nuclear weapons from germany stressing the need to get reciprocal cuts from the russians also discussed was cfe the macedonian name issue and bosnia end summary afghanistan 2 c heusgen confirmed that germany would only announce additional resources for afghanistan after the proposed international conference which chancellor merkel and uk pm brown are now proposing for january 28 in london he said the conference is key because this is where the germans expect the afghan government to make specific commitments to improve governance and to gradually begin assuming responsibility from the international community president karzai had to be put under international pressure to perform according to prescribed benchmarks toward that end the chancellery felt strongly that the conference should be held outside of afghanistan and not on karzais home turf heusgen complained that the german and us embassies in kabul are on different track and pushing for conference in kabul it was important to make up our minds quickly on the way ahead if the conference slipped to february or later and the uk were longer able to host it in view of the upcoming parliamentary elections there then germany would be willing to 3 c heusgen at first expressed concern that the us would undermine international leverage on karzai by rolling out its new strategy and resource commitments before he made any reciprocal commitments to reform gordon assured him that the formal us rollout would only come after the november 19 inauguration where karzai is expected to say the right things in his inaugural address gordon also highlighted the need to coordinate on the us rollout to avoid the perception that the us was americanizing the international effort in afghanistan it should be announced as common strategy and not as us strategy to which the allies then respond heusgen agreed in principle but indicated that germany would stick to its approach of holding back on any announcement of new commitments until after the international conference middle east 4 c referring to the secretarys recent public statements on settlements heusgen said that germany perceives this differently and thought netanyahu needed to do more in order bring the palestinians to the negotiating table with palestinians in east jerusalem getting notices from israeli authorities that their houses will be destroyed it would be suicide for president abbas to move under the current circumstances heusgen said he could not fathom why netanyahu did not understand this he suggested pressuring netanyahu by linking favorable unsc treatment of the goldstone report to israel committing to complete stop in settlement activity gordon said that making direct linkage between the two would almost certainly be counterproductive but agreed that it was worth pointing out to the israelis that their policy on settlements was making it difficult for their friends to hold the line in the unsc heusgen said this certainly would be an issue when netanyahu and half of his cabinet visit berlin on november 30 for bilateral government consultations iran 5 c heusgen praised the us for its patience with iran berlin 00001433 002 of 003 but noted that at some point it would be necessary to move to the second track in order to maintain credibility heusgen said that he and his british counterpart agreed that ideally there would be some conclusion on this by early next month so that the way ahead could be discussed by eu leaders at their summit on december 10 gordon agreed that there had to be time limit noting that president obama had given the iranians by the end of the year to respond favorably he also noted that the us could support turkish role in the proposed exchange of lowenriched uranium for reactor fuel if that would make it easier for iran to accept the deal gordon indicated however that turkish pm erdogan needed to be careful about losing credibility in washington if he continued to make comments about ahmadinejad being his friend guantanamo detainees 6 c heusgen noted that now that the bundestag election was past germany was ready to help on detainees as it had promised earlier he advised the usg to work directly with new interior minister maiziere rather than going first to mfa and the chancellery which had irritated maizieres predecessor and made him less willing to cooperate in this regard he thought that it would be helpful if dhs secretary napolitano made direct contact with maiziere heusgen also suggested that the discussions be kept confidential until moi had come to decision on which detainees to accept and in which state they would be settled premature public disclosure could doom the whole initiative heusgen said that uighurs would be too difficult but that germany could probably accept 23 others comment the reluctance about uighurs is due to the expected negative reaction of the chinese government end comment european security proposal and possible osce summit 7 c heusgen said that while the west should try to react positively to whatever the russians propose in advancing the medvedev european security proposal nothing should be accepted that would undermine current european security institutions including the osce he shared gordons misgivings about proposed treaty he was also skeptical about the idea of an osce summit in astana agreeing that kazakhstans human rghts record and the lack of substantive agenda items made it unattractive heusgen suggested that an osce summit be offered to the russians on the condition they solve the frozen conflict in transnistria which he said moscow could accomplish in about month tactical nuclear weapons 8 c in response to gordons question about how the government planned to take forward the commitment in the coalition agreement to seek the removal of all remaining nuclear weapons from germany heusgen distanced the chancellery from the proposal claiming that this had been forced upon them by fm westerwelle heusgen said that from his perspective it made sense to unilaterally withdraw the 20 tactical nuclear weapons still in germany while russia maintains thousands of them it would only be worth it if both sides drew down gordon noted that it was important to think through all the potential consequences of the german proposal before going forward for example withdrawal of nuclear weapons from germany and perhaps from belgium and the netherlands could make it very difficult politically for turkey to maintain its own stockpile even though it was still convinced of the need to do so cfe 9 c gordon asked for heusgens views on german cfe paper that had been delivered to the state department just few days earlier heusgen said he did not know anything about it claiming that he did not follow this issue closely or believe in it he noted that mfa loved this disarmament business which was okay but it had to be balanced or the russians will sit there and laugh macedonian name issue 10 c gordon briefed heusgen on the current state of the negotiations noting that the two key issues were the geographic modifier and international usage heusgen noted that the chancellor knew pm macedonian gruevski through their common membership in the european peoples party and would be willing to engage him on this issue if that would be helpful bosnia berlin 00001433 003 of 003 11 c heusgen revealed that serb president tadic was coming to berlin the week of november 16 for consultations he noted that while tadic always claimed to be tough on republika srpska pm dodic he needed to be tougher while expressing pessimism about whether it would ever be possible to turn bosnia into working state heusgen agreed it was important to keep trying murphy
