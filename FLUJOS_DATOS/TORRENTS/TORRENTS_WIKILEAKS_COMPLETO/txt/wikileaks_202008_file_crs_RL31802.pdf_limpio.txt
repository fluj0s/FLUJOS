september 23 2003 unofficial staff table of the house committee on appropriations which includes estimates for the fy2004 house and senate actions as we ll as estimated fy2003 amounts amounts from committee reports on fy2004 dhs appr opriations hrept 108169 srept 10886 were not used is this report becau each of those reports used different account arrangements also since fy2003 appropriations were acted prior to the establishment of dhs funding will likely be subject to seri of adjustments beyond the end of the 2003 fiscal year in most cases data represent net dhs funding for specific programs and activities after incor porating current and forward funding supplemental appropriations and advance appropriations however all data are subject to additional scorekeeping decisi ons that can alter account totals for each fiscal year and as result affect the subtotals in various tables shown below 302a and 302b allocation ceilings the maximum budget authority for annual dhs appropriations is determined through twostage congressional budget process in the first stage the c ongress agrees to overa ll spending totals in the annual concurrent reso lution on the budget subsequently these amounts are allocated among the various committees usually through the statement of managers for the conference report on the budget re solution these amounts are known as the 302a allocations they include the discretionary totals available to the house and senate committees on appropriations for actment in annual ppropriations for fy2004 the congress agreed to the budget resolution hconres 95 and its conference report hrept 10871 on apr il 11 2003 the resolution provides for an fy2004 discretionary total of 7845 billi on for procedural information see crs report 98721 introduction to the federal budget process httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31802crs3 in the second stage of the process the appropriations committees allocate the 302a discretionary funds among their subcommittees for each of the 13 annual appropriations bills these amounts are known as the 302b allocations these allocations must add up to more than the 302a discretionary allocation and form the basis for enforcing budget discipline since any bill reported with total above the ceiling is subject to point of order the 302b allocations can and often do get adjusted during the year as the various appropriations bills progress toward final enac tment the initial 302b discretionary allocations for the fy2004 appr opriations bills were agreed to by the house and senate committees on appr opriations on june 17 2003 as shown in table 2 comparable amounts for fy2003 and the presidents fy2004 budget are also shown both the 302a and the 302b allocations regularl become contested issues in

comparable amounts from the fy2003 enacted fy2004 request and fy2004 enacted are based on the september 23 2003 unofficial table of the house committee on appropriations highlights this report describes the presidents proposal for fy2004 appropriations for dhs programs as submitted to the cong ress february 3 2003 and the congressional response to that proposal it compares the fy2004 amounts enacted through pl 10990 with the house nd senatepassed amounts fo r fy2004 in addition it includes the presidents fy2004 request and current estimates of the fy2003 amounts for programs and activities that were transferred to dhs after its establishment on january 24 2003 nearly 4 months after the start of fy2003 the report tracks legislative ac tion and congressional issues related to the fy2004 dhs appropriations bill with particular attention paid to discretionary programs however the report does not follow specifi c funding issues related to mandatory dhs programs such as retirement pay nor does it systematically follow any legislation related to the authoriza tion or amendment of dhs programs the department of home land security appropriati ons act 2004 is unique in that it is the first ever appropriations fo r the new federal depa rtment there was potential for being contentious because of the serious nature of the activities funded as well as organizational problems that may occur with the establishment of any large organization this bill provi des all of the discretionary funds for dhs unlike manyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31802crs4 other appropriations

offices to the new department of homeland security dhs created by the act the dhs was organized in four major directorates border and transportation security emergency preparedness and response science and tec hnology and information analysis and infrastructure protection the final bill included appropria tions of 56 billion for biodefense countermeasures sometimes refe rred to as project bioshield to remain available until september 30 2013 however the bill limits the availability of these funds for obligation so that more than 34 billi on may be obligated during the next 4 years and more than 890 million may be obligated in fy2004 by enacting the house provision the fy2004 dhs bill appropriates 56 billion for the entire 10 year period but only 890 million of that is counted under
