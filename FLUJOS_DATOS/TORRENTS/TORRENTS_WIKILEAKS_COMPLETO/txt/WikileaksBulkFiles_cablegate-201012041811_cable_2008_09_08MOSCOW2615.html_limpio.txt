econ prel pgov etrd einv rs subject after the war with georgia russias economic future more uncertain ref moscow 2563 classified by ambassador john r beyrle for reasons 15 b and d summary 1 c that russia is back at least economically has been an insistent theme of the kremlin the last few years russias economic recovery from the depths of its financial crash in 1998 is indeed impressive high growth burgeoning international reserves and rising living standards were the result of luck in the form of fivefold increase in the prices of oil and gas russias main exports but also the result of prudent macroeconomic policies that stressed fiscal and monetary stability 2 c we would argue however that the russian government has overstated the extent of this economic restoration and its sustainability after seven years of 7 percent growth or better per capita income remains below 10000 year and only last year did russias gdp finally surpass its level in 1991 moreover unlike other emerging markets such as china and india russias impressive growth has not been fueled by its manufacturing sector but rather by rising but volatile commodity prices 3 c the underlying fragility of the russian economy and its uncertain future have been brought into sharp focus by the war in georgia some of our contacts agree with the line from the russian government that the economy will quickly recover from its current turmoil other observers believe that higher political risk has returned for the foreseeable future bringing with it lower economic growth however all of our contacts are increasingly pessimistic about the ability of the gor to pursue the reforms needed to modernize and diversify the russian economy short term costs 4 c one of the persistent myths that russian government officials press publicly about the russian economy is that it is decoupled from the global financial system by which these officials mean its growth and stability are not affected by global developments and specifically are immune to the effects of the subprime crisis in the united states corollary of this argument is that russia is safehaven for international investors however the performance of russias stock markets over the past two months and especially since the war with georgia erupted belies these claims 5 c as we have reported elsewhere the russian stock market began its slide in midmay global conditions strengthening dollar and softening demand for commodities were contributing factors however series of government actions culminating in the decision to invade georgia and recognize abkhazia and south ossetias independence are principal causes that have driven the stock markets to their lowest levels in nearly two years in the process wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in shareholder value 6 c with military activities subsiding local newspapers have been increasingly filled this past week with articles about the economic cost of the war and its aftermath for russia citing especially the stock market losses and the downturn in business confidence the kremlin has seemed oblivious to these concerns claiming that the economy is fundamentally strong and will quickly recover some local analysts agree citing in particular russias status as the worlds largest exporter of hydrocarbons chris weafer of uralsib noted in an august 27 email to clients that russia has 1 billion in oil and gas revenue coming in each day and tensions with the west including possible sanctions will not affect this 7 c however other analysts are less sanguine xxxxx told us that the decline in the stock market is how the business community gets to vote about the governments economic policies he said foreign and russian investors bet on the russian economy is on its convergence with western economies with that now in question he and other analysts see the return of high political risk to the russian economy and worry that it may be permanent although they dont see 1998style collapse coming they do see lower growth over time in fact most analysts have been systematically cutting their forecasts for 2008 growth over the past two weeks 8 c the effect of the global credit crunch has been magnified by increased political risk in russia further raising the cost of capital more expensive capital will cause russian and foreign businesses here to delay or cancel expansion and improvement plans lowering growth the russian economy is particularly vulnerable in this regard because it is heavily reliant on foreign capital for its longterm financing needs russian corporations reportedly have 500 billion in increasingly expensive shortterm foreign debt 9 c according to xxxxx lower growth in turn ultimately puts at risk the grand bargain the gor has made with the russian people rising living standards in return for political quiescence he believes as do many of our other contacts that likely outcome is that the gor will intervene and recapitalize russian companies in place of the expensive foreign loans norilsk nickels vladimir potanin had highly publicized meeting last week with medvedev in which he reportedly asked for this while xxxxx thought this might spark market rally and ease the shortterm costs to the russian economy he acknowledged that the longterm economic consequences would be negative long term consequences 10 c second myth about russias economy is that it has been moving beyond dependence on exports of natural resources and that its current prosperity is now driven by selfperpetuating growth in consumer spending in fact the boom is threatening to go bust inflation has risen rapidly over the past year exposing the underlying disconnect between supply and demand in the economy simply put the energy bonanza has fueled sharply increased domestic demand and in the absence of an adequate supply response prices have soared 11 c the gor explicitly acknowledged that economic growth was off kilter in the runup to the presidential election in march president medvedev made series of statements the most famous his february four is speech at the krasnoyarsk economic forum at which he called for fundamental reforms to the russian economy including strengthening institutions improving infrastructure moving to value added innovation economy and improving the climate for investment the net result according to medvedev and his inner circle would be more modern and more competitive economy 12 c medvedevs agenda appears to be one of the casualties of the war in georgia there was already entrenched opposition to the reforms within the ruling elite and especially to medvedevs emphasis on fighting official corruption and reducing state control much to the dismay of the majority of the business community medvedevs apparent loss of influence reftel would seem to put paid to the reforms at least for the time being it has also raised two very important questions who is in charge of russian economic policy and what are their objectives 13 c the easy answers in the wake of the georgian conflict would be vladimir putin and that his goal is maximizing the economic power of the state however it is more complicated than that there are three primary economic tendencies or groups that are discernible within the russian government elite all of them enjoy some degree of support from the tandemocracy and all of them have influence and shape policies 14 c two of these groups are generally characterized as economic liberals who favor market solutions one group centered on finance minister aleksey kudrin and the other on president medvedev in the person of his principal economic advisor arkadiy dvorkovich for kudrins group which includes his finance ministry and the central bank the watchword is stability they favor more moderate growth and more gradual reforms dvorkovichs group which includes the presidential administration and most of the ministry of economic development favors faster growth and faster reforms 15 c these two groups probably agree on more issues than they disagree on especially on the need for the modernization integration and diversification of the economy encapsulated in medvedevs reform agenda however month ago it was their disagreements over inflation and taxes that were driving economic policy kudrin thought the economy was overheating and wanted to slow growth and rededicate the gor to fiscal discipline dvorkovich argued for lower taxes to stimulate even faster growth which when combined with structural reforms and infrastructure investments would unleash the supply response he thought was needed to restore equilibrium to the economy 16 c the result of the competition between these two groups seemed to be healthy debate within the gor that was likely to lead to set of compromise economic policies that would have promoted medvedevs reforms while emphasizing continued stability xxxxx that the governments policies could be summed up as legal reform leading to reduced corruption leading to increased economic freedom leading to surge in small and medium sized enterprises leading to faster and better economic growth the benefits of which would be more widely and evenly distributed 17 c however the third group within the governing elite that has great deal of sway over economic policies the socalled siloviki has very different goals they are not easily identifiable as group and have natural leader on par with kudrin since their members are driven primarily by selfinterest they do however share two overarching characteristics preference for state control and high tolerance for official corruption they are often closely linked or overlap with another amorphous group the oligarchs russias fabulously rich billionaires most of whom made their money out of political connections are loath to challenge the government in the wake of the yukos affair and an increasing percentage of whom like deputy prime minister sechin or the head of state corporation rostechnologia sergey chemezov have backgrounds in the security services 18 c the siloviki are by all accounts the big winners out of recent events there were reports that medvedev was planning to move many of them aside in fall government reshuffle if such plans existed they are now shelved the siloviki are also the main opponents of modernization and integration which would have limited their ability to extract rent from the economy these individuals are now more likely to succeed in arguing for continuing state control and therefore their control over the commanding heights of the economy especially the energy sector where the profits are high and the profit margins even higher 19 c the kremlins consistent rejection of the economic consequences of its action whether over the tnkbp investor dispute the mechel incident or the conflict with georgia has played into the silovikis hands reinforcing their authority and their ability to delay reforms that said the weakness of the silovikis position according to xxxxx and others is that the longterm uncertainty about the gors commitment to market economics and international integration to playing by the rules at home and abroad will inevitably reduce the economic resources at the governments disposal and that in turn will put their two principal objectives personal enrichment and continued control of the country in direct competition comment 20 c there are two economic futures for russia the first is the one that medvedev and the economic liberals have sketched out in the governments ambitious 2020 development plan this future is that of an innovation economy that has diversified away from reliance on commodity exports toward industries where russia can add value in this economic future russias enormous revenues from oil and gas would have been used to transform and modernize the economy 60 percent of russians would be middle class providing lasting force for political and economic stability this future seemed poised to emerge as central government priority just few months ago now it is clearly on back burner 21 c the darker future is one all too familiar to many countries that are blessed with natural resources and cursed with poor governance it is russia still dependent on volatile commodity exports the surplus of which is easily captured by an entrenched and selfinterested governing elite it is country of income extremes and unstable politics and it is country that with its resources being rapidly depleted or with the world moving toward other energy sources may have missed its chance at lasting prosperity 22 c both of these futures pose opportunities and threats for the us prosperous more selfconfident russia is one that will require the intensive engagement and policy giveandtake that characterizes our relations with our european allies it is less likely to be russia that threatens its neighbors and fears their stability and prosperity russia still dependent on commodity exports will likely be intrinsically weaker and less influential globally but lacking domestic accountability it will pose more of threat to its neighbors and therefore to international order 23 c without doubt the us has clear interest in the first future for more prosperous better integrated more stable russia with that in mind we would argue that the us needs to be careful that our efforts to demonstrate that russias actions visavis georgia have real consequences do not play into the hands of the antireform circles who are promoting that other future 24 c the russians of course especially the progressives around medvedev also face difficult choice medvedevs recent public statements especially the harsh rhetoric that russia has nothing to fear from economic isolation are contradicted by privatelyexpressed hopes that we not take steps to isolate them they will ultimately have to decide when and how to confront their domestic opponents if they are to avoid this fate and if they are to resume their efforts to transform russias economy beyrle
