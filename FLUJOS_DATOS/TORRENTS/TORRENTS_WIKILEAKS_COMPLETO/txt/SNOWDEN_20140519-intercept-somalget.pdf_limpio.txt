ssirel intro here in s2f weve had great success using systems that buffer fulltake audio collection for nominal 30 days these systems have led to real breakthroughs in target discovery and we wanted to alert other analysts to their potential collectors please take note of how beneficial these types of collectors can be to analysts as compared to more traditional models ssirel somalget is family of collection systems which greatly facilitate and make possible remarkable new ways of performing both target development1 and target discovery2 significant analytic breakthroughs and successes in both areas have been made bimalysts in the two countries where somalget accesses currently exist ie and the bahamas u how it works ssirel somalget collection systems forward fulltake metadata in real time and buffer fidltake audio for nominally 30 days3 it makes possible the selection of audio content against the buffered data after the fact in near realtime or up to 30 days later this ability is dubbed retrospective retrieval the power of retrospective retrieval in facilitating target development or discovery lies in its ability to permit the analyst to selectively retrieve audio content and immediately validate hisher tentative analytic conclusions derived from metadata tssirel somalget access to bahamian gsm communications has led to the discovery of international narcotics traffickers and specialinterest alien smugglers this access together with our use of methods that take advantage of targets behavioral patterns4 have allowed our s2f analysts to gain firm understanding of the targets activities even when these contacts occurred prior to their discovery u more to come ssirel these successes which depend on access to buffered audio files that may be associated with selectors not tasked to the collection asset in question argue in favor of collection methodology for telephony that may be viewed as analogous to xkeyscore that is we buffer certain calls that may be of foreign intelligence value for sufficient period to permit wellinformed decision on whether to relieve and return specific audio content with proper engineering and coordination there is little reason this capability cannot expand to other accesses besides and die bahamas provided compatible hardware and interfaces are developed and deployed5 u notes 1 u target development the process by which an analyst can extend liislier knowledge of known target by observing elements of metadata diat relate to diat target 2 u target discovery die process whereby an analyst can discover targets by observing metadata as it relates to behaviors characteristic of hisher target set regardless of whether or not die newly discovered selectors are related to known targets 3 ssirel the nominal 30 days storage actually varies depending upon on space power and observed activity levels 4 tssirel observing diat targets tend to use prepaid calling cards in an attempt to mask die destination of telephone calls s2f focused on mobile identifiers in number ranges diat represent newly activated accounts we have also used sms text messages to identify and retrieve audio of interest 5 ssirel storage capacity is directly related to die amount of disk storage diat can be deployed when deployed against entire networks as somalget is die back end database and processing required for interactive search and retrieval of cuts also requires enterpriseclass data warehousing and highperformance processing to manage die vast amount of data captured currently diis warehouse dynamically manages roughly 5 billion call events widi die capacity to expand well beyond our current target communications this retrospective retrieval infrastructure is web based and is already in place as noted widi proper engineering and coordination diere is little reason diis capability cannot expand to odier accesses provided compatible hardware and interfaces are developed and deployed
