bolkcom richard f grimmett foreign affairs defense and trade division summary airborne early warning aew aircraft significantly improve the effectiveness of modern defensive and offensive air operations presently only few countries manufacture such aircraft the demand for aew aircraft is growing however as their utility is recognized aew aircraft have been sought by china and india each party in regional rivalries congress is likely to review the us national security interests and policies raised by these cases background introduction to airborne early warning airborne early warning aew aircraft significantly improve the effectiveness of modern defensive and offensive air operations aew aircraft provide larger and clearer view of the battlespace and the ability to more coherently organize and employ large numbers of aircraft over great distances and against large number of threats or targets because radar is effective only to the extent of its direct line of sight the earths curvature limits the ability of most surfacebased radars to detect low flying aircraft beyond about 30 miles modern aircraft can travel this distance very quickly potentially eluding detection until they are literally on top of their target by elevating early warning radars say to 30000 feet low flying enemy aircraft can be detected at ranges up to 250 miles providing better ability to prepare defenses and eliminate devastating surprise attacks figure 1 illustrates this concept aew systems are often combined with command control and communications c3 equipment such as identification friend or foe iff electronic and communications intelligence elint and comint advanced navigation and jamresistant tactical data links the resulting awacs aircraft airborne warning and control system can be used not just to provide warning to defenses but also to effectively control large numbers of aircraft on both defensive and offensive missions over large area against large httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20754crs2 1 only the most current and capable aew aircraft are included here this section does not address legacy aircraft such as the russianbuilt tu126 moss this aircrafts aew capabilities are rudimentar and it has been phased out of most countries inventories nor does this section include maritime reconnaissance aircraft such as the british nimrod aircraft or search water radar which have some modest early warning capabilities 2 federation of american scientists beriev a50 mainstay httpwwwfasorgnukeguidehtm figure 1 comparison of groundbased and airborne early warning radar coverage against low flying aircraft number of threats or targets in sum awacs aircraft may be considered force multipliers they facilitate the coherent use of large numbers of aircraft over great distances against numerous threats or targets that would otherwise operate in small groups with relatively limited operational vision summary of select aew systems1 aew aircraft are very sophisticated and even technologically advanced countries like britain have decided that purchasing such aircraft is more attractive than building them thus in 2000 only few countries produce aew aircraft the united states makes the e3 sentry and e2 hawkeye aircraft both aircraft are distinguished by large slowly rotating discshaped surveillance radar attached to the aircrafts fuselage these pulsedoppler radars can perform numerous surveillance functions simultaneousl and track hundreds of objects at hundreds of miles these aircraft also employ variety of c3 technologies in severe electronic warfare environments designed to operate from aircraft carriers the e2 aircraft is noticeably smaller than the boeing 707 aircraft on which the e3 is based the russian a50 mainstay aircraft also employs rotating pulsedoppler radar on large aircraft il76 and most closely resembles the e3 the mainstay uses iff electronic warfare ew and other c3 equipment some contend that the a50 is not as capable as the e32 yet even the baseline a50 can simultaneously track 50 fightersizedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20754crs3 3 janes radar and electronic warfare 19971998 janes information group london 4

offers various a50 variants for export to control air defense and counterair fighters such as the su27 and mig29 israel and sweden have recently fielded aew aircraft based on the most sophisticated radar technology abandoning rotating pulsedoppler radars the israeli phalcon and swedish eyrie are electronically steered radar arrays that provide full 360 degree surveillance coverage the erieye radar sits in rectangular box mounted on the argus aircraft the phalcon radar has been tested on several aircraft and conforms to the aircraft fuselage these radars put less stress and drag on the aircraft than do rotodomes this in turn can result in longer time on station longer lived aircraft or the use of smaller more versatile aircraft the argus transmits its data to ground based controllers while the phalcons 1013 member onboard crew controls fighter operations directly aew aircraft in military operations the military value of aewawacs aircraft has been proven in numerous conflicts the success of israel for instance against syrian aircraft in the 1982 lebanon war owed much to usbuilt e2 hawkeye aew aircraft in israeli service e2s routinely detected incoming syrian aircraft at long range and vectored israel fighters to surprise them4 the e2s also supported israeli air attacks in 1985 israeli f15s accompanied by an e2 flew 1500 miles to bomb plo headquarters in tunisia by contrast the british lack of aew aircraft is considered major factor in the loss of two destroyers to cruise missiles launched by argentine fighters during the 1982 falklands war lacking long range surveillance the british were forced to position the hms sheffield and hms coventry in postures that increased their vulnerability5 carrierbased e2c aircraft directed f14 fighters during the strike against libya in 1986 e2cs and aegis cruisers working together provided air superiorit over the fleet libyan aircraft probed us defenses at least 153 times but never got into firing position before being locked into the sights of us aircraft or aegis platform missile6 during the 1991 gulf war operation desert shield and operation desert storm us aew aircraft contributed significantly to the coalitions overwhelming air campaign e3b aircraft provided 24hour radar coverage throughout the war awacs gave early warning of iraqi air activity and helped control engagement of iraqi aircraft it also supported strike packages e2c aircraft tailored tactical control filtered intelligence and improved the situational awareness for navy strike groups and coalition

was allied fratricide and only two aircraft lost to enemy defenses aew aircraft coordinated complicated maneuv ers such as night time multinational aerial refuelings of up to 80 aircraft nato e3 also enabled the downing of three mig29s only four minutes after they took off from an airfield in serbia8 china and aew acquisition in recent years china has sought to upgrade significantly its conventional military equipment its force modernization program has included purchases of advanced combat helicopters combat fighter aircraft submarines and variety of missiles russia has been the principal source of most of these advanced military items while chinas upgrade efforts can be viewed as logical effort to maintain and enhance the capability of its military force structure it also presents worrisome situation for taiwan china continues to regard taiwan as renegade province of the chinese state and periodically has made threatening gestures toward it the united states for its part has undertaken through law and policy statements commitment to seek peaceful resolution to the prctaiwan dispute pending such an outcome the united states has provided military equipment to taiwan to enhance its ability to defend itself against military attack9 chinas indigenous fighter aircraft are technologically inferior to taiwans f16s and mirage 2000 fighters to address this weakness china has imported su27 fighters from russia which are of comparable quality to western fighters yet currently china only has 48 of these aircraft compared to taiwanese force of 240 modern fighters controlled by four e2 hawkeye aew aircraft the integration of aew aircraft into chinas air force would reduce many of these apparent deficiencies on july 12 2000 longstanding effort by china to acquire modern aew capabilities from israel reached climax when in response to united states opposition israel suspended its proposal to sell its phalcon aew system to china10 under the suspended contract the chinese reportedly had the option to purchase between three and six aircraft after receiving the first plane11 once it became clear that israel would not be the source of its aew aircraft the chinese turned to their principal weapons suppler russia for possible alternative during the late summer and fall of 2000 reports indicated that china was considering seeking number of

the standard russian model of the a50 aircraft12 published reports note an option for china is to lease two russian a50 aircraft for an interim period so that chinas air force could conduct aew training during this interim period the chinese would work with russia to upgrade the radar and avionics to be part of the newly built a50e aircraft over three year period efforts would be undertaken to reduce the a50s current vulnerability to electronic countermeasures and to enhance its ability to engage in secure communication among other things the new 50e would be designed to track 300 airborne and sea targets at range of 250 miles compared to the a50s current range of 140 miles the a50e would also be designed to control up to 30 aircraft such as the su27 and su30 fighter aircraft while serving as c3 platform13 on november 34 2000 russian deputy prime minister illya klebanov discussed the sale of a50 aew aircraft with the chinese during state visit to beijing it was subsequently reported that an agreement to sell the aircraft to china was reached during this visit press reports indicate that at least four new a50e aew aircraft would be sold on december 13 2000 itar reported that initial delivery would begin in 200114 india and aew acquisition india has long been major arms client of the former soviet union and russia india has also long regarded an aew aircraft as valuable asset for its military having used the tu126 moss in its 1971 war with pakistan when israel suspended its sale of the phalcon to china in july 2000 india reportedly discussed buying system from israel israel appears reluctant to make the sale due to concerns over us objections india is also concerned about us objections russia wants to sell india an advanced version of its 50 aew system india has assessed the current a50 aircraft this year and has expressed interest in obtaining it if the plane can be upgraded indian software specialists are working closely with russian and israeli companies to develop new software that will improve the a50s capabilities15 russia has reportedly offered to lease two a50 aircraft to india while modernized a50e is developed although russian prime minister vladimir putin signed number of agreements for weapons sales to india during his state visit to india in early october agreement was reached regarding lease or sale of the a50

israeli phalcon system if prospective us objections to its sale can be overcome16 india already enjoys quantitative and qualitative advantage over pakistans air force it has 21 more fighter squadrons than pakistan and larger number of modern aircraft unlike pakistan india also has aerial refueling and electronic warfare aircraft improving its aew capabilities will increase indias conventional aerial warfare capabilities perhaps more troubling however are the potential implications for aerial delivery of nuclear weapons many believe that india and pakistan probably would rely on aircraft to conduct any nuclear strike at least until their nuclear weapons are reduced in size or their missiles are made more powerful and reliable modern aew aircraft could give india greater probability of neutralizing pakistans air defense fighters considerations for congress in light of these two case examples the us government is likely to consider the adequacy of current regulations policies or multilateral agreements governing the transfer of aew aircraft given the potential effect that acquisition of advanced aew aircraft could have on chinas military capabilities the us government may consider what courses of action are available to deter russia from selling advanced aew aircraft to china if the sale does go through congress may confront request to augment taiwans defensive capabilities us naval and air forces in east asia may also be faced with requirement to augment existing capabilities to counter potential threats posed by chinas acquisition and effective deployment of aew aircraft in view of the continuing tensions between india and pakistan the prospect of india acquiring advanced aew aircraft could tip the conventional and nuclear military balance visavis pakistan this could lead to an escalation of conventional or nuclear military acquisitions by pakistan in response because any future significant armed conflict between the two countries could prompt pakistan to consider relying on nuclear weapons to avoid conventional military defeat congress may consider it appropriate to monitor developments regarding the possible acquisition of aew aircraft by india and to support efforts by the us government and others to dissuade suppliers from selling such aircraft some analysts argue that aew aircraft confer more defensive capabilities than offensive capabilities and are thus not dangerous weapons17 yet others disagree with this analysis 1987 book by an indian air force officer for instance describes how the acquisition of aew by pakistan would give the pakistanis significant advantage in aerial combat and would prove destabilizing18 the growing availability of these aircraft and their potent affect on aerial combat capabilities could lead to the reevaluation of the prominence of the aew aircraft proliferation issue in us national security policy formulation
