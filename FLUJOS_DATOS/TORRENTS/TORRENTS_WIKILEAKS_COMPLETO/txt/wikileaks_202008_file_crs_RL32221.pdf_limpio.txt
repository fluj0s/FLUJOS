have been raised about the ability of terrorists to enter the united states under the visa waiver program vwp since the vwp bypasses the first step by which foreign visitors are screened for admissibility to enter the united states nonetheless the inclusion of countries in the vwp may help foster positive relations between the united states and those countries promote tour ism and commerce and eases consular office workloads abroad the vwp allows nationals from ce rtain countries to enter the united states as temporary visitors nonimmigrants for business or pleasure without first obtaining visa from us consulate abroad temporary visitors for business or pleasure from nonvwp countries must obtain visa from department of state dos office rs at consular post abroad before coming to the united states in fy2007 16 million visitors entered the united states under this program constituting 49 of all overseas visitors to qualify for the vwp statute specifies that country must offer reciprocal privileges to us citizens have had nonimmigrant refusal rate of less than 3 for the previous year or an average of more than 2 over th past two fiscal years with neither year going above 25 issue their nationals machinereadable passports that incorporate biometric identifiers certify that it is developing program to issue tamperresident machinereadable visa documents that incorporate biometric identifiers which are verifiable at the countrys port of entry and not compromise the law enforcement or security interests of the united states by its inclusion in the program countries can be terminated from the vwp if an emergency occurs that threatens the united states security interests pl 11053 adds new requirements to participate in the vwp and provides the secretary of the department of homeland security dhs the authority to waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate requirement certain statutory conditions must be met before the waiver to becomes available all aliens entering under the vwp must present machinereadable passports in addition passports issued between october 26 2005 and october 25 2006 must have digitized photo on the data page while passports issued after october 25 2006 must contained electronic data chips epassports under dhs regulations travelers w ho seek to enter the united states through the vwp are subject to the biometric requirements of the usvisit program numerous countries eg poland estonia israel south korea have expressed interest in being part of the vwp dhs and dos have provided selected countries with road maps to help them meet the requirements of the program however some of the countries have complained that the road maps do not contain milestones or time tables they note that since us consular officers are the ones that approve or disapprove applications for visas it is extremely difficult for countries to affect their visa refusal rates and meet the requirements of the program in addition dhs has signed memorandums of understanding w ith certain countries who are likely to meet the program requirements once the nonimmigrant refusal rate waiver is available to facilitate these countries entries to the vwp this report will be updated if legislative action occurs httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32221g24g146g156g138g561g25g138g146g159g142g155g561g18g155g152g144g155g138g150g561 g561

visa waiver program vwp the secretary of homeland security1 in consultation with the secretary of state may waive the b nonimmigrant visa requirement for aliens traveling from certain countries as temporary visitors for business or pleasure tourists2 nationals from participating countries simply complete an admission form i94 before their arrival and are admitted for up to 90 days the vwp constitutes one of few exceptions under the immigration and nationality act ina in which foreign nationals are admitted into the united states without valid visa temporary foreign visitors for business or pleasure from most countries must obtain visa from department of state dos offices at consular post abroad before coming to the united states 3 personal interviews are generally required and consular officers use the consular consolidated database ccd to screen visa applicants in addition to indicating the outcome of any prior visa application of the alien in the ccd the system links with other databases to flag problems that may make the alien ineligible for visa under the socalled grounds for inadmissibility of the ina which include criminal terrorist and public health grounds for exclusion consular officers are required to check the background of all aliens in the lookout databases including the consular lookout and support syst em class and tipoff databases 4 although the vwp greatly eases the documentary requirements for nationals from participating countries it has important restrictions aliens entering with b visa may petition to extend their length of stay in the united states or may petition to change to another nonimmigrant or immigrant status aliens entering through the vwp are not permitted to extend their stays except for emergency reasons and then for only 30 days5 additionally with some limited exceptions aliens entering through vwp are not permitted to adjust status an alien entering through the vwp who violates the terms of admission becomes

maximum overstay rate established by the secretaries of dhs and dos for countries receiving waivers of the nonimmigrant refusal rate to participate in the vwp the program pl 11053 also specifies that in determining whether to waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate requirement the secretary of dhs in consultation with the secretary of dos may take into consideration other factors affecting us security

the vwp is supported by the us travel and tourism industry the business community and dos the travel and tourism industry views the vwp as tool to facilitate and encourage foreign visitors for business and pleasure which results in increased economic growth generated by foreign tourism and commerce for the united states 27 dos argues that by waiving the visa 26 temporary visitors include aliens who entered with b visas and those who entered under the vwp 27 the example of argentina was frequently used to illustrat this relationship during the first year argentina was in the vwp tourism from that country to the united states grew by 115 some cite south korea as country that should be participating in vwp b ecause of the trade and tourism growth it could generate and contend that this factor should be added to the criteria used to select participating countries other proponents of the vwp however contend that the criteria should not be broadened to include tourism

have the resources to resume issuing visas to all the visitors from vwp countries28 nonetheless while the program has significantly reduced the consular workload and facilitated travel to the united states it has increased the workload of immigration inspectors at ports of entry by shifting background checks to ports of entry furthermore others contend that the relaxed documentary requirements of the vwp increase immigration fraud and decrease border security immigration inspectors have stated that terrorists and criminals believed they would receive less scrutiny during the immigration inspection process if they applied for admission into the united states under the vwp 29 another concern has been the lack of information on aliens from vwp countries who overstay the terms of their

prescreening international passengers before takeoff during that hearing testimony by jess t ford of the government accountability office gao noted that the vwp has many benefits as well as some inherent risks of particular concern are the stolen passports from vwp countries especially since they are prized travel documents among those attempting to illegally enter the united states and

as security risk since travelers under the program do not undergo the screening required to receive visa others contend that the inclusion of countries in the vwp actually increases us security they argue that the vwp enhances security by setting standards for travel documents and information sharing and that the program promotes economic growth and cultural ties in addition membership in the vwp could be used as an incentive to get other countries to share information with the united states 31 there are countries that have expressed desire to be included in the vwp because of the possible economic benefits eg increasing commerce and tourism making it easier and cheaper for their populace to travel to the united states ie since their citizens do not have to get visa before traveling temporarily to the united states and because membership in the program is continued violations are weakened arguing that these provisions are essential to safeguard and control our borders 28 in his testimony before the house immigration and clai ms subcommittee on february 28 2002 william s norman president and chief executive officer of the travel industry association of america stated that it

2005 the administration began providing countries interested in joining the vwp with road maps to aid the countries in meeting the programs criteria32 however some of the countries have complained that since the road maps do not contain milestones or time tables it is difficult to measure the amount of progress made towards fulfilling the criteria for vwp membership33 moreover others contend that since us consular officers are the ones that approve or disapprove applications for visas it is extremely difficult for countries to affect their visa refusal rates limiting the ability of country to follow defined set of steps to meet the required vwp criteria

that the department of state dos advises dhs of its intent to nominate country for inclusion in the program only after state has determined that the country meets key criteria for visa waiver designation 35 then dhs and dos may engage in pre nomination consultation process to ensure that all parties are in agreement before dos submits its formal nomination after receiving the formal nomination from dos dhs through an interagency working group evaluates the effect that the countrys designation would have on us law enforcement security and immigration interest s on the basis of the review the interagency working group submits recommendation to the secretary of dhs who in consultation with the secretary dos decides whether to admit the country into the program 36

in addition the secretary of dhs must also certify to congress that the electronic travel authorization system discussed below is operational prior to being able to waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate requirement56 initially the air exit system does not need to incorporate biometric identifiers however after june 30 2009 if the air exit system is unable to match an aliens biometric information with relevant watch lists and manifest information the secretary of dhs authority to waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate will be suspended until the air exit system has the specified biometric capacity

receiving waivers of the nonimmigrant refusal rate to participate in the vwp the program pl 11053 also specifies that in determining whether to waive the nonimmigrant refusal rate requirement the secretary of dhs in consultation with the secretary of dos may take into consideration other factors affecting us security such as the countrys airport security and passport standards whether the country has an effective air marshal program and the estimated overstay rate for nationals from the country in addition pl 11053 makes several changes to the criteria to qualify as vwp country which are intended to enhance the security of the program as previously mentioned the act mandates that the secretary of dhs in consultation with the secretary of state develop and implement an electronic travel authorization system the system through which each alien electronically provides in advance of travel the biographical information necessary to determine whether the alien is eligible to travel to the united states and enter under the vwp aliens using the system will be charged fee that will be set at level so that the cost of creating and administering the system is covered by the fees eligibility to travel determined by the system is valid for more than three years and eligibility can be revoked at any time notably determination under the system that an alien is eligible to travel to the united states does not constitute determination that the alien is admissible the system will become operational 60 days after the secretary of dhs publishes notice in the federal register pl 11053 also requires the secretary of dhs later than one year after enactment to establish an exit system that records the departure of every alien who entered under the vwp and left the united states by air the exit system is required to match the aliens biometric information against relevant watch lists and immigration information and compare such biographical information against manifest information collected by airlines to confirm that the alien left the united states furthermore under pl 11053 to participate in the vwp countries are required to enter into an agreement with the united states to report or make available through interpol information about the theft or loss of passports currently vwp countries only have to certify that they are reporting thefts of blank passports the agreements have to specify strict time limits for the reporting of this information in addition to be part of the vwp countries have to accept the repatriation of any citizen former citizen or national against whom final order of removal is issued later than three weeks after the order is issued also the countries are required to enter into an agreement with the united states to shar information regarding whether national of that country traveling to the united states represents threat to us security or welfare the act requires the secretary of dhs to provide technical assistance to vwp countries to assist the countries in fulfilling the requirements of the program in addition pl 11053 requires the director of national intelligence to conduct intelligence assessments of countries for new vwp countries the reviews must occur prior to their admittance into the vwp for existing vwp countries the reviews should be done in conjunction with the biannual country reviews the act also requires the director of national inte lligence to immediately inform the secretary of dhs of any current and credible threat of imminent danger to the united states or

grant another extension of the biometric deadline 67 as result the us government clarified that digitized photograph printed on data page in the passport would count as biometric for the october 26
