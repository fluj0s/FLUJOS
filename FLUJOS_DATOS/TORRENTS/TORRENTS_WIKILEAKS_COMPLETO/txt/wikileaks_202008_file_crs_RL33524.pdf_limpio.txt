virtually any cell in the body stem cells are used by scientists to study the growth and differentiation of individual cells into tissues this work may provide insights into the causes of birth defects genetic bnormalities and other disease st ates as well as potential treatments the research is controversial in the opinion of some because the stem cells are located within the embryo and the process of removing them destroys the embryo some have argued that stem ce ll research should be limited to adult stem cells obtained from tissues such as bone marrow or umbilical cord blood because they believe the derivation of stem cells from embryos is ethically unacceptable other scientists believe that adult stem cells should not be the sole target of research because of important scien tific and technical limitations due to the controversy federal polic has limited federal f unding for research on embryonic stem cells in response many states are moving forward with their own initiatives to encourage or provide f unding for stem cell research in order to remain competitive and preven t the relocation of scientis ts and biotechnology firms to other states or overseas

cloning by judith johnson and erin d williamsstem cell research state initiatives embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into virtually any cell in the body scientists are using stem cells to study the growth and differentiation of individual cells into tissues1 understanding these pro cesses could provide insights into the causes of birth defects genetic abnormalities and other disease states stem cells may eventually be used to produce rge amounts of one cell type to test new drugs for effectiveness and chemicals for toxicity or they may be transplanted into patient to treat medical conditions such as diabetes and parkinsons disease despite its promise only relatively sm all amount of federal funding has been used to support embryonic stem cell research the research is controversial in the opinion of some because stem cells are located within the embryo and the process of removing them destroys the embryo2 moreover some of the research may involve type of cloning see the discussion of somatic cell nuclear transfer or scnt below many abor tion opponents and others opposed to embryonic stem cell research believe that cloning creates human life even though it may consist of only one or few hundred cells and that the struction of cloned embryo to extract stem cells is also ethically unacceptable federal funding for embryonic stem ce ll research is limited by two factors first the dickey amendment which has been added to the laborhealth and human serviceseducation appropriations bill each fiscal year starting with fy1997 it prohibits using federal funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryos are destroyed second although the august 2001 bush administration stem cell policy for the first time llowed federal funds to be used for research on human embryonic stem cells the bush policy also limited federal research to only the 22 stem cell lin that were in existence in august 2001 scientists are concerned about the quality and longevity of these 22 stem cell lines for variety of reasons many belie ve that research advancement requires the development of new embryonic stem cell lines and for certain applications stem cells derived from cloned embryos may ffer the best hope for understanding and treating disease cloned embryos are created through process called somatic cell nuclear transfer scnt3 in scnt the nucleus of an egg is removed and replaced by the nucleus from mature body cell such as skin cell obtained from patienthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33524crs2 4 proposition 71 at

produce dolly the sheep the first mammalian clone when scnt is used to create anot her individual such as dolly the process is called reproductive cl oning in contrast scientists interested in using scnt to create cloned stem cells allow the cell created via scnt to develop for few days before the stem cells are removed for research stem cells created via scnt would be genetically identical to th patient and thus would avoid any tissue rejection problems that could occur if the cells were transplanted into the patient this is why the scnt process is often called therapeutic cloning regardless of federal policy many stat are moving forward with their own initiatives to encourage or provide funding for stem cell resear ch in some cases therapeutic cloning as well in order to remain
