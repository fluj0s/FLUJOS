international monetary system itself chief among these concerns is the ability of current internationa l financial institutions most notably the international monetary fund imf to cope with financial crises generated by the sudden movement of shortterm capital r portfolio investment sometimes referred to as speculative flows or hot money in march 1995 the imf began review of the adequacy of the

expanded in 1983 they provide supplementary resources t the imf in order to enable it to forestall or cope with an impairment of or threats t the international financial system in light of this review the leaders of the g7 countries at the halifax economic summit on june 1516 1995 propose d to create similar emergency financing mechanism supported by suggeste d doubling of the gab this proposed new

similarities between the nab and the gab are striking as can be seen from table 1 on the next pagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97468crs3 it is also probable that there would have been political resistance

issues regarding us participation in the imf appears in crs report 9856 the international monetary fun ds imf proposed quota increase issues for congress and is equally applicable to the nab wha t follows here is limited treatment of only three selected issues perhaps the most serious economic argument against funding the imf rests on the issue of moral hazard that is that f inancing by the imf particularly emergency financing provi ded during financial crises bailouts encourages the very behavior that it seeks to prevent according to this view countries know that they will b spared the worst consequences of bad economic management in the event as th 19941995 mexican crisis demonstrated and the asian crisis is alread demonstrating countries are not spared the consequences of imprudent economi c policies the real economies of financially troubled countries and the people wh live in them suffer the painful consequences of forced economic adjustment th policy question is whether the unavoidable economic pain is to be somewha t mitigated by external financial support tied in turn to conditional economi c adjustment program different type of moral hazard also arises with regard to investors does the existence of an emergency financial mechanism encourage private investors to take on risks tha t they might otherwise shun in an attempt to reap greater financia l returns in this context some are troubled that as byproduct of bailout professional investors who took on higher risks and were most probably rewarded with higher returns are made whole investors whose activities require marktomarket accounting treatment hav sustained immediate financial losses on their holdings in asia this would includ portfolio investment and trading activities including foreign exchange financia l activities where accounting rules do not require markingtomarket and thus immedi ate loss recognition specifically commercial bank lending where loan s are carried at par or face value will nevertheless face economic losses as loan s to asia russia and perhaps other troubled markets are increasingly rescheduled or written off moreover some commercial banks will have already sustained losse s in connection with trading activities according to federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan testifyin g before the senate subcommittee on foreign operations on march 3 asian equit losses excluding japanese companies exceeded 700 billion from june 1997 to the end of januar 1998 more than 30 billion of this loss was sustained by us investors substantial further losses have been recorded in bonds and real estate the moral hazard issue is particularly troubling with regard to the expande d financial package provided to russia in july 1998 because of its nuclear capability and strategic importance ru ssia appears to have been placed in the category of too big to fail investors clamored for an imf package while simultaneously investin g in shortterm government

impact that extends beyond the difficulties f particular country the contagion issue this was major concern f policymakers as the late 1994 mexican crisis unfolded proving then to be justified this issue conti nues to be major concern during the current financial crises in asia and russia consideration of the nab proposal and the proposed quota increase is now occurring against the backdrop of international financial crisis that began with currency crisis in thailand resulting in the devaluation of the thai baht on july 2 1997 the crisis spread firs t to the currencies of other southeast asian nations then to taiwan and hong kong in october 1997 it reached all major financial markets including those of the united states in november korea the worlds elevent h largest economy began to experience severe pressure eventually leading it to th door of th imf in may 1998 continuing volatility in emerging markets led to a12 financial crisis in russia more recently the japanese yen and the south african13 rand have been under gre at pressure the us government intervened in support of the yen on june 17 federal reserve chairman greenspans testimony of march 3 thus continues to be relevant there is small but not negligible probability that the upset in east asi could have unexpectedly large negative effects on japan latin america an d eastern and central europe that in turn could have repercussions elsewhere including the uni ted states thus while the probability of such an outcome may be small its consequences in my judgment should not be left solely to chance the tradeoff thus is between system ic risk and the making whole of some investors as an unintended and undesirable consequence of providing emergency assistance to the troubled countries of asia an incentive toward us participation in the imf in general and the nab in particular is the potential spreading of ris ks and costs associated with future financial crises as made clear by treasury secretary robert rubin the united states cannot be the lender of last resort to the world this policy not only remains i n14 place but appears to be guiding principle for us policy in dealing with the crisis of 19971998httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97468crs11 see general accounting office international monetary fund observations on it s15 financial condition statement of harold j johnson jr before the

liquidity ratio has been used as way of examining the adequacy of the imfs financial resources in the current debate over funding the imf however the liquidity ratio itself has received some attention this is largel attributable to the fact that the ratio is seen as having builtin adjustment reserve or cushion for future contingencies that results in an understatement in the imf s available financial resources15 alternate view i the illiquidity ratio figure 1 presents n alternative to the imf s liquidity ratio th alternative ratio which s been dubbed the illiquidit ratio in ord er to

ratios occurred during the peak of the petrodollar crisis of the 1970s the remaining five occasions occurred during the 1980s debt crisis during which the imf s financial condition was more illiquid than at any time during the 48 years that were considered here the worst year being 1984 when the illiquidity ratio reached its highest leve l ever 1863 by historic standards the imfs quotabased resources are without question under substantia l pressure this conclusion is reached without taking into account the russian loan that was approved on july 20 alternate view ii the gab and an inadequacy of resources yet another way to look at the imfs need for funding is t examine the now ten occasions on which the general arrangements to borrow gab have bee n activated the gab are only activated when the imf needs additional resources to deal with an impairment of r threat to the international monetary system for that reason the gab have been rarely activated and only when the 11 majo r industrial countries that participate in the gab table 2 on page 5 determine that extreme circumstances require the additional resources the most recent activation was on july 20 1998 when the imf made call on the gab in order to provid financial assistance to russia table 3 on the next page shows the illiquidity ratio at monthend just prior to each gab activation or call the size of the loan purchase that triggered the call and its hypothetical effect on the imfs illiquidity ratio here termed th adjusted illiquidity ratio assuming that the full amount of the loan had bee n funded without activating the gab the hypothetical or adjusted illiquidity ratio obtained after allowing for the full amo unt of the russia loan announced in july 1998 was the third highest of the n calls lower only than the 1977 activations for britain and italy these latter two instances occurred during the international oil crisis of the 1970s thus this comparison would also tend to support the conclusion that the imf is at present seriously constrained financiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97468crs13 table 3 illiquidity ratio prior to activation of the general arrangements to borrow gab and

somewhat less fortunat position it owes the imf sdr 11565 million 593 of quota although thi s would be subtracte d from its cumulative limit it too could borrow 100 of its sdr 15913 million quota in the first year taken together these four countries alon could potentially request sdr 59602 million 79 billion and still remain withi n current access limits the role of congress the dollar equivalent of the sdr 2462 million funding required for us participation in the nab is scored in the fy 1999 budget as 34 billion under16 budgetary and accounting practices established in consultation with congress i n 1980 this will require budgetary authori zation and appropriation in the full amount17 as with the gab funds provided to the im f under the nab are provided upon call budget expend iture occurs only as cash is actually transferred to the imf if transfer is made the united states receives an equal offsetting receipt n interestbearing international monetary sset in budgetary terms however offsetting transactions are treated as an exchange of assets as consequence they do t result in net budget outlays and they do not affect the net budgetary position of the us government irrespective of whether it is in deficit or in surplus federal budget policies are generally enforced under two sets of procedures first concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth spending levels that ar enforced by points of order when legislation is under consideration second th balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 as amended gramm rudman establishes discretionary spending limits and payasyougo paygo requirement that restrain action on annual ap propriations measures and on mandatory spending and revenue measures respectively any violations of the discretionar spending limits or the paygo requirement are enforce d at the end of congressional session by sequester that is by acrosstheboard spending cuts the imf is currently exempted from both sets of federal budget enforcemen t procedures section 314 of the congressional budget and impoundment control acthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97468crs15 this section was added by sec 10114 111 stat 688690 of the budget enforcement act18 bea of 1997 the bea of 1997 is title x of p l 10533 the balanced budget act of 1997 this section was amended most recently by sec 10203 111 stat 698702 of the budget19 enforcement act bea of 1997 of 1974 requires that the chairmen of the house and senate budget committee s adjust various limits and allocations under budget resolution for certain factors including in sec 314 b3 incr eases due to enactment of imf funding the imf18 is thus exempted from budget resolution controls the imf is lso exempted from statutory spending limits by requirement that the limits be increased by the amount of the imf funding section 251 b2d of the 1985 balanced budget as amended requires that the statutory discretionar spending limits be increased by the amount of imf appropriation act19 although funding for the imf has impact on the federal fiscal position and is exempted from the budgetary enforcement procedures it is nevertheless subject to the appropriations process imf fun ding is considered with the foreign operations appropriation historically this has provided congress with an opportunity t exercise vigorous oversight of the imf its programs and operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97468crs16 appendix i the illiquidity ratio upon becoming member of the imf or at the time of quota increase im f members must pay in 25 of their quota or quot increase in hard currency or sdrs this represents the imfs paidin capital it also constitutes an international reserve asset of the member country and is therefore known as the reserve tranche the remaining 75 of memb ers quota subscription or quota increase does not have to be paidin but is callable the united states for example provides the callabl share of its quota in the form of non interest bearing nonnegotiable letter of credit that may be accessed on demand by the imf movements in the reserve tranche positions of member countries reflec t financial activity within the imf as the imf draws upon callable capital for use in its loan operations the reserve tranche of the member country whose currency i s drawn or called will increase by an equival ent amount its reserve tranche then will rise above the level of paidin capital equal to 25 of quota the imf only draws on the callable capital of member countries that are in strong balanceofpayment s positions by comparison countries that are not in strong external financia l position may withdraw their reserve tranche paidin capital automatically an d uncondi tionally upon presentation of balanceofpayments need and man countries do indeed some poorer countries withdraw their reserve tranch immediately after becoming imf membe rs their right to do this arises from the fact the reserve tranche is legally considered to be part of countrys internationa l reserve assets for example as of may 31 1998 the industrial countries had provide d resources to the imf that more than compensated for withdrawals by the developing countries the industrial countries had reserve tranche positions of sdr 45925 6 million 613 billion compared to their paidin capital requirement of sd r 221063 million 295 billion looked at another way the imf had tapped sdr 238193 million 318 billion in callable resources provided by the industria l countries by comparison the developing countries that are imf members d quotas amounting to sdr 568958 million about 760 billion as of may 31 paidin capital or the reserve tranche for the developing countries would be equal to sdr 1422395 million 190 billion in fact however the developing countr members of the imf as group had combined reserved tranche position of sdr 58519 million 78 billio n that is as group they had drawn down sdr 83721 million 112 billion or 589 of their paidin capital in text figure 1 on page 10 of this report when t he reserve tranche positions for all imf mber countries taken together are equal to their paidin capital 25 of all imf qu otas the 100 mark in text figure 1 the imf is on net basis in financially neutral position when reserve tranche positions fall below an amoun t equal to paidin capital some member countries have withdrawn all or part of their reserve tranche total reserve tranche positions have fallen below the 100 mark but the imf has not had to draw on its callable capital in order to allow them to do that in addition the imf is also able to fund any loan operations from paidi n capital although the imf is becoming relatively less liquid it is not particularl financially co nstrained because it has sufficient paidin capital to cover its needs onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97468crs17 the other hand when reserve tranche positions begin to exceed paidin capital th imf is tapping callable capital to fund its operations it is once again becomin g relatively less liquid but the manner in which it funding its operations has change d from paidin capital solely to paidin plus callable capital the illiquidity ratio rises above 100 thus the higher the ratio rises above 100 the more seriously constrained are the imfs finances major feature of the ratio shown in t ext figure 1 is that it does not involve any type of adjustment or allowance for the amount of financial resources that the imf must have available for future contingencies rather this ratio makes judgement on this hi ghly contentious issue data used by crs for this ratio are hard bookkeeping or accounting numbers considering only quotabased resources the imf is simply more financially constrained the higher the ratio moves above th 100 level for this reason and to distinguish it from the imfs ratio it is dubbed the illiquidity ratio second feature of the ratio is that its components are fun damental to the imfs operations are published monthly and have been publicly available for long time using published data available to crs the d ata series could be run back to 1950 not too many years after the imf first began its loan operations to achieve this 48year time series calendarye ar data were used alternatively end of imf fiscalyear data could have been used data for building similarly long timeseries usin g endof imffiscalyear data were not however available within crs b comparison the imfs liquidity ratio is only available annually published in th imfs annual reports every year since 1990 disadvant age of the illiquidity ratio is that twomonth lag still remains reflecting the normal lag in publication of the data for reserve position in the imfs international financial statistics ifs in less volatile times this would not be of particular importance in the midst of major international financial crisis however it is drawback crs has taken advantage of d ata provided by imf treasurer david williams in his press conference of july 13 1998 to update the ratio to this latte r date finally the ratio does not take into account the impact of borrowed resources during some periods they have provided significant amount of resources to th imf all previous borrowings however were repaid by 1996 at present the imf has access to sdr 170 billion currently about 225 billion under the gab f which sdr 6 3 billion about 83 billion were recently activated for the assistance package for r ussia for some time now reserve tranche positions and outstanding fund credit have been moving in rough tandem the activation of the gab take s some pressure off the imfs general resources and alters the direct relationshi p between reserve tranche positions and outstanding fund credit as result th illiquidity ratiois likely

illiquidity ratio and the imfs liquidity ratio graphic pre sentations of crs illiquidity ratio and the imfs liquidity ratio are shown immediately below it is important to remember in looking at the two graphs that they will move in opposition directions when showing the same thing thus in figure 2 crs illiquidity ratio rising ratio indicates that the imf is becomin g increasingly illiquid in figure 3 the imfs liquidity ratio falling ratio indicate s that the imf is becoming increasingly illiquid for comparability the data for both graphs are presented on an imf fiscalyear basis that is ending april 30 of eac h year except for december 31 1997 and july 13 1998 the two sets of ratios ar also presented in appendix table 2 at the end of this section because the two ratios are cons tructed differently the resulting ratios also differ numerically this outcome is implicit in their construction and entirely expected comparison of the two graphs allows few conclusions to be drawn both ratios show that the imf was in fairly liquid financial position fro m april 1993 just following approval of quota increase in late 1992 through april 1997 both ratios show that between april 1997 and december 1997 the im f became increasi ngly illiquid and that this deterioration has continued in 1998 both ratios show that the imf i s now more illiquid than at any time during the nearly 8 ½ years period and the crs ratio shows somewhat less variability than the imfs liquidity ratio but over the entire period the outcome does not differ greatly from 1990 to july 1998 with base year of 1990 as 100 an index for crss illiquidit ratiorose by 532 while an index for the imfs liquidity ratio fell b 577 from an analytical perspective the somewhat greater variability in the imf ratio is not surprising it is implicit in the construction of the ratio itself the numerato rhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97468crs20 annual report 1990 p 5120 press conference july 13 199821of the imfs liquidity ratio consi sts of uncommitted and adjusted usable resources the imf adjusts the numerator to reflect its need to maintain working balances f currencies and to reflect the possibility that the currencies of some members i n relatively weaker external positions might have to be removed from the operational budget the latter consists of the currencies of about 30 countries that the imf uses in its operations the imf maintains confidentially regarding which currencies ar included in its operational budget the removal of weak currency from th operational budget might provide an adverse signal to private financial markets since februa ry 1998 the adjustment factor applied to the numerator has been set at 10 of the quot as of members whose currencies are used in the operational budget neither of these two adjustment factors are matter of public record nor can the readily be estimated or calculated the resulting number for uncommitted an d adjusted usable resources nevertheless represents the imfs judgement on th amount of resources it has available for future loan operations the denominator of the imfs liquidity ratio consists of the imfs liqui d liabilitie s which consists of reserve
