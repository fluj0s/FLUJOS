union upon being questione d by federal agents from th department of labor and the internal revenue service regarding whether he had received any cash or gifts from jrd when he was union officer his respons was at that point the agents produced company records showing the contrary they also informed the petitioner that lying to federal agents in the course of an investigation was crime the

kinds of conduct 1 concealing material fact 2 making false stat ement 3 and using false writing the false statement clause to which the exculpatory doctrine is directed is the second clause of 18 usc 1001 it provi des whoever in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the united states knowingly and willfully falsifies conceals or covers up by any trick scheme or device material fact or makes any false fictitious or fraudulen t statements or representations or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined not more than 10000 or imprisoned not more than five years or both the petitioner argued that the court should depart from the literal text that congress had enacted and approve the doctrine adopt ed by many circuits which makes the exculpatory an exception to the scope 10012 the courts that created this exception have expressed the view that one could not be prosecuted under the statute for merely denying criminal conduct3 these courts generally have said that prosecutions in such cases come very close to violating the privilege against selfincrimination which is protected by the fifth amendment4 therefore the issue before the court was whether the exculpatory doctrine should be reco gnized as complete defense to false statements charges under 18 usc 1001 in writing for the court in seven to two decision holding that there is exception to 1001 criminal liability for false statement consisting of an exculpatory justice scalia began his analysis by making it cl ear that although many court of appeals decisions have embraced the exculpatory doctrine as the petitioner argues it is not supported by 1001s plain language5 the court said the law itself made such exception and neither the text nor th spirit of the fifth amendment confers privilege to lie6 the court noted that proper invocation of the fifth amendment privilege against compulsory selfincrimination allows witness or potential witness to remain silent but not to swear falsely7 however the court said unlike criminal suspects in custody people questioned by government investigators generally have right to remain silent silence in such circumstances can be interpreted as an indication of guilthttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98413crs3 8id at 4116 9id at 4115 10id at 4117the net effect of the supreme courts deci sion is likely to fortify the dilemma for the suspect inasmuch as the statute has the potential for being used as powerful means of obtaining convictions to substitute for an underlying crime that otherwise cannot be proven for example the suspect can tell th truth to the federal investigator and incriminate himself and risk punishment or rema in silent when silence may be treated as an admission of culpability and used at subsequent trial justice ginsburg concurred in the judgment but wrote separate opinion in order to call attention to the extraordinary authority congress perhaps unintentionally has conferred on prosecutors to manufacture crimes she concluded that because the controls are not in place to address the basic issue ie the sweeping generality of 1001s language the prospect remains that an overzealous prosecutor or investigatoraware that person has committed some suspicious acts but unable to make criminal casewill create crime by surprising the suspect asking about those acts and receiving false denial8 as in brogan justice ginsburg noted that the target may not be informed that false is criminal offense until after he speaks9 justice stevens with whom justice breyer joined in dissenting said it seems clear that congress did not intend to ma ke every exculpatory felony10
