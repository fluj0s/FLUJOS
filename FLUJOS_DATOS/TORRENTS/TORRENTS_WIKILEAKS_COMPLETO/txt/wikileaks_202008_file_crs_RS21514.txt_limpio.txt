this report will be updated as events warrant background kenya nation of about 31 million people became independent in december 1963 after prolonged uprising against britain involving over 13000 casualties kenya resisted the marxistleninist ideological tide that swept much of africa in the 1960s and 1970s and maintained fairly stable political system in region marred by civil strife and political violence although it was under oneparty rule until 1992 kenya enjoyed relatively open political system for the first two decades after independence kenya also had one of the most impressive economic growth rates in africa in december 1991 president daniel arap moi reluctantly agreed to move to multi party politics eight years after his government amended the constitution to legalize one party rule kenya had been facto oneparty state since 1969 the move came after twoyear antigovernment campaign by opposition groups and persistent pressure by donor countries including the united states in late december 1992 kenyans voted in record numbers in the countrys first multiparty election in almost 26 years president moi in power since 1978 defeated opposition candidates by small margin his party the kenya african national union kanu also won majority in the 210seat parliament despite the defeat of senior kanu officials by little known opposition candidates the three major opposition parties the forum for restoration of democracy kenya fordkenya fordasili and the democratic party dp each received substantial votes but fell short of expectations congressional research service the library of congress crs2 kenya made limited progress towards building democratic institutions after the 1992 elections harassment of opposition politicians and proopposition journalists by hardline ruling party members dominated the political scene for much of the 1990s wrangling and defection within the opposition parties weakened opponents of the ruling party efforts to bring about reconciliation within the opposition camp did not succeed until recently in the mid1990s the opposition suffered from series of defections by prominent opposition party leaders to the ruling party in addition to the formation of several other small political parties number of factions emerged within the major opposition groups the internal bickering within political parties was not limited to opposition parties the ruling party kanu was also in turmoil in the late 1990s in december 1997 at the height of tensions between the opposition and the ruling party kenya held its second multiparty elections president moi was reelected with 40 of the votes cast while his nearest rival mwai kibaki won 31 the ruling party kanu won 107 seats in the 222member parliament 12 are appointed by the president while the opposition secured the remaining 103 seats international and kenyan election observers said that while there were some irregularities the results of the elections reflected the wishes of most kenyans the victory by moi was largely due to divisions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21514 within the opposition camp and the inability of the opposition to back single candidate against moi it looked as if the opposition would face the same fate in the december 2002 elections when number of opposition leaders joined the kanu government in the late 1990s and early 2000 the december 2002 elections end of an era the 24year rule of president moi and his ruling kanu party came to an abrupt end in december 2002 when coalition of opposition parties decisively defeated kanu and president mois handpicked candidate uhuru kenyatta in the parliamentary elections the national rainbow coalition narc won 125 of the 210 seats while kanu managed to secure 64 seats longtime opposition leader and former vice president in the moi regime mwai kibaki of narc won 61 of the votes while kanus kenyatta won 31 of the vote president moi did not run because of term limit the elections were considered free and fair by international observers and for the first time since the initial multiparty elections preelection conditions were also free of violence and harassment some observers had predicted that moi would not step aside and that the ruling kanu would rig the elections but the outcome surprised many including kenyan opposition leaders just one day after the elections the electoral commission of kenya civil society groups and elections monitors indicated landslide victory for the opposition coalition narc on december 29 2002 kenyatta gave conciliatory concession speech

longtime opposition leader raila odinga was named minister of works and housing and former vice president george saitoti was given the ministry of education the cabinet consists of longtime opposition figures and also senior members of the former ruling party kanu president kibaki had to take several factors into consideration in the selection of his cabinet members including ethnic balance technical skills and government experience while crs4 also rewarding old and new political allies the postelection environment appears to be stable although president kibaki faces serious economic and political challenges the challenges ahead the 24year rule of president moi kept kenya united but left the east african country in serious economic difficulties and politically fractious the most immediate political challenge to president kibaki is to keep his narc coalition intact and keep former kanu senior figures from redefecting number of powerful opposition figures might be tempted to challenge kibaki by denying him majority in the parliament the current minister of works and housing raila odinga of the liberal democratic party who switched parties several times in the past few years wants to become the next prime minister if the new constitution would create such position president kibaki is 71 and questions have been raised about his health he was hospitalized in january 2003 and is rarely seen in public some observers expect kibaki to step down in 2008 the economy is another challenge it has been stagnant since the mid 1990s with gross domestic product gdp growth rate of less than 1 in 2001 unemployment is httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21514 high and corruption is endemic in 1997 the imf suspend its enhanced structural adjustment program because of corruption and the refusal of the moi government to implement proposed reforms the expectations of kenyans after 24years under kanu are likely to increase pressure on the kibaki government to deliver goods and services tackling corruption is seen as major priority of the kibaki government despite the potential political and social backlash in dealing with this problem rooting out official corruption may require getting rid of senior members of government and prosecution of former senior government officials another daunting challenge is the hivaids pandemic in kenya where 15 of adults aged 1549 were estimated to be hiv positive at the end of 20011 in march 2003 president kibaki appointed high level cabinet commission chaired by himself on hivaids 2 he stated that his governments top priority would be to tackle the aids pandemic saying that kenyans cannot afford to sit back as the pandemic ravages our nation despite these enormous challenges facing the narc government the kibaki victory has had positive impacts in kenya as well as africa the smooth transfer of power and transparency in the conduct of the elections reaffirmed that democracy can flourish in africa the lessons learned from the kenyan elections are many and could strengthen democracy movements elsewhere in east africa the power of incumbency and the entrenched clout of ruling party did not stop an opposition victory in kenya the elections demonstrated that ethnic divisions can be contained as the coalition of opposition parties showed in kenya if groups are united by single objective ruling parties in tanzania ethiopia eritrea and uganda may have to consider their political future since most have been in power for decades with limited popular support moreover donor governments and the people in these countries expect and could demand more transparency and free and fair elections after witnessing the kenyan elections 1 united nations joint program on hivaids unaids report on the global hivaids
