court to stop the us department of agriculture from collecting payments recent regulatory changes have attempted to aid farmers in fulfilling their agreements the new farm bill contains provision to allow borrowers to restructure the amounts due what are shared appr eciation agreements when borrower experiences difficulty in repaying loan made by the us department of agricultures usda farm service agency fsa1 usda may restructure the loan and give priority to princi pal and interest writeoff or setaside thus usda can forgive portions of loans to farm ers who can not make full repayment in return for the forgiven portion of the loan borrower may be required to enter into shared appreciation arrangement saa which would allow usda to share in the appreciation of the borrowers real estate property backing the loan appreciation is considered the gain in value between the time entered into an saa and the time of repayment2 the amount of the farms equity in whic h usda potentially can share is 75 of the appreciation in the case of agreements that last four years or less and 50 of the appreciation for agreements that last longer than four years repayment is requiredhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21145crs2 sooner if the property is conve yed sold with the exception of transferring title to the spouse upon the death of borrower or if the operator ceases farming in the event that borrowers property value does not rise money is due the maximum amount that can be recovered by fsa cannot exceed the amount written off prior to august 18 2000 saas had maturity period of 10 years in regulatory change on august 18 2000 new saas would have maturity period of five years see regulatory changes below appreciation of the propertys value is determined by appraisals if an appraisal is obtained by fsa in order to determine the r ecapture amount prior to the expiration of the saa the borrower may appeal the appraised value and request an independent appraisal at the end of the 10year agreement the borrower selects an appraiser from list of fsa approved appraisers if the borrower is ble to pay the recapture amount or obtain financing to do so the recapture amount can be established as loan and be repaid over period of up to 25 years at special low inte rest rate if paymen t cannot be made or new note taken the account is considered delinquent and proce ssed for liquidation authorizing legislation and intent of congress saas were instituted as part of the agricultural credit act of 1987 p l 100233 hr 3030 january 6 1988 which amended the consolidated farm and rural development act act pl 87128 augu st 8 1961 the act is the authorizing statute for usda farm loans the specific language of the act sec 353e that deals with saas states shared appreciation arrangements 1 in general as condition of restructuring loan in accordance with this section the borro wer of the loan may be required to enter into shared appreciation arrangement that requires the repayment of amounts written off or set aside 2 terms shared appreciation ag reements shall have term not to exceed 10 years and shall provide for recapture based on the difference between the appraised values of the re security property at the time of restructuring and at the time of recapture 3 percentage of recapture the amount of the appreciation to be recaptured by the secretary sha ll be 75 percent of the appreciation in the value of such real security property if the recapture occurs within 4 years of the restructuring and 50 percent if the recapture occurs during the remainder of the term of the agreement 4 time of recapture recapture shall take place at the end of the term of the agreement or sooner on the conveyance of the real security property b on the repayment of the loans or c if the borrower ceases farming operationshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21145crs3 the saa provision was contained in the senate version of the bill s 1665 sec 613e but not in the house version hr 3030 during conference the provision was adopted into the enacted law pl 100233 questions have arisen about the intent of congress in authorizing saas with some saa participants believing repayment would be required if the borrower remained in farming for 10 year s senate report 100 230 to accompany s 1665 would appear to conf lict with this view it states that it is the committees intent that the secretary shall ad minister the shared appreciation provisions so as to maximize the potential recovery of debt which has been writtenoff or set aside page 4647 and that as condition of restructuring an the borrower of the loan may be required to enter into shared ppreciation arrangement with fmha that requires the repayment of amounts written off shared appreciation agreements shall have term not to exceed 20years and shall provide for recapture based on the difference between the appraised values of the security property which shall be real property at the time of restructuring and at the time of recapture page 125 according to the language in s rpt 100230 and language in the act sec 353e it appears that the c ongress intended saas as way to keep farmers on their farms while at the same time allowing recovery of loan writedowns by the fsa this was reinforced during nate floor debate congressional record pages 336124 december 2 1987 when senators clarified that saas did require repayment with the total repayment not to exceed th amount originally writtenoff current situation many borrowers are faced with situation where the appreciation on the land has been substantial while they do not have f unds to repay the amounts due some reports indicate that farmers are tellin g fsa that even though their land has appreciated enough to cover the forgiven portion of the loan th ey still do not have the cash to pay because of depressed prices for many agricultural commodities thus significant percentage of the borrowers with saas coming to maturity during the years 1999 and 2000 were not able to repay the recapture amounts according to usda in response fsa issued rule on april 23 1999 allowing affected farmers to receive an extension on the repayment deadline see regulatory changes below otherwise some farmers would have been required either to use the appreciated nd as collateral for commercial loan or sell enough land to reimburse fsa in june 2001 109 farmers in 16 states file d suit in the us district court in bismarck nd challenging usdas efforts to require payment under s aas stahl et vs veneman the dispute arose from some bo rrowers belief they had to repay the write down amount only if they sold their farm or ceased farming within 10 years while those who kept their property would owe nothing among their arguments in court documents were claims that 1 the portion of debt writtenoff that was attributed to principal washttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21145crs4 reported to irs as income due to discharge of federal i ndebtedness that was longer collectable and 2 they were told by fsa employees that the saa would go away after 10 years if they did not sell the land or cease farming on august 22 2001 federal judge refused to order usda to halt its collection on disputed loans while the lawsuit was pending on may 20 2002 the judge granted the governments motion to dismiss and the case was dismissed the plaintiffs expect to appeal to the eight circuit court regulatory changes federal register april 23 1999 vol 64 78 pages 198635 interim rule that allowed borrowers with saas ending in 1999 and 2000 who had not yet paid their obligation under the saa or made arra ngements to pay and could not pay the amount owed to have all or pa rt of their obligation suspended for one year suspension may be renewed twice for total suspension of up to three years at each renewal the borrower will receive suspension limited to the portion of the recapture amount fsa determines based on farm and home plan that the borrower still is unable to repay at the time of the renewal request the amount of the recapture payment subject to suspension will accrue interest at rate equal to the applicab federal borrowing interest rate as determined by the fsa administrator if borrower wants to refinance the am ount owed under an saa that must be requested within 30 days of receiving the notice requesting repayment if the real estate is conveyed sold with the exception of tr ansferring title to the spouse upon death of borrower during the suspension period the recap ture amount plus any applicable interest will become due immediately nd payable under the notice procedures explained in the notice to the borrowers federal register august 18 2000 vol 65 161 pages 504015 final rule that made the following changes 1 allow the value of some capital improveme nts made during the term of the saa to be deducted from recapture the value contri buted by dwelling barn grain storage bin or silo constructed during the term of the saa will be deducted from the final appraisal ie when the saa matures if new construction is replacement for or an addition to structure only the difference in value added will be deducted 2 change the maturity period of future saas from 10 years to 5 years this change will reduce the burden of fsa in monitoring saas and allow the farmer to plan for the future without contingent liability in the distant future 3 reduce the interest rate on shared appreciation loans sa loans to the farm program homestead protecti on rate sa loans are approved when the borrower cannot pay the saa previously sa loan s could be amortized for up to 25 years at nonprogram rates 1025 as of march 1 2000 under this final rule the rate is reduced to the homestead protection ra 675 as of ma rch 1 2000 which is below market and near th federal borrowing rate according to fsa these changes gave bo rrowers an opportunity to repay portion of the debt that was written off while still ensuring the government promptly recaptures some appreciation of the collateralhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21145crs5 legislation fy2001 agricultural appropriations pl 106387 sec 818 changed the amortization rate on all future sa loans to the homestead protection rate less 1 additionally the amortization rate on all sa loans in ex istence as of october 28 2000 was similarly reduced regulatory changes published in the federal register on february 21 2002 and effective march 25 farm bill two separate provisions dealing w ith saas were included in the house and senate passed farm bills hr 2646 and s 1731 but were dropped in conference in favor of different m easure see below house farm bill sec 522 of hr 2646 would have provided temporary suspension of foreclosure for borrowers w ho failed to make pa yments required under saas specifically sec 522 would have pr ohibited usda from foreclosing or requiring payments under saas until after december 31 2002 senate farm bill sec 531 of s 1731 would ve allowed saa borrowers the option to grant usda an agricultural use protection and conservation easement on the property subject to the saa the easement would have been for 25 years and would have required that the property continue to be used or conserved for agricultural and conservation uses sec 531 also would ve allowed the easemen ts for saa borrowers who already had reamortized the recaptu re amount under an earlier agreement with usda farm security and rural investment act of 2002 farm bill pl 107 171 sec 5314 allows the secretary to modify recapture loan on which payment has become delinquent if th default is due to circumstances beyond the borrowers control and the borrower has acted in good faith reamortized loans may not exceed 25 years and may not reduce outstanding principal or unpaid interest
