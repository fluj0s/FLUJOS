hildreth foreign aﬀairs defense and trade division updated september 14 1999 abstract the army scratched the may 25 1999 thaad test because of problem with the target missile in its most recent test march 29 1999 the thaad theater high altitude area defense program again failed to validate the concept of highspeed highaltitude hittokill intercept thaad must now successfully intercept three of the next four tests by the end of 1999 lockheedmartin the thaad contractor will be penalized for failing to achieve these results sooner rather than later in the year the next test is scheduled for may to be followed by another before the end of june 1999 since its inception the thaad test program has experienced numerous delays as well as various technical and ﬁght problems in unsuccessful attempts to intercept ballistic missile over controlled test range congress has appropriated about 38 billion for the thaad eﬀort since 1989 the administration is requesting 44 billion for fiscal years 20002005 the total program acquisition cost is estimated at 147 billion despite longstanding congressional support thaad test results have escalated criticism of the program within congress and by others further development of thaad may be in jeopardyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98751for an assessment of global ballistic missile and weapons of mass destructio n1 proliferation see robert shuey nuclear

division summary after two successful in tercepts in june and august 1999 the pentagon announced it would scrap the remaining thaad flight tests nd proceed to the emd engineering and manufacturing development phase doing so the pentagon and others argue would save some money and expedite thaad deployment somewhat thaa d supporters argue that these intercepts have validated the systems major component s and that the systems nearterm deployment is now possibility critics continue to argue that thaads checkered test legacy over controlled test range is insufficient for the program to move forward with high confiden ce and caution that costly system fixes may lie in store for thaad in the future congress has appropriated about 38 billion for the tha ad effort since 1989 the administration is requesting 44 billion for fiscal years fy 2000 2005 the total program acquisition cost is estimated at 147 billion this repor t will be updated after future developments for broader treatment see crs issue brief 98028 background the thaad program is designed to field as soon as possible an uppertier system upper atmospherelower space to hit and destroy attacking theater or mediumrang ballistic missiles currently the first thaad units are scheduled to begin delivery i n1 fy2005 and continue through fy2013 the thaad program is in part product of long standing

critical to the overall thaad effort and is examined briefly in the following section thaad flight test program the thaad pro gram has experienced numerous schedule delays and test failures both the pe ntagon and the general accounting office gao have examined the tes t program because of concern over variety of flight test problems gao recommended in september 1997 that congress pursue slower test and development program befor committing to thaad acquisition decision in fe bruary 1998 pentagon group panel on reducing risk in ballistic missi defense flight test programs found that numerous technical failures were due to poor design and fabrication inadequate test planning an d preflight review as well as the pressure to test in debating the fy 1999 defense bill senator bingaman cited both these reports in criticizing thaads rush to failure and pointed out that the p rogram at that time was four years behind schedule congressional record may 13 1998 s4755 eleven tests have been conducted since 1995 the primary test objectives in the initial tests and the subsequent i nterceptor test objectives are summarized in the table below it should be added however that each of these tests had numerous other objectives in fact the pentagon stressed tha t the latest test accomplished most of its objectives the primaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98751crs3 according to the pentagon telemetry data from t haad was lost completely after about minute3 into the flight hence this has complicated efforts to determine the precise cause of the intercept failure nonetheless bmdo currently believes the likely cause was failure of one of the divert and attitude control system thrusters which began to degrade after about 20 seconds into th flightobjective being an intercept was not realized nonetheless continued support for th e3 program likely will be function of the intercept attempt test results table thaad flight tests summary table flight test objectives test result cause

three successful intercepts of the remaining five scheduled tests thi s arrangement placed emphasis on completing the tests earlier rather than laterhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98751crs4 because ft9 march 30 1999 failed lockheedmartin was penalized 15 million technically lockheedmartin will not bill the governmen t for 15 million of effort under this particular contract with the second successful test on august 2 lockheedmartin avoided 20 million penalty p enalties established in law for additional test failures have apparently been waived with the decision to scrap the remaining flight tests despite the previous test failures the ballistic missile def ense organization bmdo praised lockheedmartins efforts specifically bmdo cited improvements i n management and program leadership stronger technical support and enhance d engineering quality control procedures many suggested that th recent successful tests are due in small part to these management and quality control improvements currently the us army is preparing for an emd decision possibly late 1999 r early 2000 as part of that decision an independent cost assessment for thaad will have to be completed congressional concerns congress has had much to say about the thaad program there remains overal l support for thaad as evidenced in the fy19 99 house and senate defense authorization and defense appropriation subcommittee reports funding cuts were generally related to savings due to envisioned delays in testing and acqui sition of an early operational thaad capability although both defense c ommittees expressed support for an early deployment concept the house appr opriations committee hac raised serious questions about the plan at that time this year congress directed critical questions to bmdo and thaad progra m managers regarding the flight test program but after the recent successful flight tests congressional concerns about the program as reflected in current defense authorization and appropriations bills may be relieved issues for congress for more than decade congress has wanted to dep loy an effective tmd to protect us forces and interests abroad against what many consider v ariety of nearterm ballistic missile threats the principal weapons candidate for this mission has made significan t improvements as demonstrated in the two recent test successes but has thaa d demonstrated that it can meet the requirements to defend us troops and assets against fast moving mediumrange ballistic missiles there remain two strong and divergen t schools of th ought in this regard meanwhile there simply are other nearterm hitto kill technologies available for this mission in the near or midterm future congre ss recognizing national security need to deal with the threat posed fro m mediumrange ballistic missiles has made significant budg etary and political commitment to thaad how will the uppertier plan for tmd be affected which states that one of two programs thaad or navy theater wide will be selected as the lead area tm d effort and given more funding and support while the other is put on lower schedule will time and money lead to the deployment of an effective thaad system should the pace and scope of this commitment continue or be adjusted as some have recentl yhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98751crs5 suggested are there advantageous alternative or concurrent technical military r political approaches to counter longrange theater ballistic missiles if the thaa d program canno t produce an effective tmd system what are the near and mediumterm implications for us national security and for us troops deployed overseas in area s where troops are threatened by ballistic missiles even if the thaad program i s successful the system is likely to be less than perfect what then are the implications of the hostile deployment of theater ballistic missiles with weapons of mass destruction r their threat of use on us military strategy
