patterson reasons 14 b and d 1 snf summary in response to queries posed by the national security council embassy islamabad believes that it is notnot possible to counter alqaeda in pakistan absent comprehensive strategy that 1 addresses the interlinked taliban threat in afghanistan and pakistan 2 brings about stable civilian government in afghanistan and 3 reexamines the broader role of india in the region as the queries presuppose the ending of pakistani establishment support to terrorist and extremist groups some afghanfocused and some indiafocused is key element for success there is chance that pakistan will view enhanced assistance levels in any field as sufficient compensation for abandoning support to these groups which it sees as an important part of its national security apparatus against india the only way to achieve cessation of such support is to change the pakistan governments own perception of its security requirements end summary 2 snf alqaeda can operate in pakistans federally administered tribal areas fata largely because the talibanrelated groups in these areas continue to challenge the writ of the pakistani government unilateral targeting of alqaeda operatives and assets in these regions is an important component of dealing with the overall threat it is notnot however sufficient in and of itself to force alqaeda out of the fata so long as the territory remains largely ungoverned space increased unilateral operations in these areas risk destabilizing the pakistani state alienating both the civilian government and military leadership and provoking broader governance crisis in pakistan without finally achieving the goal to be effective we must extend the writ of the pakistani state into the fata in such way that taliban groups can longer offer effective protection to alqaeda from pakistans own security and law enforcement agencies in these areas we should be under illusion however that this effort will not require multiyear multiagency effort 3 snf taliban groups in pakistan and the regional threat posed by alqaeda however cannot be effectively dealt with absent broader regional strategy that leads to stability in afghanistan fear that the isaf mission in afghanistan will end without the establishment of nontaliban pakhtoonled government friendly to pakistan adds to the pakistani establishments determination not to cut its ties irrevocably to the afghan taliban they fear that withdrawals of nato countries on date certain from afghanistan is only the thin edge of wedge that will be followed by other coalition partners including the united states discussions of deadlines downsizing of the american military presence or even denial of the additional troops reportedly to be requested by gen mcchrystal are taken as evidence that reinforces this perception general kayani has been utterly frank about pakistans position on this in such scenario the pakistan establishment will dramatically increase support for taliban groups in pakistan and afghanistan which they see either as ultimately likely to take over the afghan government or at least an important counterweight to an indiancontrolled northern alliance 4 snf most importantly it is the perception of india as the primary threat to the pakistani state that colors its perceptions of the conflict in afghanistan and pakistans security needs the pakistani establishment fears proindia government in afghanistan would allow india to operate proxy war against pakistan from its territory justified or not increased indian investment in trade with and development support to the afghan government which the usg has encouraged causes pakistan to embrace taliban groups all the more closely as antiindia allies we need to reassess indian involvement in afghanistan and our own policies towards india including the growing military relationship through sizable conventional arms sales as all of this feeds pakistani establishment paranoia and pushes them closer to both afghan and kashmirfocused terrorist groups while reinforcing doubts about us intentions resolving the kashmir dispute which lies at the core of pakistans support for terrorist groups would dramatically improve the situation enhanced usg efforts in this regard should be considered 5 snf money alone will notnot solve the problem of alqaeda or the taliban operating in pakistan grand bargain that promises development or military assistance in exchange for severing ties will be insufficient to wean pakistan from policies that reflect accurately its most deepseated fears the pakistani establishment as we saw in 1998 with the nuclear test does not view assistance even sizable assistance to their own entities as tradeoff for national security visavis india the lack of faith in usg intentions in pakistan and in relation to india makes such bargain untenable in the eyes of the pakistani establishment development assistance in the context of the pakistani counterinsurgency strategy must be accelerated and refined in order to extend the government writ to the fata to stabilize regions atrisk for insurgent activity and recruitment and to offer incentives for those that desire to leave terrorist groups it can and should notnot be viewed as payoff for behavior change by the pakistani establishment 6 snf in the final analysis there is shortcut to dealing with the alqaeda problem in pakistan and afghanistan it is inextricably linked to and cannot be divorced from the taliban problem in both countries nor can we hope to develop strategy for minimizing taliban influence and thereby alqaeda operational space in pakistans fata absent strategy that brings about stability in afghanistan the notion that precision or longrange counterterrorism efforts can suffice are equally illusory afghan instability by definition leads the pakistani establishment to increase support for the taliban and thereby unintentionally create space for alqaeda amount of money will sever that link rather we must reassess our regional approach and find ways to reassure the pakistanis that they can address their longstanding national security objectives most effectively both to the east and to the west by working closely with the us patterson secret
