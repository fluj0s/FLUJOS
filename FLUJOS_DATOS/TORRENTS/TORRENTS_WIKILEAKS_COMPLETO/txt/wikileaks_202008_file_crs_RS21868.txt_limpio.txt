origin which include general rules for all signatories and specific rules for each country as with the other cafta parties the dominican republic would be allowed to use inputs also from mexico or

the textile industry15 the american apparel and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21868 footwear association aafa which represents the north american apparel industry and its suppliers said however because many us companies maintain production sharing relationships with the dominican republic swift implementation of the fta will likely have positive economic impact in the united states16 an unresolved

negotiated list of agencies and its own thresholds for contract amounts covered by the chapter similarly the chapters on crossborder trade in services financial services and investment include general

laws to encourage trade and agreed to ensure access to judicial proceedings the text would establish governmental labor and environmental committees to oversee implementation and other bodies would do
