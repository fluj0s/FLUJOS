classified by ambassador michele sison reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary on the evening of january 21 abu dhabi crown prince and deputy supreme commander of the uae armed forces sheikh mohammed bin zayed mbz nahyan hosted centcom commander general john abizaid for dinner they discussed regional security issues but iraq was clearly the focus of mbzs interest mbz expressed lack of confidence in being able to work with the maliki government mbz believes that the saudis will not support any sunni group in iraq with alqaeda ties but that the saudis are firm in their resolve to counter iran mbz reiterated uae interest in acquiring predator b referring to the recent events in somalia mbz commented the somalia job was fantastic also present were uae chief of staff lt general hamad mohammed thani alrumaithy director of intelligence staff brigadier general engineer essa saif mohammed almazrouei commander of the special operations major general juma ahmed albawardi alfalasi and commander of the uae air forces and air defense staff air vicemarshal major general mohammed sowaidan algimzy end summary iraq 2 c clearly the focus for mbz discussion began with his pronouncement lets talk about iraq gen abizaid noted that extremists on both ends of the sunnishia spectrum are largely irretrievable but we still have an opportunity to stabilize iraq by reinforcing the moderate middle ground mbz said that he had little confidence in being able to work with this malikis government saying of maliki i think we are operating on different frequencies different radio systems altogether 3 s mbz asked general abizaid what the us hoped to achieve with the extra troops set to deploy to iraq in 2007 and reiterated his concern about the level of ongoing violence against the sunni abizaid responded that the violence in iraq is highly localized principally in the baghdad area and that most of the rest of iraq is quiet the extra troops are intended to bring calm to baghdad and give the government sufficient space and time to contain violence even further it will also send message that the us is not abandoning iraq mbz stated that ahmad chalabi and others had made big deal out of the baathist threat but said that the baathists were not and are not the problem even though specific individuals linked to the baath party wereare the problem mbz offered that debaathification was and is an unnecessary distraction stating that pursuing problem that doesnt really exist only leads to more problems he said he had seen iyad allawi month ago noting that allawi was looking to the uae for support and assurances mbz said that there is assurance that the uae can give him adding its not his time mbz added that he believes that the saudis will not assist sunni groups in iraq that are aligned with alqaeda iran 4 s mbz acknowledged that tehran knows that the us is serious in its stance against iranian proliferation this can be clearly seen in how iran is changing its tactics abizaid pressed that countries in the region should make stronger statements weak statements only encourage the iranians we need our friends to say that they stand with the americans mbz avoided committing the uae to anything like public statement and shifted the discussion to other countries in the region saying the saudis need encouragement they are wahhabis after all and will resolutely stand up to any shia anywhere and counter them strongly agreeing that it is only matter of time before the iranians develop or acquire advanced weapons technologies including mtcrcontrolled uav technology mbz asserted thats why we need it first give predator b mbz added iran has to know that there is price to pay for every decision they make they are expanding day by day they have to be dealt with before they do something tragic but that said he continued we uae are not ready yet to confront iran afghanistanpakistan 5 s abizaid thanked mbz for the actions of the uae forces currently deployed in afghanistan mbz reciprocated abu dhabi 00000145 002 of 002 thank you this has been good chance for us and we appreciate the opportunity mbz questioned the role the iranians were playing in afghanistan he further observed that musharraf is not doing enough to engage the tribes in the south and needs to expand its efforts there lebanonhizballahsomalia 6 s noting lebanese pm sinioras january 16 visit to the uae mbz characterized siniora as good man we are supporting him mbz said that hizballah has made big mistake in estimating its support in lebanon and has played it wrong they do not have the support of the majority of the lebanese people mbz discussed with abizaid the military technology that hizballah used in 2006 specifically noting the amount of antitank weapons that hizballah possessed abizaid acknowledged that hizballah has access to weapons technology that most arab states dont have mbz interrupted the conversation to state explicitly that he wants the us to understand that the uae was not involved in the transfer of those weapons or technologies in any way referring to the recent events in somalia mbz commented the somalia job was fantastic 7 u polad ambassador
