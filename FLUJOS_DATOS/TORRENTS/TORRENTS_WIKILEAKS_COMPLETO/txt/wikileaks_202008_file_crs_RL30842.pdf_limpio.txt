found himself locked in stalemate with franklin d roosevelt and two other rivals breaking the deadlock hearst prevailed upon garner who was in washington to release his delegates to roosevelt in doing so garner gained sufficient favor with fdr that he was selected as his running mate4 for many garner was viewed as counterweight to the progressive internationalist roosevelt he subsequently found himself in opposition to the administrations deficit spending policy attempt to enlarge the composition of the supreme court and some new deal legislative initiatives he was also among those in his party who opposed third term for president roosevelt like his predecessors garner as vice president maintained offices on capitol hill but he did not regard himself as primarily legislative officer he

admired truman instinctively because he voted right17 that admiration did not dim when fdr selected truman as his running mate in 1944 position barkley himself sought actually it was the president roosevelts maneuvering that angered barkley despite his selection to nominate fdr as the partys presidential candidate18 four years later barkley arrived at the position he had sought although by one estimate his term of office saw little significant activity he did provide useful link to congress at times19 barkley also regularly attended and participated in cabinet deliberations became the first

of his successive election campaigns johnson reportedly was eager to have his assistance and by one estimate previous vice president was used by his president in such broad variety of roles38 however it has also been observed that johnson showed little interest in his own vice president and humphreys willingness to assume so many roles was not merely result of his energy and enthusiasm but was more an antidote to his increasing isolation from policyan estrangement attributable in large measure to humphreys desires to deescalate us military involvement in vietnam and to negotiate settlement of the hostilities in that region39 like his immediate predecessors humphre attended cabinet meetings and national security council sessions but probably did not perform the same liaison to congress as johnson had for kennedy as special envoy he took 12 trips to total of 31 countries40 he chaired the national aeronautics and space council and the peace corps national advisory council but the presidents equal employment opportunity commission was abolished and its responsibilities were assigned to the civil service commission and the department of labor41 humphrey headed related shortlived coordinatio n and policyrecommending panel the presidents council on equal opportunity42 and congress created another statutory leadership role for him by assigning the vice president the chairmanship of the new national council on marine resources and engineering development43 in the spring of 1967 lbj began assigning the vice president responsibility for chairing various presidential

of the vice presidents executive office began in 1961 when space was provided for the vice president and his staff in what was then known as the executive office building situated adjacent to the white house128 in 1970 congress established federal budget line item for the vice presidents executive office in the form of special assistance to the president as the account is designated appropriations are provided for expenses necessary to enable the vice president to provide assistance to the president in connection with specially assigned functions129 the funds lately amounting to 34 million allowed the vice president then as well as today to hire qualified staff and to acquire and maintain administrative support130 as consequence the vice president not only was relieved from borrowing employees from the departments and agencies to obtain staff assistance but also was under less compulsion to seek the leadership of temporary study or coordination panels in order to acquire personnel131 soon staff specialists began to appear making the vice presidents office replica in microcosm of the presidents office for example ford was the first vice president to have his own national security adviser and his own counsel132 mondale created his own staff for domestic policy development133 when white house staff authorization was legislated in 1978 more detailed vice presidential staff employment structure was established along with more relaxed arrangements for making expenditures for certain authorized expenses incurred by or in connection with assisting the

organization of their offices instead of loose collections of individuals under humphrey comments one close observer the ford and mondale offices became quite hierarchical involving specific chains of
