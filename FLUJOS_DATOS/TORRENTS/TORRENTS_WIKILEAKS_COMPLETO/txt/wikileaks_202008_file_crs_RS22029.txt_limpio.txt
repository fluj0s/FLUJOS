well as asian and latin american capitals according the washington post although the united states government has discussed the process and procedures for its deciding the us nominee the us government did not discuss or consult on specific candidates2 mr wolfowitzs nomination was received with both criticism and praise according to edwin truman of the international institute for economics the truth of the matter is that paul wolfowitz is better qualified to be at the world bank than many other possible contenders on the other hand he comes with lot of baggage3 many critics reportedly consider mr wolfowitz to be the intellectual force behind us operations in iraq and are concerned that he may use the world bank as another front on the socalled global war on terror according to one expert former world bank economist william easterly mr wolfowitz is the embodiment of americans forcing other societies to adopt american values whether they want them or not4 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22029 the world bank under james wolfensohns direction has increased its work on governance reform in the past ten years but the banks charter strictly forbids the institution from incorporating political decisions in its lending decisions several us politicians have come out strongly for mr wolfowitzs nomination senator joe biden of delaware has commented that ive had lot of talks about paul in

development banks mdbs and is one of the worlds largest sources of development assistance it includes 184 member countries who are jointly responsible for how the institution is financed and how its money is spent the g78 countries are the largest shareholders of the world bank and play the largest role in setting its agenda9 the united states is the largest contributor to the world bank 258 billion committed or 236 of total contributions committed and has the largest voting share 14510 james wolfensohn the ninth world bank president arrived in 1995 after successful career in international banking he spent much of his career at salomon brothers in new york and schroeders in london before opening his own investment firm under his leadership the bank tackled many major issues including opening up the bank to engagement with nongovernmental organizations ngos and other critics and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22029 he pushed through various technology and management changes he also introduced several anticorruption initiatives and steered major global debt relief initiative for impoverished countries the highly indebted poor countries initiative hipc launched in 199611 issues of international development appear to be priority for many world bank members the united kingdom currently presiding over the g8 presidency has urged more aid and greater debt relief and has called for g8 summit in 2005 with international development as its focus12 uk prime minister tony blair has established commission on africa that will issue recommendations in spring 2005 in

december 29 2004 13 crs report rl32645 the doha development agenda the wto framework agreement crs4 american president and the imf has had european managing director this convention was the outcome of gentlemans agreement struck at the 1944 bretton woods conference establishing the two institutions during the bretton woods negotiations the united states believed that the world bank should be headed by an american since the united states was the only capital surplus nation and world bank lending would be dependent on american financial markets according to then us secretary of the treasury fred vinson the bank would have to be headed by us citizen in order to win the confidence of the banking community14 moreover he noted it would be impracticable to appoint us citizens to head both the bank and the fund15 the united states did not break the tradition in its world bank president selection rob nichols the assistant treasury secretary for public affairs has stated that the administration intends to conduct an open candid and transparent selection process16 nonetheless many still criticize the process the financial times of london editorialized that the world bank president is an executive post yet the task of managing such diverse organization both knowledge bank and lender with occasional shifts of priorities by shareholder governments is difficult in the extreme this position above all should be open to successful reformers from the developing world17 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22029 guidelines the formal guidelines for choosing the world bank president are found in its articles of agreement the guidelines state that the executive board select president by 50 majority who shall not be governor or an executive director ed of member country18 the us candidate for world bank president does not need to be confirmed by the senate the us candidate has never formally been challenged by other countries eds in 1968 bank eds requested the united states to put forward several candidates for them to choose from this request was rebuffed and president johnson submitted only one name robert mcnamara former secretary of defense 1968 198119 in 1995 degree of transparency was added when search committee was set up chaired by treasury of the secretary robert rubin after somewhat contentious negotiations james wolfensohn was selected as the us nominee20 the tradition of only nominating one candidate has continued with the united states only nominating paul wolfowitz 14 kahler miles leadership selection in the major multilaterals institute for international economics 2001 p 43 15 ibid p 43 16 blustein january 4 2005 17 the wrong kind of executive search the financial times january 11 2005 18 the board of governors bog is the highest authority in the imf and all countries are represented often at the finance ministry of treasury level the executive board handles dayto day authority over operational policy lending and other matters the us executive director is nominated by the president confirmed by the senate and directed by the department of the treasurys office of the undersecretary for international affairs 19 kahler p 44 20 see kahler p 4647 crs5 the debate over the useu convention the useu arrangement is considered by many of its critics as relic of the past whereas the united states clearly dominated the postworld war ii economy and europe was the region that the world bank was designed to reconstruct the current international economy is less easily categorized moreover the original rationale for the united states claiming world bank leadership is obsolete international capital markets not united states financial markets are the major source of world bank capital in 2004 34 of the world banks borrowing was in dollars and substantial share of these were drawn from overseas dollar loan markets21 this was down from 51 in 2000 the world bank is longer solely reliant on domestic us capital markets to finance its lending operations22 nonetheless the united states and the europeans are the largest contributors to the imf and the world bank the willingness of the united states or europe to support these institutions could be diminished if their contributions were not commensurate with influence evidence of this is the pressure that the europeans placed on the united states to support the creation of new deputy president post to be filled by european although many europeans argued in opposition to the wolfowitz nomination that the selection of high bank officers should be based on merit rather than on unilateral assertions of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22029 national power23 proposals for reform in july 2000 two internal working groups the world bank working group to review the process for selection of the president and the international monetary fund working group to review the process for selection of the managing director were created to discuss the selection procedure joint draft report of the working group was endorsed by the executive directors on april 26 2001 but never formally implemented the report declared among other things that transparency and accountability is critical to the selection process during the 2004 nomination of new imf managing director wide range of experts advocated revision of the ifi selection process moises naim editor of foreign policy magazine commented that the next chief executive of the imf and the world bank must be selected through process that gives them and their institutions the legitimacy that only competitive and transparent process can bestow nancy birdsall of the center for global development specifically pointed out the need to involve the major emerging markets of south american and asia as well as the worlds poorest countries according to dr birdsall the unwillingness of the us and the g7 to share power and responsibility in the global financial institutions is already undermining the legitimacy and effectiveness of these institutions issues facing the world bank there are several differences between the united states and other bank member countries over development issues which may complicate future assistance efforts during 21 the world bank annual report 2004 volume 2 financial statements p 20 httpwwwworldbankorgannualreport2004pdfvolume_2pdf 22 kahler p 48 23 see mr wolfowitz and the bank the washington post march 31 2005 crs6 2005 gordon brown the chancellor of the uk treasury has called for rich countries to increase aid through various proposals such as an international finance facility iff which would issue special bonds securitized on future government aid budgets the us government germany and canada have said that their public finance rules would not allow them to participate in an iff facility since they cannot account for borrowing up front dr taylor by contrast has placed emphasis on increasing aid efficiency and not the volume of aid this has complicated negotiations for debt relief while the united kingdom would like to write off all imf and world bank debt for all very poor countries in addition to hipc countries with donor countries increasing contributions to the world bank to fund the world banks debt reduction the united states believes the world bank can instead fund its own debt relief by refraining from providing loans to such countries and instead moving to grantbased assistance with tighter performance requirements the world bank and congress the 109th congress could face action on issues involving the world bank on various fronts congress must approve all us appropriations to the institutions and has oversight authority over us international economic policy in the 108th congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22029 hearings were held on various issues including anticorruption policies at the mdbs world bank lending to iran regional international financial crises and general oversight hearings concerning us international economic policy and priorities at the institutions congress appropriated 138 billion to the mdbs in fy2004 and 1219 billion in fy2005 this amount fell in between the house and senatepassed levels but 274 million or 183 below the presidents fy2005 request of 1493 billion among the institutions the largest cut falls on the international development association ida in fy2005 the president requested 1061 billion to cover the third of three scheduled annual contributions under the thirteenth threeyear replenishment of ida ida13 850 million base payment plus 200 million of uscommitted 300 million incentive contribution for increasing ida performance standards24 the enacted ida appropriation 8432 million provides slightly less than the regular ida contribution amount 850 million and does not fund the administrations 200 million incentive payment debates concerning grants and concessional loans to ida countries and the appropriate financing for debt forgiveness are likely to be part of congressional consideration for funding the 20052008 ida14 replenishment the fy2006 budget request will likely include the first of three annual us contributions for the ida14 authorizing legislation will likely be submitted 24 in 2002 the bush administration announced it would contribute 300 million over three years 100 million in fy2004 200 million in fy2005 if the world bank agreed to adopt specific steps to improve accountability and better measure the results of bankfunded operations the administration certified in april 2003 and in june 2004 that ida had achieved the two sets of reform targets and requested an additional 100 million and 200 million in fiscal 2004 and 2005 appropriations respectively as incentive contributions to ida congress however did not include this money in either the fiscal 2004 or 2005 appropriation the april 2003 announcement came following meeting of ida donors at which it was agreed that ida had met the targets specified earlier for enhancing its performance standards
