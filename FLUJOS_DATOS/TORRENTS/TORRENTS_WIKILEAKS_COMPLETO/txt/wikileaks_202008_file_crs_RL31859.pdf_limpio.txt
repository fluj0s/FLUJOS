judiciary committee has reported out s 274 both styled the cla ss action fairness act of 2003 each 1 creates consumer class action bill of rights and 2 allows the federal courts to try greater number of large class action law suits 100 plaintiffs or more arising out of state law where the parties come from diverse states current law requires that each plaintiff have suffered 75000 in damage s and that there be complete diversity before state lawsuit may be filed in or removed to federal court that is to say all of the plaintiffs must be citizens residing in different states than all of the defendants the bills ease the complete diversity requirement and eliminate the requirement of individual damages of 75000 as long as th damages suffered by the class as whole is 5 million or more the consumer class action bill of rights in each proposal contains safeguards which provide for judicial scrutiny of coupon and other noncash settlements protection against proposed settlement that would result in net loss to class member protection against discrimina tion based upon geographic location and prohibition on class representative receiving greater share of the award s 274s 1751 alone includes within its bill of rights explicit provisions for plain english settlement notices and settlement notifications for state and federal authorities hr 1115 instead defers to the notice reforms

exception concerning mass tort claims noted infra at n 8 3 diversity jurisdiction is the authority of federa l courts to try cases arising out of state law when the parties are from different states the federal jurisdiction section of each of the two bills amends section 1332 to provide for federal jurisdiction in class actions where the aggregate amount in controversy of ll individual claims exceeds 5 million and any member of the putative plaintiff class is citizen of state different from any defendant in cases with less than onethird of the plain tiffs and the primary defendants come from the same state where the suit is filed on the other hand the acts expanded jurisdictional provisions would not apply to th is section if twothirds or more of the plaintiffs and the primary defendant come from the state where the suit is filed or if the case involves less than 5 million fewer than 100 class members or state entities or officials as primary defendants in between in cases involving mo re than onethird but less than twothirds of the plaintiffs and the primary defendant coming from the same state where the suit is filed the federal courts would have discretion to tr class actions after weighing five factors 4 the hr 1115 and s 274 removal provisions allow any defendant or absent class member to remove class action from state court to federal court if the minimal

fairness acts of 2003 and 2004 background in 2003 class action fairness acts were reintroduced in the house and senate after previous legislation had died in the congress1 generally similar in content each bill hr 1115 and s 274s 17512 has three main sections 1 an amendment to the federal diversity statute 28 usc 13323 2 provision regarding removal4 and 3 consumer class action bill of

legislation requires hearing and written findings before court may approve any class settlement providing noncash benefits or requiring expenditure of funds in order to obt ain the proposed benefits similarly court must make written findings in order to approv settlement that obligates class member to pay sums to class members in an amount that would result in net loss to the class member further the two bills prohibit approv of settlement that pays class members higher amounts based solely on their economic pr oximity to the court or that pays bounty to the class representatives other th an payment for reasonable time and cost hr 1115 and s 274 provide that the acts pr ovisions apply to any civil action begun on or after the date of enactment of the act however hr 1115 would also be retroactive to existing cases where class has not been ce rtified or when certification is entered on or after the date of enactment 6 s 2062 108th cong 2d sess 2004 class acti on fairness act of 2004 was introduced by senator grassley in the senate on feb 10 2004the legislation section 1 short title hr 1115 and s 274s 17516 the act may be cited as the class action fairness act of 2003 this s ection also states that it amends title 28 of the united states code section 2 findings and purposes of the act both bills set out congress findings describing the 1 ci rcumstances in which class actions are valuable to our legal system 2 abuses of the class action process that have harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly adversely affected interstate commer ce and undermined public respect for our judicial system 3 the manner by which class members have been harmed by number of actions taken by plaintiffs lawyers which provide little or benefit to class members as whole including i plaintiffs lawyers receiving large fees while class members are left with coupons or other awards of little or value ii unjustified rewards made to certain plainti ffs at the expense of other class members and iii confusing published notices that prevent class members from being able to fully understand and effectivel exercise their rights 4 abuses in class actions which undermine the national judicial system the free flow of interstate commerce and the concept of diversity jurisdiction as intended by the framers of the united states constitution in that state and local courts are i keeping cases of national importance out of federal court ii some times acting in ways that demonstrate bias against outofstate defendants and iii making judgments that impose their view of the law on other states and bind the righ ts of the residents of those states section 3 consumer class action bill of rights and improved procedures for interstate class actions these sections would add seven five in hr 1115 new sections to 28 u sc which are intended to provide greater protections for class members in par ticular section 3 would add the followinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31859crs3 7 while there is consumer class action bill of rights section per in s 1769 it provides for contingent attorney fees to be based on the value of the coupon settlements if proposed settlement in class action prov ides for recovery of coupons to class member the portion of any attorneys fee to be paid to class counsel based on the recovery of the coupons shall be based on the value to class members of the c oupons that are redeemed section 1711judicial scrutiny of coupon and other noncash settlements section 1712 in s 274s 17517 this provision is aimed at certain pr oposed settlements of class actions in which the plaintiffs lawyer and the defendant work out settlement that provides class members with essentia lly valueless coupons while rewarding the lawyers with substantial attorneys fees to address this problem this section provides that judge may approve proposed settleme nt under which the class would receive noncash benefits or would otherwise be re quired to expend funds in order to obtain part or all of the proposed benefits only after hearing to determine whether and making written finding that the settlement is fair reasonable and adequate for class members s 2062 would require that attorneys fees be based either on the proportionate value of the c oupons actually redeemed by class members or b the hours actually billed in presenting the class action section 1712protection against loss by class members section 1713 in s 274s 1751 this provision provides that judge may not approve class action settlement in which the class member will be required to pay attorneys fees that would result in net loss to the class members until after hearing to determine whether the nonmonetary benefits to the cl ass outweigh or substantially outweigh in s 274 the monetary loss and if so making written finding to that effect section 1713protection against discrimination based on geographic location section 1714 in s 274s 1751 deleted in s 2062 this provision provides that settlement may not award some class members larger recovery than others solely because the favored members of the class are located closer to the courthouse in which the settle ment is filed section 1714prohibition on the payment of bounties section 1715 in section in s 274s 1751 deleted in s 2062 this provision provides that class action may not be settled on terms that award special and disproporti onate bounties to the named class representative class representative will however be able to be compensated for his reasonable time or costs that were required to be expended in fulfilling his obligations as class representativehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31859crs4 8 hr 1115 as received in the senate defers to the supreme courts recommendations relating to class action notification reform found in the proposed amendments to rule 23 of the federal rules of civil procedure which in the absence of explicit congressional action become effective on december 1 2003section 1715class action defini tions section 1711 in s 274s 1751 1 class actionthe term is defined to include any civil action filed in federal district court under rule 23 of the federa l rules of civil procedure as well as actions filed under similar rules in state c ourt that have been removed to federal court 2 class counselthe term is defined as the persons who serve as the attorneys for the class members in pr oposed or certified class action 3 class membersthe term is defined as the persons who fall within the definition of the proposed or certified class action 4 plaintiff class actionthe term is defined as class action in which class members are plaintiffs 5 proposed settlementthe term is fined as an agreement that resolves claims in class action that is subject to court approval and th at if approved would be binding on the class members section 1716clearer and simpler settlement information in s 274s 1751 only see section 7 in hr 1115enactment of judicial conference recommendations this provision provides that class notices should present information in plain english the notices must be designed to attract the attention of class members by stating at the outset in 18point type that the recipient is plaintiff in class action lawsuit and has legal rights that are affected by the settlement described in the notice in addition the notice must offer the subject matter of the class action b the members of the class c the legal consequences of being member of the class d detailed information about any proposed settlement i including description of the benefits for class members ii the rights that class members will lose or waive through settlement iii the obligations imposed on the defendant and iv the amount of attorneys fee counsel will be seeking or if not possible good faith estimate of such fee any other material matter8 s 2062 would eliminate what was consider ed complicated set of burdensome notice requirements for notice to potential class members and preserve the current federal law related to class notificationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31859crs5 9 28 usc 1332 see also zahn v

requirement of section 1332 10 s 1751 would provide for the removal of cla ss actions to federal court if less than one third of the plaintiffs are from the same stat as the primary defendant and the suit involves more than 500000000 s 1769 substantially broade ns the two thirdsonethird analysis to eliminate consideration of defendants state or residence in determining whether to remove an action to federal district court under s 1769 there is jurisdictional dollar amount and class action could be removed to federal court if more than twothirds of putative class reside within the same state where the class action was filed regardless of whether defendant also resides in that state thus s 1769 would provide for the continuedsection 1717 notifications to appropriate federal and state officials s 274s 1751 only this provision requires defe ndants to notify the appropr iate state and federal official of the particulars of any class action settlement and delays the effective date of the settlement until 90 days after they have done so the appropriate federal officials include the attorney general and in the case of financial institutions the federal regulatory authorities state officials entitled to notice include the authorities with regulatory jurisdiction over defendant in any state in which any member of the class resides section 4 federal district cour t jurisdiction of interstate class actions article iii of the cons titution protects outofstate litigants against the prejudice of local courts by allowing fo r federal diversity jurisdiction when the plaintiffs and defendants are citizens of different states however under current law federal diversity jurisdiction for class action does not exist unless every member of the class is citizen of different state from every defendant and every member of the class is seeking damages in excess of 750009 this section in both bills would change the law by providing additional protection for outofstate litigants by creating minimal diversity rule for class actions and by determining satisfaction of the amountincontroversy requirement by looki ng at the total amount of damages at stake under the proposals federal district cour ts receive original jurisdiction over any class action in which the amount in controve rsy exclusive of in terest costs exceeds 5000000 and in which any member of cl ass of plaintiffs is citizen of state different from any defendant bany member of class of plaintiffs is foreign state or citizen or subject of foreign state and any defendant is citizen of state or c any member of class of plaintiffs is citizen of state and any defendant is foreign state or citizen or subject of foreign state this rule holds true if less than onethird of the plainti ffs and the primary defendants come from the state where the suit is filed has applicati on if twothirds or more of the plaintiffs and the primary defendants come from the state where the suit is filed and applies at the discretion of the federal court if more than onethird but less than twothirds of the plaintiffs and the primary defendants come from the state where the suit is filed10httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31859crs6 10 continued automatic removal of class action in which fewer than onethird of the class members reside in the same state where the class action was filed regardless of the citizenship of the defendant if between onethird and twothirds of the class members reside in the same state where the class action was filed the courts w ould have the discretion to determine whether the case would be removed regardless of the citizenship of the defendant 11 s 2062 would expand the local class action exception further it would provide for broader and greater judicial disc retion by authorizing federal courts to consider any district nexus between the forum where the action was brought and the class members the alleged harm or the defendants 12 the house bill deviates from the senate versi on with regards to two kinds of lawsuits that are not class actions 1 private attorney ge neral cases brought by named plaintiff other than state attorney general and 2 nonclass action cases involving 100 or more plaintiffs known as mass tort cases 149 cong rec at h5295 hr 1115 would impose the new class action rules on both cases however s 274 but not s 1751 exempts both from the amendments to federal rule of civil procedure 23 id s 1769 would also exempt mass tort cases from the new rule s 2062 would impose the class action rules on mass action casesin the exercise of their discretion the federal courts must consider11 whether the claims asserted i nvolve matters of national interstate interest whether the claims asserted will be governed by laws other than those of the state in which the action was originally filed in the case of class action originally filed in state court whether the class action has been pleaded in manner that seeks to avoid federal jurisdiction whether the number of citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed in all proposed pl aintiff classes in the aggregate is substantially larger than the number of citizens from any other state and the citizenship of the other members of the proposed class is dispersed among substantial number of states whether 1 or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have b een or may be filed this section contains similar class action definition as section 3 defining class action as any civil action filed pur suant to rule 23 of the federal rules of civil procedure or similar state statute or rule it also deems to be class actions certain other types of civil actions 1 an action seeking mone tary relief on behalf of persons who are not parties to the action unless the named plaintiff is the state attorney general or 2 an action that asserts claims seeking monetary relief on behalf of 100 or more persons in which the claims invol ve common questions of law or fact and are to be jointly tried12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31859crs7 13 under hr 1115 any defendant named plainti ff or unnamed member of plaintiff class may seek removal at any time under s 1751 while any defendant or named plaintiff may seek removal before or after the entry of class certification order unnamed class members may not seek removal until class certification order is entered under hr 1115 and s 1751 class members would have 30 days after receiving notice of the action to file notice of removal allowing unnamed class members to remove an action to federal district court both bills offer class members the same flex ibility as the defendants regarding removal s 1769 would limit the ability of defendants to remove class actions to federal court to within 30 days after the filing of the comp laint and it would also establish time period in which the structure of the plai ntiffs class must be determinedagain in order that actions lacking national implications remain in state court the minimal diversity rules does not apply in any action where twothirds or more of the members of all proposed plai ntiff classes in the aggregate and the primary defendants are citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed b the primary defendants are states state officials or other governmental entities against whom the district court may be fo reclosed from ordering relief or c the number of members of all proposed plainti ff classes in the aggregate is less than 100 section 5 removal of interstate class actions to federal district court this section would allow class acti on lawsuits to be removed from state court to federal court either by defendant or by any plaintiff who is not named or representative class member13 section 6 appeals of class action certification orders hr 1115 only this section provides that orders gr anting or denying class certification may be appealed if notice of appeal is filed with in 10 days after

undue prejudice to party section 6 report on class action settlements section 6 in s 274s 2062 this provision directs the judicial conference of the united states to report to the judiciary committees
