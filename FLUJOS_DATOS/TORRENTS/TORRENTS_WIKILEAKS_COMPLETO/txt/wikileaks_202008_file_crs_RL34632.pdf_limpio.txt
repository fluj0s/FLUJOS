same wireless carrier eg sprint customers could only exchange messages with other sprint customers in november 2001 however wireless service providers bega n to connect their networks for text messaging allowing subscrib ers on different networks to exchange text messages since then the number of text messages in the united states has grown to over 48 billion messages every month additionally text messages are longer only sent as pointtopoint communications betw een two mobile device users more specifically messages are also commonly nt from webbased applications within web browser eg from an internet mail address and from instant messaging clients like aim or msn for congressional policymakers two major categories of issues have arisen 1 same problem different platform and 2 issues stemming from the difficulty in applying existing technical definitions to new service such as whether text message is sent phonetophon or using the phones associated email address an example of the first category would be consumer fraud and childrens accessing inappropriate content which have existed previously in the wired world but have now found their way to the wireless worl d an example of the second category would be that spam sent between tw phones or from one phone to many phones does not fall under the definition of spam in the canspam act of 2003 controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act pl 108187 however if that same message were to be nt from phone or computer using the phones associated email address it would the increasing use

service sms is thod of communication that sends text between cell phone s or from computer or handheld device to cell phone the short part refers to the maximum si ze of the text messages 160 characters1 the term sms is generally used interchangeably with the term text message even when not being used for voice ca ll mobile phone is constantly sending and receiving information it is communica ting to its cell phone tower over control channel the reason for this communicati on is so that the cell phone system knows which cell phone is in and so that the phone can change cells as the user moves around every so often phone and tower w ill exchange packet of data that lets both know that everything is working properly the control channel also provides the pathway for sms messages when someone sends an sms message the ssage flows through the sms center smsc then to the cell tower and the tower then sends the message to the recipients phone as packet of data on the

email address ie 2025551212carriercom at th is time only the latte r type of message is covered by canspam messages that are sent phonetophone through the smsc are not there is evident reason for messages that appear the same to user and have the same effect on user generally annoy ance to be treated differently under can spam resolving this discrepancy in the treatment of these two types of messages would require change to the statute inability of consumers to disable text messaging some mobile service customers ve expressed frustration to their congressional representatives about unwan ted text messages and the inability to selectively block or comp letely disable text messa ging on their phones while carriers generally offer range of text messaging packages for example 500 messages for 10 some custom ers do not use text messaging and therefore pay small fee every time they receive messa ge number of user discussion sites contain posts from users who are frustrated with the extra

various options being offered by different carriers appendix 1 contains information from that article that may be helpful to consumers given that carriers are beginning to offer various forms of text blocking to their customers it may be advantageous to c onsumers to wait to see what options the different carriers develop in that way competition is given chance to succeed in this area and carriers are offered the opportun ity to assess what their competitors are doing and perhaps improve their own serv ices eventually however congress may wish to investigate whether customers are being offered the best possible options to assure that they are not receiving unwanted text messages carrier blocking of co mmon short code messages in september 2007 verizon notified naral prochoice america that it would not participate in its csc program naral does not charge for its messages and users may optin or optout as desired but verizon stated that it does not accept programs from any group that seeks to promot an agenda or dist ribute content that in its discretion may be seen as controve rsial or unsavory to any of its users7 this decision was immediately criticized by freespeech advocates although communications scholars pointed out that the company most likely from legal standpoint did have the right to refuse to participate in the program8 since text messages are not carried over the traditi onal telephone ne twork such messages are not protected under common carrier regulati on the next day verizon changed its decision and is now participating in naral s csc program saying in statement that the decision had been an incorrect interpretation of dusty internal policy that was designed to ward against communica tions such as anonymous hate messaging and adult materials sent to children th policy had been developed before text messaging protections such as spam filters adequately protected customers from unwanted messages9 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34632crs7 10 see class

voluntary guidelines for wireless carriers to use in classifying content that they provide dir ectly over wireless handsets these voluntary guidelines apply only to content that you purchase from your wireless carrier either on onetime use or download basis or as part of package with monthly fee such as ring tones wallpaper games music video clips or tv shows content that is generated or owned by wireless user such as text messages instant messages email through chat continuedthis issue highlights the difficulty in pplying the current regulatory structure to new services while mobile providers appear to have the legal right to determine what information is available through their csc programs congress may wish to consider whether and how political and ot her speech might be better protected in those programs deceptive and misleading co mmon short code programs many thirdparty content providers use the csc program and bill the usage through the mobile service provider fo r example content providers can allow mobile device users to download content g ringtones or participate in sms based chat while most of these content providers are legitimate businesses others use deceptive tactics to gain customers and run up unexpected charges10 for example as reported by cbs news in february 2008 some customers have subscribed to monthly services without r eading the fine print and find that the charge is often difficult to remove because it is an independent third party rather than the customers mob ile service provider11 the mobile marketing association s developed consumer best practices guidelines12 that it expects its members to follow this code includes limiting subscription periods to one month after which consumers must resubscribe and providing alerts to customers when thei r chatrelated charges reach 25 increments although the best practices have not liminated all misleading programs over time the industry may bring its members into comp liance more clarity on industry efforts might allow policymakers an opportunity to assess the efficacy of those efforts protecting children from inappropriate content on wireless devices as more mobile devices become equipped to access the world wide web and additional content services are made available via cscs the risk of children downloading inappropriate content will likely increase while carriers may follow set of voluntary guidelines13 to promote wireless safety for children there is wayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34632crs8 13 continued rooms message boards etc and picture ma il is not included in the wireless carriers content classification system also content th at is accessed by surfing the internet on wireless handset is not currently included in the classification system the guidelines urge carriers to provide separate web filtering so ftware for web browsing services wireless carriers choosing to follow these voluntary guidelines agree to use at least two content ratings 1 generally accessible or available to consumers of all ages and 2 restricted or accessible only to those age 18 and older or to those younger than 18 years old when specifically authorized by parent or guardi an the restricted ratings system generally is based on or uses criteria under existing ratings systems for movies television music and games ctia guidelines are available online at httpwwwctiaorgadvocacy

that children will not be able to access inappropriate content by circumventing carrierimp lemented safeguards the following types of material can be downloaded on many wireless devices and may include content in appropriate for children images such as background wallpaper for the phone screen games including some games that are also available for gaming systems music and songs including ring tones ringback tones and downloads of full songs video including certain television shows movies and music videos as well as video programming specially made for and only available on wireless devices14 the wireless industry is working to ensure that children do not access inappropriate information over their wireless devices but there is definitive research on the success of these efforts whether current effort s to protect children from inappropriate content over wireless devices may be an issue of interest to policymakers mobile cyberbullying cyberbullying harassing communications sent for example via email or text messages or through social networking sites such as facebook or myspace is growing problem the issue made nationa l headlines in november 2007 after the suicide of megan meier 13yearold missouri girl in that case the mother of former friend of megans set up fake my space page pretending to be boy who had just moved to the area and was homeschooled within few weeks of becoming friends with josh on oct ober 15 2006 the tone of his messages changed drastically with josh saying he longer wanted to be friends withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34632crs9 15 gina marie stevens legislative attorney in the crs american law division contributed to this section megan because he had heard that she had been mean to some of her friends on october 16 2006 megan hanged herself in her closet although as in the case described above much cyberbullying takes place in the wired world more recently these sorts of messages are being sent from and to mobile devices since many mobile devices are capable of performing the same tasks as computers these messages are now being sent via mobile instant messaging the mobile websites of soci networking sites and text messaging the subsequent public outcry over the megan meier case led to four bills being introduced in the 110th congress three by represen tative linda sanc hez and one by senator john kerry each contains language that would include the use of wireless devices in the definition of cyberbullying hr 3577 was introduced on ptember 17 2007 and referred to the house committee on energy and commerce
