specialist in international trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division us trade with developing countries trends prospects and policy implications summary developing countries heterogeneous group of low and middleincome countries have become an increasingly significant factor in us trade flows and trade policy over the last two or more decades their influence is reflected in the issues on the trade agenda of the 110th congress the possible renewal of fast track trade authoritytrade promotion authority implementing legislation for free trade agreements reauthorization of trade adjustment assistance taa for workers and firms review and possible reauthorization of generalized system of preferences and other trade preference programs and oversight of the doha development agenda dda round negotiations in the wto the growth of developing countries economies and foreign trade presents the united states with opportunities and challenges the imports from many developing economies provide us consumers with an ever widening range of choices of products at lower prices raising real incomes and contributing to higher us standard of living number of the developing countries have also become robust markets for us exports because of rapid economic growth and trade liberalization at the same time many us workers are competing with an expanding pool of lowerwage labor from india china and other developing countries such competition induces usbased firms to reduce costs by using laborsaving technology moving production offshore or shutting down forcing workers to adjust even workers in the highend services sector are feeling the pressures of competition from some developing countries trade with developing countries also raises set of virtually unique issues regarding labor rights environment protection intellectual property rights among others that have become fixtures on the us trade agenda at the same time developing countries are challenging us policies on trade remedies high tariffs on wearing apparel and other importsensitive products pricing of medicines and the temporary entry of foreign workers if current trade trends hold developing countries can be expected to account for increasing shares of us exports and imports and for world trade as result these opportunities and challenges will likely continue if not expand the analysis of us trade trends also exposes significant divide among groups of developing countries some countries such as china south korea mexico and chile have made great strides and are expanding their role in us and world trade others including most of africa many in south asia and some in latin america lag behind or are losing shares of us and world trade these differences suggest that effective us trade policy may need to differentiate among the various groups of developing countries these differences could play role in how the united states proceeds on trade preferences regional

beneficiary countries 2005 12 us trade with developing countries trends prospects and policy implications developing countries heterogeneous group of low and mediumincome economies are making an increasingly strong impact on us foreign trade and investment and world trade this impact is both economic and political and is likely to increase developing countries have been shaping us trade patterns trade policy priorities and policies they are reshaping the international trading system asserting greater influence at bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations and challenging the united states and other developed countries to reappraise longheld policies at the same time developing countries advancement on the international trade stage has forced them to confront the challenges of international competition and the responsibilities that come with membership in the international trade community developed countries are demanding that developing countries jettison economic policies that protect domestic markets for local producers and workers the growing role of some developing countries in us and world trade raises sensitive policy issues for members of congress as they consider legislation to implement trade agreements to monitor administration enforcement of agreements and of trade laws and to develop policies many of the us free trade agreements ftas in place or that are under negotiation are with developing countries furthermore the united states has been engaged with the other 149 members of the world trade organization wto in the doha development agenda dda round of negotiations the vast majority of the wto members are developing countries who are using the strength of their large numbers to influence the agenda and the pace of the negotiations the dda negotiations are now indefinitely stalled because of among other reasons conflicts between developed and developing countries on agricultural trade congressional interests and the congressional legislative agenda are filled with issues pertaining to trade with developing countries the us generalized system of preferences gsp program and other trade preference programs are subject to periodic reviews and renewals some members of congress have suggested that the congress needs to reexamine the rationale for these programs and their eligibility criteria in light of the rapid economic advancements that some developing countries have made in addition the congress has recently considered and passed legislation implementing ftas with developing countries and will probably consider number of others in the near future congressional debate and final action over these measures will likely be influenced by the perception of the role that developing countries play in us trade the purpose of this report is to assist the congress in assessing and developing us foreign trade and economic policies by examining the role that developing crs2 countries are playing in trading with the united states the report will be updated as determined by events developing countries and their role in us and world trade the category developing countries includes economies representing many levels of economic development however they share one important quality they are generally technology receivers rather than technology innovators and so their economies still have room to catch up with industrialized countries through the increased application of technologybased production some of the developing countries have been more successful in catching up than others leading to wide gaps in economic welfare among them for the purposes of this report developing countries include all countries except australia new zealand europe japan canada and the united states the term also excludes the former soviet republics and the former communist states in central and eastern europe1 trends in developing countries trade with the united states developing countries have accounted for growing shares of us exports and imports of goods over 20year span data presented in the table below table 1 illustrate this trend 1 even though many of them would fall under the definition they are excluded to maintain analytical consistency over time period that stretches across the cold war and post cold war periods in addition the impact of these countries on international trade and investment remains minimal at this time crs3 table 1 share of us exports and imports 19852006 percentages 1985 1995 2000 2006 country group exp imp exp imp exp imp exp imp developing

328 in 1985 versus 470 in 2006 similarly developing countries are becoming more significant as sources of us imports developing countries accounted for 345 of us imports in 1985 and 547 of us imports in 2006 however the data clearly show that the trends are not consistent across developing country subgroups for example asian developing countries all asian countries except japan have accounted for much of the growth they increased their share of us exports from 126 in 1985 to 237 in 2006 and their share of us imports rose from 164 in 1985 to 325 in 2006 until recently the four socalled east asian newlyindustrialized economies nies hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan had been an important contributor to this growth but their influence is declining they accounted for 75 of us exports and 113 of us imports in 1985 and 94 of us exports and 59 of us imports in 2006 the shares of us trade accounted for by the 10 members of asean were growing in crs4 the 1980s and early 1990s but are also in decline2 their shares of us exports had been as high as 68 and of imports as high as 84 in 1995 they declined to 55 of exports and 60 of imports in 2006 among east asian economies and developing economies in general china has made by far the most significant impact on us trade during the last twenty years it accounted for 18 of us exports in 1985 and 53 in 2006 for 11 of us imports in 1985 and 155 in 2006 the trends suggest that the patterns of us trade with east asia are shifting from the east asian nies and asean to china india huge asian economy accounts for only small part of us trade 09 of us exports and 11 of us imports level of shares that has not changed appreciably over the past two decades latin america has also increased in importance accounting for 140 of us exports in 1985 and 215 in 2006 and for 136 of us imports in 1985 increasing to 179 in 2006 however the shift is largely the result of mexicos surge as us trade partner in 1985 62 of us exports went to mexico share that rose to 129 in 2006 similarly the share of us imports coming from mexico increased from 55 in 1985 to 107 in 2006 among the regional groups the african countries particularly those of sub saharan africa have largely stagnated in importance as us trading partners in 1985 us exports to subsaharan africa accounted for 17 of total us exports in 1985 and for 12 in 2006 in 1985 us imports from the subsaharan african countries increased modestly as share of total us imports from 28 in 1985 to 32 in 2006 however 81 of us imports from subsaharan africa is oil mostly from nigeria and angola the united nations identifies 50 countries as the poorest countries or least developed countries ldcs this group many of them located in africa have consistently accounted for very small shares of us trade in 1985 they accounted for 11 of us exports and 08 of us imports and in 2005 for 06 of us exports and 13 of us imports the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec are another important subcategory of developing countries their shares of us trade have remained fairly constant with shares of us imports reaching high of 79 in 2006 but largely dependent on world oil prices their share of us exports declined from 50 in 1985 to 39 in 2006 us exports to developing countries are dispersed over range of product categories primarily manufactured goods electronic products computers and components and autos and parts for agricultural exporters developing countries are significant market in 2006 they bought 56 of total us agricultural exports 2 the members of asean association of southeast asian nations are brunei cambodia indonesia laos malaysia myanmar burma philippines singapore thailand and vietnam crs5 the leading us imports from developing countries are crude oil electrical machinery and computers and components3 the product composition of us trade changes somewhat depending on the subgroup of developing countries in 2006 more than 60 of us imports from the ldcs were oil more than 70 came from angola other leading us imports from the ldcs consisted of textiles and apparel with agricultural products and natural resources much further behind in contrast more than 90 of us imports from the more advanced newly industrializing economies of east asia consisted of more technologyadvanced products such as electrical machinery other machinery and cars4 the trade patterns between the united states and the advanceddeveloping countries suggest intraindustry trade and trade where the developing countries are part of international production supply chain developing countries have not made the same inroads in terms of us foreign investment as they have us trade in 2005 latest data available 72 of us foreign direct investment went to australia canada europe and japan the latin american countries accounted for 8 the middle east for 1 and asia for 9 developing countries are even much less important source of foreign direct investment in the united states fdius in 2005 europe canada japan and australia accounted for 93 of these investments the developing countries of asia account for 1 and other developing countries and some carribean islands accounted for the remainder5 developing countries and world trade developing country trends in trade with the united states are mirrored in the trends

latest data available they increased their shares of world exports from 254 to 335 and their shares of world imports from 232 to 304 however the data also show that not all groups of developing countries have experienced the same level of economic integration the east asian countries have been the leaders with the four east asian nies among the primary drivers of trade growth in the region their shares of world exports climbed from 58 to 97 but had been as high as at 103 in 2000 before declining and their shares of world imports increased as well from 53 to 90 although they had reached as high as 106 in 1995 similarly the ten aseanmember countries have experienced robust trade growth with their shares of world exports having risen from 37 to 61 and their shares of world imports having grown from 33 to 54 from 1985 to 2004 however chinas emergence on the world trade scene has overshadowed the others with the fastest pace of world trade growth in 1985 chinas share of world exports and imports stood at 14 and 21 respectively and 64 and 61 respectively in 2004 crs7 other categories of developing countries have exhibited less robust trade growth other asian countries have not faired as well as the east asian countries for example indias shares of world exports and imports have remained virtually unchanged during the period according to the data in table 2 the shares of world trade of the latin american countries as group have also remained virtually stagnant during the period although mexicos shares have grown modestly the african countries particularly the subsaharan african countries have fared the worst of all as group their rate of participation in world trade has been low and has been declining in 1985 the subsaharan african shares of world exports and imports stood at 26 and 21 respectively but at 16 and 14 in 2004 causes of the trends specialists and other observers have cited range of reasons for the disparity in the rates of developing countries participation in trade the most successful developing countries have adopted policies of economic integration with the rest of the world with an emphasis on exportled growth the east asian countries are the most vivid example the four east asian nies are largely credited with launching these efforts in the 1970swhich resulted in their economies taking off in the 1980s and continuing to grow in the 1990s albeit with some bumps along the way other east asian countries have followed for example thailand and malaysia china is the most recent and largest example of an economy that has moved to become more integrated in the world economy such cases are not confined to east asia chile and mexico have emerged as successful exportoriented economies india has also recently undertaken economic reforms to become more integrated with the rest of the world among the less successful developing countries are ones that have followed import substitution economic development strategies of discouraging imports by imposing high tariffs and other trade barriers and trying to develop domestic production of all goods these policies have proved to be highly costly and have inhibited economic growth6 analysts have also concluded that the most successful developing economies are those that have built successful manufacturing sectors while number of the less successful countries are highly dependent on the production of primary goods such as food agricultural products and natural resources the 50 ldcs are dependent on average on just three primary commodities for 70 of their total exports some ldcs are dependent on single commodity for their exports this is matter of concern because commodity markets tend to be very volatile in addition commodities account for decreasing shares of world trade making it more difficult for commoditydependent countries to gain foothold in world trade7 6 spero joan edelman and jeffrey hart the politics of international economic relations st martins press new york 1996 p 231234 7 an oecd study points out that primary commodities such as food and raw materials are income inelastic that is as national incomes rise countrys population spends declining share of its income on them in addition raw materials account for declining share of production oecd the development dimensions of trade paris 2001 p 134 crs8 furthermore many of the least developed countries do not have the sufficient infrastructure customs offices and procedures transportation facilities communications infrastructure to conduct large amounts of trade the adjustment costs from trade liberalization might also be too great for smaller less diversified economies some developed countries have responded with tradecapacity building assistance as part of efforts to promote trade liberalization and economic growth in these countries8 us trade policy toward developing countries us trade policy toward developing countries is evolving for many years the policy largely consisted of trade preference programs extended conditionally and unilaterally to various groups of developing countries while those programs are still in place us trade policy is clearly shifting with successive presidential administrations the bush administration especially has negotiated bilateral and regional reciprocal trade agreements with decided emphasis on trade with developing countries observers have also pointed out that us trade policy toward developing countries is ambiguous on the one hand encouraging trade liberalization through trade preference programs and free trade agreements while on the other hand applying high import tariffs on products in which developing countries are more likely to have comparative advantage laborintensive goods and semi finished goods that contain raw materials us trade preference programs us trade preference programs have been important vehicles for us trade policy toward developing countries these programs also reflect the ambiguity of us policy the generalized system of preferences the broadest and oldest program is the generalized systems of preferences gsp the us gsp program was first enacted on january 1 1976 as part of an effort to encourage economic growth in developing countries by extending preferences in the form of low or tariffs on the imports from certain developing countries the program was partially in response to developing countries criticism that high tariffs on their products prevented their producers from competing on world markets originally considered temporary 10year program us gsp has been renewed on eight occasions most recently through december 31 2008 in section 8802 of pl 109432 while covering broad spectrum of products of developing countries the statutory authority for the gsp program requires countrybeneficiaries to adhere to number of criteria among them protection of specified labor rights and protection of intellectual property rights in addition the statute provides for the graduation of countries that exceed per capita income level and the graduation of products that exceed competitiveneed limits also certain importsensitive goods are excluded 8 for more analysis of the trade capacity building program see crs report rl33628 trade capacity building foreign assistance for trade and development danielle langton crs9 from coverage including some watches footwear glass products and electronic products9 some critics of the program have charged that the exclusions limit the programs effectiveness by disqualifying laborintensive products which make up the major part of the production profile of beneficiary countries as evidence they point out that only small portion of imports from beneficiary countries enters the united states under gsp in 2005 for example only 96 of us imports from gspeligible countries entered the united states under the gsp program10 see table 3 below another criticism of the us gsp program has been that only few countries have been able to take advantage of its benefits in 2005 839 of gspcovered imports were from only 10 countries11 it is also important to note that gsp has automatic competitive need limits cnl for beneficiary developing countries bdcs but not for leastdeveloped bdcs or level above which the preference is longer extended absent cnl waiver while the other preference programs have such limits this is an important distinction between it and the other preference programs and is perhaps one of the reasons that the percentage of total trade entering under gsp although the broadest program has remained relatively static and that the preference may be used less than the others table 3 us imports from gsp beneficiary countries 2005 millions of dollars 1 total imports 278029 2 mfn

united states extends tariff preferences that go beyond preferences under gsp to certain imports from 24 eligible countries in the caribbean region the original program went into effect on january 1 1984 and was due to expire on september 30 1995 it was revised and made permanent under the caribbean basin economic recovery act of 1990 pl101382 furthermore the congress enacted the caribbean basin trade partnership act cbtpa on may 18 2000 pl 106200 to respond to the devastation wrought by hurricanes georges and mitch in 1998 the cbtpa provides for more trade preferences on more extensive range of imports from the region including textiles and apparel but is scheduled to end on september 30 2008 or on the date that the free trade area of the americas agreement is completed whichever is earlier table 6 below provides data on the impact of the cbi and cbtpa programs in us trade in 2005 the data indicate that the cbtpa has added substantially to the tariff preferences for us trading partners in the region the significance of cbicbtpa will diminish as the drcafta see discussion below is implemented since the larger cbi beneficiaries are participants in that arrangement crs12 table

united states entered into its first bilateral free trade agreement fta in 1985 with israel and into its largest fta in 1994 with canada and mexico the north american free trade agreement nafta while the united states launched fta negotiations with three countries during the clinton administration jordan chile and singapore us interest in ftas has surged under the bush administration as part of its competition in liberalization trade strategy15 in addition agreements have been signed but not entered into force with oman colombia and peru negotiations with panama have been completed but an agreement has not yet been signed negotiations are underway with south korea and malaysia they were launched with members of the south african customs union sacu thailand ecuador and the united arab emirates uae but are now dormant of the seven ftas that have entered into force since 2001 only one agreement has been with nondeveloping country australia in terms of trade with developing countries the emphasis on ftas signifies decided shift in us policy and strategy from unilateral trade preferences to reciprocal agreements for developing countries ftas provide the opportunity to negotiate for greater access to us markets and provide forum to raise concerns about us trade policy and practices for example antidumping practices similarly the united states has been seeking increased market access in developing countries reduced barriers to foreign investment especially in financial services and 15 along with australia 2005 the united states and entered into bilateral ftas with jordan 2001 singapore 2004 chile 2004 morocco 2006 and bahrain 2006 it has also signed the drcafta with the dominican republic and five central american countries to date the agreements with salvador 2006 honduras 2006 nicaragua 2006 and guatemala 2006 have gone into effect while the implementation of agreements with costa rica and the dominican republic are pending crs13 professional services and greater protection of intellectual property rights ipr both the united states and its trade agreement partners have used the ftas also to achieve noncommercial foreign policy objectives such as solidifying alliances ftas are reciprocal agreements meaning that the partners negotiate on an equal basis at least ostensibly consequently while the united states has demanded that developing trade countries improve ipr protection as condition for preferential treatment in its market some developing country partners have demanded increased access for textiles and apparel or other markets deemed sensitive by us policymakers as condition for preferential treatment for us exporters critics have argued that the united states needs to shift the emphasis of ftas from developing countries to larger trade partners such as japan and the eu where the benefits of ftas might be greater the united states also employs bilateral and regional trade and investment framework agreements tifas with number of developing countries under tifa the participating countries agree to establish council as forum to discuss ways to facilitate mutual trade and investment in some cases tifa is considered step toward launching fta negotiations world trade organization wto the united states has promoted developing countries membership and participation in the wto along with increasing trade flows many developing countries have been exerting stronger political influence in the wto of the 150 wto members 107 or 71 are developing countries because of wto rules of procedures the developing countries are able to exert institutionally disproportionally larger degree of influence in the wto than their participation in world trade flows might dictate the wto makes decisions by consensus which means that any one membercountry can block decision developing countries participation in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gattwto has evolved over time up until the 1990s most developing countries did not consider gatt to be an institution that would be sympathetic to their economic concerns and they largely worked through organizations16 for that matter the highly protectionist trade policies that many developing countries were following would not have been congruent with gatt principles and rules fostering trade liberalization developing countries increased their activity most noticeably during the uruguay round 19861994 as they began to put their imprint on agreements that emerged from the round including the establishment of the wto this trend matched the economic restructuring that many developing countries were undertaking to integrate their economies with the rest of the world and that is reflected in their growing shares of world and us trade the developing countries voice in the wto has never been stronger than in the doha development agenda round and in events leading up to the launch of that 16 michalopoulos constantine developing countries in the wto palgrave new york 2001 pp 2 152153 crs14 round in late 1999 the wto trade ministers had gathered in seattle for the third wto ministerial and their main agenda item was to reach agreement on the launching of new round of wto negotiations however the large group of developing countries themselves rather diverse and promoting different agendas had nevertheless united against the scope and content of proposed new round the seattle meeting collapsed and some experts assert the concerns of the developing countries not being addressed was an important factor in that failed meeting developing countries were especially concerned that the mechanism for establishing the agenda for the round did not allow them sufficient opportunity to promote issues of interest to them17 the negotiations were eventually launched at the fourth ministerial in november 2001 in doha qatar as the doha development agenda italics added round to reflect the intention of the wto members to focus on the concerns of developing countries the negotiations moved very slowly at the fifth ministerial in cancun they came to standstill when the members could not agree on how to proceed among the major participants was the g20 group of developing countries led by brazil and india at cancun and since that meeting the g20 has emerged as major force on par with the united states and the eu in setting the agenda and pace of the negotiations18 one of the problems of wto participation for many developing countries is that it is costly to initiate and carry through with disputes in the wto issues in us trade with developing countries the emergence of developing countries as an important factor in us trade has generated range of policy issues that while not unique to developing countries arise more often in us trade with them the issues described below do not constitute an exhaustive list but nevertheless represent the most prevalent issues that have emerged in us bilateral and multilateral negotiations with developing countries some of the issues are developing country challenges to the united states that is changes to us laws and practices others are us challenges to developing countries the issues generally cut across us trade relations with most developing countries at all levels of economic development labor rights and wages perhaps issue has dominated debate on us trade policy over the past decade more than the role of trade liberalization in employment and wages the issue results from the increased role of us trade with lowerwage developing countries and the concern that us workers are forced to compete in race to the bottom as us companies are induced to close down or to reduce the wages of or lay off workers 17 ibid p 3 18 bhagwati jaddish from seattle to hong kong foreign affairs

south africa thailand and venezuela crs15 and move production facilities to lowerwage countries labor and trade as an issue has gained more attention recently as economic studies have focused on the growing income gap in the united states that is even though the us economy continues to grow robustly more of the rewards from that growth are going to more highlypaid workers to higherincome households and to multinational corporations many economists attribute the growing gap to advances in technology that improve labor productivity and increase demand for highskilled labor while diminishing demand for lowskilled labor they also attribute modest role to trade liberalization and globalization19 other economists attribute larger role to increased trade with low wage labor countries and the emergence of large pools of lowwage labor in china and india that cause compression of wages in developed countries including the united states one study shows that over the past twenty years income inequality in the united states has been rising suggesting correlation with the rise in trade with developing countries in addition they point to more intraindustry trade between the united states and developing countries where us companies shift production to countries with lower wage labor20 trade policy responses and proposals in the united states have varied for example some observers argue that trade plays limited role if at all in employment and wages and therefore trade policy response is required others have suggested that the government should provide safety net to workers who lose their jobs or experience decrease in wages because of trade this safety net might be in the form of an enhanced trade adjustment assistance taa program or wage insurance others have proposed that the united states needs to boost the level of education to better prepare us workers to compete in the global economy some members of congress have argued that lower wages persist in developing countries in part because of the lack of labor rights protection and have called for enforceable internationallyaccepted labor standards to be part of us trade agreements with the governments of developing countries developing countries on the other hand consider demands for labor rights provisions in trade agreements as form of protectionism they argue that their workers wages are lower because their economies have an abundance of unskilled labor and that low wages reflect the lower level of economic development this issue will likely be part of the expected debate over the renewal of the trade promotion authorityfast track procedures during the 110th congress and debate over implementing bills for ftas21 19 see for example the federal reserve board remarks by chairman ben s bernanke before the greater omaha chamber of commerce omaha nebraska february 6 2007 httpwwwfederalreservegov 20 see for example roach stephen s special economic study the politicization of the

administration have made foreign government protection of the rights of us holders of copyrights trademarks and patents priority in trade negotiations and trade agreements including ftas while not exclusively an issue with developing countries the problem primarily occurs with those countries because they have not developed sufficient body of laws or do not adequately enforce the laws they do have us producers of ip products argue that they not only lose revenues because of the sale of pirated products but also lose control over the quality of the product that bears their brand name or trademark developing countries argue that they do not have the infrastructure to combat piracy and that legally produced goods would be prohibitively expensive for their residents to produce or sell each year the office of the united states trade representative issues special 301 report that identifies trading partners that fail to protect usorigin ipr22 of the 13 countries that the ustr placed on its priority watch list 11 were developing countries and the other two were former soviet states23 access to affordable medicines for many developing countries especially the ldcs access to affordable medicines to combat infectious diseases hivaids tuberculosis malaria and others has been major issue in their trade relations with the united states and other developed countries they claim that the prices demanded by pharmaceutical companies are beyond the means of those in need the pharmaceutical companies respond that the high costs are required for the companies to recoup the research and development costs they have incurred some pharmaceutical companies have made their drugs available to developing countries that face health emergencies but have done so largely on an ad hoc basis in december 2005 wto members adopted as an amendment to the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips agreement provision allowing the use of compulsory licenses for the production of generic pharmaceuticals for certain infectious diseases where the developing country lacks the domestic capacity to manufacture those medicines in essence it allows developing country facing health crisis to issue compulsory license for the production of generic drug in third country that has the production capacity and then to import that medicine the provision allows for compensation for the patent holder and restricts the use of the medicine for domestic use and for limited period of time however for various reasons use of the system of compulsory licenses has 22 special 301 refers to statutory requirement under section 182 of the trade act of 1974 as amended that the ustr annually identify those countries that are the egregious offenders of denying ipr protection and against which the united states could take action in practice the ustr has also identified countries which do not fit the category of most egregious offenders but bare serious monitoring on its annual priority watch list and those that require less serious watching 23 the 13 countries were china russia argentina belize brazil egypt india indonesia israel lebanon turkey ukraine and venezuela crs17 been modest and developing countries have complained that developed countries are not putting the procedures in place for it to be used24 tariffs and nontariff barriers developing countries raise the issue of high us tariff and nontariff barriers on products in which they have comparative advantage for example textiles and apparel and certain agricultural products they claim that these barriers limit their ability to export to the us market particularly developing countries cite high tariffs on textiles and apparel one study points out that 627 of the value of apparel imports from developing countries face peak us tariffs tariffs of 10 or greater wearing apparel production is largely laborintensive and therefore advantageous for many developing countries with an abundance of lowwage labor to produce and export25 developing countries have raised this issue during bilateral negotiations on free trade agreements26 developing countries frequently complain about high us tariffs nontariff barriers and subsidies on some agricultural products us quotas and high outof quota tariffs on sugar have been an issue in us fta negotiations with sugar producing developing countries27 one study has estimated that tariffs quotas and subsidies provide us agricultural producers with the protection equivalent to an average tariff of 199 the study also notes that the united states is by means the most protectionist in this category as the tariff equivalents for other industrialized countries are much higher canada 523 european union 464 and japan 82128 at the same time the united states asserts that developing countries maintain high tariffs and nontariff barriers on some agricultural products and manufactured goods and barriers to trade in services such as banking insurance and professional services the united states has pressed the developing countries to reduce these barriers that could offer expanded markets for us exporters but also improve the efficiency of developing economies 24 for more information see crs report rl33750 the wto intellectual property rights and the access to medicines controversy by ian f fergusson 25 cline william r

the united states and other developed countries initiate against their products are protectionist and unduly affect them number of developing countries are part of an informal group in the wto called friends of antidumping in the doha development agenda round they have proposed that developed countries extend special and differential treatment to developing countries when initiating antidumping actions against their products such as raising the minimis threshold for ad action that is the level of dumping below which action is to be taken29 developing countries have also raised the issue with the united states as part of fta negotiations pressing for special treatment under the ftas south korea has been doing so congress has gone on record opposing any agreement that weakens antidumping laws or any other us trade remedy statute this position is contained in statute authorizing trade promotion authorityfast track as principal negotiating objective to preserve the ability of the united states to enforce rigorously its trade laws including the antidumping countervailing duty and safeguard laws and avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines on unfair trade 30 rather strong bipartisan consensus in congress supports this principle the bush administration allowed the possibility of changes in trade remedy laws to be put on the table in the doha development agenda arguing that doing so was necessary in order to get developing countries to launch the negotiations many members of congress have criticized this step effectiveness of trade preference programs many developing countries argue that while trade preference programs such as gsp are wellmeaning on the surface in practice they do not provide much benefit because of exceptions made for importsensitive products these products tend to be ones in which developing countries have or could have comparative advantage for example us law prohibits gsp coverage for certain textile and apparel watches importsensitive electronic products import sensitive steel articles footwear leather apparel and importsensitive manufactured glass products developing countries also argue that benefits of tariff preference programs are eroding because the united states and other developed countries have been entering into free trade agreements that eliminate tariffs among fta partners in addition various rounds of multilateral negotiations under the gatt and wto have lowered tariffs for all members and thus have been eroding the effectiveness of trade preference programs for developing countries 29 for more information on the antidumping issue in the wto see crs report rl32810 wto antidumping issues in the doha development agenda by vivian c jones 30 trade act of 2002 section 2102b14 crs19 trends and policy implications developing countries have become an increasingly significant factor in us trade over the last two or more decades and this influence is reflected in the issues on the trade agenda of the 110th congress the possible renewal of trade promotion authority tpa or fast track trade authority implementing legislation for ftas reauthorization of trade adjustment assistance taa for workers and firms review and possible reauthorization of gsp and other trade preference programs oversight of the doha development agenda dda round negotiations in the wto and other issues the growth of developing countries foreign trade presents the united states with opportunities and challenges the imports from many developing economies provide us consumers with an ever widening range of choices of products at lower prices raising real incomes and contributing to higher us standard of living number of the developing countries have also become robust markets for us exports at the same time us workers are competing with growing pool of lower wage labor from india china and other developing countries some usbased firms are induced to use laborsaving technology to move production offshore or to shut down their operations completely even workers in the services sector such as computer programmers are feeling the pressures of competition from some developing countries many economists argue however that in the long run that trade affects the composition of jobs but not employment levels trade with developing countries also raises set of virtually unique issues regarding labor rights environment protection and intellectual property rights among others that have become fixtures on the us trade agenda at the same time developing countries are challenging us trade policies on trade remedies high tariffs on wearing apparel and other importsensitive products pricing of medicines and the temporary entry of foreign workers among other issues if current trade trends hold developing countries can be expected to account for increasing shares of us exports and imports and of world trade as result these opportunities and challenges will likely continue if not expand the analysis of us trade trends also exposes significant divide among groups of developing countries some countries such as those in east asia mexico and chile have made great strides and are expanding their role in us and world trade others including most of africa many countries in south asia and some in latin america lag behind or are losing shares of us and world trade these differences suggest that an effective us trade policy needs to differentiate among the various groups of developing countries these differences could play role in how the united states proceeds on trade preferences regional and bilateral trade agreements and multilateral negotiations in the wto for other versions of this document see
