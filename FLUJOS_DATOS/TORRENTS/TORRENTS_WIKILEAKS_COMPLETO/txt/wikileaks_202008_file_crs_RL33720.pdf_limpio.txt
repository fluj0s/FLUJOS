divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33720imports of canadian waste summary private waste haulers and canadian cities including the city of toronto ship large quantities of waste to the unite d states about four million tons as many as 400 truckloads day have been shipped annually since 2004 according to receiving states nearly threequarters of this waste has gone to two large landfills near detroit the influx of waste has been highly cont roversial in part because the ability of state and local governments to restrict it is limited under court rulings concerning the us constitutions commerce clause only congress can authorize restrictions that discriminate against foreign waste thus for several years the state of michigan and the michigan congressional delega tion have pressed congress for action legislation to provide limite d authority to restrict waste imports hr 518 was introduced early in the 110th congress by representative dingell with the co sponsorship of the entire michigan delega tion the bill was reported by the energy and commerce committee march 29 and passed the house by voice vote april 24 2007 congress began to focus on this issue in the summer of 2006 in july of that year in the department of homeland security appropriations bill hr 5441 the senate approved the tablishment of an inspection program for waste imports that might have added more than 400 in fees to the cost of importing truckload of waste in early september the house passed legislation simila r to hr 518 hr 2491 in the 109th congress which would have given states limited authority to restrict waste imports in between these actions an agreement was reached between michigans two senators and the ontario ministry of the environment under which ontario will eliminate shipments of municipally managed waste to michigan by the end of 2010 the steps taken by congress in beginni ng to move legislation as well as separate legislation enacted by the state of michigan clearly played role in bringing about the voluntary agreement between mich igans two senators and ontario but large issues remain the agreement is not treaty or an international agreement so it does not formally bind the united states or canada or the pa rties shipping and receiving the waste assuming that its provisions are adhered to by ontarios waste managers it still would not address twothirds of the waste being shipped to michigan ie the waste being managed by private waste management firms and it would not affect waste shipments to states other than michigan this report provides

animal and plant health inspection service of the us department of agriculture aphis required in cineration of all foreign garbage shipped to the united states to prevent foreign pests and diseases from harming us agricultural production canadian waste was exempted from this requirement in july 1991 when aphis decided that it did not have the legal aut hority to prevent the importation of canadian garbage or to require its incineration becau there was biological basis for these restrictions the amount of ca nadian waste shipped to the ited states increased at least fivefold following

similar requirements for municipal solid waste5 but for lack of legislative authority the amendment was never implemented6 it is these unregulated shipments of non hazardous waste principally municipal solid waste that have proven controversial lacking notification or consent requirements for msw many state governments do require the operators of solid waste management facilities to report the origin of waste they have received for disposal after the fact on quarterly or an annual basis according to these data entities in the canadian province of ontario have shipped major quantities of waste principally msw and cd waste to the united states in recent years waste import data state waste reporting requirements are not uniform the reporting periods vary as do the methods used by states

restrict imports of waste in 1992 however in fort gratiot sanitary landfill v michigan dnr waste import restrictions authorized by the state were held unconstitutional by the us supreme court12 under article i section 8 of the us constitution congress is given power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in long series of cases beginning in the 1800s the court has held that this grant of authority to congress implies prohibition of state actions to discriminate against interstate and foreign commerce absent the consent of congress recent developments providing congressional consent is the goal of numerous bills that have been introduced in congress hr 2491hr 518 in the 109th congress the most prominent of these bills was hr 2491 gillmor which was reported by the house energy and

th bilateral uscanada wa ste trade agreement as amended in 1992 to deal with municipal solid waste shipments between the two countries it would require the epa adminis trator to perform the functions of the designated authority under the agreement nd require him to imp lement and enforce the agreements notice and consent requirements in considering whether to consent to waste importation the epa administrator would be required in the words of the bill to give substantial weight to the views of the state or states into which the municipal solid waste is to be importe d and consider the views of the local government with jurisdiction over the loca tion where the waste is to be disposed the administrator would also be required to consider the impact of the importation on continued public support for and adherence to state and local recycling programs landfill capacity and air emissions and road deterioration from increased vehicular traffic and to consider the impact of the importation on homeland security public health and the environment the bill would also authorize states to restrict imports of foreign msw provided they do so prior to the bilatera l agreements

amended by the senate july 13 2006 also contained provisions that would have discouraged canadian waste imports an amendment submitted by senator stabenow for herself senator levin and senator baucus provided for inspections of internationa l shipments of msw and required the secretary of homeland security to levy fee to cover the approximate cost of such inspections14 in floor statement senator stabenow explained the effect of the amendment as follows based on information provided by the inspector general of the department of homeland security we know that it will take four customs agents about 4 hours for each trash truck inspection based on personnel and administrative costs we estimate that the fee for each trash truck will be approximately 42015 separate amendment introduced by nator levin with the cosponsorship of senators stabenow and voinovich and so approved in the senate by unanimous consent would have required that the secr etary of homeland security deny entry into the united states to trucks carrying msw unless he certifies to congress that the methodologies and technologies used by the bureau of customs and border protection to detect the presence of che mical nuclear biologi cal and radiological weapons in municipal solid waste are as ffective as those used to screen for such materials in other items of commerce entering the united states in commercial

fy2007 shipments of solid waste from ontario to michigan declined for the first time since fy199920 the steps taken by congress in beginning to move legislation as well as the separate legislation enacted by the state of michigan clearly played role in bringing about the exchange of letters with ontario but large issues remain remaining issues issues remaining to be addressed include some posed by the exchange of letters and others posed by hr 518 issues posed by the exchange of letters the agreement reached by the two mich igan senators in their exchange of letters with ontarios minister of the environment would address portion of the waste shipped from ontario to michigan but it would not eliminate the majority of it the letters refer to municipally managed waste and specifically use 2005 baseline amount of 134 million tonnes21 of municipal waste shipped22 accompanying materials from the ministry of the environment however note thatin 2005 4 million tonnes of waste were exporte d to the us with 90 of this waste being sent to michigan landfills 23 thus ontarios commitment appears to cover only onethird of the waste shipped from the province to the united states or 37 of the waste it shipped to michigan the reason for excluding the majority of the waste is that it is not municipally managed it is waste collected by private haulers and shipped to michiganhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33720crs7 landfills under private contracts these wastes are shipped to michigan either because it provides lower cost disposal op tions or because the landfills in michigan are controlled by the same company that collects the waste in canada the provincial government and the local g overnments within the province have authority to prevent these private waste shipments from leaving ontario thus the province has committed to eliminate what it can ie that portion of the waste that is municipally managed second the exchange of letters addresses the shipment of these wastes to michigan but not to other us states given the subsequent action by the toronto city council it would appear that when th waste is diverted from michigan it will be shipped to site in ontario but nothi ng in the letters would prevent the waste being shipped to other us landfills instead of those in michigan third the exchange of letters repres ents voluntary good faith commitments by the parties it is not treaty or an inte rnational agreement nd does not provide the enforcement provisions or penalties that legislation might offer to summarize those who continue to be concerned about canadian waste shipments are likely to note that the exchange of letters does not address twothirds of the waste being shipped does not protect states other than michigan and contains enforcement provisions addressing th issues would require congressional action issues posed by hr 518 hr 518 by contrast would apply to pr ivate contracts would apply to all 50 states and would provide for enforcement the bill would clarify that actions taken under its authority shall not be consider ed to impose an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce and thus would be immune to challenge under the commerce clause of the constitution but the effect of the bill might still be certain in section 4011a3 it states nothing in this section affects replaces or amends prior law relating to the need for consistency with international trade obligations the bill thus appears to recognize that us trade agreements would have ro to play in defining the scope of the states authority to act pursuant to the legislation it is not clear how these obligations and the bills grant of authority to the states to restrict waste imports would ultimately be reconciled opponents of the b ill including the national solid wastes management association which represents the us waste management industry have already made clear their inte ntion to challenge its provisions in court if it is enacted this issue would presumably be among the provisions litigated
