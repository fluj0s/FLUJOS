knezo specialist in science and technology resources science and industry division open access publishing and citation archives background and controversy summary controversies about open access publishing and archiving confront issues of copyright and governmental competition with the private sector traditional publishers typically charge readers subscriber fees to fund the costs of publishing and distributing hardcopy andor online journals in contrast most open access systems charge authors publication fees and give readers free online access to the full text of articles supporters of the open access movement object to the rising costs of journal subscriptions share peer reviewers reluctance to do free reviews for journals rapidly escalating in price and believe that scientific collaboration advancement and utilization will be hastened by free access to information traditional subscriberpays commercial publishers and some scholarly associations object to most open access publishing because it may weaken the publishing industry and erode profits critics seek to limit free governmentrun repositories only to articles and citations from federally sponsored research others oppose fees in the thousands of dollars charged to authors to pay the costs of publishing articles or view as unreliable foundation donations that sustain some open access activities in response to congressional action in 2004 and 2005 the national institutes of health nih implemented policy that requires authors it funds to voluntarily submit copies of their manuscripts to nihs free access electronic database pubmed central pmc as soon as possible after journal accepts the article for publication but within 12 months the policy allows publisherimposed embargo or delay before allowing free public access to the manuscript many publishers oppose this policy and there is only about 4 compliance rate by grantees in september 2006 nih publicized procedures to permit publishers to post manuscripts or articles directly to pmc and to give nih free access to some articles for the embargo period in the 109th congress report language on hr 3010 signed as pl 109149 endorsed nihs

histories of the growth of open access publishing and citation archives and descriptions of selected major open access activities it moves on to summarize major points of difference between proponents and opponents of nongovernmental open access publishing and databases and then highlights federal including national institutes of health nih open access activities and contentious issues surrounding these developments the report also briefly describes open access developments in the united kingdom where number of governmental and nongovernmental initiatives have occurred and in the international arena finally controversial issues which could receive attention the 110th congress are summarized definitions of open access publishing and database models the open access movement is said to have begun in 19661 the term describes variety of activities that includes access to archives of indexed citations of articles access to separate journal articles that were published in traditional subscriberpays journals and access to free online journals2 according to may 23 1 with the inception of educational resources information center eric launched by the us department of educations office

available for instance see open access bibliography liberating scholarly continued crs2 2005 wall street journal articlecurrently the openaccess movement makes up between 1 and 2 of the market experts say while that number seems small the concept is assuming an important role channeling academic discontent about the rising costs of journals3 in traditional subscriberpays publishing the publisher who holds the copyright to an article pays most printing and distribution costs and in order to read an article the journal subscriber pays fees whether for hardcopy or online versions sometimes an author is required to pay printing page charges for complex graphics or color presentations open access publishing generally means that the author or publisher who holds the copyright to an article grants all users unlimited free access to and license to copy and distribute work published in an open access journal which may be published initially electronically or in hardcopy users can also make copies for their personal use if authorship is properly attributed4 open access publishing often requires an author to pay for publishing or posting of paper estimates of fees charged vary but generally range from about 500 to 4000 these charges may be paid by individual authors or by institutions pursuant to institutional subscription contracts with open access journals that cover publication charges for all authors affiliated with that institution typically open access publishers require that complete version of the work and related materials be deposited electronically in an online database that permits open access distribution interoperability allowing users to extract and use the data in other research and longterm archiving5 in free access publishing neither an author nor reader pays for articles to be published or posted on the internet6 but other open access features may not be mandatory few commercial publishers have adopted some open access features in their business models however the fundamental difference is that traditional publishers 2 continued literature with eprints and open access journals information is available at

published articles in an open access repository or database or on the authors own website the scope of open access repositories or archives varies some contain published journal articles or nonpublished grey literature in all fields of science or in specific scientific disciplines some archive specific researchers preprints articles or research reports or as in the case of the national

ploss journals include plos biology plos medicine plos computational biology plos genetics and plos pathogens7 plos seeks to launch journals in other disciplines it has the goal of publishing highly selective topquality articles competitive with the quality of articles in traditional subscriberpays journals like science and nature different from traditional subscriberpays publishing which requires authors to cede copyright to the publisher authors who publish in plos retain copyright to an article but are required to deposit copy of the article in an open access online repository that

immediate access to free selected fulltext research articles and materials from the three organizations websites which provide links to different types of published materials according to the group the initiative is being driven by recent trends indicating that public awareness of clinical research heightened by media coverage and fueled by the spread of broadband internet has led more and more patients to go online to find the latest information about treatment options15 nihs decision to launch its system reportedly accelerated the formation of patientinform after period of evaluation the group will determine whether to expand its focus past the three initial diseases into rarer conditions16 this system may not permit permanent access to materials on it since the organizations maintaining the website may overtime replace or remove materials posted illustrations of academicrelated systems some universities ensure that their scholars publications are available online in free

university of california system was launched in the fall of 2003 it is an electronic searchable repository that makes freely available an archive of the publications and other media and some research databases of university of california researchers the vehicle is also used to disseminate the universitys own open access peer reviewed published journals17 supporters of systems like this say that indexing materials improves access to them and if full text is available widens reader access and improves utilization of federally financed research and development18 14 information is available at

open access systems and policies seem to have outpaced societys ability to design equitable and efficient mechanisms and economic reward structures to manage transitions between traditional and open access publishing and archiving25 there is evidence that greater acceptance of online and open access publishing is forcing traditional journals to address fundamental financial and philosophical challenges26 which has generated heated discussions in the scientific publishing community27 24 see httpcogprintsorg 25 see for instance julie m esanau and paul f uhlir eds open access and the public

inevitable changes in publishing and electronic dissemination of information due to development of the internet29 hastens scientific progress gives access to more readers promotes economic development and in the case of federally funded research provides citizens with ready access to the results of research and development that their taxes funded opponents of open access publishing primarily traditional publishers and major scientific associations cite such issues as the doubtful permanence of electronic archives questions of copyright ownership and reductions to traditional publishers profits costs to researchers who have to pay to have their manuscripts published in open access journals the possibly dubious quality of articles published questions about peer review processing and quality perceptions of the academic community and the academic reward system which appear to give more status to articles published in traditional subscriberpays journals and so forth30 see appendix 1 for list of additional issues raised about the impact of open access publishing on the academic community scholarship and teaching the following sections elaborate on some of these issues journal publishing costs and sources of revenue the costs of publishing journal article include preparing the manuscript for publication initial sorting and selection of manuscripts to be refereed peer review selection editing layout table of contents overhead letters to the editor etc and distribution according to wall street journal story costs for publishing an article typically range from 3000 to

estimated costs for publishing an article in other journals bioscience about 7000 per article nature and new england journal of medicine in excess of 150033 the comparative costs of publishing online only versus traditional journals that print hardcopy are uncertain while some observers say that article processing costs are similar for print and electronic publications other research shows that electronic publishing and distribution are cheaper than hardcopy publishing34 private british funding group reported that research it commissioned showed that author pays open access publishing models are viable alternative to subscription journals and have the potential to serve the scientific community successfully35 specifically open access publishing should be able to deliver highquality peer reviewed research at cost that is significantly less than the traditional model while bringing with it number of additional benefits36 who pays traditional subscriberpays journals traditional publishers usually incur most of the costs of publishing an article revenue comes from subscriptions advertising reprints and in some cases from authors who are asked to subsidize the costs of color printing or printing of complex graphics or page charges for publishing articles in traditional hardcopy journals data for 2004 from study by the kaufmanwillis group which surveyed sources of revenue for traditional and open access publishers indicates that the three largest sources of revenue for traditional journal publishers were subscriptions which provided on average about 70 of total revenue industry support advertising and sponsorship at about 15 for some journals and membership dues at about 8 for others and author fees and charges37 who pays open access journals reportedly most but not

kaufmanwillis group cited above identified the three largest sources of revenue in 2004 for open access journal publishers as industry support advertising and sponsorship at 37 author fees and charges at 30 and grants at 1339 this same study showed that contrary to expectations author fees were charged by larger fraction of traditional subscriberpays journals than openaccess journals40 author fees include charges for color printing page layout page publication charges and so forth this finding in combination with the data on percentage sources of revenue appears to mean that in relation to the total number of publishers traditional publishers more than open access publishers charged fees to authors but the payments as percentage of publishers total revenue were less to traditional publishers than to open access publishers the fees traditional subscriberpays publishers charged to authors were primarily for small changes color views and related items rather than the larger fees open access journals charge authors to publish in the open access journal41 policies for paying publication costs in relation to the future of open access publishing among the issues related to author pays and possibly to the future of open access journals is whether the federal government will continue to allow some research grant funding to be used to pay charges levied on authors or institutions

crs11 funded research this may become more prominent issue if open access publishing becomes larger part of the market now pursuant to ombs guidelines federal agencies that award funds for scientific research permit investigators at universities colleges and nonprofit institutions to charge the costs of publishing scientific article as an allowable direct cost usually paid in full if the funding agency agrees that they are an appropriate part of the project if the costs of publishing are disallowed as direct costs the federal governments likely will pay for these costs as part of facilities and administrative fa indirect costs if the research was federally sponsored and if the journal levies similar charges on all research papers published by the journal42 if the cost is covered as an fa indirect cost full reimbursement may not occur due to limitations on recoveries of some indirect costs some federal agencies have issued policy guidance about allowing as direct cost of project support fees for publication and page charges in order to disseminate reports of the agencys federally funded research results the national science foundation nsf for instance says the proposal budget may request funds for the costs of documenting preparing publishing or otherwise making available to others the findings and products of the work conducted under the grant this generally includes the following types of activities reports reprints page charges or other journal costs except costs for prior or early publication necessary illustrations clean up documentation storage and indexing of data and databases development documentation and debugging of software and storage preservation documentation indexing etc of physical specimens collections or fabricated items43 according to nih the following publication costs are allowed page charges for publication in professional journals are allowable if the published paper reports work supported by the grant and the charges are levied impartially on all papers published by the journal whether or not by government sponsored authors the cost of reprints and publishing in another media such as books monographs and pamphlets also are

include the costs of institutional subscriptions that open access publishers or journals may sell to colleges or universities to cover publication fees for all authors affiliated with specific institution at least one report cautions that some federal agencies may not allow publication costs to be covered 45 harold varmus cofounder of plos considers publishing fees as the final relatively cheap step of research project and contends that the federal government should pay for these costs46 in 2003 the uk wellcome trust large research charity that supports biomedical research in the united kingdom announced its support of online open access journals and said it would allow scientists it funds to use portion of their grant to pay author charges required by the journals47 the usbased howard hughes medical institute allows grantees to use up to an additional 3000 to spend for publishing in open access journals some professional groups have developed or widened policies for author pays publishing allowing free access to readers for example in 2006 the american chemical society and elsevier both of which publish large numbers of scholarly scientific journals announced that they would establish mechanisms permitting authors to pay few thousand dollars to allow their articles to be viewed online for free after publication of the journal48 similarly anticipating the release of many important papers after the 2007 startup of the large hadron collider lhc particle physicists are seeking free access to all articles published in their field in report released in june

most publishing costs are borne by research sponsors such as the federal government and that allowing these sponsors to shift support to pay for open access publishing will not cost more and will provide more benefits to society for instance asking research sponsors to pay for publication of the research they support may seem to impose new financial burdens on the government agencies foundations universities and companies that sponsor research but these organizations already pay most of the costs of scientific publishing huge fraction of the us 9 billion annual revenue of scientific medical and technology journals comes from subscriptions site licenses and publication fees ultimately billed to grants or employers much of the rest is borne by society in the form of increments to university tuitions healthcare costs including drug prices and state and federal taxes that subsidize healthcare libraries and education surely the cost of open access digital publishing cannot in total be more than we are already paying under the subscription and licensing model by simply changing the way we support the scientific publishing enterprise the scientific community and public would preserve everything we value in scientific publishing and gain all of the benefits of open access51 in opposition some say if the government paid such costs money would be diverted inappropriately from research to publishing some universities say their costs will increase if they need to reimburse researchers to pay author fees for open access journals and if they still have to pay high costs for subscriptions to traditional journals52 in addition some young scientistsinvestigators say that business models that force authors to pay for publication in open access journals could hurt them since they often have smaller grants and an authorpays model could amount to tax for productivity 53 another issue is that in some applicationsoriented fields such as medicine engineering computer science management and pharmacy users of journals including open access materials are often private sector parties who read the journals but likely would not be authors who would contribute to journal publication costs as result researchers who produce knowledge would bear disproportionate costs for journal publication54 50 jocelyn kaiser particle physicists want to expand

subscription costs it has been reported that traditional subscriberpays academic publishing has 5 billion global market55 and that one of the leading publishers reed elsevier journals brings in about 16 billion in annual revenue with an operatingprofit margin of about 30 this profit according to the same source could be cut to between 10 to 15 if open access publishing were expanded56 the total scientific and technical journal market has been estimated at 9 billion57 subscription costs vary depending upon the journal and how many journals an institution subscribes to prices also vary for individual versus institutional subscriptions according to one article in october 2003 two scientists at the university of california at san francisco were charged 91000 from elseviers cell press unit for oneyears access to six biology journals58 the university of california in 2003 was reportedly charged 77 million year for subscriptions to 1200 elsevier periodicals which was 25 price reduction from the original bill negotiated after faculty moves to boycott elsevier journals if the original bill price were not reduced59 reportedly sometimes sales are increased by publishers forcing libraries to subscribe to more than they want because publishers often bundle journal subscriptions into large contracts often not well matched with institutional research interests60 this includes bundling together journals that are made available electronically in database systems that access current and archived journals bundling of this sort can force libraries to pay for access to the same journal several times if it is included in more than one database to which the library subscribes61 rising journal subscription costs it is argued are too expensive making it difficult for libraries especially university libraries and the public to afford many journals62 and forcing them to sacrifice spending on other media reportedly rick johnson former director of the scholarly publishing and academic resources coalition sparc said that because of rising costs library spending on print media is shifting from monograph and other materials to support largely journal subscriptions with price per journal reportedly having doubled within 15 years he illustrated this by saying that while the consumer price index increased 64 percent 55 this is the figure for academic market sales and is less than the 9 billion figure cited by brown eisen and varmus op cit possibly because it excludes some sales and consumers 56 wysocki may 23 2005 op cit the profit margin reduction figures according to

are paying 227 percent more for journal subscriptions63 according to national library of medicine nlm report access to biomedical research information prepared for congress in june 2004 prices of commercial biomedical titles increased 224 from 1988 to 1998 while the prices of nonprofit titles increased 12964 the nlm report was quoted as saying that these trends have adversely affected the ability from cost standpoint of academic and health science libraries to continue to support the needs of the research and health care provider communities for access to biomedical literature 65 the current open access movement has been fueled by actions of academics and librarians located at the university of california campuses as well as at other academic sites who in late 2003 and 2004 mounted strenuous objections to increases in costs for subscriptions to scientific journals some demanded 25 reduction in subscription fees from major scientific publishers with reed elsevier often cited as major target and said if fees were not reduced they would relinquish journal editorial board memberships or stop providing free peer reviews for major scientific publishers66 the role of foundation support for open access journals the question as to whether open access journals can exist without subsidies may still be unanswered some observers wonder whether open access journals and archives can be sustained without philanthropic contributions and what will happen if foundation contributions are ever reduced it has been reported that several journals which attempted to provide free access to readers reversed policies due to falling subscription rates and revenues for print journals these journals reportedly included the journal of high energy physics which published online for free for six years it originally did not charge authors fee but ultimately decided to impose subscription fee of about 1000 year for readers67 there is also question of whether if publishing patterns and revenue sources change publishers will obtain enough revenue to be able to risk starting up niche journals in narrow fields of science and which have small readership which many traditional publishers have been able to do given their revenue margins68 63 damon brown open access journals offer new way of publishing journal of the american dietetic association 2004 p 1060 64 as

wysocki may 23 2005 op cit crs16 publishing revenues support scientific societies the point is often made that scientific societies which may publish on their own or may use commercial publishers to publish their journals reap considerable profits from their share of journal revenues they then use these profits to support societies activities which can include advocacy and assistance to new researchers in the field critics of this practice say that these professional associations need to find different business models or alternative ways to raise money to support their activities instead of using publishing profits which are based on payments from subscribers university libraries and in many cases indirect costs of federally funded rd on the other hand revenues to scientific societies may not decrease since at least according to one professional association the rise of online publishing does not reduce subscriptions to print journals for instance according to the american physical society aps which receives journal publishing profits preprints of articles in physics computer science and mathematics are published on arxivorg an open and publicly accessible archive the editorin chief of the american physical society reportedly said that there has been decline in the subscriber base of journals in those disciplines in fact the contrary is true he said he explained aps journals have very liberal copyright policy that gives back to the author the right to post articles on eprint servers even before journal publication they also allow authors to update articles on the servers using the corrected journal form after publication 69 commercial and open access publisher practices proponents of open access have alleged that some traditional publishers practices limit equitable access to scientific information these practices include restrictive licensing terms overriding copyright and fair use practices controls on longterm archival access to electronic content and selective deletions of published articles from database and epublications70 traditional subscriberpays publishers often disagree and say that they are beginning to adopt some features of open access publishing including but not limited to developing multimedia enhancements allowing authors to selfarchive their articles and improved content search capabilities journal enhancements some traditional publishers like many open access publishers have taken steps to enhance the content of journal articles they post online by permitting digital access permitting access to ancillary databases and related materials or allowing posting of preprints in authors websites or institutional repositories71 however often traditional subscriberpays publishers charge fee to view the journal article or enhancements with fees ranging from few dollars to 69 bradie metheny public representatives call for egalitarian access to published research washington fax aug 10 2004 70 rankin and franklin op cit 71 guterman jan 30 2004 op cit crs17 few tens of dollars72 open access proponents say that fees should not be charged for access to these kinds of information timing of free access to journal articles subscriberpays traditional publishers have wide variety of policies regarding free access to the articles they publish the british medical journal bmj for instance allows free access to all readers for all materials in its journal for one week after publication after that non subscribers have free online access only to original research articles that were published in the hardcopy journal only paying subscribers can access editorials and news articles published in the journals and articles that are published only in an online version after year access is free to all bmj materials generally traditional publishers may permit free access to journal articles anywhere from few months to two years after publication proponents of open access have argued that the public or other researchers should not have to wait year or more to have access to research findings especially for biomedical research findings that could be used to improve patients health outcome another view is that limited access to the full text of research articles is bad for science such restrictions make it difficult for researchers to build on the entirety of what has gone before and for readers to check whether they have done so the practice might contribute to citation bias since authors will only reference journals they can access73 still others may find that traditional publishers do not allow electronic access to data in form that other researchers can easily use to verify findings or to compare in other research projects selfarchiving open access publishers require or allow authors to self archive their articles immediately and to make them accessible for free some traditional subscriberpays publishers now allow authors to selfarchive on the authors own website an electronic version of the preprint of their article or after delay the published journal article there are variety of models for this sometimes with fees charged some traditional publishers allow authors to selfarchive the preprint and then link to the printed version after publication american meteorological association some do not allow posting of the article until year or more after publication in the journal american association for the advancement of science some allow posting of an authors article only on an institutional or educational server not the authors personal selfarchive american anthropological association and so forth the policies of hundreds of us and foreign journals associations and publishers are summarized in an inventory published by sherpa british open access project74 critics say that archiving only on the authors website makes it hard to find sets of related articles in particular subjects because articles are more accessible when placed in freely searchable repositories that archive articles in many fields by many authors and which can be searched by index or keyword terms 72 guterman jan 30 2004 op cit 73 citing others this quote is

httpwwwsherpaacuk romeophpallyes crs18 commercial and open access search engines some commercial publishers make available free search engines that allow readers to search for citations or abstracts in specific fields or types of information some of these repositories link to text version which can be viewed for free however most full text articles found through these searches are not accessible for free costs to read or download an article average 30 per article which users or libraries are required to pay75 an example is scirus search engine limited to science literature managed by elsevier which provides access to short abstracts or excerpts open access bibliographic or citation archives have wide range of policies regarding access to scientific articles open access bibliographic archives generally provide free access to abstracts or citations in multiple fields and often to fulltext manuscripts or articles nihs pubmedmedline is free bibliographic database that the public can use to search for journal articles it gives access to references from millions of articles published in almost 5000 biomedical journals dating back to the 1950s it gives citation and abstract and links to fulltext articles that are available for free via publishers websites or on pubmed central as well as to fulltext articles on the publishers websites that users may have to pay to view nihs pubmed central pmc includes the fulltext version of almost all articles cited in its database usually from open access publishers and in limited cases has links to the fulltext versions on publishers websites many journals routinely deposit material in pmc and generally all their published articles are made available for free pmc also is the repository for articles resulting from nihfunded research that are submitted under the agencys public access policy these articles comprise only small part of the pmc database and many nihfunded researchers publish the results of their research in journals that do not contribute article to pmc pmc is discussed in greater detail below in the section on nihs public access policy open access proponents say that there are multiple benefits to providing free access to articles in online repositories of collections of articles since reader could identify many related papers on one topic and would bypass the need to search individual authors websites or to use commercial indexing databases that typically charge fee to read an article copyright issues supporters of traditional subscriberpays publishing argue that publishers as copyright holders need copyright protection in order to market journals and sell reprints which support the costs of publishing and archiving both hardcopy and electronic materials some also say that copyright ownership is required to guarantee researchers accuracy and the authenticity of authorship of an article in open access publishing the author of the article retains copyright ownership but access to the article normally remains free to readers as will be discussed below mixed model is used in the case of nihs public access policy which asks authors to voluntarily submit to pubmed central pmc the peer reviewed version of manuscript accepted for publication in journal this should be done as soon as possible but within 12 months of acceptance of the article by the publisher free access to the manuscript is prohibited until after journal publication 75 from httpwwwsciruscom crs19 or for the embargo period specified by the publisher publishers who hold the copyright to articles that are not published using the open access model retain the exclusive right to disseminate the work for the time before free access is permitted on pmc but authors are encouraged to conclude agreements with publishers that allow them to place the manuscript in the database according to nih regardless of the publishers decision the agency has the right to utilize the journal article under the government purpose license doctrine even though nih says it is not exercising this authority in the future other agencies may seek to implement public access policies similar to nihs but may modify it to use government purpose licensing provisions which may be controversial see the section on nih below for more details economic development open access publishing according to many proponents helps promote economic social and technical development and equitable access to scientific knowledge by researchers in countries unable to afford the costs of scientific journals by hardcopy or subscription web access many open access systems also say that they will waive publication charges for authors from developing counties who cannot afford to pay to have their articles published but some traditional publishers say that scientists in developing countries already have free and ready access to most scientific journals for example many traditional publishers participate in projects sponsored by the world health organization and the food and agriculture organization of the united nations to provide medical and agricultural journals to readers in developing countries at low or cost76 in addition more than 2000 biomedical journals are accessible online to researchers and health workers in developing countries via philanthropic project called health internework access to research initiative hinari supported in collaboration with the world health organization77 peer review and quality of articles in open access journals there is diversity of views about whether the articles that appear in open access journals have been subject to the same kind of rigorous peer review as those published in traditional subscriberpays journals and about whether they are of comparable quality the peer review process traditionally involves review of quality of the article and selection of articles to be published in journal usually journal editors or editorial boards make an initial selection of articles to be peer reviewed from among those submitted use panel of expert scientists who may volunteer their time to review submissions select articles to be published from among the articles peer reviewers ranked as high quality and sometimes do some editing 76 lila guterman jan 30 2004 op cit 77 brian d crawford openaccess publishing where is the value the lancet nov 8 2003 pp 15781580 crs20 longheld principle is that the accumulation of highquality scientific knowledge rests on foundation of publication typically in traditional commercially distributed scientific journals with the findings and results vetted and validated through process involving peer review and feebased journal subscriptions critics allege that the open access author pays model of paying for publishing costs including peer review prevents quality control mechanisms from working correctly and that in the long run scientific articles published in open access sources may be less credible than those published in journals which charge subscription fees78 survey published in 2005 funded by traditional subscriberpays journal publishers is reported to have found that the quality of peer review was lower in open access than in traditionally published journals openaccess journals received fewer submissions and were less selective in choosing among submissions it continued essentially all of the journals reported using editorial review to select and edit submissions but nearly all of the traditional journals used external peer review while only editorial staff members reviewed submissions of about 30 percent of the openaccess journals79 according to another study the most rigorous peer review as measured by their journals reliance on external reviewers was largely by traditional publishers and that in contrast full open access journals tended to depend heavily on editorial staff only for peer review except for two subsets of open access journals biomed central bmc and internet scientific publications isp journals which had practices more like traditional journals80 on the other hand study published in 2005 by publishing analysis firm showed that the quality of nearly 200 open access journals was almost as high in specific medical disciplines as the quality of articles in traditionally published journals81 some analysts say that peer review in open access journals suffers from the difficulty of finding enough scientist peer reviewers for both the growing number of open access journals and traditional journals there is also the view that editorial boards of open access journals may not filter out unacceptable manuscripts as much as traditional subscriberpays journal boards do thus peer reviewers for open access journals who interact and report primarily electronically may be overwhelmed by the number of articles they are given to review and ultimately there may be delay in the system publication in peer reviewed journals figures prominently in promotion and tenure

access journals or freely available on the internet are used and cited more frequently than those published in traditional journals and are therefore better model to ensure the speedy utilization of scientific research for instance experience in physics where researchers publish in traditional journals and then selfarchive their papers in free database is conducive to scientific communication and favorable to authors because papers listed in free archives often get more citations83 recent study showed that in four disciplines philosophy political science electrical and electronic engineering and mathematics articles that are freely available via open access publishing have greater research impact than those not available via open access impact is measured by citations made by other researchers to the literature in the isi web of science database84 in computer sciences 2001 study in nature showed that at least in one set of disciplines papers that appear free online are more likely to be cited by other researchers than those that do not scientist at nec research institute analyzed nearly 120000 papers in computer science and related titles those that were freely available online had been cited more often in other papers than were those not online he found the average number of citations of offline papers was 274 compared with 703 for those freely available online85 study published in an open access journal suggested that articles published online in open access journal got cited more often than those cited in subscriber or pay for view journals the articles examined were published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in 2004 authors paid 1000 to allow their papers to be read immediately and without cost86 82 points raised in the

articles that were published in journals in the fields of biomedical behavioral and clinical research91 the goal of the database system is to develop publicly accessible permanent and searchable electronic archive of life science literature that is separate from publishers individual databases some of the journals participating in pmc typically open access publishing journals make full text articles available to users immediately upon publication some require waiting periods of up to three years to obtain free access to full text of an article some journals which participate allow the publication of bibliographic information about an article but require the reader to link to the journals website to view the abstract or full article which may be accessible only to subscribers or for fee many major biomedical journals do not participate in submitting materials to pmc including such journals as the journal of the american medical association the american psychologist the journal of abnormal psychology and the new england journal of medicine electronic access to articles in these journals is usually available for fee sometimes over 25 per article at the journals website

med central journals permit free access usually immediately to the final version of an article and authors who publish with them do not have to take further steps to satisfy nih public access policy seven of the almost 300 journals accessible via pmc require the author to submit manuscripts at this time nih also initiated new system called the pubmed central nih portfolio project only for nihfunded research which is apparently designed to satisfy nih needs and the demands of some nonprofit publishers although signed agreement is not necessary106 some publishers have signed an agreement for participation with nih according to one publisher it stipulates that published journal articles resulting from nihfunded research be made available only for internal use in an nihfunded archive during the embargo period that the embargo period last longer than 12 months and that following the embargo period nih could provide links to the journal and could also distribute the article directly through pmc107 if journal does submit articles via the bulk system authors have to confirm the version that is posted on pmc so far only one journal blood has agreed to participate but negotiations are underway with other publishers108 authors that publish in any other journal not considered regular pmc journal or nih portfolio journal identified by nih for example as elsevier journals need to continue to submit manuscripts to comply with nihs policy to submit final manuscripts to pmc109 these changes occurred after several months of discussions intended in part to allay criticisms110

develop an aggressive outreach program to ensure full participation by grantees in volunteering to submit their journal manuscripts to the nih archive it also requested the nih director to report to congress by march 1 2006 on the number of articles111 deposited and the length of the embargo by publishers that is the delay between submission of each peer reviewed article to nih and its subsequent posting on the pubmed central website and to estimate the total number of articles available for deposit112 srept 109103 on this bill endorsed the objectives of the policy but also emphasized the need for interaction between nih and stakeholders it urged nih to work with stakeholders as it implements the new policy and asked nih to report by february 1 2006 on the number of peer reviewed articles deposited in the database on the extent to which the implemented policy has led to improved public access on the impact on the peer review system and on the cost of operating the database113 the bill enacted after conference committee action was sent to the president for signature on december 28 2005 signed as pl 109149 the nih report to the committees was released in january 2006114 it reported that for the first eight months of the system the rate of submission was low less than 4 of the total number of articles estimated to be eligible for submission that is 1636 out of about 43000 that could be deposited lack of awareness it reported does not appear to be the primary reason for the low submission rate the report did not describe the reasons for the low rate of participation but publisher resistance seems apparent the nih said it will continue to work with participants and stakeholders to improve public access it also identified three issues the working group was continuing to examine which undoubtedly contribute the low participation rates should investigators participation in the policy be mandatory or voluntary which version of an article should be deposited in pmc the authors final peer reviewed manuscript or the final edited article as it is published in the journal 111 the word articles is used in the house and senate reports even though the nih policy as it

websites to read the full text of articles the senators also questioned nihs ability to fund the public access system due to limited resources and requested that nih meet with representatives of the group to consider their proposal dr zerhouni reportedly said he would welcome meeting120 criticisms of nihs enhanced public access policy criticisms of the nih policy have come from traditional subscriberpays publishers as well as proponents of open access for instance ploss supporters have criticized the nih policy for its voluntary compliance requirement and said the agencys language should have been to require or expect rather than request the deposition of nihfunded articles in the national library of medicines freetouse internet repository pubmed central121 in addition according to plos the maximum allowable delay before articles public release should have been at most 6 rather than 12 months particularly since publisher has presented evidence that the free availability of fraction of its journals articles half year after publication would adversely affect subscription revenues122 others say that the 12month delay for public access falls short of achieving goals of congressional intent and is too lengthy in field as dynamic as biomedicine where patients need immediate access123 nih policy has also been criticized by some who say that nih should utilize free access policies that exist in the notforprofit publishing community which they say are more costeffective they suggest that instead of putting articles in pmc nih should create search engine that has the capability to crawl the full texts of existing journals including nonprofit journals to allow access to articles on the original journals website and to provide access to other articles on the topic publishers often charge fee to access articles this way among the groups who have 119 described further below 120 coleman dec 20 2005 op cit 121 andy gass and helen doyle

likely can be considered printed publications for patent purposes thus triggering the oneyear time period for filing us patent application covering research disclosed in the manuscript 127 current practice it is charged relies on the date of journal publication to start the clock128 report prepared for the american physiological society criticized the nih policy as limiting technology

to provide copy of the article to pmc142 nih relies on obtaining permission from authors as the basis for its policy even though nih does not need to seek permission from journals who may acquire copyrights from authors or institutions because any copyright transfer or assignment is currently subject to the government purpose license pursuant to 45 cfr 7436143 the term government purpose license is not used per in the cited regulation but is implied nih says it is not relying on use of government purpose license to implement its policy the regulation reads the recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed or for which ownership was purchased under an award the hhs awarding agency reserves royaltyfree nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce publish or otherwise use the work for federal purposes and to authorize others to do so 45 cfr 7436a the concept of nonexclusive right to use the work is similar to the concept of government purpose license that is used in the federal acquisition regulation which governs federally funded contracts government purpose licensing permits agencies to disseminate to the public scientific and technical articles based on or containing data produced from research funded by the agency the government may subsequently use and distribute the scientific and technical articles as submitted to publisher or as published in journal if the publisher has not added any original materials such as publisherprepared abstracts or peer review comments however generally an agency should obtain publishers written

be limited to contracts funded by those agencies whose originating or authorizing legislation mandates them to preserve andor disseminate information to the general public about the agencies activities and research results145 agencies may attach separate and different interpretations to this function and purpose other agencies that support scientific grants are governed by omb circular a110section 36 which allows copyrighting by the owner of the work produced from the award of federal funds but gives the government nonexclusive right to use it specifically the recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed or for which ownership was purchased under an award the federal awarding agencyies reserve royaltyfree nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce publish or otherwise use the work for federal purposes and to authorize others to do so146 the circular a110 language does not appear to require agencies enabling legislation to mandate dissemination of research findings although agency regulations generally require grantees to publish or disseminate the findings of their research and to share data generated by such research see for instance the nsf grant policy manual which specifies that investigators are expected to promptly prepare and submit for publication with authorship that accurately reflects the contributions of all those involved all significant findings from work conducted under nsf grants147 however agencies may have different rules relating to the dissemination of research findings and definitions of federal purpose if other agencies were to develop public access policies like nihs they might use policy of voluntarily submitted manuscripts like nih but research funding agencies might also chose to invoke government purpose license or nonexclusive right to use policies to archive articles 144 continued research support is implied to be applicable to grants also see section 4 works created under

structures and toxicology which cas does not deal with not broader chemical reactions which cas covers171 an nih official christopher austin senior advisor at the nih chemical genomics center at the national human genome research institute was reported to have said that limitation of pubchem would have profoundly negative effects on medical discoveries172 one report said the overlap between the two databases occurs in the indexes of chemical names nih maintains the overlap is quite modest and for the most part is complementary to cas acs disagrees saying pubchem duplicates cas platform and replicates its search features and information173 several articles noted that the acs lobbied members of congress especially appropriations committee members to have pubchem terminated174 or limited to include only compounds derived from federally funded rd and to avoid overlap with commercial enterprise both the house appropriations committee and the senate appropriations committee addressed this issue in their reports on the fy2006 appropriations bill that includes appropriations for nih hr 3010 they did not reduce funding for the database both reports said essentially the same thing that they understood that the database will include chemical compound information from the nihfunded molecular libraries screening center network and from other sources but they both expressed concern about duplication of effort with the private sector and urged nih to work with private sector publishers to avoid unnecessary duplication175 after conference committee action the bill was cleared on

free database for nih to deposit bioassay data from its molecular screening project179 instead on september 1 2005 nih announced in the federal register that it was inviting participation from private sector providers and users of chemical information to participate in new working group to advise on interactions with private sector information providers in the development of pubchem180 subsequently it was reported in october 2005 that the american chemical society objected to what it characterized as the retrospective process that the group was to use to assess biomedical relevance of compounds in the data base181 and sought that prospective analysis be used instead reportedly nih database managers said that nih cannot know priori which compounds should and shouldnt go into the collection the privatesector panel and nih officials met on december 19 2005 and reportedly definitive conclusions were reached at the end of the meeting although industry representatives said they left with better understanding of pubchem and of nihs intentions agency officials said it was unclear whether the working group would meet again 182 according to nih many new private sector depositors have

chemical information industry have found pubchem useful and complementary to their commercial services183 speculation about differences in federal agency policies there are unequivocal answers as to why some agencies can maintain open access systems more easily than others it may be that publishers despite their misgivings 176 continued science june 17 2005 177 kaiser op cit june 17 2005 178

moderated their opposition to congressional action to put manuscripts on nihs pubmed central since the posted items are limited to those that resulted from nih funding however nih may be in different position from other federal agencies since it has mandate to preserve and provide health information to the public other agencies may not have such clear mandates to distribute information and the results of their research funding to the public furthermore support for nihs open access activities seems based not only on the need to allow taxpayers access to results of research their taxes funded163 but also on the emotional argument about need for rapid access to information to improve health and save lives compelling rationale to many members of congress reportedly does scientific and technical information advisory board is discussing at the highest levels the question of whether it should establish an open access policy like nihs to make doefunded articles available in its own database and is preparing report on this subject according to several federal agency staff it seems that in the absence of guidance from the congressional appropriations committees agencies other than nih would likely find it difficult to mount system like nihs because of publisher opposition164 interagency activities scientific publishing and communications methods are slowly changing as internet publishing becomes more prevalent some observers say that government supported researchers and sponsoring agency staff should participate in shaping these new methods of delivering scientific

30 organizations were surveyed and 18 were interviewed to collect information regarding technology policy procedures and metadata in operational or continued crs43 international activities several international organizations and other countries are examining wider implementation of open access publishing following the release in 2003 of the berlin declaration which called for open access to knowledge and its signing by representatives of selected european universities research groups and government sectors166 the european union began study on changes in markets for scientific and technical publishing in europe among its topics of inquiry is the subject of open access to research findings for all and the need to reconcile authors rights and the economic interests of publishers167 the report study on the economic and technical evolution of the scientific publication markets in europe january 2006168 endorsed but did not require open access to publicly funded research in 2004 the organization for economic cooperation and developments oecd science ministers declared their commitment to principle that research data from public funding should be openly available169 on the rationale that providing such access promotes longterm economic benefits more informed governmental decisionmaking and hastens the advancement of scientific research the ministers asked oecd to develop guidelines to facilitate optimal costeffective access to digital research data from public funding 170 that would be balanced in terms of opening access while recognizing the need for restriction of access in some instances to protect social scientific and economic interests171the guidelines will be released after approval by the oecd council the 2004 oecd work was based in part on report that was funded by the us national science foundation172 165 continued prototype projects the results of this project were reported in digital electronic archiving the state of the

press release nsf pr 04031 mar 18 2004 the report was not named in the press release the author was reported to be peter arzberger director of life sciences initiatives at the university of california san diego crs44 according to the reports authors the ultimate goal is to make data sharing and the principle of open access the rule rather than the exception173 another oecd report published on september 2 2005 as digital broadband content scientific publishing174 it reiterated the view that governments should increase access to findings from publicly funded research to maximize social returns on public investments and presented examples and comprehensive pro and analyses of currently used business models of open access publishing and open access archives175 it also summarized the pros and cons of hybrid business models which distribute publishing costs among authors and users one example is twopart tariff for author feeswith fees levied for submission and publication serving to reduce the tendency for multiple and speculative submission of papers for publication and enabling journals to cover the costs of quality through support for higher rejection rates such as model might also serve to increase revenue certainty for publishers of open access author pays variant journals and by reducing the cost of publication in them enable them better to compete for authors with subscriptionbased journals however user resistance would be strong possibility compared with simpler author pays models 176 the report also proposed variations of another hybrid model involving segmentation of journal into subscription and open access on an articlebyarticle basis according to the authors preference and willingnessability to pay177 apparently number of publishers have already adopted such practices and the oecd report concluded such model may be useful way for journal title to migrate from subscription model to an open access model over time with the pace and direction of change dictated by author preferences178 as noted above there has been considerable governmental and nongovernmental activity to promote open access publishing in the united kingdom some scientific and medical researchers in britain took steps to make research results freely available via the british open access publisher biomedcentral179 subsequently in 2004 the science and technology committee of britains house of commons issued report endorsing open access to research results by proposing to require authors to deposit their published papers in online archives and journals using an author pays model and eliminating subscription fees it also recommended that government agencies mandate that governmentfunded researchers put their 173 nsf pr 04031 op cit 174 organization for economic

in november 2004 the uk government the department of trade and industry rejected the proposal maintaining there is indication that access to scientific journals is impeded under current publishing methods and that according to the government the true costs of openaccess publishing are still not clear 182 and it is not obvious that the author pays business model would give better value for money than the current one 183 in june 2005 the united kingdom research councils rcuk184 the main british supporter of publicly funded research which distributes most government science funding185 issued for comment draft policy which mandates researchers it funds to archive their journal articles and conference papers in free public archive at the earliest opportunity wherever possible at or around the time of publication 186 but the rules may allow publishers to continue to embargo archiving articles until many months after publication since the council says its mandate is subject to copyright and licensing arrangements that can restrict what authors do187 costs of publishing in author pays journals would be covered by the research councils funding grant subject to justification of cost effectiveness188 the british government said it would review its policy options on this issue taking into consideration the draft rcuk policy and any changes to it as well as other information189 the executive board of the rcuk issued policy statement in the summer of 2006 saying that all peerreviewed journal papers produced by publicly funded research must be made available for free soon after

selected questions in academia continuing questions relating to controversial issues about open access publishing were raised by andy gass and helen doyle the reality of openaccess journal articles chronicle of higher education february 18 2005 they conclude that although there are problems support is growing in academia for open access journals remaining questions include what will become of the market for secondary filters of primary research articles services like biomed centrals faculty of 1000 which highlight important papers published in wide swath of journals will feeforaccess ventures that collect openaccess articles become new cash cow for publishers at present faculty members offer their recommendations to the filtering services free and publishers sell their aggregated opinions to institutions will established professors go on contributing their free labor to such entrepreneurial enterprises how will the role of the research library change as openaccess scholarly communication becomes more widely practiced to what extent will librarians be freed from the burdens of subscription management many university libraries now encourage open access by subsidizing portion of the publication charges in openaccess venues for authors affiliated with the university through channels like our employers institutional membership program will those subsidies continue if so will they continue to be paid from libraries budgets or will they come from research budgets source that would be more consistent with the view of openaccess proponents that costs of publication should be part of the costs of conducting research or will external granting agencies many of which already pay scientists page charges and colorillustration fees assume the full costs of their investigators openaccess publications will libraries continue to serve as intermediaries through which researchers find openaccess information as well as that available only through subscription and how those questions relate not just to academic libraries but to the mission of colleges and universities the time has come for comprehensive review of how best to pay for the dissemination of professors work how will reduced legal barriers to reusing articles stipulation of most formal definitions of open access affect teaching research and other scholarly activities there are of course good crs51 precedents for having few or legal restrictions on the reuse of scholarly work every article published by an employee of the nih is in the public domain some morerestrictive openaccess licenses now available like the creative commons attribution license in use for articles from our employer and from biomed central permit users to reproduce scholarly work in any medium for any purpose as long as the author receives proper credit what kinds of educational tools will such licenses make possible for example will we see proliferation of online articles enhanced with explanatory links and informational sidebars which make scientific discoveries more comprehensible to wide audience will such resources be produced by commercial enterprises by nonprofit organizations or by networks of volunteers as is the case with opensource computer software will openaccess articles enable more researchers from lessdeveloped countries to work on the frontiers of science given that all credible openaccess journals waive publication fees for authors who cant afford to pay them increased availability and therefore knowledge of the literature might well allow scientists in the developing world to increase their output of cuttingedge work would that change in turn help resolve the 1090 gap the unfortunate reality that less than 10 percent of the global expenditure on medical research goes to study the predominant health needs of 90 percent of the worlds population most important what kinds of discoveries might result from searchable open archives of peerreviewed fulltext scientific literature the aggregation of gene sequences in single freely accessible information space genbank has spawned entire fields of research will open access to journal articles have similar effect on areas of work that could benefit from mining full texts and figures clearly comprehensive collections of openaccess literature would make it much easier to systematically review published medical studies will openaccess literature lead to frequent discoveries of correlations between phenomena previously thought to be unrelated will it spark more open access to data sets and databases of laboriously compiled and annotated information the potential for open access to lead to new discoveries is its single most compelling asset though one that is frequently overlooked198 198 andy gass
