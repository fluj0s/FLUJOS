have respect for the office of president and that we recognize the duties and res ponsibilities that he has to carry on after he leaves that office58 s 607 as introduced provided that the compensation for an administrative assistant secretary and ot her clerical assist ants for each former president should not exceed the aggregate amount au thorized for the staff of the senators from the least populous state which at the time was 10000059 during house debate on s 607 however it was argued that the staffing provision of the proposed legislation could involve salaries totaling as much as 120000 for each former presidents office depending on the individual salary paid to each staff person house and senate conferees believed that even 100000 was excessive and imposed 50000 limitation on the total compensation authorized for former presidents office staff60 the bill also originally authorized the gsa administrator to furnish suitable officespace for each former president in federa l building at such place within the united states as the former president shall specify the conference committee deleted the reference to federal building allowing gsa to furnish suitable office space for former president in nonfederal office space 61 despite strong support by the leadersh ip of both the house and the senate opposition to the concept of providing benefits to former presidents persisted in an effort to bring their dissenting views to the attention of the members of the house of representatives and of the american public seven members of the house committee on post office and civil service prepared formal report on why they opposed authorizing presiden tial retirement benefits62 they argued that adequate need or justification to provide such bene fits existed and that enactment of s 607 would create separate entity for former presidents with an aura of official standing and wholly undefi ned relationship to the cons titutional functions of the federal government63 equally problematic for the seven di ssenting members was the unprecedented vagueness of the proposed legislations provisions for staff and office allowanceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34631crs13 64 ibid

the widows pension begins on the day after the former presidents death and would end with death or remarriage before reaching 60 years of age the fpa prohibits pension benefits to former presidents

must also waive the right to any annuity or pension under any other legislation nancy reagan and betty ford are the remaining surviving widows and according to gsa they did not waive the right to other statutory annuities or pension and do not receive the annual pension 68 grover cleveland served two nonconsecutive terms and is therefore included twice in the table which created wide and dangerous loopholes64 the members were also concerned about the provision to provide each former president with suitable furnishings in an office space that could be located anywhere within the united states such broad provision the dissenting members argued took into account only the proposed costs for providing allowances to the two surv iving former presidents herbert hoover and truman and overlooked potential future costs that could be incurred as subsequent presidents began receiving pension benefits after leaving office65 s 607 as amended was approved by the senate on august 16 1958 passed by the house on august 21 1958 and signed into law by president dwight d eisenhower on august 25 195866 as enacted the former presidents act fpa provided each former president an nnual taxable

reject former presidents choice in office size or location rental payments currently range from 102000 per year for president carters office to 516000 for president clin tons with small portion occupied by the us secret service among the options likely to be considered are placing spending cap on office space for former president mandating that former presidents office be located in owned or
