awareness levels lecture given on 27 april 1965 thank you thank you well you look better today sorry to have to tell you but you look much better today whats the date audience 27th of april ad 15 all right twentyseven april ad 15 saint hill special briefing course ah dear i havent reallyi can tell you with great honesty i havent the least idea of what to talk to you about today this was simply tuesday in which lecture came up i have been working extremely hard trying to handle awhat amounts to false report which had come in over the world and didnt know i was handling false report until just last week and that was false report on rates charged by organizations nearly every organization in the world had covertly unreportedly reduced its rates so that when the new pricing program went into effect and they were asked what their rates were they simply gave their advertised rates they did not give the rates they actually charged in fact i would go so far and could add somewhat cruelly as i dont think the top executives in the orgs knew what rate was really being charged so on the basis of this false report given last autumn pricing program was arranged with national councils through the world and they happily and pleasantly agreed to price increase that amounted to 400 to 1000 percent above their 1964 prices without saying word as result the public was considerably shocked and the funny part of it is i couldnt even find out what they were shocked about since according to the pricing program and the reported rates that were being charged by organizations the pricing program frankly reduced several of their advertised rates but that was only on paper in actual fact the public at large knew very well that this had not been the fact the rates therefore were enormously increased and as result why business slackened up and activity damped here and there but all i was aware of is the fact that when i came back from vacation why they all had down curve except saint hill and they all had this nice down curve and this was reported to somewhat late in the reportand i got onto it as soon as i found this out and started to solve this problem and it took long time it took thea long time for it tookit took the better part of three weeks to finally find the engram necessary to resolve the case and that engram was false report and it was universal false reporteach org had done this and we were very fortunate to have found this before we began to expand because frankly at the rates they were charging and for the service they were going to give for the rates had i not pulled them up and standardized prices and found this engram they would have expanded into insolvency because the rates they were charging would not have covered the costs and if thousand persons had been driven down on the org for training and processing dont you see and if they had trained and processed these people at the costs which they were really training and processing them at it would have cost somebody nonexistent somebody dont you see several thousand dollars month that would have gone into the red in other words the organization would have expanded into the red and for some reason or other nobody really had courage enough i suppose in these national councils to say but ron uhheh has course you know onlyonly gets two pounds huhhuh in our area or in perhaps angeles ah yes but werewere chargingwere charging only fifty cents for ten thousand hours of processing plusplus promise to clear and ot do you follow do you follow an incredible situation then had existed but what we discovered is not the fact we discovered that an organization can be pounded by the public in the form of one two three four suppressive people you see this sounds like the public you knowthese are the blokes that specialize in everybody says everybody thinks dont you see into believing that they mustnt charge anything for their services and there was therefore in extant tendency to downgrade service well now that is the surest way in the world to wipe service out because it costs money to run an organization or an auditor or staff and so on and if you could just pound the income of scientology down far enough of course there would be org there to help these nasty people weve got to get even with do you follow and the tendency then was to reduce prices covertly by strange and peculiar discounts which were then not announced or put on the line do you follow so that these discounts and so on mounting up gradually would take the price of the service down below the cost of the service and what we gained out of it was the recognition of the fact that there was this tendency and that it required an extraordinary effort to hold price line once set and so we can make that extraordinary effort were nowmy desk is covered with cable traffic and telex traffic right at this minute which is readjusting this whole situation but the public in the meanwhile has been informed that all organizations have fallen back to their 1964 prices and theyre at this moment mailing an hco policy letter out to the public at large which returns to their 1964 prices so that was the end of that and we just wiped out the engram you see the basic idea of the 1964 program was not pricing the basic idea of it was simply that we take all membership monies and all book monies and we put them in special account and then we use that for advertising scientology and scientology books and that was the basic idea and to that became added then pricing complexities and so forth by this persons objection and that persons objection dont you see and counselor action of this kind or another it got into pricing mess well you see the basic idea is quite sound and will of course be followed but the pricing situation and so on was what was out and that was what caused the januaryfebruary slump of this year in most organizations and iright now as i say ive got desk covered with the most incredible figures which are the most incredible departures from anything ever reported before you ever saw because i sent the hco secretary this morning in every org in the world down to accounts to ask accounts what is on the invoices of 1964 not whats in the literature but whats on the invoices and i tell you the things that are on the invoices would fry your hair see one month of training ten rand oh yes marvelous yes thats what it was so of course the public was suddenly confronted with this tremendous price jump and this getmade them all very nervous and so on but its very interesting to read the ad comms heres the boy on the ground see you read the ad comms and all the ad comms ever hit were locks they never said there was price jump in january they said well price changes are what drove things down the fact that we changed some prices drove things down you see thats not true the fact that we increased prices 400 to 1000 percent is what drove things down now of course we can actually retain those 1964 prices and just fool everybody see all ill do is retailor the service to fit the money and that will be that it takes some gymnastics but its held up the release of your org board because i was not about to release an org pattern of some kind or another which might require adjustment and instantly released instantly adjustedthe devil with that so until i got this whole situation this basic engram cleaned up and figured out i knew id better not go ahead and publish that org board now i can go ahead and letter the thing but its quite quite laughable when you get to thinking about it i suppose registrar hearing suppressive joe and suppressive pete and so forth walk in and say oh the people are bhalhmhororra you know and so on hes being asked for ten shillings for weeks coaudit you see or something and oh thats too much money and blah blah blah and pretty soon she gets the idea the public will not pay any money see well lets see how can i covertly reduce the price you see so in casual conversation in coffee shop you see with the assoc sec she says everybody thinks that you get the ideashe just passes on the same engram you know and therefore the has coaudit and so forth really ought to be priced shilling you see well thats fine but you cant have an instructor there do you follow so this sort of tendencythis sort of tendency had to be spotted and cleaned up its something that you should guard against very carefully in your own individual activity and so forth its very amazing but i can go back over the years on the subject of prices and pricing and i find this peculiarity also isolated out in those orgs where i was functioning straight on in direct management and so onin those orgs staffs always made good pay you can go back and verify that thats washington london in the days when i was riding them straight to and close to and so forth you look at it its above the average of what they would get on whats called fixed pay in other words their unit pay was above their fixed pay now when i moved oft you would say offhand well management wasnt so good it was more careless when i moved oft somebody changed the prices see they would figure some method ill give you an idea this idea of scholarship scholarship was something that was handed to the field auditor to give to friend you see now this was very happy thing because the first genus of it is of course he wants somebody to help him where he is so he gave this scholarship which he was sent as field auditorhe just signed it and handed it over to somebody he wanted trained therefore that person could be trained cheaply and go back and help the field auditor now that line collapsed up to the front corner of the registrars desk so that anybody who walked in the shop is just dealt this scholarship see you got it see it was never intended for that at all it was intended to help out the field auditor and it had very little to do with money it just had to do with the fact that this bird who the field auditor wanted to have help him you seethis guy could be sent into the org very cheaply and this guy in the field you see why then he had somebody to help him who was trained and it wouldnt break their finances to get going in that immediate area and that was what the scholarship was all about see but it got upgraded more and finally got up to recognized discount and then it moved up on the registrars desk and then of course these things just got dealt well of course that immediately cut the price i think it was something on the order ofthe price of an hca course in london was seventyfive pounds and thescholarship or something like that cut it to thirtysix pounds so then itsthe price of an hca in london reported at seventyfive pounds was in actual fact thirtysix pounds uniformly now do you get the picture see it was never sold for seventyfive pounds now why anybody would tell the public that an hca course was seventyfive pounds while as matter of fact it was always thirtysix pounds see i wouldnt know that would be wonderful way of knocking business apart see gorgeous see you say our prices are very high to everybody out in the field you see and so on well we have very high prices but the second somebody comes in they say have you got ten cents so iim very happy to have run this engram and its in the process of running out now and the preclear is doing very well and im very proud of the preclear for sitting there quietly now and answering up ive never had anything answered up so smart in my life as it was just last night when the telexes flew out of here asking for the vital data and actually its all sitting on my desk and has been there for hours in other words they really answered up on this engram so that was real good morale in organizations is out through the roof i mean its in terrific shape ive never seen morale better because one of the things is ive been telling them to do this and to do that and to do the other thing and theyve been getting sec eds and theyve had heavy policyletter line during all this period theres been lots of policy letters but they all refer to the new organization you see these policy letters are simply being put with them so that they wont be in the dark when they get their new org board and theyve been running not on policy letters but on sec eds well i just skipped the policy line and although youre getting policy letters what youre doing is the sec ed see and the policy letters go into effect when the new org board but anyway theyve managed to look under the corner of these policy letters and look at some of these figures and department and division numbers and so forth on them and they managed to sort of put together what the org board must look like dont you see but theyre running on the secretarial executive director now secretarial executive director is an issued by air letter or wire or cable or telex which is simply issued to hco hco types it up at once in the form of an order and stamps it as official and posts it or circulates it through the organization and that operates as an immediate order as matter of fact something could happen at eleven oclock in the morning in an organization and usually by three or four they could have secretarial executive director out on it if things were really running hotter than pistol you see so there is such thing as remote management its not very remote its right up there these secretarial executive directives are issued for all organizations or for one special organization in other words you can issue one for saint hill only let us say or for johannesburg only or angeles only and then you can issue general one the other thing which they had done inthroughout organizations was quite marvelous they had not complied with an order last autumn to compile all their mailing lists and to cull through all their invoices and get their organization mailing lists up and very few had done anything about this so when we started to send out auditor 8which is by the way quite an issuewhen we started to send this out we asked for addresses for all their inactive and active lists give you an example auckland reported eleven hundred names on their mailing list for central organization eleven hundred names whats this their congress list see and johannesburg which has been having dreadful time and so forth reported five hundred names five hundred names we just never heard of these figures dont you see and you know its what wall because we have this datum in our background that when the london list of about six thousandive forgotten the exact figureit was something like six or eight thousand certaintys going out to six or eight thousand people you see each month when that was cut to save money on the magazine seemagazine mailing cost very expensive you know weve got to save moneywhen that was cut to seven hundred names secretly all of sudden londons business hit the skids nobody walked in the front door that was it and when i finally got back to england and picked it up off the ground it was twentytwo thousand pounds in the red and going into the red faster every minute and boy it took year and half to put that organization back together again i picked it up and got it going again and kicked it into line and we eventually put it back up where it could stand but that was just because seven hundred names was the only mailing you see now you get out bunch of promotion or information or data and then you find youve only got an audience you see of maybe five hundred thats nothing see thats exactly nothing so theyre culling through their addresses now and theyre culling through their invoices and new zealand went back through its past invoices for its mailing listyou see their names all appear on their invoicesand theyve picked up three thousand just like that and will be up to four they think before theyre through therell be about four thousand names well that was actually the field of new zealand well of course thats got to be much higher than that and ive set them some various figures and other ways of doing this and so on theyre gradually building these things back up again the only trouble were having little bit of trouble with johannesburg johannesburg keeps insisting they have got all of their addresses and so forth an organization couldnt becouldnt have lived over those years and still only had five hundred names dont you see it couldnt have so were about to do terrible thing to them were about to send for all of their invoices ever since theyve been in operation by air freight well tell them well give them to them back but either they dont have any invoices at allsee theres another fib there what were operating onjohannesburg will do all right and theyll survivemostly because i said so but heres the main point is over period of time i tried toi just dropped everything i think in 1963 january 22nd when there was considerable amount of governmental attack and so forth i just dropped everything and in the ensuing year why i did what would have amounted to maybe ten years of normal research pushed it right straight up to r6 materials and so i could look on the other side of it and see where we went with ot you see i did nothing but that i just said to hell with it go ahead i said go broke die i dont care see i know this that theres only one answer to government attacks see and thats to complete the research thats the only thing they could do us up withthey get us so involved one way or the other that we couldnt end the cycle on the research line to total finished ot product see so that was it and of course weve been paying for it because i came back on the bridge you might say in april of 1964 and i had all the material there i didnt bother to round off all the material as some of you r6 students notice the material is not cut or edited in various places its all there but i didnt bother to polish up the material or finish up the line or anything like that because now it was in shape where it could be finished up and would finish and i went ahead then into the field of management and started in on organization to save the bacon of some of these organizations who had begun to slip and they had slipped and that inattention for that period of time was of course dearly paid for but nevertheless were bringing that right out into the open now and straightening that on up it was calculated risk i knew very well how far they could go its something like youve got two kids one sliding off one side of the boat one sliding off the other side of the boatcalculated risk of which one do you save you see knowing very well that you can reach three feet deep in the water for the other one and get him by the collar before he goes down the third time dont you see its that type of calculated risk and so on this wasthis has been very tight and very very very closely played in the last couple of years and they lost now weve just got the thing of straightening up orgs but it was very funny to have great big engram sitting in the middle of the recovery line thats of course why they didnt recover fast there was this big engram sitting there hidden unsuspected and so on the main difficulties that you run into in handling scientology and so forth are not with scientology organizations theyre with the public and the poor organization sits there and wherever the public impinges upon the organization you can count on that point enturbulating thatyoull know exactly where an organization will erode itll erode exactly at the point where the public impinges upon it you see well now this is very very curious how we got this far im sure i dont know there was good luck and good management and lot of dedicated work by staffs and that sort of thing and theyvetheyve really done fine job having scolded them and snarled now about their covert pricing dont think for moment that im mad at any of them because im not i see exactly how it arose but at those points where the public hits or where they impinge will be the most enturbulated points and it is the public which is in confusion and were trying to put stable datum called scientologist or an organization you see into the middle of this confusion and frankly an individual cannot stand alone with scientology he will just get knocked appetite over tin cup by the public i can tell you that by vast experiencevast experience if hes not backed up organizationallyif he doesnt have an organizationthen he cant get off the launching pad get his case gains and so forth up the line because of course every scientologist in the world and every organization in the world is connected with suppressive thing called the society do you see so theyre going to go appetite over tin cup bang if they are left all by themselves to fend now you take one of your pcs and you send him back home and he was bright and shining and so forth the chances of your picking up that pc bright and shining in just another month or two months in the same condition as he left your session and so forth are so remote as to be nonexistent that guy is going to be batted hes going to lose part of that gain this is the frog who climbs up three inches in the daytime and falls back two inches at night and its that chugchug type of advance which you can count on your pc making he will make it to the degree that he continues to have confidence in you oddly enough even though hes long way away from you hes now got confidence in you hes got arc with one human being in the world do you see thats his auditor im talking now about field situation well now that auditor is being knocked around of course because he is public front gate now if he cant himself lean back against stronger entity such as an organization that will support him why he once more gets knocked around now if the organization once more cannot lean back against stronger entitya larger organization you seewhy it gets unduly knocked around and then of course the larger organization with good handling of all organizations is pretty big organization see and that way why you can lift man up by his bootstraps you can get this thing off the launching pad but you are dealing in psychotic society there are thirtytwo levels below zero the average public is at least fifteen levels below zero at an average and neurosis starts in at ten levels below zero neurosis only goes few levels and then its psychosis psychosis is an inability to observe an inability to be aware of anything but the wrong thing and thats your public and i took look at it the other day and ive had two interesting experiences in the last year personal experiences that you yourself may someday run into when i first had total reality last year sometime on the exact character of the reactive mind of exactly how it was there and exactly what it was calculated to make an individual do i just said oh nooo and i sort of sat down and i looked at that and i thought ah thats just too gruesome it was sort of an arc break and i said now if anythingitthe truism is if somebody is shocked by something and this is quite commonly true if someone is shocked by something itnormally theres something wrong with what hes shocked with dont you see so it wasthat rule applied to this i said well i must have something wrong with the structure that i have got here for the reactive bank so i promptly went all over it suppressed it good arc broke it turned on enough somatics to blow your head off and so forth and then finally ran out all the suppressions and challenges on the thing and that was still it the shock was not actually with the reactive bank but the pretenses that had been made about the character of man and amongst those pretenses is be glad youre neurotic and i thought my god something that makes man an obsessive murderer and hes got to have this in order to live or be artistic ughhh and it was considerable shock to finally confront this thing called reactive bank and see exactly what it consisted of and exactly what trash one had been led to believe was vital and valuable in the business of living because it couldnt make anything but bums criminals dogs dont you see and it was shock it was shock and i got over it in about fortyeight hours and so forth and finally said to hell with it and as matter of fact my case has goneim having an awful time trying to get you the data right now im trying to hold onto the case long enough to get it plotted but its blowing and i now cant get tone arm to rise and im afraid that just behind that the needle action is going to go theres plenty of mass there and theres plenty to be run out there theres plenty of this and that to be handled you understand but it doesnt have enough effect do you understand for quite while now my cognitionsoh so thats why people you know had cognition of this is why i am that has gone sometime since i used to have ball with that oh thats why i soandso oh yes mumm i havent cognited like that for ages but ive been very carefully holding the bank there in order to get you the exact proper plot see and i cant hold it there its disintegrating and its gotten now to point where the tone arm wont rise and its sitting down around the clear read and the needle looks awful funny its very floppy reads very well this stuff reads nicely still i know the symptoms first the tone arm action goes out and then the needle action goes out when youre really flattening something dont you see first you lose the tone arm action well thats gone and what i did was contact the fundamentals below the gpms and theyre whats blowing and im trying to plot the gpms when i dont have to run them and thats quite serious of course itd ruin somebody to do this you know i mean you bypass all the gpms and try to run out the lower stuff hed go colderhed feel like he was in an icehouse and the somatics would tear him to pieces and so forth but you actually theoretically could run the bottom pinning out of the bank and the rest of the bank would disappear well unfortunately i contacted the bottom pinning and the rest of the bank is blowing i cant stop it blowing so if you never get complete plot on this why you know what happened its not that im in fabulously marvelous shape at the particular momenthandling all this stuff and working day and night on it and that sort of thing but the mainthe main thing about it is it doesnt have any particular effectits having an effect on my body now the masses move in against the body and make an impression on the body and i know that and i can feel that and i can see these things and that sort of thing i havent got any time track anymore and thats awfully disorienting i miss it miss it terribly i can assure you of it its like missing the tin cans after youve eaten you sort of say what the hell happened to the tin cans huh wheres the garbage but whereas previously i used to be able to think of well now lets see what did i read in such and such text at such and such time and so forth id get beautiful picture of itgorgeous you seeand even be able to read it and so forth nah i dont get any picture anymore i just know what it said and its disconcerting only if you look at it in retrospect seems perfectly normal but you look at it in retrospectyou say well some somatic like that would come from some cracking big engram see so you say all right wheres the engram theres engram there you know gpm thats half discharged sitting in front of you see and you say oh that oh well wheres the picture or yousometimes you will notice the factthe tail end of an engram see and its sitting down on top of gpm that hasnt been contacted or plotted dont you see and you say golly look at that g of course you remember what it was all about butit doesnt leave you in mysterybut you havent got nice billboard picture of it anymore dont you see now the funny part of it is you could turn around and make picture of it see you couldyou could turn around and make picture of it and you could probably even put it on automatic and hold it there dont you see next day you say what the hell am i doing with this picture throw it under the bed you know but pictures of course are completely unnecessary for any kind of recall at all which is probably about the only change there has been from the definition of book one clear the other change is that clear apparently is theoh not apparently its truehes the original electric eel so on and apparently affect physical objects without half trying in that state that is to say you can warm something up or something this isnt phenomena that you would consider even very good phenomena i mean it isnt very advanced dont you see now you can see very easily that throwing lightning bolt couldnt be very much of trick it merely depends on practice in holding your position if you could hold your position very accurately why you could throw lightning bolt thatd probably char the empire state building but thats beside the point thats justthats just theoretical what youve got here in actual fact is that thingsthat by staring at things you can make them warm and things like this you know you pick up aheres glass with some ice in it you know you stare at it for few minutes and you havent got glass with ice in it its the warmest cocacola you have ever had anything to do with dont you see this isthis is very very lowscale phenomena its just monkey business but there isnti was just giving you the departures on the one hand the eidetic recall and that sort of thing considered desirable and so forth actually vanishes you just get knowledge and you can put it back there so you can read it again but why do you see and the other thing is that there is an energy phenomenon which was not forecast in the first book im just bringing you up to date on the data theres energy phenomenais forecastnot even mentioned until two or three years after the first book then we began to mention energy phenomena of some kind or another but you apparently can do various things in this particular direction its long way to go you start reaping benefits from this sort of thing way before you start reaching any kind of an ultimate condition and those benefits are sometimes quite amusing you suddenly realize that you longer have bangbang whatever it was you see and you say why im notand as matter of fact i havent had it for month you know negative gain you stop hitting yourself on the head with hammer and then you pass up into your gains in other words the basic phenomena of case gain is negative gain its apparently negative gain which also takes place in terms of positive ability and the ability seems very natural to you and you dont miss the headache see on the one hand you dont miss your headache and on the other hand why you dont question the fact that you have regained an ability so people going up the line like this are not in case of startlement or golly look how much better i am you know and gee yeah gosh yeah boy am i getting wonderful you know and so on theyre not in that state of mind at all if persyou saw person in that frame of mind and saying those things and so forth why you begin to wonder if he hadnt hit an end word that says wonderful or something you know on the one hand he takes his renewed abilities for granted his new energy levelthat is to say his new ability to act or move or reason or ferret things outhe takes that all for granted you see thats just natural see and its been natural for day you know andbut its just natural and on the other hand the hole in his stomach and the pain in his back and so forth these things are gone and of course like motherinlaw you dont want her back but you wouldnt think of it coming back because you havent got them do you follow so you see on the one hand you have an undetected negative gain because its gain by absences and on the other hand you have an undetected increasing ability because its naturalbecause its your ability anyhow theres nothing unnatural about the two actions so an individual sometimes has to get down and think rather hard and you say well have you had any case gains lately and hed have to think about it and hed say well yes ive had some case gains lately yes he knows that well what were these case gains well lets see he sort of has to mock up what was wrong with him you see last week what was wrong with him last week lets see what did he have last week what was he moaning and groaning about last week well its hard to remember because you see he doesnt have to worry about moaning and groaning about it again because he knows it isnt going to happen to him again and he suddenly remembers well since last week ive been able to see yeah yeah thats right i couldnt see before last weekend yeah ive had case gain but its taken for granted and that is the factor you want to look for in case gains if you think as an auditor your pc should always be patting you on the back in high degree of euphoria thats just what it iseuphoria meaning gleeful happiness about something you know oh dear you are wonderful audi i always look at pc when he starts telling about that man oh you are wonderful auditor you are so magnificent oh auditor i worship you what the hell have i run into here and one of the things i know about it is that in three days its going to collapse thats athats bank phenomenon and it is simply going to destimulate you know everything destimulates in from three to ten days ordinarily and so on i remember the first pc that ever did this to you know i felt rather uneasy about this you know they felt so wonderful you know and i ooooooh you know what is this and three days later that pc couldnt have been scraped off the pavement but anyway your negative gain proposition makes it sometimes rather difficult but sometimes now and then you will get positive mechanical phenomenon which is suddenly called to your attention you say this tone arm doesnt rise anymorelike i just told you few minutes ago this tone arm is blowing down now only 25 thats blowdown the needle throws dial wide at sensitivity 2 but returns meter doesnt act like that see yousuddenly you will getyoull get an outside or external measurement you see probably there are lots of these things youll probably get up along the line and get clear as bell so they ping you and theyyoull ring for hours and youll be talking to somebody rather excitedly and explaining to them how you really dont take all the garbage cans and put them in the basement that you put them outside and he wont quite understand what youre talking about and then you realize that the person has got red flush on his face person is quite feverish as matter of fact youll suddenly say oh i shouldnt talk to him quite that sincerely and say well thats all right just remember after whileyou know put the garbage cans out back and you go walking out you go on talking to him very much longer youre going to have fried homo sap you got the idea be too much for him and youll in other words get an external measure see that will be the external measure of the thing see youll be running machine and this machine will benot firing on something you know and so its not firing on this and so on and thats that and so forth ooooh its just that thats it then the machine purrs off and you sit down and you say what the hell did i do see you get the external phenomenon sometimes feed back on you but you begin to be able to perceive external relationships and see the difference in their relationship to yourself between the reaction of things to yourself and so forth youll notice such thing as youre talking to group of people and theyre all listening to you very nicely and theyre all very interested and very cheerful with you and so forth and youll notice one of them starts to talk to the same group and they dont listen got the idea they start chattering amongst themselves hes saying things quite as interesting as you were saying well whats this you sort of scratch your head and you could saybe very reasonable about it and say well he isnt as popular as i am ah lets not pat yourself on the back so hard his communication level isnt as high as yours you see youre probably going out on three four five communication channels simultaneously see hes going out on one vocal communication channel do you understand i mean youre starting to run into some other factors that you dont quite yet have grip of you dont quite know what these things are but you notice that theres difference see you notice theres difference between you talking to somebody and another person talking to the same person dont you see and youll notice all of sudden that your room is neat and didnt used to be you might notice this comparison dont you see but everything seems to be in applepie order all the time then you begin to notice that youve got more time but then youll also notice that you havent got enough time you begin to notice something is wrong with your time factor and thats because youve noticed other people acting in the same time span and you yourself are acting in slightly different time span than theyre acting in in other words your perception of second has become different than their perception of second dont you see this doesnt throw you into any disagreement its just something that you see you just notice this and these things will flick across your awareness or consciousnessoh every few days or few weeks youll run into one of these things you see and they arent all good they arent all good you maybe have not looked at some sphere or some dynamic someplace in existence and you just have never looked there and then you will look there and you say oh and youll feel sort of ill and for moment you know you feel sort of like withdrawing you know and dont want much to do with that dont you see then you begin to look it over and you understand it better and so on and you very rapidly get familiar with it but you get little startslittle shocks well how in the name of god could they be so cruel as that you see youve never noticed that theres tremendous cruelty going on in some section or another youve not been aware of the fact that that is apparently standard behavior in that activity you say wow shocker the other big shock that i had was just very short time ago i sat as innocent as could be i was happily plotting away and working out the logical reduction for common denominators of behavior and i found out the common denominator of behavior was degree of awarenesswhich you can put down if you want to as very interesting datum its the degree of awareness is the thing in common to all life in other words there is level called aware see or awareness thatsits degrees of awareness and the difference between person and person b regardless of the other phenomena is their degree of awareness so that is not as aware as b or something of that sort dont you see or hes aware of different things and then man as he advances up along the line therefore goes over across certain points there are certain things of which he would become aware in order to get case advance in other words if you skip one or two or three of those then he cant become aware of this higher one so i was just plotting it all the way down to the public i was plotting this scale of awareness which is what it takesyou know your old know to mystery scale and your subzero tone scale and all that sort of thingi was using this kind of thing and running into these things and replotting it and straightening it out trying to get this bridge down to homo sapiens you see youre not aware of the fact that youve advanced anywhere along the line particularly youre hard at work and youve got lot of things to do and lot of responsibility and that sort of thing and youre just working along and you dontaware that youve been opening gap theres gap occurring behind you see youre not noticing these negative gains you see and these positive gains and this gap is getting wider and wider and wider and then one day you say well happily happily were turning around lets plot this down where does this preclear lie and you reach and you reach say what the hell hes not on any scale im doing here all right lets do theoretical scale of all of this and lets run it right straight on down and lets find out where this thing is and boy i got thirtytwo levels below zero give you some kind of an ideathis is not the final scale at all figure to make its just this is research in progress but the twentyeighth level below zero is criminal see so we obviously arent there because hes still functional hes to some degree functional see he drives cars and smokes cigarettes and he does this but there he is hes twentyeight down from zeroso hei cant tell you that this is thethis only goes thirtytwo thats all ive been able to strain my brain to look see but i was figuring out these things and i was replotting what we know in these lower subscales and upper scales and so forth and what were the various phenomena meeting up with this and i went into another one like i went last year i suddenly found myself looking at the human race and it was horrible shock i never had quite looked see not to that degree and i felt rather weird and i guess i went around in the doldrums for about twentyfour hours you know i didnt like this i finally got used to looking at it and i got over it to realize that you could process dog then that sounds like funny conclusion doesnt it and it didnt compare the human race to dog but i had to immediately relate it becauselook look look i was dealing with the average public preclear at ten or twelve levels below communication well it was more than that but youre at least ten or twelve levels below communication oooooohh well how the devil are you going to give this individual an auditing command howhowhow can you grapple with this thing at all dont you see and that was part of the aghastness iswell if you havent got communication then your communication processes wont reach him and then matter what auditing command you gave and so forth whyyou see all of sudden you dont have an auditing command that you can give because you couldnt give an auditing command because you havent got communication line so how in the name of common sense do you process him and anton was talking last night about running give that hand on dog we got to talking about dogs and that little vixie that you see around hereof course the society at the present moment is going to do to vixie if we dont watch it what they normally do to psychotic who starts to get well because these bands through which they come up are not social bands see theres few propitiative unaware cavedin bands mixed up amongst them theyre sort of resting places you see an individual is kind of inoffensive you know yeah yeah yeah well hes good boy now you see they get psychotics this way with electric shock one psychotic that had been displayed as marvelous cure and so forth on stage before whole hall full of psychiatrists and so forthand newspaper reporter asked him wellyou know your newspaper reporter had more sense than the psychiatrists he said to the guyhe said well how do you feel about all this and the fellow said well i bloody well learned to keep my mouth shut so start to make gamewe had one like this in new york some field auditor up in new york would process this girl and bring her up to point of where she was just tearing the whole place apart see and i mean literally you know and the family would instantly institutionalize her and theyd get her some shocks and knock her down again field auditor would get ahold of her process her up the line again you see and shed just start tearing the place apart you see and the family would institutionalize her and put her in straitjacket you see and then shed get out finally and the field auditor would get ahold of hersome other field auditor seeand theyd run some process on her and theyd get her up to this point again you see and they could never get her up to point of going into what would be motion for that particular level you see without the family suppressing it so little vixie is probably running into this band right now because im trying to teach vixie how to talk and of course vixies idea of talking is quite boisterous and shes gotten so that she will talk about most anything but its always in the same bark but its very loud and her increase in communication is expressed of course in the amount she will communicate and the duration of the communication you seethe volume and duration so shes getting better in terms of volume and duration heres this little dogthis very short tiny little doglittle corgi dwarf she just has gotten from point of you know of purring slightly and so forth when she is very pleased or something like this well shes gotten to point now where she runs into mary sues room looks demandingly at the mantle where she knows some candy is kept for her you see and then just barks like the devil see shes saying of course give some candy damn it and i brought cat up along the line once old john w campbell jr and so forth was really the source of this because he hated cats and he used to kick this cat and this cat was nice little calico cat so forth so i just simply processed the cat up to point where the cat every time john w campbell jr would sit down would go over and tear his shoe laces open you see and then if john made motion with his foot why the cat would just score his ankles up gorgeously and finally that cat had him in full retreat actually i brought the cat up to point where the cat would obey commands which is almost impossible with cats and so forth it came when you whistled and do various tricks along this particular line it had very good recognition level and so forth very veryselfdeterminism of that cat just went up through the stars but it was just run on reach and withdraw basis and i got the cat to reach more and got the cat to reach more and got the cat to reach more and got the cat to reach more and finally the cat was coming uptone all the way i know these things about processing then an inarticulate person who is relatively out of communication and when i say person just take it as what i intended complete short circuit because youre looking at somebody who happens to be able to erect machinery because of vocal cords to say things which are more meaningful than dogs bark i know this brands one as antisocialtype activity quite on the contrary because my worry was mainly about how do you reach them see how can youbecause id suddenly seen my god thereyou know that gap behind is too big and how we going to bridge that gap well weve already got them weve got give that hand weve got body mimicry weve gotwe can perfect bunch of reach and withdraw things but more important than that we know now exactly what various strata the public will respond to they will respond to such things as suffering they will respond to various other things hope is very high scale and worseningtheres whole band there where an individual would become aware of the fact that worsening could occur and all youd have to talk to him about would be worsening and this would perform very very difficult feat for an auditor if an auditor didnt have this scale and therefore the scale is going to take little time to completely adjust ill release it in an unadjusted form but when youre getting down the line like that youthesethese levels tend to jam theyre hard to recognize which one is the upper level which one is the lower level when you get down toward the bottom exactly how do these things fit well experience will tell exactly how these things fit and itthethe pattern is more or less correct dont you see but you get way down there and youre liable to have trouble you know skip band accidentally there is band there and youve skipped band and frankly its very easy to handle because its merely awareness of what can the person be aware of so if the person is at bandwell just some artificial numberband you see why then they would improve in case if they could become aware of band b and then becomeimprove in case again if they could become aware of c dont you see so it would merely be means of making the person aware now we could get carried away with this sort of thing and become far far far too enthusiastic because youve got such bands there as hysteria and this band suffering is quite an interesting band an individual gets up to point where he can suffer and thats fairly hightoned lot of institutional cases are lying around complaining mainly about the fact they cant feel anything well they must be just below suffering or they wouldnt be aware of the fact that they werent reaching suffering so youre processing in that particular characterwithout putting the person under duress but this is why the psychiatrist when he has any luck at all with electric shock is being fortunate you see hes just accidentally picked person out of these many bandspicked the person up whose next band for increase is suffering so therefore he givesmakes him suffer and the person has case gain do you follow but if you took person who was up here on the upper what we consider scientology bands and you made him suffer he jolly well wouldnt have case gain hed become quite upset do you follow so anyway looking at the broad panorama of the human race and so on one is apparently on gradient scale that goes down to nonarticulate unawareness of various lower lower lower lower lower degrees in other words the awareness is getting less less less less less less less less less and i realized afterwards that we had it pretty well whipped because all you have to doit is scale of awareness this is what you have to know about it you see it is scale of awareness and therefore if you find person anyplace on that scale of awareness then the next action which you have to do in order to give him case gain is to make him aware of the next level above that now it doesnt say then that you would necessarily sit down across from him and process him do you follow you wouldnt give him auditing commands or something you mightyou mightit might be as dim as you sit onhehes sitting on bed and youre sitting on anon chair and whenever he makes an accidental move of some kind or another you make the same movesomething like this this would increase an awareness but that would be about as low as you could get with process and that would be type of mimicry you see he does something you do something and therefore he becomes aware that hes doing it because he sees you doing it hey what do you know he said i very often nod my head ah yeah ah what do you know hm hm hmcase gain see hes little more in control of this thing oh but below this there would betheres all of the phenomena of awareness applies and that phenomena is not the phenomena of communication but the phenomena of an increasing perimeter awareness is always matter of an increasing perimeter now it can increase into delusion which is one of the things that bugs you in other words he can become more and more delusive further and further away from him see well that would be an inverted awareness so that sort of upsets one then he doesnt quite understand what is this scale see called awareness because this fellow sure is getting more and more delusive and here is this person that thinks that every time he thinks the wrong thought why thousands of people die in poughkeepsie you see well thats certainly long reach well yes its reach into delusion but then you have to state that what you mean by this is youve got to increase their awareness in the direction of sanity or reality in other words youve got to increase their awareness in the direction of real increase of awareness thats the thing of dont invalidate any more than you have to reactive bank you see dont worry about that reactive bank get the reality on the line thats an old rule dont process the person in the direction of getting more and more unreal i process him in the direction of becoming more and more real so you see having nightmares every night would be an improvement if he had ithad them only once week do you follow so hehisawareness would be changed by the degree that you could simply increase his perimeter of actuality or his perimeter of reality so it still holds to real perimeter and what do you mean by perimeter it means an expanding circle concentric circle youd have circlea pc is let us say imagined to be standing in the middle of circle which is one inch in diameter and by expanding the perimeter you would mean well you now have circle two inches in diameter you see and now we getcan get circle that is one foot in diameter youll find that psycho quite ordinarily is unaware of anything beyond the reach of his fist thats very peculiar but the real heif anything is further away than the knuckles of his fist from him he is not aware of it beyond that point delusion sets in so what youve got to do is increase his awareness beyond those knuckles dont worry about the fact that he can only reach to the knuckles you see dont try to do too much about that just try himto get him to reach as far as an extended finger in other words awareness has to do with perimeters an expanding perimeter the person is more and more aware of more and more inside bigger and bigger circle or sphere do you follow well youve got an individual who could only be aware of what was going on on hiswellaround the skin of his face well you might be able to get him up to point of where he would be aware of aof aa wall which was close beside his head do you follow well that would be an increased perimeter see youve only got that few inches from the thetan to the skin of his head then we increase it that extra inch see by having him become aware of wall which is one inch further away than his head you got it now we could increase that again by another inch dont you see and youd get some sort of an well ill give you an idea in 8c for instance which ran with the persons arm further and further away from him when he touched the wall do you follow that you flatten twofoot 8c see and then you flatten threefoot 8c and then you flatten fourfoot 8c dont you understand itd just be how much further the walls were away from him and then you get an expanding perimeter of awareness well naturally he will come up through then the bank from the bottom right straight on up to the top and oddly enough so would any living being and theres not much communication involved in it because in 8c or give that hand or some such process as that if he does not execute the auditing commandyou speak it but if he does not execute itthen you execute it for him with his body and you can keep doing this and he suddenly gets communication here and he recognizes that there is some connection between your speaking and his acting you see and that would be tremendous cognition and unfortunately you could take many grocers clerk out here and find out that that would be great cognition for him that there isthere is coordination between the customers order and filling it hes doing it all the time but hes never noticed this so the other thing we get is you can have action without awareness and weve had that around for years weve said social conduct and social machinery and that sort of thing actually you can have action without awareness sounds pretty wild but you could haveyou could have person who ate and dressed and went to the office and did work and so forth and never knew anything about it didnt know thing about it and wed call to his attention that he was going to the office and going to work and nobody has even noticed this about him sudden sort of blankness would have occurred across his eyes you see it ticks the next level of awareness of some kind or another youd say well fellow like you day after day going to work and coming back home again must get pretty bored with life and so on itsall of sudden you get sort of dull look in his eyes huh never occurred to you called it to his attention that hes doing repetitive action hes never considered it repetitive action before in fact hes never noticed that he was doing it well you take person with bad tic they quite often do not know they have bad tic and sometimes when you mimic tic somethingthe tic vanishes because the person becomes aware of the fact he has tic they very often do this somebody will come in whowith awith awith broken leg and complain to you about his headache he hasnt noticed hes got broken leg do you see and this is awareness it is what the individual is aware of and what the individual is doing are not the same thing ever you got it that was why man couldnt make any forward progress in the human mind in spite of fifty thousand years of headaches do you follow that therefore the observation of conduct of the person will not diagnose the person unless you have little secret scale of your own in other words youd have to know the secret of what the mest universe dictates as gradient scale man of course didnt have that so you follow this an observation of conduct will not lead you to solution of situation i think its quite remarkable when you get right down and look at it because its one of mans most fixed ideas that all you have to do is observe conduct and you know all about it and he just jolly well keeps falling on his head with that conclusion homo sap cant get anyplace as long as hes got that stupid conclusion so that you get all their mental healing sciences and that sort of thing socalled and so on over the years were based on observation of conduct that was the doctor was supposed to observe the patients conduct and then diagnose that and then cure it accordingly and in some instances they happily crosssectioned something that illogically fitted with something else and they would call it something because they could produce slight effect upon it dont you see but usually they just observed the conduct and labeled it and then of course they couldnt do anything about it so whats had mental science quote absent on this planet and in this universe actually has been this fact that by observing conduct you cannot establish an accurate diagnosis and if you uniformly diagnose inaccurately you cant of course then have any sort of remedy to apply to the situation and if you did have the right remedy and did all your diagnosis by conduct you would wind out never applying the right remedy to the person you follow that and that would be what the situation has been you cannot watch joe blink activities and then know that joe blink is bangbang or know that he is paranoid dipso dementia praecoxo see or psychiatrico nutto or something see the reason this girl keeps going to the water fountain is shes thirsty you see and you base this diagnosis on the fact that theres atheres gymnastico potto is firebug and is uncomfortable when they are absent from water and so this person is seen to be going to water rather routinely so you say hes gymnastico potto you see that had nothing to do with the case whatsoever the case happened to be thirsty case is stuck in an engram actually which is in the middle of the sahara desert and theyre member of the french foreign legion see and they know at that moment they are member of the french foreign legion and is awfully thirsty and that their water bottle has run out see and the trouble with this person is this person can be aware of allall that they can be aware of and so forth is privation they can be aware of not having anything see thats the diagnosis you see well they can at least have water and the remedy of the case might take an entirely different thing than water or thirst or fire or something associated with water thats just that its just something else but the conduct would not be direct entrance to it as matter of fact that one is too direct trouble with psychosis is its psychotic its very hard to understand but the moment that you grasp this one principle about psychosis and about neurosis and about other mental disabilities and so forth or about being homo sapiens you get this as stable datum and youve got it thatdont diagnose by conduct ever dont dont draw any conclusion from conduct thisjust skip that because thats going to be blind alley what you want now if you see some conduct that you didnt expect then all you know at that moment is that you dont know about something see but that is something to know now instead of jumping in there with bunch of pretended knowingness and say hes gymnastico psychatrico potto squigo you see and thats whats wrong with the case see with great pomposity and why hes gymnasticopotto you know and so forth and you will find that written in the text of mr wumphgulum yes damn it the person is still in an institution you get thebut this terrific false pomposity you see of giving them some beautiful label because they have some conduct or another doesnt lead to solution and its bad science the physical sciences have gotten ahead because they long ago left the various schools of astronomy and so forth which said there couldnt possibly be an eighth planet because seven is the perfect number thats actually true in thein the annals of astronomy that statement was said all kinds of wild things well when science departed from that and says well when you dontwhen something isnt working you havent got the answer thats all science had to find to become science and from that moment on why the physical sciences have advanced by leaps and bounds because when they find something doesnt work or the situation didnt resolve and so forth they dont sit back with great pomposity and say well thats the einsteinian pocomoco they say well hell that must be wronger than threedollar confederate note lets see what is the reason behind this see what law is applying here you see they have the advantage of having the workable thing right out in front of their face and they can see whether it works or doesnt work you see but you start substituting an authoritative utterance you see for resolution of the situation anyou can go mad and that is psychosis and thats where the mental sciences were parked when we came alongright there now this goes further than that when youre trying to find out about some pc in order to run some process on the pc or straighten the pc out somehow or another and you base what you do on the conduct of the pc other than his good and bad indicatorsgood and bad indicators conduct thats the visible fact of are you going the right way or the wrong way thats just few little road signs but you base what you do on what the pc is doing and youll goyoull go round the bend right along with the psychiatrist this pc is nattering at you so obviously conduct would indicate that you must have done something wrong this is one of the hardest things that an auditor has to learn the pc is nattering at him nah ive had better auditors than you and so forth back in the coaudit nyanya see and we get all this mad dissertation and so on well if the auditorcan take that as an indicator see now he knows that he doesnt know there is datum there he doesnt know just forget about the missed withhold aspect of it theres something he doesnt know about this pc you just ask this pc is there something about you i dont know you dont have to worry about the mechanics of missed withholds you see youve uttered the utterance which is true and thats the truest utterance he is behaving in some way which you didnt expect so therefore there is something about him you didnt know now the remedy of the situation is what about you didnt i know brother well nyahnyah wellwellwell you could put it that way and so forth well i ate your lunch today thats why you couldnt find it so when you seewhen you see conduct that is not understood by you dont give it label dont give it label know this thing nowknow this thing about that know that you dont know and learn to be humble enough to admit when you dont know something otherwise youll just go on being authoritative and pomposity will rampant itself all over the place do you follow if every time you saw some situation that you didnt understand and because you had to maintain your dignity or your classification or something you promptly said ah that is gumbo potto gymnastico yees hmmm youre being fool because the situation isnt going to resolve that situation will not resolve because the only thing that keeps the situation from resolving is the unknowness or unawareness so if the scale of sanity of course is awareness all the way up then the scale of aberration as you go down is degree of increasing unawareness so the nuttier they are the more unaware both that person and yourself would be regarding whats going on and the more unaware they get why the harder they are to handle because it is hard to get their attention long enough to find out what you dont know not to find out something to know but to find out what you dont know you understand you get into tremendous blur of the dont knows man are skywide and deep see yourwhen you got person thats way down at the other end of this scale of awareness why the degree of unawareness you see is fabulous so just trying to getyoure just trying to push at the person enough so that he will become aware enough so that you can find out enough to find out what you dont know about the person do you understandwould be the entrance point now the gain would be is what can i now find out about this person and what can this person find out about himself and by increasing that awareness scale as you come up the line of course the individual will get saner and saner and brighter and brighter and come back to battery and become more aware be himself and his old abilities will come back and hell lay aside some umptyump trilliontrilliontrillions of pure mud he all of sudden will be himself but as of course he comes up the scale and becomes aware of something hell hit various dynamic situations that he becomes aware of see and sometimes these are little bit hard to take sometime somebody who has been howling around about his family and how his family was mean to him and that sort of thingone fine day wakes up to the fact that its great probability that his family never even saw him in all the years he was with them and that all of his propitiation and figuring and striving and struggling was all in vain because he was dealing with mama and papas and sisters and aunts that never would have seen it if it had turned into thousand dollar bill under their noses see they never would have become aware of johnnie and when you realize how far one might well have taken his life off of its normal course in order to do something that somebody like that would approve of its horrible shock to realize that such persons would never have noticed it to approve of it and then this becomes even more complex as they very often would have approved of things that hadnt happened at all give one tremendous sense of unreality dear johnnie im so very glad you have been made general lately and the guy was just dismissed with dishonorable discharge you know it can get that gappy sometimes one doesnt detect them and one sometimes falsely pretends on these things and accepts things or statements from people which have bearing or reality on what is going on so this study of awareness of what can somebody be aware of is quite subject and what youyou have to eat humble pie you see to begin this subject at all you have to know that there is something in the universe you dont know and that for person who is way downscale is the most dangerous utterance that he could possibly make because hes already totally sealed off from everything and if everyone realized how blind he was and so forth of course theyd just eat him up so he compensates for his unawareness by automatic mechanisms of pretense and youll find some bird thats way downscale like that and my god the things he knows that he doesnt know are fabulous and the last thing in the world he wouldnt have courage enough to say well i dont know anything about that and yet he cant resolve any situation until he says well what do you know ive got an area where i dont know see at that moment he can make tremendous amount of progress because then he can start pulling on that area and taking look at it you see and hell all of sudden find something in that area thatd be quite surprising and quite interesting and quite necessary for him to locate so when you see somebody behaving oddly why the first thing and really the only thing you know is that theres something there you dont know theres something both you and he aretheres something youre certainly unaware of and there is something where he is probably unaware that he is unaware of it now hell cover that up with pretended awareness which doesnt exist and you get these various delusive things this becomes very fascinating study and you have to keep yourself very steady on this and you have to look atlook atover situation and its going rahrrahrrahrrahr dhudhudthu bop plop you know and it looks like one of yellowstone parks geysers you know about to explode and so on its going to explode you dont know you dont know whats going on but there is way to know something about it there is way to know something about it and this is quite trick after youve gone through the valley of despond and despair you can come up on the other side and heres aheres new trick there is something you can know about it about anything that you confront there is something you can know there is something you can know about that thing you can know that you dont know and that is the first thing you should know about it so you know now theres something about the situation that you dont know so now you will take the action to find out and just in the process of finding out the whole thing will clarify its the most magical thing you ever observed in your life thats that first thing so there is something you can know about anything there is something you can know about the internal government of russia never read textbook on it never looked at it nothing but there is something you can know about it you can know that you dont know what it is now knowing that you dont know what it is and so forth why you can get ahold of little textbook or something and you can also know this you can know that that guy doesnt know either but heres the amazing thing about aberration and heres where you come in and wheresheres where this is very very valuable if you did find out the internal government of russia would either go clear or collapse that sounds utterly impossible but happens to be true so running an engram out of organizations running an engram out of the individual running somebody clear and so forth would be to simply continue to pull into view something he didnt know about and the only way you could fail to pull something into view and so forth would be consistently to suppose that you knew all there was to know about it and there wasnt anything else for you to learn at all about this because therell always be some curve on it even though you knew the whole bank the end words very often have become upside down and backwards and reconnectedalthough they will run straight according to plot and so forththe upsidedownness and backwardness of the arrangements the way hes got them squashed up will make quite different situation you dont know what hes got stacked up where thats one of the things you dont know do you see well you can find all these things out so on the basis of it this has been very well worthwhile and becoming clear you might say is process of becoming more and more aware and you become up to point of where you also become aware of where you are unaware and you see that rather quickly and then when you notice one of those why you either decide that it isyou should find out or it doesnt make any difference you see whether you do or not and if its some area where you should find out you can pull on it very quickly and magically will appear into view the doggonedest situation that you never suspected before and when you pull that situation into view it quite normally collapses all by itself now i suppose as some of us cross this band and get onto the other side we start asking questions of the human racewere not quite sure what will happen but that wont excuse you from studying to get there on your own steam but great deal of realivrevelation does occur its not always palatable not always nice to find out these thingsbut the clearer you get why the shorter time you find it distasteful and the more familiar you can be with it well i hope itll help you out somehow or another in handling pcs and processing and understanding the human race to realize that they go thirty two levels below zero and i dont think ive hit bottom yet we probably are merely to the upper class of the society but then im just being snide thank you very much
