compete dire ctly with the insurgents propaganda it must also compete fo r space within the information market this demands proactive and assertive approach we must fight the information war as relentlessly as we fight the physical war an d we must fight it continuously isaf stratcom will therefore adhere to the fol lowing principles abe first with the truth we must get accurate information on isaf activities to external audiences key leaders and the media as soon as possib we must beat the insurgents and their supporters to the headlines and p reempt propaganda and rumors we cannot just be accurate and truthful we must be first we cannot mislead in doing so we must remain trusted source of reli able information we will acknowledge inadvertent casualties damage and mist akes and then explain what we do to avoid them and what we will do in the f uture to do better we must also hold the media and influential communicators accountab for accuracy and context bfocused and proactive targeting all stratcom is conducted for purpose and should therefore be clearly focused to achieve the desired effect we must plan for and anticipate future events preplanned stratcom themes and messages delivered in support of known or likely events or operations help set or shape the conditions we desire we will analyse each target audience identify key means of influencing that audience and then pursue those means pro actively and persistently we will build relationships with key opinion leaders as required finally we must demonstrate the agility to exploit tactical events for stratcom effect the insurgents have demonstrated significant capabi lity in this regard and we must be equally adept we must be rapidly capitalize on good stories to our benefit and exploit insurgent activity to undermine them cunity of voice isaf will portray consistent and coherent perspective across ll levels of command whilst the level of detail and point f emphasis will vary the themes must remain consistent isaf will also seek to ensure th at its information remains consistent with higher headquarters in nato and is coo rdinated or shared as appropriate with oef unama and ic partners in afghanistan 3densure actions match words we must ensure we do what we say we do our actions will invariably have greater impact than what we communicate verbally or in writing consistency between video and audio will rei nforce our stratcom messages and maintain isaf credibility ecounter disinformation and correct misinformation in an environment where fact is hard to come by and where insecurity hampers access rumour misinformation and disinformation flourish the longer f alse piece of information is circulating without response the greater the likelihoo d of it being accepted as fact isaf will therefore firmly and rapidly counter disinforma tion and correct misinformation to achieve this frequent messaging from regio nal commands rc is required and should include not just the hard facts but also the human interest vignettes that bring the facts to life fbe culturally appropriate isaf will communicate with target audiences in ways that are culturally sensitive and effective isaf stratcom activi ties will ensure respect for afghan culture and traditions cultural advisors wi ll be integrated to maximum extent to ensure accurate and appropriate stratcom themes nd messages wherever possible afghans supported by isaf will be used to define and present messages to afghan audiences gbuilding afghan capacity competence and credibility winning is about afghan capacity competence and credibility isaf stratcom with in means and capabilities and in cooperation with the nato scrs office and other international actors will focus on improving afghan capacity and competence in stratcom additionally isaf stratcom will attempt to give maximum credit t afghan institutions whenever possible isaf will seek to reinforce th capacity of the government centre for media
