from phil jones pjonesueaacuk to tom wigley wigleyucaredu subject re t data date mon 28 oct 2002 155007 0000 cc ben santer santer1llnlgovtosbornueaacuk xflowed tom talked to tim re the sd field can you read the following j climate 10 25482568 before you come so you know how tim infilled the sd field hadcm2 data was used this would seem to bias any model validation to this model also it would seem odd to validate any model in region where there is data in region that had to be infilled i can see that global fields make things simpler but they will need to constructed in the best possible way in 1997 we thought the best way was to use model but our aim then was different from yours cheers phil at 0604 281002 0700 tom wigley wrote phil thanx i need to see if cmip has the height fields for models ben tom _______________________________ phil jones wrote tom heres the file that you should have got back in september it is 19812000 where this could be calculated and 196190 elsewhere the other fields already sent enable you to know where the 196190 field has been used all you need to overcome the problem of this being surface temperatures is to get 5 by 5 degree average height field i have emailed mark new to see if he has 1 by 1 degree height field which could then be averaged mark must have had this at some stage he has 10 minute height field for the world which im sure he has degraded to 1 degree i have landsea mask at 1 by 1 degree so am hoping mark has the heights with this all you will need is the model height fields as for the sds it would be possible to produce this for period like 19812000 or 196190 but both would have gaps probably exactly the same as in the climatology the options to consider here are 1 period 19812000 or 196190 2 how many years in each needed to get an sd 3 how to infill the gaps tim osborn must have infilled the gaps for the errors paper in 1997 as we needed complete field of variances he did this by blending some model data hadcm2echam3 probably with the real observations most areas get infilled easily big problem is the southern oceans and the antarctic also central arctic i will talk to tim we can discuss this more when you come cheers phil ps i should have some results from anders by the time you come he is comparing means sds and extremes etc of hadrm3 with real world data from 200 sites across europe only temperature variables in the first part clearly shows that for islandscoasts comparisons must be with land points in the model weve had to move some stations to be on model land to get better comparisons islands that are not in the model have poor comparisons it is possible to see country outlines in some comparisons with either max or min temperatures corrections for elevation are needed to get over large elevational differences between stations and the model but the alps are still visible lapse rates work best only in some seasons not very good in summer max temps produce consistent difference maps modelobs over europe but mins are more erraticrandom min error is overall small but with large variability while max has larger error but low variability due to mins being more affected by local environment at 0913 271002 0700 tom wigley wrote phil re my last email i have looked at the data you sent it would be very nice to have gapless 19812000 t climatology to match the xiearkin precip climatology however this means somehow filling in the gaps in the 6190 minus 8100 differences nontrivial task so my choice in the absence of this is either gappy 8100 or full 6190 i have chosen the latter perhaps we can discuss how to produce gapless 8100 climatology when i am at cru problem with the 6190 is that it is surface and that observed surface is not equal to model surface im sure you have thought about this in the model validation context already so this is another item to discuss for precip i also have the interannual sd climatology so i can validate both the mean climate and the variability very interesting it would be nice to be able to do this with temperature especially since the mean climate for temperature in the models is pretty darn good but how good is variability is there an sd climatology for temperature that you can send cheers tom prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk name newabsref8100out newabsref8100out type plain text textplain encoding base64 prof phil jones climatic research unit telephone 44 0 1603 592090 school of environmental sciences fax 44 0 1603 507784 university of east anglia norwich email pjonesueaacuk nr4 7tj uk xflowed
