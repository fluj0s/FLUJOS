china many in search of refuge since the height of north koreas famine in the 1990s the state department estimates that 3000050000 north korean refugees currently live in china some nongovernmental organizations estimate the number is closer to 300000 and believes those who are repatriated may face punishment ranging from few months of labor correction to execution number of reports also document the difficult conditions faced by north koreans who remain in china the plight of the north koreans focuses attention not only on those seeking refuge and their refugee status but also points to the factors driving their decision to leave primarily food shortages deteriorating humanitarian conditions and human rights violati ons north korea is generally characterized as one of the worlds worst violators of human rights and religious freedom an issue that some members of congress and interest groups say should assume greater importance in the formation of us priorities towards north korea congressional concern about human rights in north korea and conditions faced by north korean refugees led to the passage of the north korean human rights act nkhra in 2004 north korean refugees in china and human rights issues are frequently raised simultaneously particularly in congressional context although the situation for north koreans seeking to leave their country and for those who remain inside its borders pose different questions and may call for separate responses both focus on the nature of the regime in pyongyang critics of the north korean government have raised both issues together to put pressure on the regime particularly when nuclear weapons program negotiations stalled some advocates do not want to link refugee and human rights issues claiming that the former calls for quieter cooperative approach while the latter requires more outspoken response to the north korean governments practices although some policy experts insist that the united states has moral imperative to stand up for the oppressed others say that this creates obstacles in the nuclear disarmament negotiations in 2007 the bush administration entered into bilateral talks with north korea and linked the prospect of diplomatic relations and pyongyangs reentry into the international community with only the nuclear issue leaving out human rights and refugee concerns nevertheless north korean human rights and refugee issues remain significant concerns and also have broader regional importance china and sout h korea want to avoid massive outflow of refugees which they believe could trigger the instability or collapse of north korea north korean refugees seeking resettlement often transit through other asian countries raising diplomatic refugee and security concerns for those governments south korea as the final destination of the vast majority of north koreans struggles to accommodate new arrivals and does not want to damage its relations with north korea this report will be updated as events warrant httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34189g16g152g155g157g145g561g13g152g155g142g138g151g561g20g142g143g158g144g142g142g156g561g146g151g561g5g145g146 g151g138g561g138g151

across its borders1 food shortages persecution and human rights abuses have prompted thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of north koreans to go to china where they often become victims of further abuse neglect and lack of protection those who remain in north korea formally known as the democratic republic of north korea or dprk also continue to suffer from lack of food and other basic humanitarian provisions both the house and senate have held hearings and passed resolutions addressing the status of the refugees additionally several members of congress have written letters regarding the issue to the us and chinese governments in 2004 the 108 th congress passed and president bush signed the north korean human rights act hr 4011 pl 108333 the north korean human rights act nkhra authorizes the president new funds to support human rights efforts improve the flow of information and to require the president to appoint special envoy on human rights in north korea it also identifies the need for humanitarian food assistance and refugee care north korea has been viewed as threat to us interests for number of important security reasons that go well beyond refugee concerns and human rights issues these include the pursuit of nuclear weapons and missile programs history of proliferating missiles reported threats to export parts of its selfdeclared nuclear arsenal and possible possession of chemical and biological weapons programs 2 north korea is also on the us list of states that sponsor terrorism3 amid an atmosphere of continuing tensions over north koreas nuclear program the potential remains for worsening humanitarian conditions and possible increase in north koreans fleeing the country the situation raises the questions of what more if anything can and should be doneby the united states and the international communitynot only to focus attention on the abuses of the dprk regime but to alleviate the suffering of north koreans increasingly some argue it is the suffering of ordinary north koreans that brings into sharp relief the continuing violation of fundamental rightsrig hts pertaining to food security refugee status and individual freedomsand raises questions abou t how those rights should be protected and by whom g18g155g152g157g142g140g157g146g151g144g561g20g142g143g158g144g142g142g156g561 china generally refuses

the international instruments that provide protection to refugees include the 1951 united nations convention relating to the status of refugees refugee convention and the 1967 protocol to that convention4 refugee is legally defined in the refugee convention as person fleeing his or her country because of persecution or owing to wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership of particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country5 parties to the refugee convention have an obligation to abide by the principle of nonrefoulement which means that contracting state shall expel or return refouler refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race religion nationality membership of particular social group or political opinion 6 china and south korea are parties to the refugee convention and its 1967 protocol north korea is not party to either instrument7

the united nations high commissioner for refuge unhcr is the agency dedicated to the protection of refugees and other populations displaced by conflict famine and natural disasters8 its mandate is to lead and coordinate international action for the protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems worldwide refugees are granted special status under international law once an individual is considered refugee that individual automatically has certain rights and states that are parties to the refugee convention and its protocol are obligated to provide certain resources and protection unhcr ensures these rights works to find permanent longterm solutions for refugees and coordinates emergency humanitarian relief for refugees and increasingly other persons of concern enforcement of the refugee convention can present challenges for example the national laws of state may not be developed sufficiently to allow full implementation of the provisions of the refugee convention often becoming party to the refugee convention is first step and unhcr serves as an important resource sometimes the refugee convention may contradict bilateral agreements between states such as the repatriation agreement between north korea and 4 under the 1951 convention mainly europeans involved in events occurring before 1 january 1951 could apply for refugee status in response to the emergence of large refugee movements since 1951 the 1967 protocol incorporates the measures in the original 1951 convention but imposes time or geographical limits for texts please see

status of refugees chapter 1 article 331 the issue of nonrefoulement is also considered part of customary international law 7 countries that are used as escape routes by north koreans include cambodia which is party to the refugee convention and its protocol and laos vietnam burma thailand and mongolia all of which are not parties to either instrument 8 unhcr was established by the general assembly resolution 428 v of december 14 1950 and made operational in 1951

later in this report from unh crs point of view international law overrides other bilateral agreements but governments may not agree unhcr may try to assist in creating solution or states may use ad hoc procedures to determine whether an individual has well grounded fear of persecution and thus is prot ected from deportation unhcr often works with governments behind the scenes in asylum cases to push for application of the principles of the refugee convention and protection of the rights of the individual even though there may not be agreement on legal jurisdiction9

population located in china estimates range from as low as 10000 the official chinese estimate to 300000 or more 11 press reports commonly cite figure of 100000 300000 in 2006 the state department estimated the number to be between 30000 and 50000 down from the 75000 to 125000 range it projected in 2000 unhcr also uses the 2006 range 30000 50000 as working figure unhcr has not been given access to conduct systematic survey estimating the numbers is made more difficult because most north koreans are in hiding some move back and forth across the bordereither voluntarily to bring food and or hard currency from china or north koreaor because they are forcibly repatriated amnesty international has estimated that on average each year about 10 of those who cross the border back to north korea do so as result of force much smaller number is esti mated to make their way to third countries 12 clearly the refugees need to avoid detection coupled with lack of access by international organizations make it difficult to assess the full scope of the refugee problem however based on anecdotal reports the number of people crossing the border does not seem to have overwhelmed the resources of the chinese economy in part because the movement has been gradual g9g142g151g141g142g155g561g20g142g153g155g142g156g142g151g157g138g157g146g152g151g561 according to some recent reports it is thought that nearly 75 percent of the refugees are women 13 unhcr says the number of males may be underestimated and they may be in hiding but the proportion of women among those hoping eventually to resettle in south korea is striking 9 for more information see crs report rl31690 united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr by rhoda margesson and johanna bockman 10 some of the research

reportedly 50 percent of the refugees were women four to five years ago 20 percent were women it has become trend but the reasons are unclear in north korea the conditions of poverty and failed marriages could also be contributing factors as to why women choose to leave an element of family reunification for men who left several years ago may also be factor some also believe that men may be more tied to their enterprises which could make them less mobile g5g152g151g141g146g157g146g152g151g156g561g146g151g561g5g145g146g151g138g561 g5g155g152g156g156g146g151g144g561g18g152g146g151g157g561 most north koreans are believed to enter china from north koreas northeastern provinces in search of food andor employment the destination favored by most refugees the yanbian korean autonomous prefecture of china is home to an estimated one million chinese of korean descent many of these ethnic koreans have assisted their newly arrived north korean kin for mix of reasons including family connections financial motivations sense of altruism and desire to reciprocate the help that north koreans gave those korean chinese who crossed the border during the political turbulence of chinas cultural revolution in the 1960s and 1970s it is unlikely that large numbers of north korean refugees are living elsewhere in china

intermediaries who target the refugees14 human smuggling trafficking extortion and exploitation are thought to be growing problem women are particularly vulnerable to prostitution rape arranged marriages and bride traffickers many otherwise face the option of imprisonment or hunger in north korea the stat department rates north korea as tier 3 country in human trafficking the poorest rating due to the fact that it has not implemented international standards or prosecuted trafficking 15 it has also engaged in forced labor it is reported that perhaps 8090 of north koreans in china end up as trafficking victims there appears to be an increase in the numbers but this could also be attributed to greater awareness of the problem16 14 amnesty international report 2007 state department 2006

authorities but by anyone who turns them in as undocumented immigrants for payment of reward while northeast china is generally far more economically developed and stable than north korea some nongovernmental organizations ngos report the poverty in the broader region of northern china is extreme and that conditions for the poor in both china and north korea are roughly similar reports indicate that many refugees live in dire conditions forced to survive by working in menial lowpaying jobs g18g158g156g145g561g138g151g141g561g18g158g149g149g561g8g138g140g157g152g155g156g561 people cross borders for many different reasonssome choose to do so voluntarily others are forced to leave or flee as matter of life or death push and pull factors are terms used to explain why people move as in many refugee situations there are push and pull factors that influence certain people to leave their country the reasons north koreans seek refuge in china may vary based on individual circumstances but despite limited access and information it is clear that two key elements driving north koreans across the border into china include deteriorating humanitarian conditionsmainly due to food shortagesand human rights violations g8g152g152g141g561g21g145g152g155g157g138g144g142g156g561 extreme poverty within the dprk in general and food shortages in particular appear to have significant impact on movement across the border into china the dprk began experiencing food shortage of increasing severity beginning in the early 1990s after the collapse of the soviet union and the resulting cutoff of economic benefits north korea had received from the communist bloc disastrous floods in the summer of 1995 plunged the country into severe famine that by some estimates was responsibl for 600000 to two million deaths approximately 5 to10 percent of north koreas population 17 some argue food shortages are inextricably linked to the regime itself in part because food distribution favors the ruling elite and military and is tied to the governments ongoing broader political and military motivations18 in september 1995 north korea appealed for international food assistance contradicting its national ideology of juche or selfreliance shortly thereafter the united nations world food program wfp moved into north korea and its activities there gradually expanded to become at one point the wfps largest singlecountry operation until 2005 the united states was by far the largest donor to the wfps north korea operation china and south korea providedand continue to provideeven larger amounts of food bilaterally to north korea 19 17 although natural disasters were the immediate causes of the food crisis several experts have found the root causes of the famine in decades of ec onomic and agricultural mismanagement for instance see andrew natsios the great north korean famine us institute of peace washington dc 2001 especially chapters 1 and 2 among the cited policies that over time led to the famine were excessive use of chemical fertilizers and the excessive conversion of land into agricultural uses the latter practice contributed to the massive deforestation and soil erosion that led to increasingly severe annual floods moreover lack of agricultural machinery and inputs and severe energy crisis also mean that production remains well below standard 18 see us committee for human rights in north korea h unger and human rights the politics of famine in north korea by stephen haggard and marcus noland 2005 19 for more information seecrs

apparently abated by 1997 and the dprk made incremental progress in agricultural production the wfp says that food conditions worsened for most north koreans after north korea introduced economic reforms in 200220 by 2005 the wfp estimated that nearly half of north koreas 24 million people did not have enough to eat and that more than third of the population was chronically malnourished21 according to the wfp food security continues to be daily struggle for one third to one half of all north koreans in march 2007 the wfp indicated that the government had acknowledged an expected shortfall of one million metric tons of food and the possibility of willingness to increase food assistance 22 flooding and reduced wfp and bilateral food assistance in 2006 only compounded the problems that are ongoing in 2007 torrential rains between august 7 and 14 2007 caused significant and widespread flooding in nine provinces in central and northern dprk the international community provided emergency relief and conducted needs assessments and continues to monitor the humanitarian impact 23 according to the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs unocha 1 million people were affected with nearly 454 people killed 156 missing and nearly 170000 displaced typhoon between september 1720 resulted in further loss including 1649 people made homeless24

organizations have portrayed similar pa ttern of extreme human rights abuses by the north korea regime for many years25 there appears to be prospect of appreciable change at least in the near future the reports paint grim picture of human rights conditions and stress three general categories of abuse 1 total denial of political civil and religious liberties the regimes list of proscribed offenses is extensive and severe punishments are established by north korean laws and the constitution dissent or criticism of kim jongil is allowed the regime totally controls all continued nikitin 20 2004 nutritional survey conducted jointly by the north korean government and by the united nations unicef and wfp also indicated that although malnutrition rates fell significantly after the late 1990s more than onethird of the population remained malnourished and anemic it concluded that peoples growth was stunted from lack of food and nutrition in this survey among children 37 were stunted 23 were

the official media 2 severe physical abuse meted out to citizens who violate laws and restrictions the us committee for human rights in north korea published lengthy report in 2003 describing system of concentration camps organized like the soviet gulag system that houses an estimated 150000 to 200000 inmates including many political prisoners26 reports from survivors and escapees from the camps indicate that conditions in the camps for political prisoners are extremely harsh and that many political prisoners do not survive 3 other evidence of violations of human rights the state departments 2006 report cites anecdotal evidence from refugees that north korean refugees who crossed into china for strictly economic reasons were generally being treated less harshly than in past years but that the regime continued to inflict severe punishments for repatriated north koreans who went to china for political reasons had contacts with south korean groups including religious groups and sought asylum in third countries 27 recent reports by amnesty international and human rights watch confirm the state departments description of human rights conditions within north korea however human rights watch presents different description of north koreas policy toward refugees who went to china for economic reasons human rights watch asserts that north korea appears to be punishing its citizens with longer sentences in abusive prisons if they are caught crossing the border to china or have been forcibly repatriated by beijing and that this ominous hardening of policy since the summer of 2004 has been applied to all repatriated north koreans regardless of their reasons for going to china 28 the united nations confirms these findings the special rapporteur on the dprk special rapporteur states that despite some legislative improvements there are continuing reports of violations of basic freedoms such as security of the person humane treatment and justice29 according to the special rapporteur despite north koreas formal commitment to human rights in various national laws and under the hum an rights treaties mentioned the human rights situation remains grave in number of areas many violations of rights persist throughout the country and as well as in countries of first asylum 30 some of these rights are the focus of specific 26 the us committee for human rights in north korea the hidden gulag exposing north koreas prison camps 2003 27 the state department report on north korea is more general in nature than for other countries many of the specific incidents and events cited occurred in 2005 or previously this reflects the closed nature of north korean society and the difficulty in securing information on uptodate events in the country the 2006 report acknowledges the difficulties in securing information much of which comes from sources outside north korea 28 human rights watch north korea bordercrossers harshly punished on return march 20 2007 and

are each party and others are cited in numerous reports and discussion s or are part of evolving custom or practice between states north korea has not cooperated with the special rapporteur despite repeated requests in its response to the human rights council china focused mostly on its unwillingness to view illegal migrants as refugees

considers those who cross the border into china to be criminals though it is difficult to get fuller sense of how north korea views the problem it is possible that north korean leaders have calculated that the refugee situation poses little threat to the regime because the flows of refugees have been going on for years it is likely that the refugees have already been politically triaged in that most individuals of an political importance have either already left or been caught new bordercrossers could be considered politically insignificant by north koreas leadership indeed in some sense chinas prov inces have provided north korea with useful way to export its economic problems as the migration may have protected thousands more people from starvation

defection or attempted defection as capital crime stating that defector who is returned to north korea shall be committed to reform institution for not less than seven years in cases where the person commits an extremely grave concern he or she shall be given the death penalty31 it is unclear how grave concern is defined minor offenders appear to be subject to up to six months imprisonment at labor training centers where conditions are extremely harsh and inhumane enforcement reportedly varies in part due to rampant bribery and corruption inside north korea some repatriated north koreans are subjected to brutal treatment including detention torture placement in concentration camps forced labor and even execution north korean authorities are particularly brutal toward those suspected of making contact with south koreans missionary groups or other foreigners returnees who cross the border in search of food reportedly receive milder treatment many repatriated pregnant women carrying the children of chinese menoften husbands to whom the women were sold by human traffickersare reportedly subjected to forced abortions continued of those seeking asylum and the attitudes and practices

korea unhcr has received reports that some people deported one to three times by china back to north korea receive little punishment while others endure hard labor or beatings even if unhcr could assess who is at risk before deportation it would be difficult to determine and weigh the risk factors and the seeming arbitrariness of the system in north korea families are classified by loyalty to

despite being party to the refugee convention and protocol china has not allowed agencies in particular unhcr to have access to north koreans who are residing in china because it views these individuals as economic migrants rather than political refugees who cross the border illegally primarily in search of food32 unhcr has therefore been unable to determine what percentage of these individuals north koreans in china qualify as refugees but believes number may meet that definition33 in 1995 unhcr established an office in beijing under an agreement with china at the time issues were focused on limited numbers of refugees coming from vietnam during visits to the northeast in the late 1990s unhcr determined that some of the newly arrived north koreans were refugees but china saw the problem as an internal matter and subsequently prohibited unhcr from all direct access to the border 34 the chinese are suspicious of unhcrs intentions and have prevented aid agencies from entering the region to monitor the situation and possibly set up refugee camps although it continues to push its case for access unhcr cannot provide assistance to the refugees in an open transparent manner firsthand information is not available to unhcr which relies heavily on those working on the ground unhcr officials interviewed for this report say that they have worked behind the scenes with chinese officials to assist with the challenges posed by refugees and asylum seekers and believe this is the most productive way forward 32 china has been party to both instruments since september 1982 but has not adopted legislation to implement the treaties for example the entry and exit of aliens being granted political asylum under chinese law is based solely on the approval of competent authorities chinas policy towards refugees in general has varied over the decades two large groups of foreigners in china who have claimed refugee status include the vietnamese and the kachin burmese it is estimated that there are up to 300000 people from vietnam residing in china many of whom arrived during the sinovietnam war in 1979 unhcr has provided some assistance to these refugees over time they have mostly integrated and been accepted by the chinese although not granted permanent status much less is known bout the kachin burmese of which there could be hundreds of thousands in china mainly in the yunnan province other small groups of refugees that have been certified by unhcr have been allowed to stay still others have been repatriated without unhcr being granted access under the 1951 convention and the 1967 protocol contracting states agree to cooperate with unhcr and facilita its supervis ory function 33 seymour p 21 34 the unhcr mandate in the 1995 agreement with china was

apply for political asylum35 moreover china indicates it is obliged under bilateral1986 repatr iation agreement with north korea to return all border crossers despite this agreement chinese officials have generally ignored the agreement tolerating the inflows of refugees and the activities of foreign ngos so long as such activities were carried out quietly definitions of status are not always easily determined and motivationsbe they economic or politicalare not so easily separated unhcr recommends that one be deported until determination of refugee status can be made36 according to unhcr even those who arrive in search of food may have claim to refugee status sur place because they would be at risk of persecution if they returned37 thus some experts argue that because it is known what might happen to north koreans who are deported the north koreans in essence become refugees furthermore chinas deportations raise the question of violation of international law that is chinas violation of its obligations to abide by the principle of nonrefoulement under the refugee convention and protocol in march 2006 these issues were raised for the first time in highlevel talks between the high commissioner for refugees and the chinese foreign ministry the creation of refugee program raises difficulties for china it does not want to provoke an ally destabilize the korean peninsula or create pullfactor for individuals wanting to cross into china unhcr is concerned too about the treatment by north korea and china of the victims who are repatriated and those who become victims of exploitation at the border g5g145g146g151g138g514g156g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g5g152g151g156g146g141g142g155g138g157g146g152g151g156g561 in addition to being formal ally with north korea the chinese government wants to avoid situation that could destabilize the broader region such as the collapse of the north korean regime it believes such an event would bring thousands of north koreans across its border and have huge impact on its economic development adding to the unemployment problem in its industrial northeast 38 moreover it could strain chinas relations with north korea perhaps weakening chinas influence over north koreas behavior in other matters such as its nuclear weapons program given north koreas ability to destabilize the region quickly through military provocations china may be reluctant to antagonize its neighbor some experts also contend that 35 complementary forms of protection are occasionally available usually negotiated on casebycase basis such as granting humanitarian status temporarily or arranging political asylum in third countries see complementary forms of protection their nature and relationship to the international refugee protection regime executive committee of the high commissioners programme 9 june 2000 and complementary forms of protection global consultations on international protection 4 september 2001 36 in addition some experts have questioned whether the level of deprivation in north korea could be considered reason to grant refugee status as the poverty is so extreme and perhaps different from other political reasons that cause people to flee while this gives the chinese explan ation some basis it is not directly linked to political persecution but rather to the conditions under which people ar forced to try to survive the general criteria used to determine the status of refugee have not been expanded to include this observation 37 person who was not refugee when he or she left his or her country but who later becomes refugee is considered refugee sur place 38 the official registered unemployment in china as whole is about 4 percent however substantially greater unemployment and underemployment exist in

south korea since the end of the korean war in 1953 topped 10000 what began as trickle in the decades following the war swelled beginning in the late 1990s due to the north korea famine according to

north koreans resettled in south korea with some wanting to return to north korea or resettle elsewhere south korea is party to the refugee convention and its protocol unhcr has an office in seoul to provide assistance to resettlement programs some observers say that seoul adjusted its stance on north koreans to mollify pyongyang and that this was reinforced by two new measures announced by the south korean unification ministry in 2004 the traditional lump sum amount provided to north korean refugees was reduced by twothirds with the difference go ing to jobtraining incentive programs and screening of asylum seekers in diplomatic missions was strengthened to identify possible criminals or spies critics say the changes in policy are designed to discourage defections but south korean officials defend the changes as necessary to discourage exploitative brokers who charge the defectors for facilitating passage from north korea in addition officials claim the enhanced screening

exchange for pyongyang freezing its nuclear weapons program the bush administration policy on north korea has undergone several shifts from refusing to meet with the north koreans to pushing aggressively for negotiated deal on dismantling the norths nuclear weapons programs until the 2007 sixpa rty agreement the bush administration had regularly drawn attention to north korean human rights violations by supporting resolutions that criticize the north korean record at the united nations human rights council and general assembly highlevel officials including the president and secretary of state also periodically criticized the regime in pyongyang for its human rights practices some observers note that focus on human rights issues appears to have increased during periods when nuclear weapons negotiations have stalled with few exceptions references to the refugee situation have generally been limited to lowerlevel meetings as efforts to push forward the sixparty talks have accelerated in 2007 the administration has not proposed any negotiations with north korea over human rights but has asserted that human rights is one of several issues to be settled with north korea after the nuclear issue is resolved the sixparty agreement of february 13 2007 calls for the united states and north korea to start bilateral talks aimed at resolving bilateral issues and moving toward full diplomatic relations prior to the agreement in 2007 the bush administration held that it would not agree to normalization of diplomatic relations with north korea until there was progress on human rights presumably including refugees and other issues this position was criticized by china and south korea which called on the administration to offer north korea full diplomatic relations in exchange for satisfactory nuclear settlement however since the signing of the agreement in february 2007 assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs christopher hill

china some have hailed the nkhra as an important message that human rights will play central role in the formulation of us policy towards north korea they believe the issue should be addressed in the usnorth korea normalization working group established by the february 13 2007 sixparty talks agreement passage of the legislation was also driven by the argument that the united states has moral responsibility to stand up for human rights for those suffering under repressive regimes advocates claim that in addition to alleviating major humanitarian crisis the nkhra will ultimately enhance stability in northeast asia by promoting international cooperation to deal with the problem of north korean refugees critics say the legislation risks upsetting relations with south korea and china and ultimately the diplomatic unity necessary to make north korea abandon its nuclear weapons program through the sixparty talks further they insist that the legislation actually worsens the plight of north korean refugees by drawing more attention to them leading to crackdowns by both north korean and chinese authorities and reduced assistance by southeast asian countries concerned about offending pyongyang they point to reports that chinese soldiers nearly shut down the border between china and north korea following series of embassy stormings in 2002 preventing any further flow of refugees since passage of the nkhra it does not appear that china has altered its practices in response to pressure from the united states to deal more humanely with north korean refugees

refugee provisions may be counterproductive they argue that the legislation on north korean refugee admissions could send dangerous message to north koreans that admission to the united states as refugee is assured encouraging incursions into us dipl omatic missions overseas state department officials say that given the tight security in place at us facilities abroad unexpected stormings could result in injury or death for the refugees secondly granting of asylum status to north korean refugees involves complex vetting process that is further complicated by the fact that the applicants originate from state with which the united states does not have official relations in congressional hearings state department officials have cautioned that effective implementation of the nkhra depends on close coordination with south korea particularly in developing mechanisms to vet potential refugees given the dearth of information available to us immigration officials on north koreans 50

staff familiar with providing assistance to north korean refugees say that funding explicitly associated with the nkhra is problematic because of the need for discretion in reaching the vulnerable population refugees are often hiding from authorities and regional governments do not wish to draw attention to their role in transferring north koreans so funding is labeled under more general assistance programs in addition many of the ngos that help refugees do not have the capacity to absorb large amounts of funding effectively because of their small grass roots nature

refugees some of the challenges to implementing this provision were highlighted in report the nkhra required the secretary of state to submit to congress noting opposition by governments hosting north korean refugees particularly china to us refugee admissions processing on their territory the report stated without cooperation of such governments the multistep oftenlengthy admissions procedures leading to the departure of nort h koreans for the united states will not be possible in the region the report suggested however that it might be possible to admit some north korean refugees to the united states from south korea after appropriate vetting this reference to vetting suggests another significant obstacle to north korean refugee resettlement in the united statesthe difficulty in completing security checks the house international relations committee report on the bill that became the nkhra cited genuine security concerns related to north korean refugee resettlement in the united states acknowledging the department of homeland securitys obligation and authority to assess north koreans on caseby case basis the report stated that such requirements may present natural

talks remain focused primarily on the nuclear weapons issue and bush administration negotiators in 2007 have linked establishing diplomatic relations and facilitating pyongyangs reentry into the international commun ity with only the nuclear weapons issue rather than human rights and other issues the appointment of special envoy on human rights theoretically allows for separate track but according to many observers the predominant attitude of the bush administration in 2007 reflects the view that raising the profile of north koreas human rights violations jeopardizes the progress of the nuclear disarmament negotiations 56 the nkhra pressures executive branch policymakers to link human rights and overall negotiations with pyongyang the nkhra conveys the sense of congress that human rights should be key element in talks with north korea and that the united states should pursue human rights dialogue modeled on the helsinki process with north korea and other regional states57 in addition to these suggestions the requirements for admission of refugees and the funds authorized to aid human rights and refugee ngos alters the diplomatic environment in which the state department has pursued talks with the north koreans because of the reactions of other regional powers some observers disagree that linkage policy based on the helsinki process is an effective approach to dealing with north korea they argue that several factors that existed in eastern european countriesa nascent civil society minority groups semiautonomous institutions such as the catholic church dissident organizations armed uprisings against the rulers deeper contacts with the outside world and an overall political thawwere necessary prerequisites for the approach to take hold few or none of these factors reportedly exist in the closed state of north korea and as result outside ngos have very limited local forces with whom to partner to develop political movements 58 56 us in shift plans

pyongyang motivated the legislation passage of the nkhr was driven in part by the activities of network of ngos devoted to north korean issues the network includes groups explicitly committed to precipitating the collapse of the regime in pyongyang the predecessor to the nkhra the north korean freedom act59 proposed language that more harshly criticized south korea and china provided less flexibility to the president to ne gotiate security agreement explicitly linked security and human rights issues and according to some analysts associated itself with regime change60 critics of the regimechange approach point to some of lefkowitzs public statements that characterize pyongyang as government that inflicts on its citizens repression reminiscent of the most cruel totalitarian rulers of the 20th centuryand is today counterfeiting us currency trafficking in narcotics building nuclear arsenal and threatening other nations61 in 2005 and 2006 critics questioned whether the administration was committed to working with the existing north korean government in the sixparty talks if highlevel envoy could describe the regime in pyongyang in such negative terms lefk owitz also criticized aspects of south koreas sunshine policy of engaging north korea words that some say have periodically strained relations with seoul however in 2007 the bush administration entered into bilateral talks with north korea and assistant secretary of stat hill visited pyongyang in june 2007 the administration also resolved financial restrictions against banks in macau that engaged in activities that were implicated in north korean counterfeiting operations lefkowitz though still serving as special envoy has kept lower profile in 2007 the house international relations committee report accompanying the nkhra however explicitly disavowed an interest to bring down the pyongyang government nkhra is motivated by genuine desire for improvements in human rights refugee protection and humanitarian transparency it is not pretext for hidden strategy to provoke regime collapse or to seek collateral advantage in ongoing strategic negotiations 62 former chairperson of the

humanitarian not geostrategic nkhra is agnostic about regime change but emphatic about behavior change 63 despite this public statement many observers say that securing cooperation from china and south korea to deal with north korean human rights and refugee issues is more difficult because of the distrust of the goals of some us govern ment officials south korean unification minister lee

unilaterally flattering it criticism that comes with affection can help make north korean society healthy and improve the lives of its people in the long run 65 as part of its policy of increasing economic integration and fostering warm ties with north korea south korea has generally refrained from criticizing pyongyangs human rights record and downplayed its practice of accepting north korean refugees south korea has abstained from voting on several resolutions calling for improvement in north koreas human rights practices in november 2006 in the wake of pyongyangs july 2006 missile tests south korea for the first time voted in favor of general assembly resolution that criticized north korea for torture public executions past abductions of foreigners severe prison conditions and failing to allow access to the special rapporteur on north korean human rights66 however when nearly identical resolution came up in united nations human rights panel in november 2007 seoul abstained from voting citing consideration of northsouth korean relations the tension between washington and seoul on human rights issues may threaten bilateral cooperation on refugee problems the admission of north korean refugees for resettlement in the united states could benefit from information sharin g with south korean intelligence services for vetting purposes it is unclear if south korea has been willing to provide cooperation in light of its reluctance to antagonize pyongyang complicating any us effort to burdenshare with south korea by accepting north korean refugees is the south korean law

united states to include the issue of human rights in the ongoing sixparty talks the north koreaja pan normalization working group one of five established by the february 13 2007 sixparty talks agreement focuses on resolution of the abduction issue as well as pyongyangs historical grievances for the japanese annexation of the korean peninsula from 19101945 provision of the agreement that states that the united states will begin the process of removing the designation of the dprk as statesponsor of terrorism has alarmed japan which has urged the united states to keep north korea on the

putting aside the significant humanitarian concerns about north korean refugees some commentators have advocated the use of refugee flows for the political ends of weakening the regime in pyongyang liberal us resettlement policies and official encouragement to north korean refugees to seek asylum at american diplomatic posts in the region could act as magnet for drawing larger numbers of north koreans over the border if the united states weighed in as an official advocate for fleeing north koreans it could arguably foster the underground railroad system by pressuring beijing to assist in the relocation process 67 some calculate that large outflow could lead to the collapse of the precarious system of political control enforced by the north korean government such advocates argue that regime change in north korea is the only solution given the scale of human rights abuses in the country critics of this approach point out that the more likely response to massive movement of people across the border would be bloody crackdown by chinese and north korean authorities not necessarily leading to regime collapse in addition some argue that sudden political collapse would lead to chaotic aftermath in which human rights and lives would be direly threatened 67 see nicholas eberstadt and christopher griffin saving north koreas refugees the case for action international herald

nations high commissioner for refugees has examined the legal aspects of who among the north koreans in china qualifies for refugee status south korea recognizes that once refugees are on south korean territory it has an obligation to protect them however it cannot protect the north korean refugees while they are in china politically it is both domestic and bilateral problem for china to acknowledge refuge status for the north koreans and given the circumstances unhcr believes there may be overriding practical reasons not to do so first it is possible that there could be relatively few cases that might technically qualify as refugees second it is probable that granting refugee status decreases chinas tolerance dramatically for the refugees in general at least in the short and mediumterm the question thus becomes whether it is helpful to push the refugee status issue or find another way to achieve the solution being sought protect the north korean refugees in china granting some form of humanitarian statusrather than refugee statusis one way to provide broader definition of who can be helped that may be more politically acceptable to china the unhcr department of international protection which is responsible for the agencys core protection mandate in march 2006 proposed humanitarian program or enclave be developed with other humanitarian agencies to make sure the refugees have or gain access to humanitarian services discussions between unhcr and representatives suggest that china could justify good neighbor approach on the one hand without pushing human rights or asylum or on the other hand pushing for deportation china has expressed willingness to consider the option of protection in the form of such humanitarian enclave but further progress has been made unhcr also believes there may be too much emphasis on the pull factor on the part of china and others unfettered travel in north korea is difficult and both countries have demonstrated their ability to control their respective borders china clearly does not want political confrontation or fallout with north korea unhcr has been opening the dialogue with china behind the scenes because it also views open confrontation with china as unproductive given chinas current political structure the proposal to give humanitarian status as means of increasing protection for the north koreans in china is seen by some as far less provocative than granting refugee status and as offering practical solution that can be implemented although not necessarily the approach sought by some highprofile ngos unhcr believes it has to minimize its visibility and publicity to make the most progress

promote respect for human rights and asserts as primary purpose of the organization is the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all it also recognizes the doctrine of nonintervention thus article 2 paragraph 7 of the charter states that nothing in the charter authorizes the united nations to interfere in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state because of the traditional approach towards human rights as matter exclusively within the domestic jurisdiction of sovereign states article 27 has been viewed by some as an obstacle to the implementation of the human rights provisions of the charter states accused of human rights violations frequently cite this provision in response to criticisms by other states or international organizations relating to human rights conditions within their borders however many advocates argue that there is substantial justification for state responsibility for the protection of the human rights of individuals and for some level of interference by the international community on behalf of those whose rights have been infringed activity for the protection of human rights has been constantly subjected to tension between state sovereignty as protected by the doctrine of nonintervention and state obligations to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms increasingly protection of populations affected by conflict within country is seen as partly the responsibility of the international community for example some observers have more recently argued that the dprk government is threat to its own people and that north korea has violated its responsibility to protect its own citizens from crimes against humanity they suggest that action by the intern ational community and the security council is warranted 68 at the 2005 world summit the responsibility to protect was introduced putting forward the idea that each state has responsibility to protect its people from genocide war crimes ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and that human rights violations committed in one state are the concern of all states69 it is an agreement in principle that speaks to the obligations of state to protect its own people and the obligations of all states when that fails but this resolution does not make action easy or even probable lee feinstein senior fellow for us foreign policy and international law at the council on foreign relations observes that adoption of the responsibility to protect begins to resolve the historic tension between human rights and states rights in favor of the individual where the state had been erected to protect the individual from outsiders the responsibility to protect erects fallback where individuals have claim to seek assistance from outsiders in order to substitute for or protect them from the state 70 still as the case of north korean refugees demonstrates translating principle into action remains an enormous

discreetly raise human rights concerns in terms of protecting individual north korean refugees some refugee advocates argue that beijing is receptive to their appeals to take small humanitarian steps if the exchange remains out of the public eye for example china might be convinced to quietly stop deportations and arrests and perhaps even offer legal resident status to north koreans who have married chinese nationals 73 highlevel us officials could raise the issues quietly with their counterparts in bilateral talks in addition quiet pressure on other regional countries not to repatriate

may support the need for additional legislation and oversight by congress one option that congress might consider is developing legislation that requires north korea to make progress on addressing human rights conditions in exchange for diplomatic relations and an end to us economic sanctions for example although the political situations are very different in these two countries the burmese freedom and democracy act of 2003 could provide useful model for such legislation since 1988 the united states has imposed wide range of sanctions against burma which by 2004 meant that nearly all economic relations with burma had terminated the burmese freedom and democracy act bans imports from burma into the united states which affects mainly imports of burmese textiles the united states has not had an ambassador to burma since 1992 when the senate foreign relations committee refused to confirm the nomination of an ambassador because of the human rights abuses the conditions set forth in the burmese freedom and democracy act for the lifting of sanctions show that the sentiment in congress favors maintaining the full range of us sanctions once again renewed in august 2007 until the ruling state peace and development council spdc and the burmese military terminate major human rights abuses and make fundamental political concessions to the democratically elected government 75 it
