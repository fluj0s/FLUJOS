and schip by bbra 99 as incorporated in the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 4 title vi medicaid 4 title vii state childrens health insurance program 6 medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip provisions in the consolidated appropriations act for fy2000 introduction medicaid is joint federalstate entitlement program that pays for medical assistance primarily for lowincome persons who are aged blind disabled members of families with dependent children and certain other pregnant women and children within broad federal guidelines each state designs and administers its own program total program outlays in fy1998 were 1774 billion federal outlays were 1002 billion and state outlays were approximately 772 billion the federal government shares in states medicaid costs by means of statutory formula based on states per capita income adjusted annually in fy1998 federal matching rates ranged from 50 to 77 of states expenditures for medicaid items and services overall the federal government finances about 57 of all medicaid costs the 105th congress made important changes to the medicaid program through the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 105331 bba 97 included provisions to achieve net medicaid savings of about 13 billion between fy1998 and fy2002 largely from reductions in supplemental payments to hospitals that serve disproportionate share of medicaid and lowincome patients bba 97 also significantly increased the flexibility that states have to manage their medicaid programs in particular it gave states the option of requiring most beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans without seeking federal waiver and replaced federal reimbursement requirements imposed by the boren amendments with public notice process for setting payment rates for institutional services the act also required that the previously existing costbased reimbursement system for federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics be phased out over 6year period spending items in the act included medicaid coverage for additional children and increased assistance for lowincome individuals to pay medicare part b premiums bba 97 also included provisions establishing schip under new title xxi of the social security act schip represents the second largest federal effort to provide health insurance coverage to uninsured lowincome children since the enactment of medicaid in 1965 the program began in october 1997 with total federal funding authorization of 397 billion for the period fy1998 through fy2007 1 for detailed description of the changes to medicaid under bba 97 see crs report 98 132 medicaid 105th congress by melvina ford and richard price crs2 generally schip is targeted at uninsured children who live in families with income below twice the federal poverty level states may use schip funds to provide coverage through health insurance that meets specific standards for benefits and costsharing known as separate state programs or through expansions of eligibility under medicaid or through combination of both options not all targeted lowincome children will necessarily receive medical assistance under schip for two reasons first the law does not establish an individuals entitlement to the benefits of schip instead it entitles states with approved schip plans to predetermined annual federal allotments based on distribution formula set in law second each state has flexibility to define the group of targeted lowincome children who are eligible for its schip eligibility criteria may include for example geography age income and resources residency disability status access to other health insurance and duration of eligibility for other health insurance as of december 1 1999 all 50 states the district of columbia and all five territories had approved schip plans among these 25 are medicaid expansions 16 are new or expanded separate state programs and 15 will use both medicaid expansion and separate state program federal spending in fy1998 totaled less than 500 million recently the congressional budget office cbo2 estimated that federal schip spending will total approximately 1 billion for fy1999 these spending projections fall well below total annual federal authorization levels of 43 billion for each fiscal year however since annual state allotments are available for period of 3 years states may eventually claim their full fy1998 and fy1999 federal schip funding these initial spending projections are consistent with preliminary enrollment estimates of 13 million children nationwide through june of 1999 subsequent to enactment of bba 97 cbo estimated that schip would cover an average of 23 million children per year after 19993 the administrations goal is to enroll 5 million children by fy2002 recent legislative activity on october 26 1999 the senate finance committee ordered reported the medicare medicaid and schip adjustment act of 1999 s 1788 on november 5 1999 the house passed an expanded version of bill originally introduced with changes to medicare only the expanded version retitled the medicare medicaid and schip balanced budget refinement act of 1999 hr 3075 added provisions modifying medicaid and schip on november 17 1999 house and senate negotiators reached agreement on the medicare medicaid and schip provisions the

the following day the president signed this legislation on november 29 1999 pl 106113 cbo has estimated the cost of bbra 99 at 16 billion over the fy2000 fy2004 period and 27 billion over the fy2000fy2009 period4 taken together the medicaid and schip provisions account for small fraction of the total cost of this package the medicaid subtotal is 700 million over 5 years and 12 billion over 10 years nearly onehalf of these medicaid expenditures 43 over 5 years and 50 over 10 years represent interactions with part b premiums under medicare and cost sharing5 the remaining costs are primarily associated with increased dsh payments to certain states extension of the availability of the 500 million fund for medicaid eligibility determinations due to welfare reform and delays in the phaseout of cost based reimbursement for federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics the schip subtotal is 200 million over 5 years and 400 million over 10 years nearly all of these schip expenditures are due to the increased allotments for territories and new data collection and evaluation provisions the following sidebyside comparison provides brief description of prior law and
