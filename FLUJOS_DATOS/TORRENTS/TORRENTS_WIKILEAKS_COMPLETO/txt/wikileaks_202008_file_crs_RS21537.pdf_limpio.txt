taxation of internet transactions john r luckey legislative attorney american law division summary this report examines state taxation of internet transactions as well as efforts to achieve uniform state sales and use tax treatment there are at least two common misconceptions in the area of state taxation of internet transactions contrary to popular belief 1 states do have the power to impose sales tax on instate sales that are accomplished via the internet even after the enactment of the internet tax freedom act in 1998 and 2 states do have the power to tax transactions of their own residents where the seller is located outside of the state and has real connection with the state the internet tax freedom act placed th reeyear moratorium only on imposition of new taxes on internet access services existing taxes on access services were grandfathered or any multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce by state or local governments not on application of general sales tax to such transactions the internet tax nondiscrimination act of 2001 extended this moratorium through november 1 2003 in the 108th congress the moratorium was allowed to expire but in its closing days the moratorium was extended retroactively from november 1 2003 until november 1 2007 in addition to congress other stakeholders are involved in internet taxation issues the streamlined sales tax proj ect which claims the involve ment of 39 states and the district of columbia aims to achieve more uniform sales and use tax scheme while the projects aim does not specifically pertain to internet access taxes it is inextricably related and has been wide ly discussed congressional action would be required to implement the projects plan to require selle rs to collect sales and use taxes based upon the buyers home state rates this report examines state taxation of internet transactions including certain misconceptions surrounding such taxation as well as efforts to achieve uniform state sales and use tax treatment it is important to recognize the distinction between internet access internet service taxes as opposed to sales taxes imposed on internet purchases with regard to state

tax transactions of their own residents where the seller is located outside of the state and has real connection with the state state governments depend on sales and use taxes for nearly onethird 323 of their total tax revenue2 the traditional method of collec ting sales tax has been by the brick and mortar retailer who collects the tax from the purchaser and then remits the money to state tax agency on periodic basis this thod has broken down in the out ofstate seller context because the seller whether mail order or internet sales having substantial nexus to the state is under forceable obligation to collect sales tax3 moratorium the internet tax freedom act placed threeyear moratorium on the imposition of new taxes on internet access services or any multiple or di scriminatory taxes on electronic commerce by state or local governments4 in pertinent part the act defined discriminatory tax as imposing an obligation to collect or pay the tax on different person or entity than in the case of tran sactions involving similar property goods services or information accomplished through other means5 accordingly during the moratorium period states we re not permitted to impose tax on charges to access the internet nor tax internet purchases to different persons or entities or at rate different than purchases made through other mediums such as traditional brick and mortar stores states that had such an acce ss tax already in place and enforced it as of october 1 1998 maintained their ability to impose such tax through grandfather clause6 it remained permissible to apply sales

transactions using the internet and internet access and reporting its findings to congress within 18 months9 in april of 2000 the commissions report to congress included formal findings and recommendations as well as major policy proposals10 formal findings and recommendations consisted of encouraging initiatives to br ing internet access to lower income individuals exploring the privacy imp lications of internet taxation and making permanent the standstill on international internet taxes and tariffs11 the policy proposals included rendering permanent the moratorium on transaction taxes on the sale of internet access and clarifying which factors establish sellers physical presence in state for purposes of determining nexus12 the internet nondiscrimination act of 2001 extended the moratorium imposed by the internet tax freedom act an add itional two years until november 1 200313 the 108th congress originally allowed the moratorium to expire and then more than year later reimposed it retroactively in the internet nondiscrimination act14 this act extended the moratorium for four years november 1 2003 to november 1 2007 expanded the definition of internet access to

the important question in the out ofstate seller context is not th states power to tax the tran saction but rather whether the state can require the outofstate seller to collect the tax from the purchaser17 the due process18 and commerce19 clauses of the united states constitution limit state from imposing tax liability or coll ection responsibilities on business concern unless there is substantial nexus or instate contact established with the state there is currently statutory authority and scant case law on the subject of nexus and the internet but the supreme court has given considerable guidance in the analogous area of taxation of mail order sales the two major supreme court decisions in this area are national bellas hess inc v illinois department of revenue 20 and quill corp v north dakota 21 in the 1967 national bellas hess decision the supreme cour t held that the state of illinois could not require an outofstate mail order sales company to collect use tax from illinois customers bellas hesss only contact with the state was via the mails or common carriers this contact was found to be insufficient to establish nexus under either the due process or commerce clause the court utilized physical presence standard for nexus for both of these clauses22 ten years after bellas hess the supreme court set out four part test in complete auto transit inc v brady23 for determining whether state tax is compatible with the commerce clause for state tax to be applied to an activity there must be substantial nexus with the taxing state the tax must be fairly apportioned it must not discriminate against interstate commerce the tax must be fairly related to the services provided by the state24 this clarification became mo re significant in the mail order sales area after the 1992 quill decision in quill case factually similar to bellas hess the court dropped the physical presence test for nexus under the du process clause requiring only that the sellers efforts be purposefully directed to ward the residents of the taxing state25httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21537crs5 26 id at 317 27 httpwwwstreamlinedsalestaxorg 28 id 29 idtherefore the due process clause was longer an impediment to requiring tax collection by the outofstate seller ho wever the physical presence standard or substantial nexus requirement of the commerce clause was reaffirmed26 therefore the practical outcome of the case was the same as bellas hess the state could not force the seller to collect the tax absent substantial nexus the removal of the due process clause as road block did open door for congress under its commerce powers to legisl atively empower the states to require the collection of these taxes the supreme court in quill specifically invited congress to act in this area to date congress s not enacted legislation in this area streamlined sales tax project one of the objections to requiring outofstate sellers to collect state sales tax is that there are many different sales tax rates from statetostate as well as multiple sales tax rates within an individual state based on the ty pe of good being sold or the locality where the tax is collected the streamlined sales tax project sstp is an effort now underway to address at least in part these concerns sstp is comprised of thirtynine states nd the district of columbia according to the sstps website27 its goals are to establish uniform tax base definitions simplify tax rates by allowing only one state rate with limited exceptions impose uniform sales and use tax exemptions create uniform and limited audit procedures for sellers and have states fund some of the requir ed technology improvements many states currently employ variety of sales tax rates depending on what the type of purchase is ie goods food prescription drugs etc local governments within states are also able to impose sales taxes and often do so with similar variety of rates the sstp would limit states to one sales tax rate per stat with the possibility of an excep tion different rate for food and drugs local jurisdictions would be allo wed one local rate additionally the sstp would mandate that states and their local governments use common tax base and eliminate the widely imposed requirement that businesses file tax returns with local governments the coalition states working together are known as the streamlined sales tax implementing states sstis this group approved model legisl ation the streamlined sales and use tax agreement on november 12 2002 ten states representing 20 of the population of sales tax states must conform for the agreement to come into effect not clear whether states must actually be conforming in operatio n or just approve conforming28 sstp claims thirtyfour states and the district of columbia have approved the agreement and twenty have enact ed some form of c onforming legislation29 the next step is for the participating states would be to ask congress for the permission to compel outofstate vendors to collect sales and use taxes once the states have implemented the simplified system by appr oving the agreement and enacting conforminghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21537crs6 30 see hr 8184 and s 1736 of the 108th congresslegislation in the 108th congress bills were introduced which would have authorized participating states to require sellers to collect sales nd use taxes based upon the buyers home state rates30 successful implementation of the sstp will rely largely on technology to simplify the administration of sales and use taxes it envisions providing sellers retailers the opportunity to employ one of three t echnology models to ease and modernize administration model 1 consists of certified service provide r paid for by the states which performs all of the sellers sales tax functions model 2 is certified automated system which provides only the tax calculati on function the third option would be for the seller typically large nationwide retailers to develop their own system and have it certified by the sstp crs products crs report rl31929 internet tax bills in the 108th congress by nonna noto crs report
