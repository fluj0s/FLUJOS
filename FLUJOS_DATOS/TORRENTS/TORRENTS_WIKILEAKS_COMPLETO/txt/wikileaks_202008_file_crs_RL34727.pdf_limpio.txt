submitted as an amendment intended to be proposed to hr 5151 on september 26 20082 it includes nearly 150 public lands and natural resources bills the amendment itself is combination of two other packages of bills the primary contributor to the amendment providing the basis of roughly two thirds of the language is s 3213 which itself is collection of over 90 individual bills that had been placed on the senate calendar3 the balance of legislative language in samdt 5662 is derived from the 53 bills approved by unanimous voice vote of the senate committee on energy and natural resources on september 11 20084 the intent of this report is to provide an overview of policy issues and controversies commonly associated with the subject of each title as well as to highlight specific provisions within each title where stakeholders have identified controversy this document is not however complete summary of each issue or provision represented by the amendment the majority of the provisions under the 12 titles of samdt 5662 are public lands measures related to wilderness areas the land management agencies such as th bureau of land management the national park service the forest service and other federal land management issues however there are also sections focused on the bureau of reclamations projects water settlements and other natural resources issues supporters and critics of provisions within samdt 5662 appear to disagree broadly in their positions regarding the role of the federal government in land management 5 and decisions about land management priorities such as whether to leave federal lands open to energy development and other commercial activities versus making land use designations that restrict or prohibit some activities6 proponents may praise what they view as protection of natural resources such as wilderness and national trails funding authorizations for programs which they support capital outlays for aging infrastructure and water settlements as examples some have expressed concerns focused on land use priorities such as leaving federal lands open to energy development versus other management decisions which may limit the types of activities that are authorized on federal land some opponents to provisions within samdt 5662 have cited limitations on energy exploration and development specifically 7 it may well be the case that limitations on commercial activities such as energy development are an inherent characteristic of 1 prepared by nic lane analyst in natural resources polic kristina alexander legislative

very nature limit or prevent some commercial activities broad ideological controvers ies associated with activities under any of the amendments 12 titles are discussed within the relevant sections below as an overview of the amendment this report is not intended to be an analysis of the specific effects of samdt 5662 on energy exploration or production but rather to note this issue as concern which has been raised regarding the amendment as samdt 5662 has specific energy title any direct or indirect effect on energy activities arise through the numerous provisions under titles such as those under title i additions to the national wilderness preservation system in response to concerns by property owners near the affected federal lands this amendment includes many assurances that private property will not be taken by condemnation that access rights will continue and that regulatory schemes will not extend beyond the boundaries of the protected land nonetheless not all private landowner interests may be mollified by these assurances additionally some may have concerns regarding the authorization of federal funding which may fall into two general categories that specific authorization of funding is inappropriate for the federal government or that low perceived benefit to cost ratio for given program would provide little value for federal dollars expended in general the funding figures associated with specific provisions that make up samdt 5662 do not represent physical outlays of treasury funds but rather are authorizations for appropriation the formal appropriations process consists of two sequential steps 1 enactment of an authorization measure that may create or continue an agency or program as well as authorize the subsequent enactment of appropriations and 2 enactment of appropriations to provide funds for the authorized agency or program 8 while funding figures presented in the amendment indicate what some may recommend for specific provision or program the actual funding appropriated may be more less or none at all when appropriations are made outside of the aforementioned two step process that is when appropriations are made in an act other than an ppropriations act it is known as direct spending the congressional budget office cbo analyses pending legislation and may make number of determinations regarding the bill including whether it contains direct spending provisions although crs does not make determinations on direct spending we have included description of the criteria for direct spending to provide context for those interested in the funding authorizations within samdt 5662 direct spending also known as mandatory spending has been defined as entitlement authority or budget authority9 provided by law other than appropriation acts10 direct spending may be 8 for more information on the appropriations process see crs report rs20371 overview of the authorization appropriations process by bill

government accountability office provided definition of direct spending in its most r ecent glossary of federal budget terminology which was published in 2005 see supra note 9 at 4445 congress codified the definition of direct spending in 2 usc 900c8 which has now expired according to the effective and termination dates note to 900 the direct spending provision expired on september 30 2006 direct spending originally was defined in the budget enforcement act of 1990 pl 101508 which amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 pl 99177

the authoritys duration and the amount of funding authorized11 but the defining factor is that the budget authority is made available in an act other than an appropriations act12 direct spending allows congress to control spending indirectly rather than directly through appropriations acts by defining eligibility and setting the benefit or payment rules for the spending13 another issue is the appropriateness of divesting federal ownership in federal lands many of the provisions in this amendment surrender federal ownership in lands giving property to states local interests or private entities in general federal policy has been against divestiture the enactment of the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma formally ended the previous disposal policy expressly declaring that the national policy generally was to retain the remaining lands in federal ownership section 102a of flpma states the congress declares that it is the policy of the united states that1 the public lands be retained in federal ownership unless as result of the land use planning procedure provided for in this act it is determined that disposal of particular parcel will serve the national interest g21g142g151g138g157g142g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g561g347g348g348g344g496g561g22g146g157g149g142g156g561g11g556g26g11g11g561 this section describes each of the amendments

the 1964 wilderness act15 established the national wilderness preservation system and directed that only congress can designate federal lands as part of the national system proponents argue that these relatively pristine areas warrant protection from development the lands undeveloped nature can result in highquality water habitat for rare wildlife species and recreational opportunities unavailable on other lands opponents respond that the restrictions on most commercial activities motorized access and roads structures and facilities in wilderness areas is unnecessary and can be harmful to local economies 16 commercial timber harvesting mining and oil and gas leasing and development are generally prohibited in congressionally designated wilderness areas17 however the wilderness act explicitly authorized continued livestock grazing in wilderness created from national forests18 and allowed commercial recreational services19 the 11 see supra note 9 at 45 12 see office of management and budget

areas20 and authorized the president to allow certain water projects and related facilities21 finally the act allowed exceptions to the prohibitions as necessary to meet minimum requirements for the administration of the area including measures required in emergencies involving the health and safety of persons within the area and as may be necessary in the control of fire insects and diseases subject to such conditions as the secretary deems desirable22 every congress since the 90th has added to the system including the 110th which added 106000 acres of wilderness in washington in pl 110229 today the national wilderness preservation system includes 10755 million acres in 44 states title i of samdt 5662 includes 14 subtitles that add to the wilderness system in total the 14 subtitles would designate 1775275 acres of wilderness in 8 statesca co id nm or va and wvin 35 new areas and additions to 25 existing wilderness areas section 2403 in title ii would add another 66280 acres in new wilderness area in colorado wilderness bills commonly contain additional provisions designating lands for other purposes recreation areas wild rivers etc directing land exchanges modifying boundaries and more the 14 subtitles of samdt 5662 are exception but none of these provisions nor the wilderness designations themselves seem to have generated substantial controversy however undoubtedly there are some interests who oppose enactment of each or even of all of the provisions and designations

title ii of samdt 5662 contains diverse provisi ons related to the bureau of land management blm in the department of the interior focus of congressional attention has been on provisions to establish legislatively within blm the national landscape conservation system nlcs subtitle states that it is not intended to alter the way the areas within the nlcs are currently managed the blm created the nlcs administratively in 2000 to focus management and public attention on its specially protected conservation areas according to blm the mission of the system is to conserve protect and restore for present and future generations the nationally significant landscapes that have been recognized for their outstanding archaeological geological cultural ecological wilderness recreation and scientific values 24 the system consists today of about 27 million acres of land with more than 850 federally recognized units these units include national monuments national conservation areas wilderness areas and wilderness study areas as well as thousands of miles of national historic and scenic trails and wild and scenic rivers there are mixed views on whether the nlcs should be established legislatively supporters including the blm assert that this will provide legislative support and direction to the blm and formalize and strengthen the agencys conservation system within the context of its multiple use mission opponents have expressed concern that it could effectively establish new standardized 20 16 usc 1133d1 21 16 usc 1133d41 22 16 usc 1133c and 16 usc 1133d1 23 prepared by carol hardy

samdt 5662 would establish new national monuments national conservation areas or wilderness areas25 and some of these provisions make explicit that the areas are to be managed as part of the nlcs additional support for the nlcs and for establishing such areas centers on desire for additional federally protected areas opposition stems from concern that areas would be removed from multiple uses possibly including oil and gas development motorized recreation and livestock grazing an issue that often arises with federally protected areas involves the water rights related to those areas samdt 5662 includes provision that addres ses the management of federal water rights in designated area of colorado that water rights provision states that reserved water rights are created and provides that the federal government would acquire any necessary water rights for the purposes of the designated area through colorado state law not by federal reservation however colorado water is overallocated meaning that some users already holding water rights cannot fulfill those rights the proposed legislation provides that if the states conservation board modifies some water rights such that existing rights to the designated area are insufficient to fulfill the purposes of designation the secretar would pursue water rights under state law to fulfill those purposes because the proposed legislation does not reserve federal water rights for the area and because colorados water is overallocated it would likely be very difficult for the secretary to pursue sufficient rights to fulfill the purposes of the designation other provisions of samdt 5662 would provide for the disposal of blm or other federal lands to cities private entities and other recipients in some cases the provisions provide for an exchange of lands between the federal govern ment and nonfederal land owner currently blm can dispose of its public lands under several authorities primary means for blm to both dispose of and acquire lands is through exchanges under the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma 26 these authorities impose conditions or requirements on the land transactions for instance under flpma blm can sell certain tracts of public land that meet specific criteria for not less than their fair market value further the agency can exchange land if it serves the public interest and the federal and nonfederal lands in the exchange are located in the same state and are of roughly equal value among other requirements each congress tends to consider many legislative proposals providing for specific land disposals and exchanges as in samdt 5622 such proposals have been supported as authorizing land transactions to worthy recipients that may not be allowed under existing authorities in other cases they have been supported as directing or expediting particular transactions that are allowed under law but that are not being accomplished by the blm in the time frame desired by congress more broadly land disposals have been favored by those who assert that the federal government owns and manages too much land and that federal holdings should be conveyed to state or private ownership by contrast such legislative proposals have been opposed on the grounds that they are not in the public interest as land is removed from federal ownership through conveyance to nonfederal entities they have further been opposed on the assertion that 25 still another provision of the senate amendment 2608 would release certain blm lands in nevada from being managed without impairing their suitability for designation as wilderness for discussion of the controversies surrounding wilderness designation see th summary of title i in this report 26 information on blm

scenic rivers act34 established the system and policy of preserving designated freeflowing rivers for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations the act requires that designated river units be classified as wild scenic or recreational rivers based on the condition of the river the amount of development in the river or on the shorelines and the degree of accessibility by road or trail at the time of designation instead of mandatory conservation measures the designation is to preserve the character of river the act neither prohibits development nor gives the federal government control over private property the act specifically 1 prohibits federal dams and other water projects that would harm river values 2 protects outstanding natural cultural or recreational values 3 ensures water quality is maintained and 4 requires comprehensive river management plan that addresses resource protection and development of lands and facilities designation and management of lands within river corridors have been controversial in some cases with debates over the effect of designation on private lands within the river corridors the impact of activities within corridor on the

evaluate each new area and report thereon to the congressional authorizing committees there is difference of opinion as to the merits of congressional designation and federal support of nhas heritage supporters believe that the benefits of heritage areas are considerable and thus congress should expand its assistance for creating and sustaining them supporters view nhas as important for protecting lands and traditions promoting spirit of cooperation and stewardship ethic among the general public and fostering community revitalization tourism and regional economic development some see nhas as generally more desirable than other types of land conservation because the lands typically remain in nonfederal ownership to be administered locally they view establishing and managing federal areas such as units of the national park system as too costly and observe that small federal investments in heritage areas have been successful in attracting funding from other sources some proponents see nhas as flexible enough to encompass diverse array of initiatives and areas because the heritage concept lacks systemic laws or regulations some opponents believe that nhas present numerous problems and challenges and that congress should oppose efforts to designate new areas or ex tend support for existing ones property rights advocates have taken lead role in opposing heritage areas concerns include that some nhas lack significant local support the nps could exert federal control over nonfederal lands by influencing zoning and landuse planning heritage area management plans are overly prescriptive in regulating private property use private property protections in legislation might not be adhered to and nha lands may be targeted for federal purchase and management the lack of general statute providing framework for heritage area establishment management and funding has prompted different concernthat the process is inconsistent and fragmented the bush administration has expressed opposition to the designation of new areas until systemic legislation is enacted others are concerned that the enactment of additional heritage bills could substantially increase the administrative and financial obligations of the nps still other observers recommend caution in creating nhas because in practice nhas may face an array of challenges to success for instance heritage

high cost of the eastern new mexico rural water system the bush administration testified in april 2008 that it could not support the original legislation from which this provision is derived s 2814 subtitle d 47 specifies 35 nonfederal matching requirement for federal funds made available under the act it requires the san gabriel basin water quality authority and the central basin municipal water district to provide the 35 nonfederal match for specified water quality projects under pl 106554 total of 85 million was authorized for the san gabriel basin restoration fund with the requirement that f unds would be obligated unless at least 35 of the funds are provided by nonfederal interests sec 9301 increases the authorization to 1462 million and subjects the remainder of the funds after the 85 million has been appropriated to the 35 nonfederal matching requirement sec 9301 also limits the total appropriations that can be made available to the central basin water quality project to be more than 212 million the executive branch indicates that it has not budgeted for the san gabriel basin restoration fund in the past and that it does not support an increased cost ceiling in testimony before the senate energy and natural resources committees subcommittee on water and power reclamation commissioner robert johnson stated that he believes resources should be allocated to other priorities he indicated that reclamations role should be limited to assisting concerned parties when possible and within its mission scope and budget to advance the goal of

conservation program mscp multistakeholder initiative50 to conserve 26 species51 along the lower colorado river while maintaining water and power supplies for farmers tribes industries and urban residents the mscp took effect in 2005 and has 50year term the expected total cost of the program is estimated at 626 million in 2003 dollars to be split 5050 between federal and nonfederal entities samdt 5662 would authorize appropriations to cover the federal share of costs authorize the secretary of the interior to implement mscp in accordance with the program documents and waive sovereign immunity of the us government to allow nonfederal parties to enforce program documents the issue of whether the united states should waive its sovereign immunity so that the other parties to the mscp can sue to enforce it has been controversial since the legislation was first proposed the implementing agreement of the mscp contains express waiver of sovereign immunity by the federal government without the waiver it appears likely that nonfederal parties would not be able to pursue specific performan ce or declaratory judgment actions against the federal parties to get them to comply with the agreement notably the mscp affects states all located in the ninth circuit which has held that those types of actions cannot be brought in any court without an express waiver of sovereign immunity this provision would allow the nonfederal parties to sue to enforce the agreement but not to obtain monetary damages many contend that this legislation is an important legislative authorization for an administratively approved program to ensure water supplies and deliveries from the lower colorado river while maintaining compliance with the endangered species act some express concerns that this legislation might be unnecessary since the project is already underway and the authority for federal participation in the project already exists subtitle f 52 of title ix is quite broad in the issues it covers on the effect of climate change on hydropower threatened and endangered species and stream flow data collection and more however it may also be restrictive since it does not appear to provide an overall strategy to address the possible effects of climate change on water availability and agency responses subtitle f does not address water quality or activities of the environmental protection agency which may be fundamental to water availability this omission limits how the bill is applied to many of the water issues and may result in duplicative or noncomplementary activities programmatic provisions that make broad changes to an agencys authority especially those that may change its relationship and interactions with congress can be controversial for example 9503d would provide programmatic feasibility authority for climate change mitigation strategies including the study of new dams reservoirs canals etc this authority may be 49 prepared by pervaze sheikh specialist

transport systems conflicts over water quality and quantity or stakeholder interests in expanding surface storage and conveyance it also could be controversial since it would reverse congressional decision from 1965 to revoke reclamations programmatic feasibility authority53 additionally legislation proposing changes to water resources management is often controversial subtitle g54 concerns reclamations aging infrastructure it would require the commissioner of reclamation to carry out among other things annual inspections reclamationowned and operated facilities as well as reclamation facilities operated and maintained by water users additionally the subtitle would require the secretary to develop national priorities list of infrastructure maintenance needs and establish standards and guidelines for the maintenance of these facilities this subtitle addresses an issue that has been and will likely continue to be controversial prioritizing finite budget for asset management objectives there are instructions for specific structure and approach to aging infrastructure as sessment outlined in subtitle g when this direction is considered along with the cost sh aring requirements repayment terms and other details of different provisions addressing reclamation infrastructure such as 9105 and 9106 that appear to vary by project some may view this as evidence of the need for more transparent standardized approach to addressing reclamations infrastructure needs as an example 9106d appears in some cases to require contributions from project beneficiaries or the state requirement of some costsharing contribution is common although the percentage may vary as indicated above as reclamations infrastructure continues to age these conflicts may arise more frequently additionally more expensive recapitalization projects may exceed the financial means of local operators in the case of transferred works and could drive those entities to seek congressional support for project funding 55 g22g146g157g149g142g561g26g495g561g25g138g157g142g155g561g21g142g157g157g149g142g150g142g151g157g156g347g348g561 subtitle regarding the san joaquin river restoration settlement would authorize implementing settlement in longstanding dis pute and lawsuit over management of waters in the san joaquin river basin in the central valley of california the legislation has

users if the legislation is not approved samdt 5662 reduces the initial direct spending compared to the original legislations 27 and hr 24to 88 million which is expected to be offset by early payment of water user repayment obligations another 250 million in discretionary funding is also authorized settlement opponents fear water may be required to be released without guarantee of adequate funding

remedy in case that had already been decided in favor of restoring river flows to reestablish salmon populations57 subtitle b concerns rural water projects involving the navajo nation in northwestern new mexico the federal government is considered to have trust responsibility to protect indian water rights settlements of indian water rights claims require federal approval and when settlement requires federal expenditures congress must approve congress has enacted 20 indian water rights settlements during the past three decades but federal funding for the settlements is recurring issue administrations have often opposed indian water rights settlements for cost related reasons arguing that nonfederal parties were not paying their fair share or that the federal expenditure exceeded the administrations calculated federal liability some tribes and other nonfederal parties argue on the other hand that funding for indian water rights settlements is insufficient especially for water infrastructure auth orized in the settlements and that the use and uncertainties of discretionary appropriations ma kes settlements harder they propose an ongoing dedicated source of funding for indian water rights settlements all but one of the 20 settlements used only discretionary appropriations 58 subtitle b would make use of the reclamation fund which is financed partly through reclamation water and power project revenues to pay costs of water infrastructure required in certain indian water rights settlements it would set aside 120 million annually from reclamation fund revenues during fy2019fy2028 fo r deposit in new reclamation water settlements fund for expenditure without further appropriation these funds would go toward reclamation activities to implement specified indian water rights settlements if the settlements are approved by congress in specific order of priority construction of the navajogallup water supply project which is integral to one of the settlements specified would be the first priority none of the 20 indian water rights settlements has been funded by such setaside from the reclamation fund the bush administration opposed this provision because the new funds expenditures would be excluded from the appropriations process which it was concerned would prevent future presidents or congresses from setting their own appropriations priorities this subtitle also specifically approves water rights settlement between the navajo nation and new mexico costs of the navajogallup water supply project necessary to the settlement would chiefly be funded through the reclamation water settlements fund as noted above the bush administration opposed this settlement because it argued the united states is not signatory to the settlement the total cost was excessive certain infrastructure costs were not yet known costsharing was too limited and federal legal liabilities were still uncertain proponents argue that the settlement is fair settles 30yearold litigation and delivers badly needed water and that the new reclamation water settlements fund provides certainty that the settlement will be implemented 57 for

section 11001 would reauthorize the national geologic mapping act of 1992 which was last reauthorized in 1999 the act established cooperative geologic mapping program between the u s geological survey

water resources study and may be controversial this section directs the secretary of the interior acting through the usgs in coordination with the state of new mexico to study water resources in several basins in new mexico the study would focus on groundwater resources and include an analysis of the salinity recharge potential groundwatersurface water interaction the susceptibility of aquifers to contamination and the amount of water available for human use the secretary must submit report of the study results within two years of enactment concerns about 11002 include the cost and

unrelated provisions covering the following issues management and distribution of north dakota trust funds amendments to the fisheries restoration and irrigation mitigation act of 2000 including that funding provided by the bonneville power administration be credited toward the nonfederal share of project costs amendments to the alaska natural gas pipeline act affecting personnel matters the creation of an additional assistant secretary of energy for electricity delivery and reliability land conveyance for the lovelace respiratory research institute and authorization of appropriations for national tropical botanical gardens the question of altering the governing provisions of trust fund established by states enabling act is controversial largely due to the perceived sanctity of enabling acts states are restricted in how they can manage the trust funds set up by the enabling acts because the provisions of enabling acts are required to be codified within that states constitution modification requires action by the state and the federal government section 12001 management and distribution of north dakota trust funds would give north dakota additional flexibility in managing its trust funds the provision appears to satisfy both aspects of altering trust fund by addressing the federal statutory changes needed and referencing that the state constitutional change has been effected while none of the remaining provisions appear to be broadly controversial each likely has its proponents and opponents 59 prepared by peter folger specialist in energy and natural
