work provides the principal means by which most families support themselves and public policies directed at lowincome families with children have generally attempted to encourage and support work family structure also has been focus of public policy because an increasing number of children live with single parent and poverty rates for such children are much high er than for those in marriedcouple families families with children regardless of marital status are at greater risk of poverty with child poverty rates higher than those for either nonaged or aged adults based on nuclear family income in 2004 171 of families with children had total incomes below the poverty line 215 had incomes of less than 125 of the poverty line poor or near poor and 34 had incomes of less than 200 of poverty lowincome most lowincome families had parent who worked during the year many parents work at jobs that produce low incomes for their families in 2004 13 of parents worked at wage rate that would have produced belowpoverty income for family of three and 45 of parents worked at wage rate that would have produced incomes below 200 of the poverty level even assuming fullyear fulltime worka level designated as lowincome in this report thus families with children headed by single parentwith only one potential earner are more likely to be poor than those headed by married couple however married couples with children and one working parent sometimes struggle to attain even modest income above 200 of poverty it often takes both parents working for family to exceed lowincome levels moreover for many families if one parents earnings are lost the economic status of many marriedcouple families would suffer parents characteristics eg education and work experience and the occupations in which they are employed affect wage rates and therefore the possibility that family is poor or lowincome those with lower levels of educational attainment are more likely to earn low wages and be in lowincome families we estimate that 17 of working parents with just high school diploma earn wages that are too low to support family of three at the poverty lineassuming fulltime fullyear workand 60 would be unable to support such family at twice that level among working parents with bachelors degree only about 6 earn wages too low to support family of three at the poverty line but 24 lack the earnings capacity to support such family at twice the poverty line additionally younger parents typically earn less than older parents who have had more time to accumulate work experience this puts the families of young parents who tend to have young children particularly at risk for poverty and low income annual earnings and economic status also depend on number of hours worked per week and the number of weeks worked during the year in marriedcouple families strong attachment to the workforce of both parents is associated with higher income levels however among poor marriedcouple families only half of all poor families had one earner working fulltime all year this report will not be updated httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33615g18g138g155g142g151g157g156g514g561g25g152g155g148g561g138g151g141

play in supporting their families through work with focus on the adequacy of parental earnings it examines parents effectiveness as breadwinners and seeks to address such questions as how well are american families with children doing how many families are poor and how many are poor in spite of parents work if not poor how many are near poor or just getting by is the fulltime work of one parent sufficient to support family or must other family members most notably spouse also work to attain modest level of income security relative to basic needs which categories of families are particularly struggling could they increase their income security by working more how many families while getting by would be economically vulnerable if they lost breadwinners income or had an additional child the report presents data on income and poverty status of families with children looks at parents wages relative to poverty and factors affecting wages including parents education level age and occupation and examines the amount of work provided by parents and the relationship of job attachment to earnings adequacy the report concludes by highlighting those families most vulnerable to poverty or low income based on parents earnings and briefly discusses public policies and government programs most relevant to those families our analysis is based primarily on data from the us census bureaus annual social and economic supplement to the current populat ion survey cpsasec for 2005 the survey collects information on family composition at the time of the survey february through april of 2005 and income and labor force participation in the previous year ie 2004 while shedding much light on the economic status of families with children the cps cannot address certain 1 for description of child

earnings such as sick andor family leave or other benefits such as health and retirement benefits the major findings of the analysis in this report are based on nuclear family income an estimated 68 million families with children were poor in 2004 accounting for 171 of families headed by parent with one or more children at an income standard of twice the poverty line deemed to be lowincome in this report 144 million families with children qualified as low income accounting for 364 of all families with children many parents work at jobs with wage rates that translate into low incomes for their families in 2004 an estimated 13 of all parents worked at wage rate that would have produced belowpoverty income for family of three even if they worked fulltime all year an estimated 45 of all parents worked at wage rate that would have produced incomes of less than 200 of poverty in marriedcouple families with children it often takes the work of both parents to earn modest income in 2004 almost 40 of all marriedcouple families with children would have had incomes equal to less than 200 of the poverty threshold based on the primary workers earnings many singleparent families having only one earner have earnings that leave the family either poor or near poor in 2004 more than half of motheronly families would have been poor based on the mothers earnings alone more than threequarters of these mothers had earnings that were less than 200 of the poverty threshold our economy has division of labor and specialization some occupations pay relatively low wages and substantial number of parents are employed in these occupations for example in march 2005 12 million parents worked as cashiers an occupation with median wage of 800 an hour this wage rate would produce an income of less than 125 of poverty for family of three parents earnings depend on many factors the most prominent being their level of educational attainment those with college degrees earn more than those without them another factor affecting parents earnings is their ageolder workers who have had more time to acquire onthejob experience and job skills are paid higher wages than less experienced younger workers this has important implications for parents in their 20s and early 30s period when many families are formed and people commonly have children who earn less than older parents g10g152g160g561g25g142g561g6g142g143g146g151g142g561g8g138g150g146g149g146g142g156g561 in this report we define families somewhat differently than the census bureau in its family income and poverty measures under the official census bureau measures all persons related by blood marriage or adoption living in the same household ie living quarters comprise family as such married couple or single parent with dependent biological or adopted children in their household constitutes family but so do more complex households containing other family members such as grandparents aunts and uncles nephews nieces cousins and grandchildren httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33615g18g138g155g142g151g157g156g514g561g25g152g155g148g561g138g151g141 g561g8g138g150g146g149g162g561

census bureau because we wish to gauge parents effectiveness in providing for their immediate familys needsthat is the needs of the parent or parents if spouse is present and their dependent children for this purpose we define families as units composed of married couples or single parents with at least one child under the age of 18 ie minor children all minor children and all adult children living in the household are included in the family unit unless those children have child of their own or are married with spouse residing in the household in such cases where child or another relative who has child lives in the household those subfamily units are included in the analysis but are identified as separate family units the family units constructed through this process are identified as nuclear families which are at times identical to the census bureaus definition of family but in more complex family households are subset of the census bureaus definition see appendix for discussion of family living arrangements and treatment of income in defining poverty g10g152g160g561g25g142g561g22g155g142g138g157g561g11g151g140g152g150g142g561 as noted above we define nuclear families as the basic unit of analysis in this report much of our analysis compares family income or components of family income eg parents earned income relative to census bureau poverty income thresholds we use census bureau poverty thresholds as measure of families basic needs these poverty thresholds vary by family size and composition eg number of related children under the age of 18 and are the most often used standard for measuring basic income needs 3 in our analysis we examine nuclear family income and poverty status based on the units income compared to poverty thresholds that reflect the units size and composition this is because as stated above we are trying to gauge parents effectiveness in meeting their immediate familys income needs unless otherwise stated in cases where there are extended family members andor related subfamily units present in the househol d their income and needs are excluded from the nuclear family income and poverty definitions used in this report however when reference is made to the official census bureau income and poverty measure the income and needs of extended family members are included in this report we construct income to poverty ratios by dividing the familys earnings or income by the applicable poverty threshold based on the familys size and composition family with income below 100 times the poverty line is considered poor we also assess parents earnings and family income at other income standards for example we identify families with income below 125 times the poverty line as near poor below 15 times poverty as economically fragile and below 2 times poverty as lowincome these labels near poor economically fragile and lowincome are used to facilitate the narrative and presentation and should not be construed as official government definitions or designations of relative income adequacy the body of the report focuses primarily on marriedcouple families and families headed by lone mothers with only limited discussion of lonefather families in large part due to their comparatively small numbers however data for all three family types are presented in data appendix appendix b 3 in 2004 for example the poverty threshold for family of three composed of two parents and one child was 15205 poverty thresholds are lower for smaller families and greater for larger families for example in 2004 the poverty threshold for married couple with two children family of four was 19157 and for single parent with one child 13020

much of this report in 2004 an estimated 68 million families with children were poor accounting for 171 of nuclear families or family units composed of just parents and their dependent children in all we estimate there were approximately 397 million nuclear family units with children in 2004 most of these families 316 million or 80 live in independent households with other family members or other unrelated household members under the official census bureau poverty definition taking other family members into account both in terms of their income and needs reduces the number of poor families with children to an estimated 59 million and their poverty rate to 149 figure 1 shows families with children by their incomes relative to the poverty line the lines represent the cumulative percentage of families with children with incomes below specified level by family type the labeled brackets in the figure indicate the range at which families are considered poor below 100 of poverty poor or near poor below 125 of poverty economically fragile below 150 of poverty or lowincome below 200 of poverty the line for all families shows that 171 of families with children have nuclear family incomes below 100 of poverty about onefifth of all families with children 215 were either poor or near poor with incomes below 125 of poverty and well over onethird 364 were lowincome ie had incomes below twice the poverty line most children live in families headed by either married couple or single mother it is well known that the likelihood that child will be impoverished depends greatly on which of these two family types he or she lives in in 2004 just over twofifths 418 of nuclear families with children headed by single mother were poor while only 71 of families with children headed by married couple were poor over twothirds of motheronly families 688 had incomes below twice the poverty line while just over onefifth of marriedcouple families with children 225 fell within this

the primary means by which most parents support their families in 2004 92 of families with children had at least one parent with earnings in marriedcouple families the earnings of single breadwinner may provide income deemed by the couple to be sufficient in other cases both parents may choose to work to improve the familys economic standard of living for families headed by single parents choices between work and family obligations may be more difficult in what follows we compare family income and components of family income to poverty in several ways at times we count only the primary earners earnings against the familys poverty threshold to gauge the effect of one parents labor market engagement in providing for hisher familys needs to this measure we separately add earnings of second parent if present to judge the effect of combining the labor income of both parents in supporting their family in addition to parents earnings in separate step we add all other sources of cash income in the immediate ie nuclear family to provide fuller assessment of their level of economic wellbeing in subsequent final step the income and needs of extended family members living in the household are included in the assessment of family income and poverty status considering earnings alone of course ignores the impact of other forms of incomeparticularly government transfer payments such as food stamps and the refundable earned income tax credit eitcon parents behavior and family economic wellbeing since the focus of this report is on lowincome families with children the impact of these other forms of income on economic wellbeing is obviously important considering the effect of earnings alone on family poverty status addresses the question what would the econ omic wellbeing of

children must be cared for and nurtured lowcost or free child care eg provided by relative may be essential for these mothers to work to support their families among marriedcouple families with children the poverty rate based on the earnings of the primary earner6 alone is estimated at 129 in the majority of these families 77 the husband is the primary earner not shown in figure when the earnings of both parents are considered the poverty rate for married couples with children falls to 100 all other nuclear and extended family income if present reduces the poverty rate of married couples with children to 69the official level under the census bureau definition among marriedcouple families with children earnings of second working parent are particularly important in attaining higher family income standard although earnings of second parent have only about three percentage point effect on the poverty rate the importance of these earnings is seen higher in the income distribution based on the earnings of married couples primary earner alone nearly 40 of married couple families with children would be classified as lowincome however when the earnings of the second parent are added to family income that percentage drops to 27 thus it often takes two working parents for married couple family to attain modest income in 2004 among primary earners in marriedcouple families with children who worked fulltime fullyear 9 were unable to provide their families with standard of living above poverty based on their earnings alone 15 were unable to secure an earningsbased standard of living beyond near poverty and 36 were unable to attain modest level of income security above twice the poverty line not shown in figure in many cases both parents work presumably at least in part to attain higher standard of living marriedcouple families face tradeoff relating to whether parent should stay home to care for the children or go to work to secure additional income the decision may be weighed by such factors as the secondary workers earnings potential and career ambitions suitability and cost of child care arrangements and other workrelated

productivity workers productivity is related to the knowledge skills and abilities brought to the labor market as shorthand we will refer to these worker traits simply as skills or human capital employers need for specific skills demand along with the relative scarcity of those skills in the labor force supply help determine the market value or wage that workers command and employers offer some workers skills are valued highly as reflected in their wages other workers skills are valued such that the market offers comparatively low wages two commonly measured aspects of workers human capital are educational attainment and lifetime work experience in this section we examine the effects of educational attainment on parents wages and family poverty status based on the highest education credential that parents have attained however lifetime work experience is not measured on the current population survey cps in this analysis we use parents age as proxy for potential onthejob experience wage rates vary by factors other than human capital for example wage rates of african americans and hispanics tend to be lower than those for whites women often earn less than men numerous studies have examined wage rates by race ethnicity and gender attempting to determine the amount by which wage differentials can be attributed to differences in measurable background factors eg education and work experience and the degree to which remaining unexplained differences might be due to other less directly measurable factors such as discrimination 8

educational attainment it shows the hourly earnings by decile each 10 of the wage rate distribution for each level of educational attainment the upward slope of the lines shows that wage rates increase with levels of educational attainment further the widening spread of the lines as educational attainment increases shows that the returns to education have greater variability at higher levels of attainment than at lower levels 8 for survey of this literature see altonji joseph and g and rebecca m blank race and gender in the labor market in handbook of labor economics volume 3c

attainment 2004 in 2004 the median wage rate equivalent for parent who had less than high school diploma was 962 per houra fulltime fullyear earnings level that equates to about 132 of the poverty line for married couple with one child10 based on those earnings alone such family would be classified as economically fragile with one additional child the family would be barely above poverty11 the median hourly wage equivalent of workers with high school diploma 1282 and those with some college but degree 1462 affords married couple with one earner and one child standard of livin g equal to 175 of poverty in the former case and 200 of poverty in the latter case it should be noted that these wage rates are the median observed hourly wage rates for working parents meaning that half of parents at given education level earn more per hour and half earn less the other earnings percentiles show the distribution of hourly earnings at each level of educational attainment the figure shows that higher levels of educational attainment do not necessarily translate into higher wages for example some workers with less than high school diploma earn more than workers with college degree while 20 of parents with less than high school diploma earn 1538 per hour or more 20 of those with bachelors degree earn 1333 per hour or less those wage levels mean that the top 20 of workers with less than high school diploma can support spouse and one child at modest income level equal to 210 of the poverty level 10 962 per hour x 2080 hours of work per year divided by the poverty line for married couple with one child 15205 equals 132 of poverty 11 962 per hour x 2080 hours of work per year divided by the poverty line for married couple with two children 19157 equals 104 of poverty

such family at only 182 of poverty level considered here to be lowincome in figure 5 we show how parents level of educational attainment and associated wage rates vary in their ability to support benchmark family of three in the figure working parents wages are translated into fulltime fullyear earnings equivalencies12 as measure of parents potential annual earnings as such we are considering only the ef fect of wages and not how much or little parent works on the potential economic wellbeing of hisher family parents potential earnings are compared to benchmark family s basic needs the poverty threshold for threeperson family ie 15205 for married couple with one child in 2004 the estimates are for all working parents ie primary and secondary wage earners in marriedcouple families as well as working lone parents parents who did not work during the year are excluded from the analysis as they have observed wage rate as noted above the estimates assume fulltime fullyear work for parents working less or for parents w ho have larger families to support than the 3 person standard shown here standards of living relative to poverty would be lower than those depicted for parents working beyond fulltime fullyear equivalent or having smaller family ie lone parent with only one child standard s of living relative to poverty would be higher than those depicted not surprisingly as workers educational attainment increases so do their wage rates and their ability to support family figure 5 shows that while 3 out of 10 working parents with less than high school diploma would have

figures shows hourly earnings in marriedcouple families with children for the parent with the highest earnings by that parents age the second figure shows hourly earnings for mothers heading families with spouse present by the mothers age the figures show that older parents tend to command higher earnings than younger parents the figure also shows that there is considerable wage dispersion among parents at any given age and the dispersion widens with advancing age for example figure 6 shows that in 2004 the median hourly earnings of the highest earning parent in very young marriedcouple families ie with parents under age 25 was 1106 in other words half of these parents had hourly earnings that were higher than 1106 and half had hourly earnings below 1106 onetenth of parents under age 25 had hourly earnings below 611 and onetenth had hourly earnings above 1868 on the other hand among parents age 45 to 49 who were the primary earner in marriedcouple families half had hourly earnings of 2404 or more med ian amount and 10 earned 1068 per hour or less however slightly more than half of parents under the age of 25 earned more per hour than the bottom 10 of parents age 45 to 49

young parents are particularly economically vulnerable as shown above wage rates of younger parents tend to be lower than those of older parents as younger parents have had less time in the labor market to capture the wage premiums that typically come with job experience younger parents also typically have younger children whose needs for care may limit the ability or willingness of parent to work outside the home childs birth especially among young parents may interrupt parents education and delay possible accumulation of work experience thereby affecting future wage possibilities younger parents may lack the job security that comes with time on the job exposing them to greater risk of being laid off during economic downturns figures 9 and 10 depict family income relative to poverty for marriedcouple and motheronly families respectively by parents age for marriedcouple families the age of the older parent is shown figure 9 shows for example that more than onefifth 210 of marriedcouples with children in which the parent was under the age of 25 were poor in 2004 based on their immediate family income nearly twofifths 396 had immediate family income below 150 of the

human capital affect their wage rates but so too do the characteristics of their jobs eg occupation industry firm size and working conditions adam smith in wealth of nations wrote much about the division of labor and how differing wage rates among jobs reflect both institutional and market conditions to attract workers to job employers set wage rates such that they reflect both the jobs educationalskill requirements and its other attributes 13 some occupations typically pay wages that are insufficient to support benchmark family of three beyond lowincome level even if the parent works 40 hours per week all year table 2 shows some of the occupations that pay parents relatively low wages shown are occupations that employed more than 500000 parents in march 2005 and paid less than 1462 per hour in that 13 economists have developed the theory of equalizing or compensating wage differentials to explain the structure of wages occupations that require larger investments in education must pay higher wages to compensate workers for paying the upfront costs of these investments though the impact of education has dominated r ecent discussions of wage determination other attributes of the job might also affe ct its wage relative to other jobs for example jobs that entail physical risk difficult working conditions the risk of unemployment or higher than average risk of failure should pay wage premiumhigher wages than they otherwise would pay on the other hand occupations that have desirable characteristics such as pleasant working conditions higher than average job security or offer unusual schedules flexible or parttime might pay less than otherwise would be paid see rosen sherwin the theory of equalizing differences in ashenfelter orley c and richard layard

equation that determines annual earnings is the amount of work done during the yearnumber of hours and weeks actually worked the hourly poverty wage rates shown earlier in table 1 reflect the hourly wage needed to achieve level of annual earnings assuming work of 40 hours per week for all 52 weeks of the year however many parents work less than fulltime yearround some weeks are spent unemployed because the parent was either laid off from job or is out of work but actively seeking employment other weeks may be spent out of the labor force where the parent is not seeking work also but less frequently some parents work less than fulltime work schedules the amount of work that parent wants to provide is based on tradeoffs between the income derived from work and the value of leisure and home production eg housework child care that would have to be foregone in order to work with children involved the costbenefit analysis that goes into the decision to participate in the labor forceand for how many hours in week per yearincludes costs associated with caring for children moreover wanting to provide work and actually working are not always the same thing for example many if not most employers offer only fixed work schedules with fixed hours which may not accommodate some parents needs or preferences

couple by the combination of mothers and fathers hours of work during the year it shows that the most common combination is when both the mother and father worked the equivalent of fulltime full year work during the year in 2004 282 of all families with children headed by married couple had both parents fully engaged in the workforce in the year however also common was full engagement by married

with children 92 had one parent who worked at some point in 2004 however the economic status of families depends not so much on whether parent works but rather on how much work one or both parents engage in over the year in the previous section we examined the total number of hours parents worked during the year here we examine how parents acquire those hours of workare they working all or just some weeks during the year when they work are they working fulltime or parttime schedules to examine this question we use the us bureau of labor statistics bls definition of fullyear employment as working 50 weeks or more during the year and the definition of fulltime work as 35 hours or more during the week in this section we find that less than full participation in the workforceworking fewer than 50 weeks and to lesser extent working parttime schedulewas associated with greater likelihood of poverty and low annual earnings

previous sections we examined the relation of wages and job attachment to family earnings adequacy as indicated by family income pover ty thresholds we showed how the ability to support family is closely related to parents education and age some parents earnings capacities based on their observed wage rates are too low to support couple and single child above poverty let alone to attain level of modest income security above twice the poverty line even if the parent is able to work fulltime fullyear families headed by single parent are at distinct economic disadvantage compared to married couples in part due to the unavailability of potential added earnings that come when both parents work but also due to the absence of second caretaker who can help watch over children thereby allowing the other parent to work adam smith opened the wealth of nations by noting that improvement in labor productivity stemmed from the effects of the division of labor smith also noted that different occupations resulting from the division of labor command different wages with market and institutional forces combining to create these wage differentials thus the division of labor provides the means to an affluent society but also results in an unequal distribution of the rewards from work

children that are likely to be poor or lowincome based on the work of their parents families headed by single mother given that wage rates of many parents jobs would leave family in lowincome status it often takes two parents working for familys earnings to attain modest income level above the lowincome threshold of 200 of poverty used in this report fulltime work for many single parents may be difficult to attain if safe reliable and affordable child care is difficult to obtain obviously then single parent families are at high risk for low income and poverty young families the principal earner of families headed by parent under the age of 25 had median earnings of 1106 per houra wage rate that would classify the three person benchmark family used in this analysis as lowincome but just slightly above the cutoff that would classify the family as economically fragile ie 150 of poverty based on fulltime fullyear work the low earnings of these young parents is logical consequence of being at the beginning of their adult work careers and not yet having accumulated job experience that raises earnings capacity in young marriedcouple families it may make little economic sense for both parents to work as child care for young children may be expensive relative to additional earnings that might be obtained additionally many families prefer that parent stay home to care for and nurture their children and parents labor force withdrawal may be voluntary and temporary low income and economic insecurity may be temporary during the early years of family formation but have implications for family wellbeing and child development and outcomes in years beyond families headed by parent without college degree families headed by parent who lacked high school degree were likely to be lowincome median wage rateseven for high school graduates and those with some college but college degreeresult in the benchmark threeperson family being classified in the lowincome category by having earnings below 200 of poverty unlike low wage rates caused solely by lack of job experience the lowincome status for families headed by parent without college degree might not be temporary social and economic behavior that is considered consistent with personal responsibilitysuch as marriage work and educationis not sufficient for family with child or children to escape low income rates of poverty and low income fo r singleparent families are higher than in marriedcouple families however nontrivial percentage of poor families with children 28were headed by married couples wage rates are strongly related to educational status but in 20 of poor families with children the principal earner had college degree moreover even more affluent families with children may be considered economically vulnerable based on the earnings of both parents 27 of marriedcouple families with children are low income however based solely on the earnings of the familys principal earner 39 of such families would be lowincome thus the economic wellbeing of many marriedcouple families with children is vulnerable to the loss of earnings of the familys second earner further there are reasons that some parents do not or cannot work fulltime all year such as involuntary unemployment illness or disability or the need to take time off for the birth or care of child or disabled family member

by the labor market government policy of course also has important implications for the economic wellbeing and security of families with children although it will be only briefly mentioned in this report government policies that promote full employment while at the same time keeping inflation in check are clearly important to working families while strong economy is necessary to promote family economic security for many families it is not sufficient families may still face economic vulnerability even when the economy is healthy table 3 presents typology of selected existing government programs focusing on federal or federalstate programs and how they relate to the economic wellbeing and vulnerability of families with children many of these programs face difficult tradeoffs and competing objectivessuch as providing some measure of basic economic security while also promoting personal responsibility this is especially true of safety net programs that provide assistance to mitigate income loss caused by certain events but result in inherent undesired behavioral effects such as work disincentives and marriage penalties other policies and programs seek to mitigate the undesired outcomes often associated with safetynet programs by increasing the financial returns associated with work or providing opportunities to reduce the intergenerational transmission of poverty policies to mitigate the risk of earnings loss these programs represent the basic twotiered safety net of social insurance programs and needtested programs the social insurance programs base benefits on past earnings and entitlement to these benefits is earned through work in covered employment the caseload and expenditures of social insurance programs are far greater than those of the needtested programs for families with children the basic contours of the safety net were established in the social security act of 1935 with the last major additions coming with establishment of medicaid 1965 medicare for the disabled including children 1972 and food stamps made available nationwide in the 1970s most recently this safety net was affected by the welfare reform law of 1996 which converted aid to fa milies with dependent children originally established in the 1965 social security act into block grant to states that provides timelimited and workconditioned cash assistance to poor families with children policies to raise the financial returns to work these are policies to directly raise wages eg minimum wage legislat ion provide earnings supplements or reduce the costs of going to work minimum wage legislationlike the social security actdates back to the great depression however the 1990s saw great deal of expansion of policies in this category including expansions of the earned income tax credit eitc which provides work bonus to families with low to moderate earnings and increased funding for child care which helps offset the costs of going to work policies aimed at family formation there has been much recent attention paid to this class of policies tax policies such as the deduction for dependents and the partially refundable child credit benefit families based on their number of children these policies to some extent adjust families tax burdens based on family size they may also mitigate to an extent the fact that employers consider workers assumed productivity when striking wage bargains rather than the number of dependents worker must support the role of cash welfarecushioning economic hardship when one parent is absent but thought by some to facilitate singleparenthoodhas been controversial however collections of child support for both welfare and nonwelfare families through

increased dramatically since the mid1990s recent attention has been paid to socalled marriage penalties in the tax code and very recently marriage promotion and education programs have been introduced meanwhile family planning grants authorized in 1970 may have the effect of deferring childbearing while adolescent family life created in 1980 and abstinence education enacted in 1996 specifically focus on preventing pregnancy among teenagers policies aimed at preventing intergenerational transmission of poverty as briefly mentioned poverty among families with children has special consequences particularly since growing up poor might affect childs life chances as an adult programs such as head start and title i grants to local school districts for supplementary education and services for disadvantaged children are intended to help poor children obtain the education needed to escape poverty as an adult httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33615 g561 g5g20g21g556g345g343g561t able 3 t ypolog of

for this purpose we focused on parents and their nuclear families as the primary units of analysis this approach diverges from that more commonly used in which all related members of household are considered family in this report we define such families as extended families additionally individuals unrelated to nuclear or extended family members may also reside within household figure a1 depicts families with children by their familyhousehold living arrangements the figure shows for example that 91 of married couples with children live as independent nuclear family units with other extended family members or unrelated members residing in the household in contrast only about 60 of lonemother families and just 41 of families headed by lone fathers live as independent nuclear family households among marriedcouple families with children about 8 live in households with extended family members in comparison about onequarter of lonemother families and nearly an equal share of lonefather families live in households with extended family members in some of these extended family member households other nonrelatives may also reside about 18 of lonemother families and more than twice that share of lonefather families 41 reside in households with unrelated household members the top two tiers of each bar among lonemother families 15 live only with unrelated members and small

childr 2004 in this report we considered at times only nuclear family members income and needs when assessing family economic wellbeing in other instances extended family members income and needs were also included in the analysis as noted above some nuclear and related extended families live in households with unrelated members as well however the potential effect of unrelated household members income and needs on nuclear or extended family wellbeing may vary to the extent that resources are shared among household members in some cases unrelated household members such as unmarried partners may make significant economic contributions to the nuclear family coresiding in the household in other cases the sharing of economic resources among unrelated household members may be minimal however there is clear means of determining the extent to which unrelated house hold members share income and represent joint economic unit in this analysis we excluded unrelated household members income and needs when considering family economic wellbeing the effect of family living arrangements on poverty status can be illustrated by closer examination of the families as economic units under various family configurations and income sharing arrangements figure a2 illustrates the effects of family living arrangements and the treatment of income and needs on family economic wellbeing relative to

income are counted for purposes of determining poverty status however if all related household members income and needs are considered the poverty rate of lonemother families drops to 35the official census bureau poverty rate which considers all related family members as the economic unit for poverty determination if the economic unit is expanded to include all unrelated household members the poverty rate for lone mother families falls to 299 it should be noted however that for purposes of income and poverty determination official census bureau statistics do not combine unrelated household members income or needs it was shown earlier in this appendix that about 60 of lonemother families live as independent nuclear family households absent any extended related family members or unrelated household members among these families an estimated 37 are poor their poverty status is the same under all three poverty definitions poor based on nuclear family income poor based on extended family income and poor based on household income roughly 22 of lonemother families live with other extended family members only among these families an estimated 51 are poor based on their immediate family income however when the income and needs of other related household members are taken into consideration their poverty rate drops to about 23less than half the rate when only immediate nuclear family income was considered and rate below that of lone mothers who live as independent nuclear families 37 in part the nuclear family poverty rate 51 of lone mothers in such living arrangements may be so high because they live with extended family members who help provide for their support this support is not counted in determining the 51 poverty rate but is

independently their poverty rate might not be as high as 51 but it also might not be as low as the 37 among lone mothers currently observed to be living independently some would likely work and earn more than they do when living with extended family or would seek to qualify for government assistance in the absence of extended family income support the rightmost set of clustered bars in figure a2 depict the poverty status of lone mothers living with only their children and at least one unrelated household member as noted above about 15 of lone mothers live in such households when only her immediate nuclear family income and needs are taken into account about 46 of these lonemother families would be considered poor however if all unrelated household members are considered and their income counted for purposes of determining poverty the poverty rate among these lonemother families falls to 148well below the poverty rate of lone mothers living independently in nuclear families with extended or unrelated household members in these households with unrelated members the extent to which household income is shared among members is uncertain crs estimates that about 1 million lone mothers approximately 65 of 16 million lonemother families living with unrelated household members may be in cohabiting relationships with man 16 in some cases unmarried partners may share economic resources and responsibilities much in the same way as married couples do 16 we identify likely cohabiting couples based on inference couples are identified as likely cohabiting if there are only two unrelated adults in the household of the opposite sex who are both unmarried and where there are related subfamily members present
