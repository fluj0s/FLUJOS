updated july 31 2008 james m bickley specialist in public finance government and finance division tax gap administration proposal to require information reporting on merchant payment card reimbursements summary the high current and forecast budget deficits as well as payasyougo paygo procedures have resulted in congressional and executive branch interest in raising additional revenue through proposals for improved tax compliance the bush administrations fy2009 budget includes proposal the proposal to require each payment card processor to inform the irs on the net dollar amount paid to reimburse each merchant ie seller for his payment card receipts in calendar year payment cards consist of both credit cards and debit cards the card processor is responsible for delivering the payment card transaction to the appropriate card issuer in order that the customer is billed and the merchant receives funds for the purchase the proposal would allow the irs to compare the aggregate net payment card amounts reported by processors with the payment card amounts reported by merchants the proposal would be effective for payment transactions made on or after january 1 2010 the bush administration maintains that this thirdparty reporting would significantly increase compliance the payment card industry has several possible configurations configuration may consist of four parties three parties or two parties fourparty system would include payment card association card issuer merchant acquirer and processor regardless of the number of parties in the configuration the processing function is the point where the proposed reporting requirement would apply the treasury argues that the proposal would yield substantial revenue because of thirdparty reporting which has been shown to significantly increase compliance proponents maintain that the proposal would improve the allocation of productive resources they also claim that private sector compliance costs would be reasonable and they argue that the irs has the ability to process additional information returns the proposal is not without its critics some question the accuracy of the us treasury estimates of the revenue yield opponents also are concerned about the possible reduction in privacy from the proposal in addition they maintain that private compliance costs would be substantial some argue that numerous potential administrative difficulties have not been addressed and there would be disproportionate burden on small businesses the proposal was included as revenue offset in hr 6275 the alternative minimum tax relief act of 2008 which passed the house on june 25 2008 and was referred to the senate committee on finance the proposal was also included as revenue offset in hr 3221 the housing and

of the net dollar amount paid to reimburse each merchant ie seller for payment card receipts in calendar year payment cards consist of both credit cards and debit cards this report examines the proposal by describing current law presenting the proposal contained in the fy2009 budget describing the structure of the payment card industry analyzing the justifications for the proposal and explaining the criticisms of the proposal furthermore there is description of the inclusion of the proposal as revenue offset in hr 6275 alternative minimum tax relief act of 2008 and hr 3221 housing and economic recovery act of 2008 which was signed into law pl 110289 by president bush on july 30 2008 pl 110289 requires information reporting on merchant payment card reimbursements on returns for

alternative minimum tax amt current law under current law taxpayer making payments to noncorporate recipient which total 600 or more for services or determinable gains in the course of trade or business in calendar year is required to send an information return to the irs2 this information return generally on form 1099 indicates the payment amount and the name and address of the recipient3 this requirement is far from universal information reporting is not required on many other types of transactions including 1 for an analysis of current paygo procedures in the senate and house of

services4 proposal the proposal would require the institution that makes the payment to the merchant ie the seller for card transaction for example the merchant acquiring bank to make an annual information report to the irs generally the reporting institution would be the bank or central organization to which the merchant sends payment card transactions for actual payment the report would state the net total amount paid to the merchant during calendar year the report would reflect appropriate adjustments for amounts that represent cash advances made by the merchant via the payment card or other amounts not included in the merchants gross income where an electronic payment facilitator or other third party processes payments between merchant acquiring bank5 and merchant the third party would be subject to the information reporting requirement similarly if payment card transactions of several merchants are aggregated the intermediary acting on behalf of the merchants and actually making the payment to the merchants also would have to report in that case the bank or central organization would report only as to the intermediary6 the u s treasury estimates that the proposal would yield additional revenue of 5735 billion from fy2009fy2013 and 18730 billion from fy2009fy20187 the proposal would be effective for payment transactions made on or after january 1 2010 structure of the payment card industry the proposal would require credit and debitcard processors to inform the irs annually about all aggregate reimbursement payments made to merchants to fully understand the proposal an understanding of the structure of the payment card industry is helpful the payment card industry has several possible configurations configuration may consist of four parties three parties or two parties fourparty system would include payment card association card issuer merchant acquirer and processor the primary payment card associations are visa and mastercard8

through which financial institutions interact to complete payment transactions pursuant to their respective rules and regulations9 card issuer is simply nonfinancial or financial institution usually bank that issues payment cards merchant acquirer is card association member that initiates and maintains relationships with merchants that accept payment cards10 processor is an organization that is connected to payment card association and provides authorization clearing and settlement services on behalf of member11 the processor is responsible for delivering the transaction to the appropriate card issuer so that the customer is billed and the merchant receives funds for the purchase12 in threeparty system the roles of card issuer and acquirer are combined in one institution13 examples of the threeparty systems are american express and discover card14 for twoparty system payment cards are issued by merchant to its retail customers for use only at the issuing merchants locations15 an example of twoparty system is department store that issues its own payment cards regardless of the number of parties in the configuration the processing function is the point where the proposed reporting requirement would apply the proposal states generally the reporting institution would be the bank or central organization to which the merchant sends payment card transactions for actual payment16 the treasurys description of the proposal gives an example of the processor as the merchant acquiring bank the processor would inform the irs of the net dollar amount paid to reimburse each merchant for their payment card receipts in calendar year this reported amount by the processor can be compared with the amount reported by the merchant to the irs 8 continued the black box federal

for the proposal the treasury maintains that the proposal would raise substantial revenue at relatively low cost the treasury further asserts that some merchants are underreporting gross income derived from payment card transactions17 justifications for the proposal are high revenue yield improved economic efficiency reasonable private sector compliance costs and the ability of the irs to process additional information returns revenue yield due to thirdparty reporting the treasury argues that the proposal would yield substantial revenue because of thirdparty reporting which has been shown to significantly increase compliance18 the internal revenue service has estimated individual income tax underreporting by visibility categories for 2001 for income subject to little or information reporting the net misreporting percentage was 53919 for income subject to some information reporting the net misreporting percentage was 8620 these data suggest that the proposal would substantially reduce noncompliance in addition payment card reimbursement information for business could be used to determine if revenue from cash payments to the business has been understated former irs commissioner mark everson gave the following example what this would do is if you had dry cleaning business for example and lets assume that the typical breakdown of that revenue is 50 percent credit and 50 percent cash and if you were reporting to us 1 million in revenues and then we got notice from series of credit card issuers that there was actually 1 million of credit card revenues from that business that would raise real red flag and might prompt an audit it would certainly prompt communication21 improved economic efficiency proponents argue that the proposal would improve the allocation of productive resources better tax compliance due to greater enforcement causes some resources to shift to away from sectors of the economy where they were attracted by the ease of tax evasion these resources will shift to other sectors where they will now earn higher aftertax rate of return 17 ibid 18 ibid 19 us treasury internal revenue service feb 2007 tax gap data for 2001 p 2

sector compliance costs proponents argue that private sector compliance costs would be reasonable as indicated by current reporting practices of payment card processors and compliance costs of existing information reporting current reporting practices of payment card processors the payment card processors usually banks that have issued payment cards already report summaries of payment card transactions to both customers who have purchased goods and services and merchants who have been reimbursed for selling these goods and services22 thus former irs commissioner mark everson argued that the proposal merely required that available information be sent to the irs23 compliance costs of existing information reporting the government accountability office gao conducted study concerning two information reporting proposals merchant payment card reimbursements and payments to corporations one of the purposes of this study was to identify the compliance costs of existing information reporting using case studies24 finding of low existing compliance costs would suggest that compliance costs of additional reporting requirements may also be low gao examined nine case studies to determine the kinds of thirdparty compliance costs that may result from merchant payment card reimbursements25 gao obtained some of its information through structured interviews gao interviewed five companies that it selected from lists of vendors irs approved filers and information reporting program advisory committee members26 gao also interviewed four organizations volunteered through international accounts payable professionals or the national federation of independent business27 gao found the following in our nine case studies filers of information returns told us that existing information return costs both inhouse and for external payments were relatively low inhouse compliance costs included the costs of getting taxpayer identification numbers tin buying software tracking reportable payments filing returns with irs and mailing copies to taxpayers one small business employing under five people told us of possibly spending three to five hours per year filing form 1099 information returns manually using an accounting package to gather the information an organization with more than 10000 employees estimated spending less than 005 of its yearly staff time on preparing and filing forms 1099 including recordkeeping two external parties 22 ibid 23 ibid 24 us government accountability office tax administration costs and uses of third party information returns gao08266

them charging about 80 per form for 100000 forms as expected unit prices for services provided to payers by selected software vendors service bureaus and return preparers decreased as the number of forms handled increased28 gao notes that the case study results are intended to provide examples and are not generalized to the entire population29 the sample is not random and is too small to yield statistically significant results irss ability to process additional information returns gao found that the irs could process additional information returns for fy2008 irs budgeted 80 million for programming and startup costs for the payment card proposal the irs estimated administrative implementation costs after fy2008 would be 127 million30 criticisms of the proposal criticisms of the proposal concern the accuracy of the revenue estimates privacy concerns thirdparty compliance costs administrative issues and burden on small businesses accuracy of revenue estimates some opponents of the proposal question the accuracy of the estimated revenue yield in the fy2007 report the treasury estimated that the reporting requirement would help generate 9 million in 2007 92 million during the years 20072011 and 225 million during the years 20072016 in contrast the fy2008 report stated that the reporting requirement would help generate 113 million in 2008 33 billion during the years 20082012 and 108 billion during the years 2008 2017 both the fy2007 and fy2008 report are based on data gathered from the 2001 tax year and there is explanation for how the proposed revenue estimate jumped astronomically from 2007 to 200831 furthermore as previously indicated the us treasury estimates that the proposal would yield 5735 billion from fy2009fy2013 and 18730 billion from fy2009 28

the same in the fy2008 and fy2009 budgets but the us treasury offers explanation for the substantial rise in its estimated revenue yield in addition the effect on revenues of possible behavior response are unknown some merchants may require or encourage their customers to pay them in cash rather than by payment card in order to prevent the irs from obtaining full information about their payment card sales privacy concerns some opponents are concerned about possible reductions in privacy from the proposal for example spokesperson for the nsba national small business association stated that nsba fully supports efforts to collect legally owed tax revenues but not at the undue expense of the privacy and integrity of honest hard working entrepreneurs32 high private compliance costs gao found that new informationreporting requirements for payment card reimbursements would impose new compliance costs such as 1 merging separately stored taxpayer and merchant identification numbers especially in the case of multiple locations or franchises and 2 more generally new systems and added customer service requirements33 but some of these compliance costs could be mitigated for example current systems and procedures that generate and report related data could be extended34 administrative issues some opponents argue that before the proposal can be formulated into legislation numerous potential administrative issues need to be addressed such as definitions of terms reporting of transactions timing of transactions and administrative procedures35 the actual settlement process for payment cards can be complicated 32 paul hense immediate past chairman of the national small business association statement before the house small business committee hearing on closing the tax gap

these difficulties were examined by the american bankers association for example see american bankers association white paper on the administrations proposal to require information reporting on merchant payment card reimbursements pp 811 another source for an explanation of administrative difficulties is martin sullivan treasury expects billions from credit card reporting proposal tax notes vol 115 10 june 4 2007 pp 890892 crs8 in its report gao indicates some policy options to mitigate potential problems in its description of the proposal the treasury does state that the proposal would grant regulatory authority to allow exceptions from the requirements where the benefit of improved compliance from information reporting is outweighed by the cost of compliance and to prevent double reporting of amounts potentially reported under other provisions36 two examples of likely administrative difficulties serve to demonstrate the complexities of the proposal first transactions processed on one day may be subsequently reversed when cardholders return merchandise or invoke their rights under the federal truth in lending act electronic fund transfer act or similar state laws37 cardholders may be entitled to credits from their card issuers which can result in the transaction being reversed or charged back the proposal does not discuss this issue second gift card may be sold in one time period but used to purchase product in latter time period if the initial sale of the gift card is reported as transaction then the sellers gross reimbursements may be overstated the proposal does not address the issue of gift card sales gao indicates several possible methods of mitigating charge backs gift cards and other items that may cause payment reimbursements not to match merchant receipts for one of its methods of mitigation gao states since irs is not planning an exact match anyway it could announce it was developing industry norms of nettogross ratios to evaluate information although norms may not be foolproof or always possible38 disproportionate burden on small businesses some critics argue that the proposal would impose disproportionate burden on small businesses39 first the proposal would require payment card processors to verify businesss taxpayer identification number tin if the payment card processor fails to verify the tin then the processors would be required to withhold 28 of the gross receipts of the business the president of the national small business association maintains that this provision would impose disproportionate burden on small businesses who may have to prove to the irs that their tins are 36 us treasury general explanations of the administrations fiscal year 2009 revenue proposals p 65 37 american bankers association

privacy concerns because they are more likely to use their social security numbers as their merchant taxpayer identification number41 third the executive director of the national association of the selfemployed nase argues that some administrative costs of the proposal on payment card processors may be passed onto businesses through higher fees for accepting payment cards and these higher fees would disproportionately affect small businesses42 revenue offset in hr 6275 and pl 110289 on june 17 2008 representative charles b rangel chairman of the house ways and means committee introduced hr 6275 the alternative minimum tax relief act of 2008 which would provide individuals temporary relief from the alternative minimum tax one of the revenue offsets was the enactment of proposal contained in the presidents fy2009 budget to require institutions that make payments to merchants in settlement of payment card transactions to file an information return with the internal revenue service43 the proposal would be effective for information returns for reportable transactions for calendar years beginning after december 31 201144 the joint committee on taxation estimated that this revenue offset
