law division m lynne corn specialist in natural resources resources science and industry division summary congress is again considering whether to permit drilling for oil and gas on the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlif refuge anwr alaska or to maintain the current statutory prohibition on oil and gas development in the refuge the 109th congress has considered the issue in aut horizing bills budget reconciliation bills and an appropriation bill but legislation opening the refuge has not yet passed both chambers several measures would have limited the surface area that could be covered by certain oil production nd support facilities to 2000 acres of the 15 million acres of the coastal plain these provisions raise several issues they may not apply to some or all of the nearly 100000 acres held by nativ americans in the refuge that could be developed if the fede ral lands are opened to oil and gas development and exactly what facilities would be subject to the limitation is not clear although the limitation could constrain development if oil and gas discoveries are widesp read this report discusses both legal and technical aspects of the 2000acre limit and will be updated as circumstances warrant congress is currently considering whether to permit drilling for oil and gas on the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlif refuge anwr alaska inaction would retain the current statutory prohibition on drilling in the refuge congress has considered the issue in authorizing bills budget reconciliation b ills which cannot be filibustered in the senate and an appropriation bill1 the housepassed energy bill hr 6 authorized leasing in anwr but the senate did not pass comparable bill and the provisions were eliminated before enac tment as pl 10958 the senate passed s 1932 budget reconciliation measure that would have authorized anwr leasing but thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22143crs2 2 supporters of the limitation favor development and argue that by limiting surface development environmental impacts will be reduced opponents of anwr development argue that what they see as major impacts eg caribou displacement dust subsistence and recreation resources would still occur and an acreage limit would create false sense of safety net for the refuge 3 pl 96487 94 stat 2374 16 usc 3101 et seqcomparable house reconciliation measure did not although an earlier version did an attempt to add anwr leasing to the defe nse appropriations bill hr 2863 pl 109 148 also failed section 2207a3 of hr 6 would have limited the amount of surface area that can be covered by oil producti on and support facilities to 2000 acres of the 15 million acres of the coastal plain section 4001f of th senatepassed s 1932 contained similar acreage limit as did 7a3 of divc of hr 2863 the hr 6 provision would have directed the secretary of the interior to ensure that the maximum amount of surface acreage covered by production and support facilities including airstrips and any areas covered by gravel berms or piers for support of pipelines does not ex ceed 2000 acres on the coastal plain further 2207f would have directed th secretary to prepare periodic plans to avoid unnecessary duplication of facilities and to encourage consolidation of facilities among other things this 2000acre footprin t limitation is frequently cited as one way to minimize impacts of oil and gas development on the refuge2 however the hr 6 provision might not have limited exploratory facilities and might not have limited some permanent structures the acreage limit would have applied to some and perhaps many important development facilities if facilities were limited as result or if oil and gas discoveries are widespread some otherwise attractive di scoveries could have been precluded or the limitation might be lifted at later date to permit full development section 2207a would have required the secretary to administer the provisions of the title in manner consistent with the requirements of secti on 2203 section 2203a required among other things that the secretary ensure the receipt of fair market value by the public for the mineral resources to be leased there may have been tradeoff between the direction to limit surface use for production and support f acilities to 2000 acres as well as other constraints and the determination of fair market value since bidders could be expected to discount their bids or vary their bidding strategy to reflect the limitation the senate measure s 1932 was less deta iled than the house measure because it was part of budget reconciliation measur and special procedural rules applied but leasing language in it and in the dod appropr iation bill was similar to that in hr 6 this report discusses bot h legal and technical aspects of the 2000acre limit current law on development of anwr anwr contains federal lands and nonfederal lands held by native americans section 1003 of the aska national interest

claims settlement act ancsa5 resolved the claims of alaska natives against the united states in part by establishing native village corporations th at could select surf ace land holdings and native regional corporations associated with the village corporations that could select primarily subsurface rights the kakt ovik inupiat corporation kic selected approximately three townships of lands in the geographic coastal plain of anwr township is typically 23040 acres however the legal boundaries of the coastal plain as term defined under anilca were adminis tratively drawn so as to exclude these three townships from the defined coastal plain also under anilca kic was entitled to select fourth township for total of approximately 92000 acres this township is within the area administratively defined as the coastal plain in addition there are several thousand acr of claimed or conveyed nativeowned allotments in the refuge these are basically surface ownerships with the federal government reserving the oil gas and coal rights although allo tments were originally restricted titles under pl 108337 allotments may now be subdivided and dedicated as if the surface estate were held in unrestricted fee simple title fact that could facilitate development on them if the refuge is opened the arctic slope regional co rporation asrc the regional corporation associated with kic initially could not select lands within anwr under the terms of ancsa but did receive the subsurface of these lands pursuant to 1983 land exchange agreement known as the 1983 agreement or the chandler lake agreement negotiated by then secretary of the interior james watt asrc lands are defined in the agreement as including as the context requires the surface lands as well6 however asrcs oil and gas cannot be developed unle ss and until congress authorizes oil and gas development on the federal lands in the coasta l plain on the asrc lands or both appendices i and ii of the 1983 agreement cont ain terms and stipulations that would govern oil exploration activities on asrc lands unless superseded by legislation or regulations in addition par b9 of appe ndix ii states that any oil and gas production activities on asrc lands which are both within and outsi the coastal plain shall be in accordance with the substantive statutory and regulatory requirements governing oil and gas exploration that are designed to pr otect the wildlife hab itat and environment of the coastal plain asrc lands or both theref ore it appears that oil and gas production activities on asrc lands would be subject to the same environmental requirements as those governing oil and ga s production on federal landshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22143crs4 7 48 fed reg 7936 7980 february 24 1983 8 for

north slope infrastructure and the anwr debate by m lynne corn and see crs report rl31022 arctic petroleum technology developments by bernard gelb et alapplicability of the 2000acre limit to native lands the housepassed hr 6 did not address how the 2000acre limit might apply to oil and gas development on native lands in anwr but the leasing regulations to be issued by the secretary might however hr 6 applied to oil and gas activities in the coastal plain of anwr which was defined as the area identified on map now missing referenced in anilca and as described in appendix i to part 37 of title 50 code of fede ral regulations this cfr definition of the boundary of the coastal plain was published in 19837 and excludes from the defined coastal plain the three townships then held by kic the description was not changed to reflect the fourth kic township therefore arguably three kic townships are outside the defined coastal plain and one township is inside with asrc holdings underlying all of them if the applic ability of the 2000acre limitation to native lands were to be litigated court might possibly find that 1 the provision is not environmental protection re ferred to in the 1983 agreement and therefore does not apply to development of any asrc lands 2 asrc lands within the defined coastal plain ie the fourth township lands are s ubject to the 2000acre limit but the others are not or 3 all asrc lands in the refuge are bound by the restriction because of the wording of par b9 of appendix ii of the 1983 agreement the housepassed hr 6 did not address how the 2000 acres would be llocated among asrc and federal lessees if the acreage limit applies to asrc lands the senate developed new map of the coastal plain in connection with the senate budget reconciliation measure this map shows the native lands as being within the coastal plain but the bill does not clarify the intended applicability of leasing restrictions the limitation arguably would not apply to rface use of the three townships of kic lands and allotments not in the defined coas tal plain and possibly not to those lands wherever located that are not being used as support for asrc development therefore it is possible that the 2000acre limit would not apply to some or all of the nearly 100000 acres of native lands that under the 1983 agr eement could be opened to oil and gas development in anwr if the federal lands are furthermore the limitation might not apply to exploratory activities which asrc could conduct under the 1983 agreement wh ich arguably is favorable to asrc8 dispersion of footprints technological advances have significantly reduced the size of oil drilling fac ilities in recent decades however assuming there were commercial finds it is unlikely that full development of the coastal plain could be accomplished from single compact site and development could require dispersed network of drill pads roads pipelines grav mines and other structures even with advanced drilling techniques th ere are limits to the lateral reach of drilling from given wellhead the current record in north ern alaska is 378 miles from one wellhead9 the coastal plain is approximate ly 104 miles

structures might be located just outside of the refuges boundaries sma ller widely scattered fields would likely necessitate greater infrastructure than few larger fields failure to find economic discoveries could lead to re latively minor transient distur bance important scattered or numerous finds could produce impacts lasting decades or possibly century or more to what facilities does the acreage limitation apply there is little consensus in the anwr debate on what facilities and features might be considered to be part of developments footprint the h ousepassed hr 6 required the secretary to develop regulations stipulati ons and other implementation measures the wording does not appear to include features some scientists natives or environmentalists might wish areas under elevated pipelines or affected by blowing dust or visual impacts etc the potentially limited facilities can be divided into two categories 1 areas directly covered with gravel eg gravel roads drill pads airfields culverts bridges ports causeways pump stations water treatment facilities and 2 areas whose surface is removed or covered eg gravel mines pi peline supports water impoundments airstrips and pipeline supports were expr essly limited in 2007 bu t more debatable is the applicability of the limitation to other facilities gravel mines bridges water impoundments and causeways are examples doi s regulations that define the facilities to be limited would critically ffect not only industry bids but also ultimately the potential for constraints on development as the alpine model makes clear new fields can make relatively small surface disturbance10 but as fields expand with new di scoveries surface disturbance increases in the anwr context this means that an initial lease offeri ng of 200000 acres the minimum required in hr 6 may not be seri ously constrained by the wording of the 2000acre limit in 2207a3 but scattered num erous finds could reduce the remaining available acreage so as to constrain industrys pa rticipation in future lease sales in this light the secretarys obligation to develop plans for consolidation of facilities would become both critical and more difficult since the secretary would need to allow for potential future discoveries exploration in the anwr terrain exploration on the north slope has typically been accomplished with ice roads and ice pads but in the 1002 area exploration may be more difficult than in previously developed ar eas liquid fresh water is much more scarce and the terrain more rolling in the coasta l plain conditions that elsewhere have resulted in the use of gravel roads for safety reasons11 also the warming trend of the last few decades has cut the season for ice cons truction from over 200 days to about half

the mineral leasing act see 30 usc 226e and iits previous length12 in combination these factors might necessitate permanent exploration facilities eg road s pads and gravel mines in anwr and if the 2000 acre limit does not apply to explora tion facilities these facilities could be located throughout the coastal plain if exploration is successful facilities on specific leases might be converted to production facilities raising the issue of whether such converted facilities would be limited once they are used in production interaction of acreage limit and economics companys investment calculus would affect the amount the company would bid for lease or its willingness to bid at all very large prospect near ex isting development at the coast close to gravel sources and the limited yearround liquid fresh water would likely generate industry interest even under tight envir onmental restrictions large but widely scattered or less convenient prospects would present opportun ities which could be profitable under some regulatory scenarios but not others and small or otherwise ttractive prospects might not be of interest under any foreseeable c onditions lessee will judge whether and how quickly to proceed13 based on the size of the field quality of the oil expected prices regulatory costs and other considerations this decision may be affected by limits on the operation of the field such as the size of the drill pads access to fre sh water or limits on gravel roads forcing expensive seasonal limitations and air transport for work crews all else being equal if re strictions including acreage limitations became more costly fewer prospects mig ht be developed if the footprints of production and s upport and possibly expl oration facilities throughout the coastal plain were strictly limited to total of 2000 acres tradeoff could occur between this limit and the determination of fair market value for them unless the facilities subject to limits were defined very narrowly or discoveries prove limited responses to acreage limits the acreage limitation will be closely watched both from the perspective of its putative contribution to limiting adverse environmental affects and its possible constrai nt on development if devel opment legislation is enacted environmentalists will likely focus on strict interpretation of the limit and on dois mandate in 2207f to consolidate and minimiz the footprint development proponents will likely focus on its costs depending on how much oil is found how it is distributed and where the limit is applied the effect of the 2000acre limit could range from being irrelevant to significant fact or affecting any development in the latter case industrys response could be expected to include technological improve ments shift of facilities to uncontrolled areas changed bidding strategy an effort to obtain regulatory or legislative relief or combination of these options
