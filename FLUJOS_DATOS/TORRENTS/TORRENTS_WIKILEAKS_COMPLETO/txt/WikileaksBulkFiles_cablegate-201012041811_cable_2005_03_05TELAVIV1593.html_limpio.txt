ir is goi external subject cne401083 israeli intentions regarding the iranian nuclear program ref state 26053 classified by ambassador daniel c kurtzer reasons 14 b and d 1 s summary israel sees iran as the primary threat to its security and sees the enrichment cycle as the point of return for tehrans nuclear weapons program the goi believes that diplomatic pressure with teeth such as sanctions can affect iranian behavior and is lobbying the eu3 and iaea on details of permanent suspension agreement the israelis support unified international front but are concerned that the usg may move toward the eu position despite the gois focus on the diplomatic track public and private speculation about possible israeli air strikes continues in weighing the military options the goi is aware of significant differences from its successful strike against iraqs nuclear program in 1981 including an uncertain and dispersed target set the presence of coalition forces in iraq and the gulf iranian capabilities to retaliate through hizballah and terrorism and the changed strategic environment end summary the iranian threat point of return and timelines 2 s pm sharon calls iran the main threat to israel and has recently expressed concern that some states are getting used to the idea of iran obtaining nuclear weapons other senior israeli officials echo this cautioning that tehrans nuclear weapons program poses what mossad chief meir dagan calls an existential threat that alters the strategic balance in the region 3 c in meeting with congressional visitors in december defense minister shaul mofaz described operation of the enrichment cycle as the point of return for the iranian program view shared by many senior goi officials mossad chief dagan went step further saying that the iranian program will be unstoppable once it longer requires outside assistance to complete the enrichment process at the technical level the director for external affairs at the israel atomic energy commission iaec told poloff that the critical step would be irans operation of centrifuge enrichment cascade 4 s goi officials have given different timelines for when they believe iran will have full enrichment capability in february pm sharon told the secretary that he believes there is still time remaining to pressure iran but that the window of opportunity is closing quickly defmin mofaz cautioned that iran is less than one year away while the head of research in military intelligence estimated that iran would reach this point by early 2007 technical experts at the iaec predicted that iran would have enrichment capability within six months of the end of the suspension agreement few goi officials admitted informally that these estimates need to be taken with caution the head of the mfas strategic affairs division recalled that goi assessments from 1993 predicted that iran would possess an atomic bomb by 1998 at the latest focus on diplomacy and concern with the eu3 5 s in the near term israel is focused on maintaining diplomatic pressure on iran to cooperate with the iaea and eu3 sharon defines diplomatic pressure to include unsc sanctions eg on irans airlines and trade as noted below president katsav has said that tehran is very conscious of international opinion other mfa and nsc officials point to the current suspension and to iranian reaction to the mykonos case as proof that diplomatic pressure can affect decisionmaking in tehran 6 s the israelis often express disappointment with eu3 efforts but see real alternative at this time pm sharon told reporters on march 10 that iran uses the negotiations to play for time in private sharon his cabinet and military leaders have all complained that the europeans are too soft similarly president katsav has cautioned that iran will cheat on any commitments it makes mfa staff told poloff that they do not believe that the eu3 effort will be successful in obtaining permanent suspension or that the europeans will support effective sanctions against iran 7 c goi technical experts said they have been lobbying the europeans and iaea on several issues first the goi would like clearer and more detailed listing of all activities covered by the suspension along with timelines for each step second they want more robust verification measures and greater focus on irans denial of access to iaea inspectors third the israelis insist that any final agreement must be endorsed by the unsc to ensure that noncompliance will be dealt with at an appropriate level fourth israel is pushing the eu3 to define benchmarks that would signal failure of the process and to identify the concrete consequences of such failure 8 c according to the iaec the goi has urged the europeans to examine bilateral or eu sanctions with small but noticeable economic impacts after telling the press on march 10 that it would probably not be advisable to impose an oil embargo on iran pm sharon advocated trade and flight restrictions lowerlevel goi officials said these steps could include restrictions on iranians studying in europe limitations on travel by iranian scientific personnel and suspension of landing privileges for iranian airlines within the eu the goal according to the deputy nsa for foreign affairs is unified pressure from the eu russia and us for complete full verifiable cessation of the fuel cycle program in the short term this means full suspension of all enrichment reprocessing heavywaterreactor construction and related rd activities israeli preference for usg and unsc involvement 9 c in light of their uneasiness with eu3 efforts the israelis are hoping for robust us involvement and action by the unsc pm sharon has urged the eu3 to continue its efforts but also stressed the importance of preparing to take iran to the unsc in meeting with codel on december 12 defmin mofaz pushed for the us to take the lead with the europeans and pursue all diplomatic solutions including sanctions president katsav asked the secretary not to wait for the europeans 10 c this desire for us activity is amplified by the extremely limited options open to israel on the diplomatic front the iaecs director for nonproliferation admitted that the goi sees little we can do to increase pressure on iran as long as tehran abides by the suspension agreement the mfas office director for the gulf states said that israel would maintain its lowprofile diplomatic activities such as supplying iaea members with intelligence material related to the iranian program she said the mfa believes that any overt israeli pressure would backfire leading to surge of arab support for iran and focusing attention on israels own nuclear activities 11 c following the recent announcements on iran by the president and the secretary several israeli officials asked if the usg is shifting its policy on iran the deputy nsa for foreign affairs acknowledged that the us move is probably necessary to build international consensus for taking iran to the unsc at the same time he expressed concern that the usg would be influenced by what he called the eus habit of granting concessions to iran prior to full compliance midlevel staffers at the nsc and iaec were also disquieted by us press reports claiming that the usg is reexamining its position on hizballah the military option bushehr is not osirak 12 s despite frustrations with diplomatic efforts israeli officials are understandably reluctant to discuss possible military options in public pm sharon has stressed the importance of the political and economic track during recent discussion with visiting usg official idf deputy chief of staff and cosdesignate major general dani haloutz similarly said we dont want to go there in february president katsav told the secretary that the military option is not necessary bring the issue to the security council 13 s public speculation about possible military strikes usually focuses on the differences from the israeli air forces attack on iraqs osirak reactor in 1981 in private goi officials have acknowledged that several factors would make any attack against iran much more difficult mission senior military intelligence official told the embassy that the goi does not know where all of the targets are located and said that any attack would only delay not end the iranian program the mfas office director for the gulf states noted that potential target sites are well dispersed throughout the country with several located in builtup civilian areas the iaec stressed the importance of russian assistance in restraining irans nuclear ambitions and said that any attack on bushehr would likely result in russian casualties and endanger moscows cooperation 14 c mfa contacts said that the distance to the targets and the presence of us forces in iraq and the gulf raise additional complications an israeli assault would necessitate prior coordination with coalition forces in iraq they maintained leaving the usg open to retaliation throughout the islamic world especially in iraq mfa and nsc officials acknowledged that any attack would also elicit strong response from arab states and the palestinians effectively freezing the peace process 15 c the israelis realize that iran would use any military strike as an excuse to cease cooperation with the eu3 and the iaea in addition the goi is acutely aware of irans ability to retaliate both militarily and through attacks by its regional surrogates pm sharon has claimed that hizballah has 11000 rockets and possibly uavs capable of reaching israel from launching sites in lebanon the mfas office director for the gulf states said that she believed that iran would retaliate by inciting terrorist groups in israel and the occupied territories 16 c current usg eu3 and iaea focus on iran also creates situation that differs from 1981 when the israelis felt that the international community was ignoring the iraqi threat israelis hope that the others will solve the iranian problem for them or as vice pm shimon peres has said i do not think that the matter of iran needs to be turned into an israeli problem it is matter of concern for the whole world comment diplomatic solution preferred but 17 s comment the israelis are focusing on diplomatic channels in the iaea and eu3 and appear to have very real concerns about the feasibility of military strikes against the iranian nuclear program nevertheless the goi has shown time and again that it will act militarily if it believes that its security is threatened and the idf is most certainly keeping contingency plans up to date the israeli press reported that in february pm sharons security cabinet had given initial authorization for an attack on iran the press reports cited an unnamed israeli security source who claimed that the usg would authorize an israeli attack post notes that it may not be possible to detect preparations for any military strike air defense operations would pose nearly perfect cover for civil defense and air force activities preceding any attack due to both the extreme sensitivity of the issue and the gois near inability to prevent leaks any attack order would be closely held probably even from many members of pm sharons cabinet 18 c comment continued the goi knows that we share its interest in preventing iran from obtaining nuclear weapons nevertheless we should expect continued israeli lobbying at the highest levels urging the usg to ensure that the eu3 effort is on track and backed by solid international front we will also hear israeli concerns that the us position may move toward the eu stance at the same time we should recognize that israeli intelligence briefings will understandably focus on worstcase scenarios and may not match current usg assessments visit embassy tel avivs classified website httpwwwstatesgovgovpneatelaviv you can also access this site through the state departments classified siprnet website
