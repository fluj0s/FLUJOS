taplin reasons 14 b and d 1 u on april 5 embassy received by mail letter from theodora bertzi secretary of state for the government of romanias gor romanian office for adoptions roa dated march 29 and including the final report of the gor working group established in june 2005 to audit pending petitions by foreign families to adopt romanian orphans and abandoned children post has faxed the letter to eurnce and caocsci 2 u the report shows that none of the 1092 children identified in the pending petitions will be available for intercountry adoption ostensibly for the following reasons 41 reintegrated into biological family 12 integrated within extended family 227 adopted by romanian families 17 adopted by other foreign families by the rules of the adoption moratorium 200104 8 under legal guardianship in romania 12 reached or will soon reach age 18 47 petitioned after february 6 2004 emergency ordinance suspended even exceptional approval of intercountry adoptions during the moratorium 2 died 6 not found in gors database of orphans or abandoned children 90 had petitions withdrawn by the foreign families 1 from the us 132 in process of final domestic adoption 415 not adoptable protected within substitutive sic families 83 not adoptable placed in the protection system their biological family did not consent to adoption before court or the court did not approve the opening of the domestic adoption procedure 3 c comment the working group had been expected to issue its report by the end of march and bertzi had announced publicly in december 2005 that none of the cases would be approved for intercountry adoption however the utterly nontransparent process of the working group and the opaque quality of the report suggest some of the children may in fact remain in nonpermanent situations in which their welfare is not being adequately protected post believes we should continue to press the gor to open up the working groups conclusions for transparent objective international review and to establish legal framework that would allow intercountry adoption for appropriate pending cases we will provide department with our updated recommendations soon
