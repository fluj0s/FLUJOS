addition it is the first step in the risk management process it complements the criticality assessment and threat assessment and completes the picture of how unit or installation might be attacked there are two types of vulnerability assessments that unit must consider the first is an assessment of the particular area where the unit will be operating and the second is an assessment of the units own vulnerabilities previous vulnerability assessments should be reviewed to ensure that vulnerabilities identified earlier have been adequately addressed b assessments will consider the full range of identified and projected terrorism threats against specific location or installation personnel family members facilities and other assets as identified in the threat matrix vulnerability assessments should focus on those elements directly related to combating terrorism including the prevention of terrorist acts and if prevention fails limiting mass casualties assessments should identify vulnerabilities that may be exploited by threat groups and recommend options to eliminate or reduce those vulnerabilities c commanders shall conduct vulnerability assessments at least annually incoming commanders should acquire and familiarize themselves with the most recent vulnerability assessment available and conduct new vulnerability assessment upon assumption of command assessments

and local resources collect information on the threat and process that information to include local fusion and analysis and develop reasonably postulated threat statement of the activity further the assessment will examine the ability to disseminate threat information to subordinate commands tenant organizations intransit units assigned or visiting personnel and how that process supports the implementation of appropriate force protections measures the ability to disseminate threat information should include flash system to deliver high value information as rapidly as possible 3 atfp physical security measures shall be assessed to determine the units ability to protect personnel by detecting deterring delaying or defending against acts of terrorism physical security techniques include procedural measures such as perimeter security security force training security surveys medical surveillance for unnatural disease outbreaks and armed response to warning or detection and physical security measures such as fences lights intrusion detection access control closedcircuit television cameras personnel and vehicle barriers biological chemical and radiological agent detectors

appropriate force protection measures to reduce risk and vulnerability assessment of unit vulnerabilities shall be subject to continual evaluation once deployed dod requires component commanders to provide deploying units with on board andor advancesite assessments prior to and during visits to areas of significant or high threat levels or where geographically specific terrorism warning report is in effect this includes routes that may be used by transiting forces this requirement may be waived by the geographic combatant commander for deployments andor visits to controlled locations such as existing military installations or ships afloat deploying units must coordinate with the appropriate marine forces antiterrorism officer ato to ensure proper planning is accomplished oftentimes the marine forces ato will have capabilities and resources that can be made available to deploying forces b deploying commanders shall utilize atfp measures to reduce risk and vulnerability before during

should be incorporated in predeployment planning and training predeployment assessments should assist commanders in updating area of responsibility aorspecific training and in obtaining necessary physical security materials and equipment coordination with the applicable marine forces ato is required c commanders should research and identify atfp equipment or technology requirements through the chain of command the use of commercialoffthe shelf or governmentofftheshelf products should be stressed to meet near term requirements 5 msharpp vulnerability assessment methodology msharpp is an acronym that stands for mission symbolism history accessibility recognizability population and proximity the msharpp methodology may be useful tool in identifying lucrative targets for terrorists installations and units can use msharpp to identify and prioritize force protection concerns consideration is given to the local threat likely means of attack available to the enemy and variables affecting the disposition eg attractiveness to enemy potential psychological effect on community etc of potential targets after list of potential targets is developed msharpp selection factors are used to assist in further refining the assessment by associating weapontactic to potential target to determine the efficiency effectiveness and plausibility of the method of attack and to identify vulnerabilities related to the target after the msharpp values for each target or component are assigned the sum of the values indicate the highest enclosure 2 for official use only 5mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 value target for particular mode of attack within the limits of the enemys known capabilities mission 1 mission focuses mainly on the threat to the situations activities capabilities and resources on an installation that are vulnerable to terrorist attack the mission components consist of the equipment information facilities andor operations or activities that are necessary to accomplish the installations mission when assessing points in this area determine whether or not an attack on mission components will cause degradation by assessing the components importance the value of the area or assets located in the area considering their function inherent nature and monetary value b effect the ramifications of terrorist incident in the area considering the psychological economic sociological and military impacts c recoverability the time required for the function occurring at that area to be restored considering the availability of resources parts expertise and manpower and redundancies 2 assess points to the target equipment information facilities andor operations or activities scale of 15 5 being worst in this area based upon the degree of mission degradation if attacked by terrorist 3 mission criteria scale installation cannot continue to carry out its mission until the attacked asset is restored b ability to carry out primary mission of the installation would be significantly impaired if this asset were successfully attacked c half of the mission capability remains if the asset were successfully attacked d the installation could continue to carry out its mission if this asset were attacked albeit with some degradation in effectiveness destroying or disrupting this asset would have effect on the ability of the installation to accomplish its mission b symbolism 1 consider whether the target represents or is perceived by the enemy to represent symbol of targeted group eg symbolic of us military christianity government authority etc assess points in this area based upon the symbolic value of the target to the enemy 2 symbolism criteria scale high profile direct symbol of target group or ideology asset is perceived to be vital to the mission of the installation enclosure 2 for official use only 6for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 b low profile direct symbol of target group or ideology c low profile andor obscure symbol of target group or ideology c history 1 do terrorist groups have history of attacking this type of target while you must consider terrorist trends worldwide focus on local targeting history and capabilities 2 history criteria scale strong history of attacking this type of target b history of attacking this type of target but none in the immediate past c little to history of attacking this type of target d accessibility 1 target is accessible when an operational element can reach the target with sufficient personnel and equipment to accomplish its mission target can be accessible even if it requires the assistance of knowledgeable insiders this assessment entails identifying and studying critical paths that the operational element must take to achieve its objectives and measuring those things that aid or impede access the enemy must not only be able to reach the target but must also remain there for an extended period the four basic stages to consider when assessing accessibility are infiltration from the staging base to the target area b movement from the point of entry to the target or objective c movement to the targets critical element d exfiltration 2 accessibility criteria scale easily accessible or standoff weapons can be employed b inside perimeter fence climbing or lowering required c not accessible or inaccessible without extreme difficulty recognizability 1 targets recognizability is the degree to which it can be recognized by an operational element andor intelligence collection and reconnaissance asset under varying conditions weather has an obvious and significant impact on visibility for both friendly and enemy forces rain snow and ground fog may obscure observation road segments with sparse enclosure 2 for official use only 7mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 vegetation and adjacent high ground provides excellent conditions for good observation distance light and season must be considered 2 other factors that influence recognizability include the size and complexity of the target the existence of distinctive target signatures the presence of masking or camouflage and the technical sophistication and training of the enemy 3 recognizability criteria scale target is clearly recognizable under all conditions and from distance requires little or training for recognition b target is easily recognizable at smallarms range and requires small amount of training for recognition c target is difficult to recognize at night or in bad weather or might be confused with other targets requires training for recognition d target cannot be recognized under any conditionsexcept by experts f population 1 population addresses two factors quantity of personnel and their demography 2 demography asks the question who are the targets depending on the ideology of the terrorist groups being member of particular demographic group can make someone or some group more likely target therefore when assessing points in this area determine whether or not the groups have history of or are predicted to target military personnel b family members us citizens in general c civilian employees of the us government include local nationals d senior officers or other highrisk personnel members of an ethnicity racial religious or regionally defined 3 quantity addresses the number of people that would become victims if particular target were attacked going on the assumption the intent of the attack is to kill or injure personnel it follows that the more densely populated an areafacility is the more lucrative target it makes all other things being equal 4 population criteria scale densely populated prone to frequent crowds facility routinely contains substantial numbers of personnel known to be targeted by enclosure 2 for official use only 8for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 the enemy andor the population is comprised of personnel deemed vital to the accomplishment of the installations mission b relatively large numbers of people but not in close proximity ie spread out and hard to reach in single attack contains known target group but rarely in large concentrations population has special segment necessary for mission accomplishment c sparsely populated prone to having small groups or individuals little target value based on demographics of occupants g proximity 1 is the potential target located near other personnel facilities or resources that because of their intrinsic value or protected status and fear of collateral damage afford it some form of protection eg near national monuments protectedreligious symbols etc which the enemy holds in high regard note it is important to consider whether the target is in close proximity to other likely targets just as the risk of unwanted collateral damage may decrease the chances of attack targetrich environment may increase the chances of attack 2 proximity criteria scale target is isolated chance of unwanted collateral damage to protected symbols or personnel b target is in close enough proximity to place protected personnel facilities etc at risk of injury or damage but not destruction c target is in close proximity serious injury damage or deathtotal destruction of protected personnelfacilities likely h table 21 of this enclosure is an example of an msharpp worksheet values from 1 to 5 are assigned to each factor based on the associated data for each target five represents the highest vulnerability or likelihood of attack and 1 the lowest accordingly the higher the total score the more vulnerable

process the terrorist threat assessment is process that is used to conduct threat analysis and develop an evaluation of the potential terrorist threat b commanders will prepare terrorist threat assessment at least annually and for every overseas exercisedeployment that will identify the full spectrum of known or estimated terrorist capabilities including weapons and tactics the threat assessment will integrate threat information prepared by the intelligence community technical information from security and engineering planners and information from other sources this information shall be incorporated into the units antiterrorismforce protection awareness program 2 threat assessment the goal of this step is to develop an understanding of the terrorist threat to the assets identified in the criticality assessment this information will be used to estimate the susceptibility of those assets to an attack during the vulnerability assessment understanding threats requires an understanding of the terrorists intentions and motives as well as their capability to attack critical assets therefore the assessment should clearly distinguish between threat assessment capability estimate that supports antiterrorism at planning and threat warning indications and warnings because access to this type of information is often limited this is generally the weakest link in the overall risk assessment process the process outlined below provides useful framework for data collection and analysis 3 threats threats can be defined as an indication circumstance or event with the potential to cause loss of or damage to an asset it can also be defined as the intention and capability of an adversary to undertake actions that would be detrimental to critical assets threat must be defined in terms that are meaningful to the planner ie the plausible weapons and associated tactics that are used by the terrorist organization and weapons and tactics that are within the terrorist organizations capability even if those weapons and tactics are not currently being used from this information the threat working group can determine the tactics the aggressors will likely employ and the threat severity levels associated with those tactics the threat severity levels describe the specific tools weapons and explosives associated with each tactic this information will be used to determine the vulnerability of an asset to particular weapon or tactic and allow planners to produce effective countermeasures response plans and consequence management measures 4 threatbased assessment department of defense dod instruction 200016 notal of 14 jun 2001 dod antiterrorism standards requires that at programs be threatbased that threat assessments of feasible terrorist capabilities be the basis for assessing vulnerabilities planning at physical security measures and justifying at enhancements and budget proposals enclosure 3 for official use only 1 for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 installations and expeditionary sites must develop threat assessment that identifies range of feasible terrorist capabilities that at program managers can use as planning tool this will allow vulnerabilities to be assessed in the context of specific threats routine physical security and antiterrorismforce protection measures can be tailored to counter specific threats or mitigate specific vulnerabilities and will allow audit trails for acquisitions b baseline threat used for assessing vulnerabilities and planning countermeasures facilitates the allocation of resources especially when the need to plan for multiple installations arises it also supports decisionmaking when specific warning reports are received if warning is provided regarding specific threat the commander immediately knows whether the planned countermeasures adequately defend the installation against that threat or if it will be necessary to regroup and plan additional measures because the imminent threat is outside the range of baseline threat used in the planning process c the threat matrix located at appendix to enclosure 2 identifies range of minimum terrorist threat capabilities and will be used as the baseline for planning purposes should the installations threat analysis identify additional or greater threats they will be added to the matrix 5 frequency of threatrelated incidents high frequency of threat related incidents can indicate an increased likelihood that similar incident may take place in the future especially if capability and intent are high the absence of previous incidents has little significance in predicting future incidents and should have bearing on the development of threat assessment that identifies range of feasible terrorist capabilities 6 threat data the collection and analysis of threat information is critical to the risk assessment process in order to make valid assessment of threats it is essential to understand as much as possible about each specific adversary information resources can be divided into two types those that provide unclassified or opensource information and those that provide classified information generally both are used in the development of threat data the naval criminal investigative service ncis is the department of the navy don component with primary responsibility for law enforcement counterintelligence counter intelligence operations and security policy matters ncis maintains worldwide structure to ensure operational readiness of marine corps commands by preventing terrorist attacks against don forces protecting against compromise of don sensitive infosystems and reducing crime against the don to fulfill this responsibility ncis has established the multiple threat alert center mtac which serves as the fusion point and production center within the don for all terrorist criminal cyber and counterintelligence information indicative of threat to don assets throughout the world the mtac processes real time information and operates on 24hour basis to provide commanders with timely and enclosure 3 for official use only 2for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 enclosure 3 for official use only 3 common operational picture of security threats and vulnerabilities to reduce risks to marine corps forces and assets the mtac provides the following support to marine corps commands 1 mtac special analysis reports sars sars are daily reports that cover topics such as threat advisories threat supplements counterterrorism counterintelligence criminal and cyber that are aimed at specific geographical areas and are published as soon as information is received they provide current operational intelligence on terrorist and related unconventional warfare threats to don personnel and assets 2 mtac summary report the mtac summary report is daily summary of all the sars that have been produced 3 mtac force protection summary the force protection summary is published weekly on sunday and lists countries designated by dod as moderate to high terrorist threat levels additionally when changes to country threat levels occur they are published in the summary 4 mtac spot report this report is sent to affected commands b it provides threat specific information on impending or likely terrorist activity 5 mtac blue dart report this report is sent to affected commands b it provides indications and warnings of imminent terrorist activity and advises of activities conditions or events that could lead to nearterm terrorist operations directed against don personnel or assets b there are many sources of unclassified information such as mass media us government publications and internet websites websites of interest include computer emergency response team cert national security institute nsi center for security policy extranet for security professionals esp and the opsec professionals society additional security websites and helplines are located in enclosure 12 c geographic combatant commander will be able to provide information relative to the threat in their specific area of responsibility 7 threat assessment the goal of this step in the risk management process is to make factually based estimate combining information from classified and unclassified intelligence sources with locally developed information on the existing threat for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 criticality assessment 1 general criticality assessment is the third step in the risk management process not all assets and activities warrant the same level of protection therefore it is necessary to identify the assets that need to be safeguarded and assess their relative value generally assets are valued relative to the impact of their potential loss if an adversary places high value on an asset the likelihood of that asset becoming target increases 2 criticality assessment during this step survey of assets and determination of the value of the assets is completed the criticality assessment should identify the installation or deployed units key assets including personnel information equipmentmaterials facilities activitiesoperations and critical infrastructures it should be emphasized that high population locations are lucrative terrorist targets regardless of their importance to mission accomplishment high population areas consist of places where people eat sleep gather and places where command functions occur the criticality assessment begins with survey to compile information about valued assets this information is available from variety of sources including site personnel hostnation combatant commanders representatives officersincharge managers operations personnel security personnel logistics personnel other facility staff construction personnel contractors and maintenance staff review of existing security plans and security surveyaudits rosters of classified documents and personnel located at particular site and open source information because of joint usage the criticality assessment should be coordinated with adjacent unitsservicescommunities b the data collected in the survey is analyzed to determine the most valued assets and to determine the relative degree of impact if an asset were to be compromised in some way it is important to recognize that the value of people information and activities is difficult to quantify in terms of dollars therefore criticality assessment determines whether or not an attack on component will cause degradation in mission capability by assessing the assets 1 importance the value of the area or assets located in the area considering their function inherent nature and monetary value 2 effect the ramifications of terrorist incident in the area considering the psychological economic sociological and military impacts 3 recoverability the time required for the function occurring at that area to be restored considering the availability of resources parts expertise and manpower and redundancies 3 mission essential vulnerable areas mevas the product of this phase of the risk management process will be the identification of assets that could be expected to become potential terrorist targets the impact of terrorist attack on those assets and the consequences of the loss or partial loss of those assets this information is then used to develop prioritized list of mevas and other lucrative terrorist targets mevas are defined in enclosure enclosure 4 for official use only 1for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 enclosure 4 for official use only 21 as being areas designated by the commander as containing assets essential to the accomplishment of the installationunit mission in addition to mevas other assets that should be considered potential targets because of their value to the commander in terms of potential loss of life psychological economic or sociological impacts will be identified for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 risk assessment 1 general the risk assessment is the final step in the risk management process the risk assessment provides antiterrorism at planners with the ability to improve the installations baseline security posture and efficiently and effectively deploy resources during higher force protection conditions fpcons it also provides information that is useful to the commander in making resource allocation decisions designed to protect personnel and assets from possible terrorist threats in resourceconstrained environment the risk assessment is developed on the foundation of the threat assessment criticality assessment and vulnerability assessment described in enclosures 2 3 and 4 respectively the result will identify an at strategy that will encompass physical security fpcons terrorist incident response measures consequence management measures personal security operational security opsec and at awareness which will produce comprehensive at program additionally the risk assessment will help the at officer ato identify countermeasures necessary to mitigate vulnerabilities their costs and tradeoffs and will become the basis by which protective measures are planned and their implementation prioritized b the process described above is an iterative versus sequential process that is each step may yield new information that affects the information developed earlier data gathered during each step of this process shall be documented and maintained for further analysis and use as backup data for proposed recommendations and alternatives c the risk assessment will become the basis and justification for recommendations by the commander on antiterrorismforce protection atfp enhancements programbudget requests application of random antiterrorism measures ram and the establishment of fpcons information developed from the risk assessment includes what assets are vulnerable what are the actual or estimated threats how important the assets are and what are the estimated costs of eliminating or mitigating the threats 2 risk assessment methodology risk assessments shall consider the factors of threat asset criticality and vulnerability of facilities programs and systems as well as deterrenceresponse capabilities risk assessments shall analyze the following four elements the terrorist threat b the criticality of the assets c the vulnerability of facilities programs and systems to terrorist threats and d the ability to conduct activities to deter terrorist incidents employ countermeasures mitigate the effects of terrorist incident and recover from terrorist incident the risk assessment allows the commander to obtain clear picture of the current atfp posture and identify those areas that need improvement during the risk assessment important information is also collected that can be used enclosure 5 for official use only 1for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 when writing the atfp plan 3 assessing risk and determining priorities for asset protection the elements of the criticality assessment threat assessment vulnerability assessment should be reviewed additional information obtained and revisions made to the assessments as necessary b the elements of threat and vulnerability should be considered together and an estimate of the probability or likelihood of an occurrence estimated then the probability of occurrence and the impact derived from the criticality assessment are considered together and judgment of the level of risk is made in this manner both the likelihood and magnitude of the event are considered c where the vulnerabilities are great and the threat is evident the risk of exploitation is greater therefore higher priority for protection must be considered where the vulnerability is slight andor the adversary has little capability to exploit vulnerabilities the risk is lower and the priority for new countermeasures is lower d the areas of greatest risk that are identified by the risk assessment will serve as the basis for deciding where to focus countermeasures and what countermeasures to apply once the likelihood and magnitude of an event is estimated judgment must be made as to the acceptable level of risk for particular asset the acceptable level of risk may vary with the factors of time circumstances and the commanders attitude toward risk 4 identification of countermeasures costs and options based on the information obtained and analyzed in the risk assessment potential countermeasures to reduce vulnerabilities can be identified and considered countermeasures generally fit into one of the following five categories intelligence procedures equipment physical and manpower 1 procedures opsec training awareness programs legal prosecution polygraph security investigations disclosure statements personnel transfer contingency planning two person rules passwords and periodic searches 2 equipment locks window bars doors fences alarms hardwaresoftware badges lighting paper shredder weapons cctv safe haven vaults 3 physical new construction barriers retrofitting purchase of additional land earthwork 4 manpower contractor guards local police additional military security forces 5 intelligence counterintelligence countersurveillance host nationlocal law enforcement information criminal data enclosure 5 for official use only 2for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 b each proposed countermeasure should mitigate risk by deterring detecting delaying defending andor defeating the threat and be evaluated in terms of the level of risk reduction obtained in order to identify the most effective countermeasures they must be evaluated based on the effect that each will have on the existing risk level this will be accomplished by evaluating the impact of the countermeasure on the vulnerabilities identified in the vulnerability assessment and considering if the countermeasure will have an affect on the threat or criticality of the asset during the analysis it may become apparent that certain countermeasures will reduce risk for several vulnerabilities thereby increasing the value of that particular countermeasure c commanders should ensure that appropriate procedures processes training and manpower assets that are most readily available and normally offer the most immediate and least expensive remedy available to the commander have been utilized to the fullest extent possible d every countermeasure has cost associated with it that can be measured in terms of dollars effect on mission inconvenience time and personnel in order to select the most appropriate countermeasure the cost associated with each must be determined 1 dollar cost of countermeasures including purchase price and life cycle maintenance costs including installation preventative maintenance repair warranty replacement and disposal costs should be considered the life expectancy of the countermeasure should be considered as well as the salaries of staff and contractors to implement maintain monitor and train others 2 effect on mission costs includes reduced manpower available for mission requirements increased time required for deployment etc while mission costs are hard to estimate they must be considered poor selection of countermeasure can have devastating effect on mission capability 3 inconvenience may result in additional costs if personnel bypass the countermeasure countermeasures that are least inconvenient should be employed whenever possible 4 in terms of time the time required to implement oversee and prepare for implementation as well as time require for followup and evaluate should be considered 5 personnel costs include the number of staff needed to use the countermeasure as well as the skills knowledge and abilities of the personnel involved and staff training needs 6 generally the least expensive countermeasure that will reduce risk to an acceptable level will be selected however in given instance highcost countermeasure may protect against more than single vulnerability and may prove to be the least costly countermeasure to employ 5 costbenefit analysis based on the results of the risk assessment it must be determined enclosure 5 for official use only 3for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 which of the countermeasures options mitigate risk to an acceptable level at reasonable cost factors that influence countermeasure decisions include 1 value of the asset what is the impact if the asset is lost or damaged 2 current exposure to harmloss how vulnerable is the asset 3 availability of protective measures what is the stateofthe art and effectiveness 4 availability of funds what resources are available compared to asset value 5 mandatory security requirements what is mandated by regulation b for particular vulnerability variety of countermeasures may be available each of the various countermeasures will reduce risk to varying degree and have differing associated costs the events to be protected against countermeasures risk reduction and costs should be laid out in decision matrix and recommendations made to the commander the ultimate goal of this process is to provide the least costmaximum benefit options to the commander c once the appropriate countermeasures have been selected and are in place they must be tested and evaluated to ensure they are as effective as anticipated in the risk assessment monitoring system should be established to detect any changes in criticality of assets threats andor vulnerabilities that might change the risk assessment 6 integration of the risk analysis process the risk analysis process encompasses the vulnerability assessment threat assessment criticality assessment and risk assessment using the information generated and analyzed during the risk analysis process the commander establishes site specific measures to mitigate the baseline threat for example assume the risk analysis process has identified several buildings as having vulnerabilities to the baseline threat following the implementation of the plan the commander determines the local threat has increased new terrorist group has been identified that is believed to posses the capability to deploy 50 lb placed bomb the commander selects fpcon bravo based on his estimate of the situation fpcon bravo measure 14 calls for the standoff of cars and objects from buildings the sitespecific measures against the baseline threat may call for parking and trash containers to be relocated after period of time assume that new information becomes available that shows that this terrorist group has the capability to deploy 220 lb car bomb based on the sitespecific measures designed for the baseline threat the commander may use jersey barrier wall assembly to prevent vehicles from violating the 25 meter exclusionary area for parking for the known threat note that in the example given the fpcon did not increase because the capability rather than the intentions of the terrorist group had changed if intelligence is received indicating some form of terrorist action or targeting against personnel or facilities is likely then the commander may increase the fpcon to charlie andor include additional ram to increase his level of comfort with the threat if the enclosure 5 for official use only 4for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 enclosure 5 for official use only 5commander chooses to go to fpcon charlie the sitespecific measure for the same weapon and tactic may call for the search of all vehicles parked in the vicinity of the vulnerable buildings or an increase in standoff distance b from the above discussion it can be seen how the risk analysis process works the vulnerability of assets is identified during the vulnerability assessment then the threat assessment is conducted and at minimum the baseline threat contained in the threat matrix is analyzed measures are created to enhance protection from the terrorist weapons and tactics identified in the baseline or actual threat if higher for each fpcon level ram which may come from higher fpcons or be developed independently are also created as the threat changes the sitespecific measures change the criticality assessment helps the commander identify and prioritize mission essential vulnerable areas whose protection is critical to mission accomplishment this could include nonmilitary assets and critical infrastructures such as the base child development center or water purification treatment plant if deemed critical to mission accomplishment the risk assessment assists the commander in balancing the mitigation of the threat with the assets available in part it helps the commander decide what to protect when to protect it and what level of protection to provide thus the information generated in the risk assessment process is used to develop sitespecific measures using the baseline threat contained in the threat matrix see appendix to enclosure 2 for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 terrorism threat levels 1 terrorism threat levels the department of

sufficient information to make prudent security determinations such assessments must not be considered stand alone documents the terrorism threat level is the intelligence communitys assessment of the likelihood of terrorist attack fpcons are the means the commander uses to apply operational decisions on how to guard against the threat the commander must ensure terrorist threat assessments are kept uptodate the local naval criminal investigative service resident agent can provide current atfp information necessary to continually assess the terrorist threat the commander must select an appropriate fpcon level by weighing current intelligence data and estimated terrorist threat against the loss of mission effectiveness that may occur if higher fpcon is selected subordinate commanders

measures commanders at all levels shall develop sitespecific measures that supplement those measuresactions contained in the fpcons listed in this enclosure and dod handbook 200012h notal of 19 feb 93 the fpcon measures identified in this enclosure are the minimum measures that will be implemented by an installation when an fpcon is prescribed therefore the installation atfp plan must describe the specific action that will be taken to implement each required measure an effective means to perform this function is the development of synchronization matrices for each measure for fpcon normal through delta additional measures addressing weapons of mass destruction wmd may also be included to make the matrix efficient each measure must answer the questions of who what where when and how each measure is going to be implemented in addition to the general increased protection afforded by implementing these measures measures should be developed to at minimum allow an installation to specifically detect deter defend and defeat those weapons and tactics identified in the threat matrix the implementation guidance provided by these measures will also serve as the basis for determining required resources to implement the plan and the cornerstone of the table topping and exercise programs two examples of fpcon synchronization matrices are shown in tables 71 and 72 of this

terrorism consequence management 1 general the dividing line between incident response and consequence management is not always distinct and the two functions may at times seem to overlap and become indistinguishable terrorism incident response measures can be thought of as immediate actions normally taken by first responders policefirerescue or task organized incident response teams that are based on established procedures to defeat an attack minimize loss of life and protect public health during incident response it may not be clear that the incident was the result of terrorist act or some other event such as an accident or criminal activity terrorism consequence management measures are longer term and wider in scope consequence management seeks to alleviate damage minimize loss of life hardship or suffering protect public health and safety and restore essential emergency services from military perspective consequence management includes the restoration of combat effectiveness 2 terrorism incident response the purpose of terrorism incident response measures is to establish procedures to be implemented when terrorist incident occurs at or near the installationunits location terrorism incident response is an integral element of antiterrorismforce protection planning and is designed to deter disrupt or mitigate potential terrorist attacks response measures should be established for each weapon and tactic that could feasibly be employed against the installationunit or its personnel as identified in the threat assessment while these response measures may be very similar to response measures used for criminal activity they must have the additional level of fidelity needed to cope with the additional demands of terrorist incident b terrorism incident response measures shall be designed to facilitate the flow of information within and between all levels of the response infrastructure and promote interaction and coordination among all responding organizationsunits c in general terrorism incident response measures will provide guidance for 1 reporting the incident 2 determining the nature and scope of the incident response required 3 using the

the ability to perform antiterrorism functions 12 incident debriefings and afteraction reports d terrorism incident response varies depending on the nature and location of the incident there are generally three distinct phases through which an incident may evolve although many incidents will not develop beyond the first phase events of undetermined origin may ultimately be found to have been the result of terrorist attack therefore care must be taken to treat the location of the incident as crime scene in order to preserve evidence this process will aid followon criminal investigation by the federal bureau of investigation fbi or hostnation hn authorities 1 phase i is the commitment of locally available resources including onduty watch sections available military lay enforcement security force patrols explosive ordnance disposal personnel and available backup units 2 phase ii begins when the emergency operations center is activated it includes the augmentation of the initial response force by additional law enforcement and security personnel andor special reaction team during this phase either the fbi or hn may assume jurisdiction over the incident if this occurs marine corps forces will assume supporting role and provide assistance as necessary 3 phase iii is the commitment of the specialized fbi department of defense dod or hn counterterrorist forces during this phase steps will be taken to terminate the incident through negotiation assault or other actions the table below provides matrix depicting customary implementation of authority and jurisdiction in terrorism incident responses it is useful for the commander in determining who has authority during particular phase of incident response f commanders shall ensure terrorism incident response measures

assessment emergency consultation specialized technical assistance and additional assets as needed from available entities to include federal and private sector terrorism consequence management plans should address these components d the type of incident encountered drives health response requirements chemical incident results in immediate effects at known site onscene determination of the causative agent and timely response the effects of biological weapon may not be apparent for days and would include response issues such as mass prophylaxis mass patient care and mass fatality management conventional explosives may potentially involve significant damage to key infrastructure which will further exacerbate the damage caused by the attack and would require response forces to be able to support themselves for period of time effective response planning should be directed toward enabling local systems to quickly and safely identify and treat victims in mass casualty environment protect those who are at risk ensure that adequate augmentation to these efforts is available and recovery operations can commence as soon as possible f consequence management planning

atfpp02 pl an summary 1 purpose commentary the antiterrorismforce protection plan will define the nature and scope of emergency response planning it will set forth emergency operations procedures and provide guidance for emergency preparedness disaster relief and antiterrorism operations 2 background commentary military installations are vulnerable to natural and manmade disasters such as flash flooding hurricanes thunderstorms hazardous material incidents resource shortages terrorist activities general civil disturbances or other disasters recent world events have demonstrated willingness of terrorists to use weapons of mass destruction which have the potential to produce catastrophic loss of life and property destruction it is therefore prudent that commanders maintain effective plans and preparations for dealing with these potential manmade or natural incidents this plan will outline the organization assignments and procedures to be executed in the event of significant crisis 3 summary commentary the primary mission of the command in any emergency is to protect the lives of personnel and minimize damage or loss to military and personnel property the plan will be developed to provide sound basis for emergency preparedness programs and training activities furthermore the plan will establish the organizational and operational concepts and procedures necessary to minimize loss of life and property damage and expedite recovery operations b commentary in the preparation of the plan emergency responsibilities will be assigned when possible to activities having the same or similar responsibilities during normal operations for many this plan represents logical expansion of existing functional responsibilities for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 copy ____ of ____

marines sailors civilian employees and their families from natural or manmade incidents in the event of natural disaster or manmade incident exercise incident response and consequence management measures as described in this plan to minimize disruption and restore operational capabilities as soon as possible the actions undertaken will be governed by moumoa established between the hn and the installation and appropriate coordination between the installation and 1st bn regiment marines as described in this plan 3 u execution u atfp plan development commentary this section should describe atfp plan development the development of the plan is an iterative versus sequential process that is each step may yield new information that affects the information developed earlier data gathered during each step should be documented and maintained for further analysis and presentation as backup data for proposed recommendations and alternatives the process of begins with the antiterrorism officer ato working with an atfp working group that has been appointed by the commander to assist in plan development the plan should describe the composition charter and responsibilities of the atfp working group 1 u vulnerability assessment commentary an installationunit vulnerability assessment is the foundation upon which the atfp plan is built it complements the criticality assessment and threat assessment and completes the picture of how unit or installation might be attacked the ato with the atfp working group will conduct vulnerability assessment at least annually as required by mco 33021d that considers the full range of terrorist weapons and capabilities the result of the vulnerability assessment will be prioritized listing of specific target vulnerabilities 2 u terrorist threat assessment commentary the second step in plan development is the terrorist threat assessment commanders will prepare terrorist threat assessment at least annually that will identify the full spectrum of known or estimated terrorist capabilities including weapons and tactics the threat assessment will integrate threat information prepared by the intelligence community technical information from security and enclosure 10 for official use only 3for official use only mco 33021d 18 jul 2002 engineering planners and information from other sources appendix 1 of enclosure 2 to mco 33021d

criticality assessment the conduct of the criticality assessment will result in list of mission essential vulnerable areas mevaslocated in tab to appendix 3 to annex c of this sample order and other assets that should be considered potential targets because of their value to the commander in terms of potential loss of life psychological economic or sociological impacts 4 u risk assessment commentary the fourth step in atfp plan development is the risk assessment the risk assessment allows the commander to plan for the most effective use of the resources available and to develop requirements for additional funding requests 5 u commentary once the above steps have been completed the commander can develop force protection condition fpcon integrated action sets located in enclosure 1 to tab d to appendix 3 to annex c that provide specific actions for each measure of each fpcon for each anticipated terrorist threat capability if future terrorist threat assessments provide information of terrorist capabilities exceeding the baseline threat the commander will need to reevaluate the integrated action sets 6 u commentary with the information developed thus far combined with information from other available resources the commander should be able to compile additional information to support additional portions of the atfp plan b u concept of operations commentary the installations atfp concept of operations should be phased in relation to preincident incident and postincident actions atfp planning and execution requires that staff elements work with much greater degree of cohesiveness and unity of mission than that required during the conduct of normal base sustainment operations 1 u preincident phase commentary this phase integrates and includes all preincident response and consequence management planning equipment acquisition training education construction considerations and special and routine actions taken before an attack or incident occurs 2 u incident response and consequence management phase commentary this phase includes all actions to be taken once an incident occurs depending on the severity of the incident these actions may include but are not limited to activation of the emergency operations center eoc and the crisis management team cmt deployment of first responders and crisis management force cmf activation of moumoas as necessary it also includes actions taken to manage the incident and actions directed towards return to normal operations actions taken during the incident phase are critically reviewed and

antiterrorism to annex c operations to atfpp02 u 1 u random antiterrorism measures ram commentary ram are used to enhance local fpcon measures the implementation of ram serve three purposes u ram can be used as tool to determine the productivity costs for individual antiterrorism measures ram program can help identify which measures that they are capable of being sustained and those measures that may be more stressful on personnel and material resources b u ram provide security forces with training and stimulation making the job of providing security more challenging interesting and exciting ram programs increase security because the security forces are more attentive to their regular assignments c u ram change the security atmosphere such programs when implemented in truly random fashion alter the external appearance or security signature to wouldbe terrorists and their supporters who may be providing surveillance assistance ram confuse the terrorists assessment of security posture ram causes terrorists wonder do they know we are here and have we been compromised terrorists must also consider the impact that the base security practices may have on their ability to achieve their operational goals the impact of ram programs on terrorists is difficult to measure but such programs are clearly capable of introducing uncertainty for planners and organizers of terrorist attacks 2 u commentary ram are procedures that are normally executed at specific fpcon levels the establishment of ram consists of using selected security measures from higher fpcons as well as other measures not associated with fpcons to supplement the basic fpcon measures already in place 3 u commentary at any given fpcon level implementing certain measures from higher fpcons conveys an impression of
