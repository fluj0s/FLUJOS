oconnors seat as associate justice of the us supreme court has been judge on the us court of appeals for the third circuit since 1990 this report examines his major judicial opinions both for the majority and in dissent in freedom of speech cases1 it also briefly discusses some cases in which he joined the opinion for the court but did not write it freedom of speech cases involve interpretations of the part of the first amendment that provides congress shall make law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press the supreme court has interpreted this restriction to apply not only to congress but to every level of government federal state and local and to all three branches of government executive legislative and judicial the supreme court has also found that law should not be taken literally and it is clear that the government may prohibit speech that consists of among other things threatening to kill someone conspiring to commit crime offering bribe engaging in perjury treason or false advertising or to cite oliver wendell holmes famous example falsely shouting fire in theater freedom of speech cases thus involve deciding just what exceptions apply to the mandate that there shall be law abridging the freedom of speech2 this report examines judge alitos free speech opinions by subject area prisoners free speech rights in banks v beard the third circuit with judge alito dissenting struck down prison policy that prohibited inmates who had been segregated from the general prison population for being disruptive from having access to photographs and all newspapers and magazines which are neither legal nor religious in nature3 the supreme court has agreed to review the case the majority opinion relied on the supreme courts decision in turner v safley 1 courts of appeals decisions are made by threejudge panels except when they are decided banc by the entire court which in the third circuit consists of 12 judges two of the decisions discussed in this report were banc banks v beard and ch ex rel zh v oliva 2 for additional information see crs report 95815 freedom of speech and press exceptions to the first amendment by henry cohen 3 399 f3d 134 148 3d cir 2005 cert granted 041739 nov 14 2005 crs2 that prison regulation that impinges on inmates constitutional rights is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests4 the third circuit wrote the supreme court articulated an analytical framework within which the reasonableness of such regulation is assessed by weighing four factors first there must be valid rational connection between the prison regulation and the legitimate governmental interest put forward to justify it second the court must determine whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to prison inmates third the court must assess the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional right will have on guards and other inmates and prison resources generally finally the court must consider whether there are ready alternatives to the regulation that fully accommodate the prisoners rights at minimus sic cost to valid penological interests the existence of such alternatives is evidence that the regulation is an exaggerated response to prison concerns5 the third circuit applied these four factors and found as to the first factor that prison officials had offered evidence that the speech restriction had rational connection to the legitimate governmental interests in rehabilitation of prisoners or security as to the second factor that inmates had alternative means to exercise their first amendment right of access to reasonable amount of newspapers magazines and photographs6 and as to the third and fourth factors that alternative policies that were less restrictive of first amendment rights would have only minimal impact on prison resources these alternative policies were to establish specific reading periods in which guards deliver single newspaper or magazine to an inmates cell and retrieve it at the end of the period or to escort prisoners to the secure minilaw library to read periodical of their choosing7 judge alito dissented disagreeing with the majoritys application of all four turner v safley factors as to the first factor he argued that it was rational for prison officials to think that their first amendment restriction would deter inmates who were not in segregated confinement from engaging in misconduct that could send them there and would deter inmates who were in segregated confinement from engaging in misconduct that could keep them there longer judge alito also argued that prison officials need not offer evidence that their rule achieves its rehabilitative purpose because all that turner v safley requires is logical connection between the regulation and the asserted goal8 as to the second factor judge alito argued that inmates could receive information about current events from books in the prison library and could receive letters from family members and friends even if not photographs as to the third and fourth factors judge alito found that the alternative policies that the majority suggested would impose significant burdens on prisons 4 id at 139 quoting turner v safley 482 us 78 89 1987 5 id citations omitted 6 id at 145 7 id at 147 8 id at 149 quoting turner v safley 482 us at 89 emphasis added by judge alito crs3 the supreme court is likely to decide banks v beard before the end of june 2006 but not before the senate votes on whether to confirm judge alitos nomination in waterman v farmer judge alito wrote unanimous opinion upholding new jersey statute that denied access to sexually oriented material to inmates who were imprisoned as pedophiles child molesters or rapists9 applying turner v safleys first prong judge alito found that new jersey has legitimate penological interest in rehabilitating its most dangerous and compulsive sex offenders and could rationally have seen connection between pornography and rehabilitative values10 applying the second prong judge alito found that the statute was not so broad as to forbid prisoners from reading the bible legal publications or other non pornographic books and therefore left the plaintiffs with alternative means to exercise their constitutional rights11 applying the third and fourth prongs judge alito concluded that the lessrestrictive alternative of the prisons reviewing incoming publications on casebycase basis would have costs that would be far from minimis and would have an unduly burdensome effect on guards and on the allocation of prison resources12 teachers free speech rights in edwards v california university of pennsylvania judge alito wrote unanimous opinion for the third circuit holding that the first amendment does not place restrictions on public universitys ability to control its curriculum13 the case was brought against the university by tenured professor who alleged that the university had violated his first amendment rights by suspending him for teaching from nonapproved syllabus in order to advance his religious beliefs judge alito quoted from supreme court case holding that when the state is the speaker it may make contentbased choices when the university determines the content of the education it provides it is the university speaking14 in sanguigni v pittsburgh board of public education judge alito wrote unanimous opinion for the third circuit upholding public high schools power to remove teacher from her coaching positions for publishing certain statements in faculty newsletter15 the teachers statements had focused on employee morale asserting that some faculty members were being put under undue stress had experienced bad luck and had left the building with low esteem16 judge alito wrote while holding that public employees enjoy substantial free speech rights the 9 183 f3d 208 3d cir 1999 10 id at 215 217 11 id at

court has nevertheless recognized that the state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees and that with respect to personnel actions first amendment rights are implicated only when public employees speech relates to matters of public concern17 in sanguigni the teachers statements did not relate to matter of public concern and her free speech claim judge alito found had been properly dismissed by the lower court students free speech rights in saxe v state college area school district the third circuit in an opinion by judge alito found public school districts antiharassment policy unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibited substantial amount of speech that would not constitute actionable harassment under either federal or state law18 even assuming for present purposes that the federal antidiscrimination laws are constitutional in all of their applications to pure speech we note that the school districts policys reach is considerably broader for one thing the policy prohibits harassment based on personal characteristics that are not protected under federal law federal statutes cover only harassment based on sex race color national origin age and disability the policy in contrast is much broader reaching at the extreme catchall category of other personal characteristics which the policy states includes things like clothing appearance hobbies and values and social skills by prohibiting disparaging speech directed at persons values the policy strikes at the heart of moral and political discourse the lifeblood of constitutional self government and democratic education and the core concern of the first amendment that speech about values may offend is not cause for its prohibition but rather the reason for its protection 19 nevertheless school students do not have full first amendment rights so judge alito examined whether the policy may be justified as permissible regulation of speech within the schools he noted supreme court cases that hold that school may categorically prohibit lewd vulgar or profane language and may regulate schoolsponsored speech on the basis of any legitimate pedagogical concern speech falling outside of these categories may be regulated only if it would substantially disrupt school operations or interfere with the rights of others20 judge alito found that the policy appears to cover substantially more speech than could be prohibited under this test21 among the speech it unconstitutionally covered was speech that has the purpose of disruption even when there was reasonable basis to believe that it would cause substantial disruption and speech that offends but does not interfere with the rights of others furthermore harassment as defined by the policy did not necessarily rise to the level of substantial disruption 17 id at 396397 quoting pickering v board of education 391 us 563 568 1968 18 240 f3d 200 204 3d cir 2001 19 id at 210 20 id at 214 21 id at 217 crs5 saxe included concurring opinion by judge rendell but dissent judge rendell expressed strong disagreement with the notion that the judicial analysis of permissible restrictions on speech in given setting should be affected let alone dictated by legislative enactments intended to proscribe activity that could be classified as harassment22 in ch ex rel zh v oliva the plaintiff was kindergarten student in class in which the students were asked to make posters depicting what they were thankful for on thanksgiving day23 the plaintiff produced poster indicating that he was thankful for jesus and his poster was displayed in the hallway of the school along with those of his classmates subsequently however board of education employees removed the poster because of its religious theme and later the childs teacher returned the poster to the hallway but in less prominent location at the end of the hallway free speech claim was filed on behalf of the student the third circuit banc did not reach the merits of the free speech claim in part because it found that it was not alleged that the removal occurred as result of any school policy against the exhibition of religious material or that the restoration to less prominent place was the result of school policy or an authoritative directive from the principal or superintendent24 judge alito dissented writing i would hold that discriminatory treatment of the poster because of its religious theme would violate the first amendment specifically i would hold that public school students have the right to express religious views in class discussion or in assigned work provided that their expression falls within the scope of the discussion or the assignment and provided that the schools restriction on expression does not satisfy strict scrutiny25 the final phrase in this quotation implies that the schools restriction on free expression would be constitutional if it satisfied strict scrutiny what judge alito meant by this was that if the poster would have materially disrupted classwork or involved substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of other students then its discriminatory treatment would be permitted as an exception to the first amendment otherwise to treat the poster differently because it expressed thanks for jesus rather than for some secular thing was quintessential viewpoint discrimination and it was proscribed by the first amendment 26 judge alito added that for the school to display the poster would not have violated the establishment clause because the establishment clause is not violated when the government treats religious speech and other speech equally and reasonable observer would not view the government practice as endorsing religion27 judge alito would have sent the case back to the lower court to determine whether the poster had been treated in 22 id at 218 23 226 f3d 198 3d cir 2000 banc cert denied 533 us 915 2001 24 id at 202 25 id at 210 26 id 27 id at 212 crs6 discriminatory fashion because of its religious content and if so whether the discrimination satisfied strict scrutiny discrimination against religious speech in child evangelism fellowship of new jersey inc v stafford township school district judge alito wrote unanimous opinion affirming preliminary injunction issued against public school district to require it to allow religious group to hand out materials and staff table at backtoschool nights28 judge alito noted that although the school district had constitutional obligation to distribute or post any community group materials or to allow any such groups to staff tables at backtoschool nights when it decided to open up these fora to specified category of groups ie non profit nonpartisan community groups for speech on specific topics ie speech related to the students and the schools it could not discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint29 the school district had discriminated against the religious group because it feared that to allow it to speak on school property would violate the establishment clause of the first amendment which prohibits the government from endorsing religion but judge alito found that the speech was not schoolsponsored because the school districts purpose in allowing the distribution and posting of community group materials was not to convey its own message but was to assist all organizations in the community30 because the plaintiffs speech was private and not schoolsponsored the fact that it was religious did not cause it to violate the establishment clause the plaintiff therefore was likely to succeed on the merits of its case and was entitled to preliminary injunction pending trial zoning of adult establishments in phillips v borough of keyport district court had dismissed lawsuit before trial but the third circuit ruled that it should go forward and sent it back for trial31 judge alito concurred but dissented with respect to allowing one of the claims to go forward the lawsuit was over the denial of an application to open an adult book and video store at particular location the denial was based on an ordinance that prohibited such establishments from being located within 500 feet of residence church school playground or the like sexually explicit material is protected by the first amendment unless it constitutes obscenity or child pornography neither of which was at issue in phillips speech that is protected by the first amendment may not be regulated on the basis of its content unless the regulation satisfies strict scrutiny this means as the court in phillips wrote that contentbased regulations will be sustained only if they are shown to serve compelling state interest in manner which involves the least possible burden on expression32

bookstore because it sells sexually explicit material discriminates against the bookstore on the basis of the content of its material and that such regulation therefore should be subject to strict scrutiny the supreme court however has held that regulations that are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech are to be regarded as contentneutral33 the regulation at issue in phillips was justified allegedly not on the basis of animus toward sexually explicit material but to prevent the deterioration of the community and to ensure its economic prosperity and well being of the quality of life34 regulations of speech that are regarded as contentneutral however are not necessarily constitutional although they are not subject to strict scrutiny they are subject to intermediate scrutiny which as the court in phillips explained means that they will be upheld only if they are narrowly tailored to serve significant or substantial governmental interest and they leave open ample alternative channels of communication35 thus city could not prohibit adult bookstores at all locations or allow them only at excessively inconvenient ones intermediate scrutiny may be contrasted with strict scrutiny in that regulation may be narrowly tailored without necessarily imposing the least possible burden on expression and may serve significant or substantial governmental interest without necessarily serving compelling one in phillips the district court had concluded that the ordinance is an effort to suppress the secondary effects of sexually explicit expression and not sexually explicit expression itself and that it was narrowly tailored to achieve that objective36 the court of appeals however concluded that the district court was simply not in position to make these findings and therefore sent the case back to the district court to hear evidence on these matters37 the court of appeals added that our first amendment jurisprudence requires that the borough identify the justifying secondary effects with some particularity and that to insist on less is to reduce the first amendment to charade in this area38 on another point the court of appeals did not take strong freespeech position it held that although there must be factual basis for legislative judgment as to the existence of secondary effects presented in court when that judgment is challenged there is requirement that such factual basis have been submitted to the legislative body prior to the enactment of the legislative measure39 judge 33 renton v playtime theaters inc 475 us 41 48 1986 emphasis in original 34 107 f3d at 170 35 id at 172 36 id at 173 37 id 38 id at 175 39 id at 178 crs8 rosenn dissenting observed that not single court of appeals has interpreted renton as requiring absolutely preenactment evidence40 judge alito concurred with the court of appeals majority as to all of the above he dissented however from part iv of the decision in which the majority held that on remand the district court should also consider the plaintiffs claim that their right to substantive due process was violated when their application was subjected to denial delay and revocation because of defendants dislike of the proposed adult entertainment expression41 judge alito dissented because he believed that even if the plaintiffs application had been rejected for improper reasons he was not convinced that every illmotivated governmental action that restricts the use of real estate constitutes violation of substantive due process42 he believed therefore that the district court had properly dismissed the substantive due process claim his dissent thus did not turn on point of first amendment law in terminello v city of passaic judge alito joined an unreported decision in case that challenged requirement that in order to qualify for an entertainment license theater must employ an offduty police officer as part of its security team43 although the opinion does not state that this theater was an adult establishment we include it in this section because like the zoning restriction in phillips the requirement here was aimed at combating the secondary effects of speech rather than at regulating speech on the basis of its content the district court had granted the theater preliminary injunction that allowed it to operate pending trial the city appealed and the third circuit vacated the preliminary injunction because the lower court had used the wrong standard in granting the injunction it should have used the intermediate scrutiny standard that is applicable to restrictions that are justified without regard to the content of speech which is that such restrictions must be narrowly tailored to serve substantial or significant government interest and leave open ample alternative channels for communication the third circuit found that the district court could not have properly determined whether the restriction was narrowly tailored because there is evidence in the record establishing the cost of hiring offduty police officers as compared to bonded security guards the third circuit therefore sent the case back to the district court for the district court to receive evidence on this question and then determine whether the requirement was narrowly tailored and whether it should reissue the preliminary injunction erotic dancing in conchatta inc v evanko the plaintiffs were gentlemans club in philadelphia and two erotic dancers who worked there they challenged as violating the first amendment pennsylvania statute that prohibits 40 id at 189 renton is

facility holding liquor license 44 they requested preliminary injunction pending trial against the enforcement of the statute the district court denied their request and the third circuit in an unreported decision joined by judge alito affirmed the court noted that to be granted preliminary injunction plaintiff must show both 1 that the plaintiff is reasonably likely to succeed on the merits and 2 that the plaintiff is likely to experience irreparable harm without the injunction applying this standard the court of appeals found that the plaintiffs have made strong case that the statute is overbroad which means that it restricts speech that is protected by the first amendment but the court did not find it necessary to decide the question because it held that the plaintiffs are nevertheless not entitled to preliminary injunction because as the district court held the plaintiffs failed to show that the denial of their motion for preliminary injunction would result in irreparable harm this was because the plaintiffs have never been cited for violating the statute or regulations and there is imminent threat of such action dissenting judge found that the plaintiff dancers have already suffered irreparable harm and will continue to suffer irreparable harm if their motion for preliminary injunction is not granted this was because the dancers uncertainty as to what the regulation prohibits and their fear of being found in violation caused them to restrain their performances the dissent quoted the supreme court as having said that the loss of first amendment freedoms for even minimal periods of time unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury45 the district court later decided the case on the merits and found the statute unconstitutional to the extent that it contained the words immoral and improper because there can be doubt that the terms immoral or improper are vague and therefore the statute does not provide reasonably clear notice of what is and what is not prohibited46 the court upheld the statute insofar as it applied to lewd conduct as it found that lewd was sufficiently clear so as not to constitute unconstitutional vagueness defamation tucker v fischbein was defamation case for which judge alito wrote the third circuits 2to1 opinion47 the suit was brought by william tucker and his wife c delores tucker crusader against gangsta rap lyrics against the estate of rapper tupac shakur and several companies connected with the production of an album of shakurs the plaintiffs alleged that shakur on the album had attacked mrs tucker using sexually explicit messages offensively coarse language and lewd and indecent words and that she had received death threats because of her activities48 the plaintiffs sued for defamation alleging that the 44 83 fed appx 437 2003 wl 22931320 3d cir 2003 per curiam 45 elrod v burns 427 us 347 373 1976 46 conchatta inc v evanko 2005 wl 426542 ed pa 2005 47 237 f3d 275 3d cir 2001 cert

but does not necessarily include the loss of sexual relations richard fischbein the lawyer representing shakurs estate was quoted in the press as expressing skepticism about the claim that the lyrics could have destroyed mrs tuckers sex life the plaintiffs then amended their complaint to include fischbein as defendant for having defamed them by characterizing their loss of consortium claim as claim for loss of sexual relations fischbein subsequently again expressed his skepticism of the claim that the lyrics could have destroyed mrs tuckers sex life and the tuckers amended their complaint again to add another defamation claim against fischbein as well as one against time and newsweek for publishing his comment fischbein time and newsweek moved for summary judgment and the federal district court granted their motions which means that it dismissed the case without allowing it to go to trial it did so because the tuckers were public figures under defamation law and could not prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendants acted with actual malice as public figures must do to win defamation case to act with actual malice means to make defamatory statement with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not49 on appeal in order to show that fischbein had acted with actual malice the tuckers argued that fischbein as lawyer should have known that claim for loss of consortium may not have anything to do with damage to sexual relations so he was at least reckless when he told the press that mrs tucker was trying to recover for injury to her sex life50 judge alito rejected this argument with respect to the first time that fischbein made statement to the press because at that time there is evidence that fischbein was informed that mr tuckers consortium claims did not refer to damage to sexual relations51 after the tuckers added him to their complaint however it appears that fischbein should have known that they had not claimed loss of sexual relations and therefore judge alito found reasonable jury could find by clear and convincing evidence that fischbeins second statement that the tuckers had made such claim constituted actual malice judge alito however affirmed the dismissal of the claims against time and newsweek because he found clear and convincing evidence that they had acted with actual malice judge nygaard dissented from judge alitos holding as to fischbein as judge nygaard read the tuckers amended complaint as insufficient to indicate change in their attitude toward alleging loss of sexual relations and therefore he found clear and convincing evidence that fischbein had spoken with actual malice52 49 new york times v sullivan 376 us 254 279280 1964 50 tucker v fischbein 237 f3d at 284 51 id 52 id at 292 on remand fischbein again won summary judgment but on different grounds continued crs11 in another defamation case remick v manfredy judge alito joined an opinion by judge sloviter finding that in context the defendants statement that the plaintiff was attempting to extort money was not defamatory because it constituted mere rhetorical hyperbole53 it was in context an opinion and under pennsylvania law an opinion cannot be defamatory unless it may reasonably be understood to imply the existence of undisclosed defamatory facts justifying the opinion54 commercial speech in pitt news v pappert judge alito wrote unanimous decision striking down restriction on commercial speech55 section 4 498 of the pennsylvania statutes annotated banned advertisers from paying for alcoholic beverage advertising in communications media affiliated with university college or other educational institution and student newspaper sued judge alito first noted that it makes difference that the statute rather than banning the newspapers speech merely prevented it from receiving payment for speech imposing financial burden on speaker based on the content of the speakers expression is contentbased restriction and must be analyzed as such56 judge alito next applied the central hudson test to the speech restriction advertising is form of commercial speech and commercial speech though protected by the first amendment is subject to greater governmental regulation than other speech the supreme court has prescribed the fourprong central hudson test to determine whether governmental regulation of commercial speech is constitu tional this test asks initially 1 whether the commercial speech at issue is protected by the first amendment that is whether it concerns lawful activity and is not leading and 2 whether the asserted governmental interest in restricting it is substantial if both inquiries yield positive answers then to be constitutional the restriction must 3 directly advance the governmental interest asserted and 4 be not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest57 judge alito noted that the first prong of the test is satisfied as the law applied to ads that concern lawful activity the lawful sale of alcoholic beverages and that are not misleading58 he also found the second prong satisfied as there can also be dispute that the asserted government interest preventing underage drinking and alcohol abuse are at minimum substantial59 he found however that the statute founders on the third and fourth prongs as for the third prong the 52 continued the tuckers again appealed and the appeal is pending 53 238 f3d 248 262 3d cir 2001 54 id at 261 emphasis added by the third circuit 55 379 f3d 96 3d cir 2004 56

underage or abusive drinking to material degree section 4498 applies only to advertising in very narrow sector of the media and the commonwealth has not pointed to any evidence that eliminating ads in this narrow sector will do any good60 as for central hudsons fourth prong the supreme court has held that it is not to be interpreted to require the legislature to use the least restrictive means available to accomplish its purpose instead the court held legislation regulating commercial speech satisfies the fourth prong if there is reasonable fit between the legislatures ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends61 here judge alito wrote section 4498 is both severely over and underinclusive62 it was overinclusive because it included students who were over the legal drinking age and they were substantial majority of the students it was underinclusive presumably because it applied only to narrow sector of the media judge alito added that pennsylvania can seek to combat underage and abusive drinking by other means that are far more direct and that do not affect the first amendment namely by enforcement of the alcoholic beverage control laws on college campuses63 he concluded that section 4498 fails the central hudson test and then added that it violates the first amendment for an additional independent reason it unjustifiably imposes financial burden on particular segment of the media ie media associated with universities and colleges64 for such financial burden to be justifiable under the first amendment it must be necessary to achieve what the supreme court has described as an overriding government interest and an interest of compelling importance65 but the commonwealth has not shown that section 4498 is necessary to discourage underage drinking or abusive drinking66 public employees speech rights in swartzwelder v mcneilly judge alito wrote unanimous decision upholding preliminary injunction that prevented the pittsburgh police bureau from enforcing its order requiring its employees to obtain clearance before testifying in court under certain circumstances67 in this case the bureau attempted to enforce its order against police officer who was an expert in the proper use of force by police officers and who was subpoenaed to testify as defense expert in the prosecution of police officer for firstdegree murder in connection with shooting in the line of duty the subpoenaed police officer sued 60 id at 107 61 board of trustees of the state university of new york v fox 492 us 469 480 1989 62 379 f3d at 108 63 id

his first amendment right of free speech and he sought preliminary injunction against enforcement of the order pending trial the federal district court granted the preliminary injunction after magistrate judge found that the plaintiff was likely to prevail in the lawsuit that irreparable harm would result if the preliminary injunction were not granted that granting the preliminary injunction would not cause greater harm to the defendant than denying it would cause to the plaintiff and that the preliminary injunction would be in the public interest judge alito noted the general principle that while public employees do not give up all the first amendment rights they would otherwise enjoy as citizens to comment on matters of public interest the state has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees 68 he found that speech restriction would be permissible in this case if the government could show that the interests of both potential audiences and vast group of present and future employees in broad range of present and future expression are outweighed by that expressions necessary impact on the actual operation of the government69 as for the free speech interests in swartzwelder v mcneilly the regulation of opinion testimony alone imposes significant burden on first amendment interests of both bureau employees and potential audiences as for the governments interests judge alito found that several interests that the government cited such as keeping track of the location of employees who are testifying could be served without reviewing and clearing the substance of their testimony70 others such as preventing public confusion regarding the citys official policies and practices could be served by an order that applied only to testimony related to an employees official duties71 judge alito therefore concluded that the district court had not abused its discretion in finding that the plaintiff was likely to prevail in the lawsuit as for the other elements that must be shown to be granted preliminary injunction judge alito noted that the loss of first amendment freedoms for even minimal periods of time unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury that the balance of hardships weighs in the plaintiffs favor because preliminary injunction leaves the city free to attempt to draft new regulations and that the public interest is best served by eliminating the unconstitutional restrictions imposed by the order72 freedom of association in in re asbestos school litigation judge alito wrote 2to1 opinion holding that an asbestos manufacturer could not consistent with the first amendment be held liable on the plaintiffs conspiracy and concert of action claims73 the plaintiffs had alleged that pfizer had marketed an asbestos containing product for an eightyear period without warnings though it had specific 68 id at 235 69 id at 236 quoting united states v national treasury employees union 513 us 454 468 1995 70

keeping with the method of marketing asbestos products by its coconspirators as pfizer well knew without any or adequate warnings74 pfizers alleged coconspirators were members of trade organization called the safe building alliance sba pfizer argued that to hold it liable on the conspiracy claim would penalize its exercise of its first amendment rights to engage in free speech and to associate with the sba75 judge alito agreed finding that to hold pfizer liable would be squarely inconsistent with the supreme courts decision in naacp v claiborne hardware co76 that case grew out of boycott by the naacp of white merchants in claiborne county mississippi from 1966 to 1972 group of the merchants sued the naacp and the mississippi supreme court upheld judgment in the merchants favor based on civil conspiracy and the common law tort of malicious interference with the plaintiffs businesses77 the boycott had included some acts of violence but the us supreme court reversed concluding that the nonviolent elements of the boycott giving speeches banding together for collective advocacy nonviolent picketing personal solicitation of nonparticipants and the use of local black newspaper were protected by the first amendment78 the supreme court wrote in claiborne hardware civil liability may not be imposed merely because an individual belonged to group some members of which committed acts of violence for liability to be imposed by reason of association alone it is necessary to establish that the group itself possessed unlawful goals and that the individual held specific intent to further those illegal aims79 in the present case judge alito wrote it is abundantly clear that the strict standard set out in claiborne hardware cannot be met and he therefore ruled for pfizer80 he added that although the factual background of claiborne hardware was very different from this case and that the constitutionally protected conduct in claiborne hardware was of much greater societal importance nothing in the supreme courts opinion lends support to the suggestion that the standard it enunciated was not meant to have general applicability81 dissenting judge stapleton argued that joining together with others does not render legal conduct that would be illegal if engaged in on ones own and claiborne hardware expressly recognizes that one may be held liable if one 74 id at 1287

group that one knows to have illegal aims82 in this case he added pfizer has failed to convince that its position is in any way different from defendant in any antitrust conspiracy case 83 conclusion we conclude this report with note of caution for various reasons one should draw only limited conclusions from the fact that in each of the cases discussed above judge alito voted for the party to the litigation who claimed free speech right or for the other party which was governmental entity except in the defamation cases and the freedom of association case one reason is that some judicial decisions follow clear supreme court precedents which lowercourt judge may feel obliged to follow whether he agrees with them or not but which he might be inclined to overturn were he on the supreme court another reason is that the fact that judge favored or disfavored the free speech side in particular case may reveal little of his view of the first amendment because the basis of his opinion may not have been his view of the first amendment in phillips v borough of keyport for example judge alito joined an opinion to send the case back to the lower court to hear additional evidence this ruling favored the government because the lower court had previously ruled against the government but it did not ensure that the government would ultimately win the case similarly in terminello v city of passaic the third circuit vacated the district courts decision because the district court had applied the wrong legal standard in granting an injunction not necessarily because the third circuit disagreed with the district courts result on the merits yet another reason to use caution in attributing particular first amendment views to judge on the basis of particular rulings is that even ruling for the government may expand the right of free speech and ruling against the government may narrow it not that there are necessarily any instances of either of these occurrences among the cases discussed in this report famous example of the former occurrence is schenck v united states in which justice oliver wendell holmes wrote an opinion that affirmed criminal conviction yet expanded the first amendment so that the government could punish political advocacy only when such advocacy creates clear and present danger84 82 id at 1296 83 id 84 249 us 47 52 1919 for other versions of
