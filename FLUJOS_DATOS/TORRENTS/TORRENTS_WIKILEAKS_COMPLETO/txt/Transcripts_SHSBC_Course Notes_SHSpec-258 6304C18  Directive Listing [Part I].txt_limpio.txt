6304c18 shspec258 directive listing part i details on running r3m gobbledygook to comply with the form isnt right the pc sometimes gives it knowing that it should be suchandsuch form dont use it since it will result in rocket read something odd but conceptually right eg catholicness is ok it is up to the auditor to direct the pcs attention to what should be there and get him to find it the liabilities of getting wrong items wrong goals missed items etc are so great that you should do everything possible to prevent these things from happening you have bank pattern that is at least close to the perfect pattern the upper fourteen to eighteen and the lower twelve items omitting the two lowest oppterms which vary on every goal are very set and patterned the pattern is that of lrhs fifteenth gpm he realized that we needed the basic fundamentals of the bank and that the pc was in bank so far back and so beefy that it was vital to get its character and its right pattern or get killed as pc there is more to the gpm than appeared earlier because one could confront it all until lot of charge had been taken off the goal of that bank is to create to lrhs amazement the pattern holds true later on the track and on other pcs if the pc isnt run closely guided to this pattern his rocket read goes off so the pattern has value there will be other patterns for other types of goals but they can be extrapolated from this one directive listing has to do first with the accuracy of the pattern when the auditor doesnt know what he is trying to do it is not very successful directive listing is kind permissive listing wastes time and pcs the main thing that will give you trouble is the top oppterm and the top terminal these are characterized as the final achievement of the goal the top oppterm and the negation of the goal the top terminal
