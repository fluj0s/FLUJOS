from mhughesltrrarizonaedu to tom crowley tomoceantamuedu subject re old stuff date fri 22 sep 2000 062250 0700 cc kbriffaueaacuk dear tom the difference between the campito mountain record and for example the one from the polar urals that you mention is that there is meaningful correlation between the campito record and local temperature whereas there is strong correlation in the polar urals case i give references to the work reporting this phenomenon at the end of this message but im afraid im missing the references to the technical comments that are being responded to in the last two if you examine my fig 1 closely you will see that the campito record and keiths reconstruction from wood density are extraordinarily similar until 1850 after that they differ not only in the lack of longterm trend in keiths record but in every other respect the decadalscale correlation breaks down i tried to imply in my email but will now say it directly that although direct carbon dioxide effect is still the best candidate to explain this effect it is far from proven in any case the relevant point is that there is meaningful correlation with local temperature not all highelevation treering records from the west that might reflect temperature show this upward trend it is only clear in the driest parts western of the region the great basin above about 3150 meters elevation in trees old enough 800 years to have lost most of their bark stripbark trees as luck would have it these are precisely the trees that give the chance to build temperature records for most of the holocene i am confident that before ad1850 they do contain record of decadalscale growth season temperature variability i am equally confident that after that date they are recording something else im split between harvard forest and umass these days and my copy of your paper is not with today id be interested to know what the name of the site for the lamarche central colorado record was cheers malcolm reference list 1 graybill donald and sherwood b idso 1993 detecting the aerial fertilization effects of atmospheric co2 enrichment in treering chronologies global bioeochemical cycles 7 1 8195 2 lamarche v c d graybill h c fritts and m r rose 1984 increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide tree ring evidence for growth enhancement in natural vegetation science 225 101921 3 1986 carbon dioxide enhancement of tree growth at high elevations science 231 85960 4 1986 technical comments carbon dioxide enhancement of tree growth at high elevations science 231 860 quoting tom crowley tomoceantamuedu dear malcolm and keith as i discuss in my ambio paper the anomalous late 19th century warming also occurs in lamarche tree ring record from central colorado the urals record of briffa and the east china phenological temperature record of zhu alpine glaciers also started to retreat in many regions around 1850 with 13 to 12 of their full retreat occurring before the warming that commenced about 1920 the overpeck et arctic synthesis also discusses warming before 1920 that record matches very closely the mann et reconstruction in other details back to 1600 unpublished work by us on coral trends also suggests slight warming between about 18501920 so are you sure that some co2 fertilization is responsible for this may we not actually be seeing warming tom thomas j crowley dept of oceanography texas am university college station tx 778433146 9798450795 9798478879 fax 9798456331 alternate fax
