of receiving such fede ral funds however such organizations are uniformly prohibited from using the federal grant or contract money for such political purposes unless expressly authorized to do so by

political activities by such private grantees or contract recipients this report is including the activities of lobbying or advocating for legislative programs or changes campaigning for endorsing or contributing to political candidates or parties nd voter registration or ge toutthevote campaigns although with some exceptions organi zations receiving federal grants or contracts are not by virtue of such receipt required to abdicate or refrain from exercising their first amendment righ ts of political speech participation or expression with their own resources such organizations are uniformly prohibited from using the federal grant or contract money for such political purposes unless expressly authorized to do so by law these recipient organizations must thus use private or other

for political or for voter registration purposes certain entities because of the nature of the organization or its tax status may have particular limitations or restrictions on political or advocacy activities which would apply in most instances regardless of the entities status as federal grantee or contractor thus for example entities which are incorporated for charitable educational or

number of provisions of fe deral law or regu lation which apply general acrosstheboard restrictions upon th use of federal appr opriations contract or grant funds for lobbying purposes while other restrictions exist which are upon particular program or funds the re strictions on lobbying with federal funds generally follow only the funds themselves restricting the use of such funds and do not

there are several general government wide restrictions on privat recipients using federal funds for lobbying purposes federal restrictions on contract and grant funds omb circular a122 specific

budget omb in omb circular a1222 under these current federa l provisions nonprofit grantees of the federal government may not be re imbursed out of federal grant for their lobbying activities or for

campaign contributions or expenditures but exempt any activity aut horized by congress or when providing technical andor factual information related to the performance of grant or contract when in

lobbying for other grants or contracts the so called byrd amendment applies to recipient of federal contract grant or cooperative agreement and to the subcontract ors and subgrantees of that contract or grant and includes specifically within its terms any state or local government including local and regional authorities4 the statutory and regulatory restrictions prohibit the use of federal funds to pay any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency member of congress an officer or employee of congress in connection with governmental decisions regarding the awarding of federal contract the making of federal grant loan or cooperative agreement the regulations note that influencing or attempting to influence means making with the intent to influence any communication to or appearance before an officer or employee of an agency or member of congress and thus might be intended only to reach what are consider ed direct lobbying activities as opposed to grass roots activities5 any information specifically requested by an agency or congress is allowable at any time6 however and certain other contacts may be allowable depending on the

in further information and guidance to clarify ombs interim final guidance the office of management and budget had expl ained the prohibition on use of federal appropriated funds does not apply to influencin g activities not in connection with specific covered federal action these activities include those related to legislation and regulations for program versus specific covered federal action 55 fr 24542 june 15 1990 omb proposed to revoke this further explanation in 1992 since the exemption was interpreted too broadly 57 fr 1772 but made it clear that general program lobbying in congress was still not covered even while activities to influence the earmarking of funds for particular program project or activity in an appropriation authorization or other bill or in report language would be included w ithin the acts restrictions 57 fr 1772 january 15 1992 10 note however potential tax consequences for 501c3 and 501c4 organizations 11 omb guidance 55 fr 24542 june 15 1990under the provisions of the byrd amendment federal contractors or grantees have to disclose and certify when they use even their own funds to lobby on covered matters7 while federal grantee may not under th byrd amendment lobby with respect to the awarding or making of federal cont ract or grant this particular restriction does not in itself necessarily bar general lobbying or pub lic policy advocacy on issues when that conduct is not involved with covered action that is the making or awarding of grant to that entity8 since it is directed at lobbying only on specified federal actions concerning th making of grants loans contracts and agreements and the extensions or modifications of such agreements loans contracts or grants the byrd amendment would have limited appli cation to lobbying on general program legislation while the provision might ba r the use of federal funds to lobby member of congress to intervene with an agency concerning the making extension or modification of grant loan contract or agreement or might bar the lobbying of congress concerning direct earmarked appropriation or specific program or spending instruction in congressiona l report the byrd amendment would not appear to apply to the lobbying of congre ss concerning the cons ideration of program legislation generally9 the restrictions of the byrd amendment in similar manner as the omb circular and federal acquis ition regulations are upon the federal funds and not the recipients themselves that is the provisi ons do not prohibit recipients grantees or contractors from using their own funds or other nonfedera lly appropriated funds to lobby the government on any matter10 under the provisions of the byrd amendment if the entity has any monies or resources other than federal appropriated funds sufficient to cover lobbying activities there is presumption that nonfederal monies were used in any lobbying effort11 presumption could of course be overcome with evidence or ad missions to the contrary appropriations law riders there is usually now included in appropriations law provisions general rider and restricti on applicable to fundshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34725crs5 12 pl 110161

propaganda purposes dir ected at legislation pending before congress12 while this language would clearly apply to federal agencies receiving and expending appropriations there had been questions as to whether or not the language would follow funds which orig inated as federa l appropriations to government agencies even into the nds of private par ties and individuals although funds which originate as appropria ted federal funds might be considered to lose their character as federal funds once th ey are in private hands13 the government accountability office gao formerly the general acc ounting office has opined that this particul ar restriction and rider blishes responsibility in the grantor federal agency to assure that the funds that it distributes even to private parties are not being used in contrave ntion of the limitation thus the general appropriations law restrictions enacted yearly have been imputed by the comptroller general to apply to the grantees of federal agencies14 in one case the gao found violation of the general ppropriations restriction when local transportation authority and grantee of the department of trans portation used grant funds from the agency to produce newsle tter urging readers to write to their elected representatives in cong ress to support continued funding15 as explained in the appropriations treatise prepared by gao finally in b202975 november 3 1981 the comptroller general resolved the uncertainty concerning application of the restriction to funds in the hands of grantee and concluded that federal agencies and departments are responsible for insuring that federal funds made available to grantees are not used contrary to the publicity and propaganda restriction the case involved the angeles downtown people mover authority grantee of the urban mass transporta tion administration umta department of transportation fearing that its funding was in jeopardy the authority prepared and distributed newsletter ur ging readers to write to their elected representatives in congress to support continued funding for the people moverhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34725crs6 16 id 17 pl 110161 supra at 723 121 stat 2025 2007 pl 109115

general found that this newsletter to the extent it involved umta grant funds violated the antilobbying statute16 in the later appropriations riders of this nature th language of the provision was changed to now expressly include by private contractor in the restriction on the use of federa l appropriations part of any appropria tion contained in this or any other act shall be used directly or indirectly including by private contractor for publicity or propaganda purposes within the united stat not heretofore authorized by the congress17 this change may indicate an express emphasis by congress that an agency may not accomplish indirectly through private contractor what it may not do directly that is use federal appropriations for publicity or propaganda campaigns or it may signal broader reach to all contractor and grantor funds received from the federal government even when the private recipient is not contracted or directed to engage in the particular questionable activity by federal agency but rather engages in such activity independently in the past gao has traditionally inte rpreted the public ity and propaganda restrictions as far as they applied to federal agencies as not necessarily restricting direct communications from the agencies to legislators but rather as limiting and prohibiting grassroots type of lobbying cam paigns in interpreting these types of publicity or propaganda restrictions gao has explained the following in interpreting publicity and propaganda provisions we have consistently recognized that any agency has legitimate interest in communicating with the public and with legislators regarding its policies an interpretation of the antilobbying re striction which strictly prohibited expenditures of public funds for dissemi nation of views on pending legislation would consequently preclude virtua lly any comment by officials on administration or agency policy result we do not believe was intended we believe therefore that congre ss did not intend to preclude all expression by agency officials of view s on pending legislation rather the prohibition of the antilobbying restric tion in our view applies primarily to expenditures involving direct appeals addr essed to the public suggesting that they contact their elected representatives and indicate their support of or opposition to pending legislation ie appeals to members of the public for them in turn to urge their representatives to vote in particular manner18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34725crs7 19 gao principles of federal appropriations law supra at 4211

policy matters even if such communications give argument s for or against specific legislation the comptroller general found violation of the publicity or propaganda anti lobbying rider when the material was ssentially expository in nature and did not urge or suggest anyone contact their representative in the legislature19 i n n example concerning department of tran sportation expenditures for displays and pamphlets and informational material at the time congress was considering passive restraint systems airbags for cars gao noted while considering the timing and location of the displays one would have to be pretty stupid not to see this as an obvious lobbying ploy that did not make it illegal since there was evidence that transportation urged members of the public to contact their elected representatives20 in addition to these general appropria tions law riders there may be more specific statutory or appropriations limitations on particular federal monies or on particular federal programs which also limit the use of federal monies appropriated in particular appropria tions law for lobbying or publicity or propaganda campaigns directed at congress by private grant or contract recipients or to use grant funds to pay the salary of one who engages in such activities21 as to the use of funds by grantees of federal agencies when such use is restricted by an appropriation rider the comptroller general has interpreted the restriction on grantees in the hhs appropriations legislation for example nd found it to have been violated when local community action agency used grant funds for mass mailing of letter to members of the public urging them to write their congressmen to oppose abolition of the agency22 the comptroller general simila rly found that the provision was violated when university using gran t funds received from the department of education encouraged students to write to members of congress to urge their opposition to proposed cuts in st udent financial aid programs23 the comptroller general has thus interpreted this appropriations rider on grantees and contractors in similar manne r as the publicity and propaganda riders on federal agencies that is to apply to grassroots lobbying campaigns where the public is urged to contact their members of congress it should be noted that the office of legal counsel of the department of justice has offered an opinion that thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34725crs8 24 5 op olc 180 1981 25 pl 107273 205a 116 stat 1778 november 2 2002 26 see section 6 of the third deficiency ppropriations

grantees receiving funds under that particular act directly to members of congress on pending legislation or appropriations24 criminal law the principal permanent statutory prohibition on what is considered lobbying with appropriated fu nds is federal criminal statute at 18 usc 1913 which prohibits the use of federal appropriations to pay for any personal services advertis ement telegram telephone letter printed or written matter intended or designed to influence members of congress or other officials on variety of programs legislation or appropriations the provision at 18 usc 1913 was amended in 200225 originally adopted in 1919 the law had always been interpreted to apply only to officers nd employees of the federal government26 and then only to l obbying the c ongress the 2002 amendments while eliminating the criminal penalties and substituting the civil penalties of the socalled byrd amendment27 substantially broadene d the substantive prohibition to cover the use of federal appropr iations to lobby or influence all levels of governmental authority28 and removed the penalties provision which had indicated an applicability only to federal officers and employees as noted by gao the provisions of 18 usc 1913 might be considered to apply now to others who use federal appropriations for lobbying purposes and not just to fede ral employees as had been done in the past29 the exact parameters of this law adopted in 1919 are not precisely known as there appears never to have been an enfor cement action or indic tment returned based on the provision although the payment for various activities fina nced with federal funds is barred 1913 expressly exempt s from the prohibition the activities of officers and employees of the federal government communicating to members of congress on the request of any member or to congress through the proper official channels requests for legi slation or appropriations deemed necessary for the efficient conduct of the public business this provision of law has thus been consistently interpreted in the past by the justice department as permitting direct contacts and communications from federal executive officials and

is not apparent that the permissibility of direct communications to law makers and policy makers would also extend to persons othe r than federal employees who use federal appropriations for such

501c4 of the internal revenue code this provision which is commonly called the simpson amendment prohibits sec tion 501c4 civic leagues and social welfare organizations from engaging in any lobbying activities even with their own private funds if the organization recei ves any federal grant loan or award41 the restrictions of the simpson ame ndment originally c overed all 501c4 organizations

prohibition on lobbying activities with an organizati ons own funds as condition to the receipt of federal monies only upon 501c4 grantees and those seeking an award or loan but allowing unlimited lobbying activities with organizational funds for 501c4 contractors of the federal government the simpson amendment now reads as follows an organization described in s ection 501c4 of the internal revenue code of 1986 which engages in lobbying activ ities shall not be eligible for the receipt of federal funds constituting an award grant or loan while there may have been some constitutional objections to the provisions of the simpson amendment and its effect on first amendment activities funded by an organizations own private nonfederal funds the interpretation of the provision to allow for unlimited lobbying by affiliate orga nizations with their own nonfederal monies has apparently obviated legal cha llenges the legislative history of the provision clearly indicates that it was in tended that 501c4 organization may separately incorporate an affiliated 501c4 which w ould not receive any federal funds and which could engage in unlimited lobbying43 the method of separately incorporating an affilia to lobby or to receive and administer federal grants which was described by the amendments sponsor as splitting was apparently intended to place degree of separation between

may not engage in lobbying activities the term lobbying activities as used in the simpson amendment prohibition in secti on 18 of the lobbying disclosure act is defined in section 3 of that legislation to include only direct lobbying contacts and efforts in support of such contacts such as preparation planning research and other background work intended for us in such direct contacts46 lobbying contact under the lobbying disclosure act is an oral or written communication including an electronic communication to covered executive branch official or covered legislative branch official which concerns the formulation modification or adoption of legislation rules regula tions policies or programs of the federal government47 organizations which use their own private resources to engage only in grass roots lobbying and public advocacy including specifically any communication that is made in speech article publication or othe r material that is distributed and made available to the public or through radio television cable televi sion or other medium of mass communication48 would therefore not appear to be engaging in any prohibited lobbying activities under this provision the l obbying disclosure acts definitions of lobbying activities nd lobbying contacts exclude and do not independently apply to activities which consist only of grass roots lobbying and public advocacy49 similarly since the term lobbying activitie s relates only to the direct lobbying of covered federal officials the simpson amendment would not appear to limit in any way an organizations use of its own private resources to lobby state or local legislators or other state or local governme ntal bodies or units while direct lobbying of the congress or of certa in high level executive branch officials is covered under the lobbying disclosure act as lobbying contact and thus by definition lobbying activity the acts of testifying before congressional committee subcommittee or task force or

political advocacy as in the area of public policy advocacy and lobbying the courts have been careful and ferential to the rights of private parties in terms of their freedoms of association and expression103 in buckley v valeo the supreme court even while upholding limitati ons on political contributions to federal candidates and committees invalidated provision of the federal election campaign act which would have restricted the am ount of money certain entities could spend independently on political advocacy concerning candidates in fede ral elections the court found that the acts expenditure ceilings impose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech it is clear that primary effect of these expenditure limitations is to restrict the quantity of campaign sp eech by individuals groups and candidates the restrictions while neutral as to the ideas expressed limit political expression at the core of our electoral process and of the first amendment freedoms104 even when federal regulation on l obbying or public policy or political advocacy involved merely disclosure and reporting requi rement and not restriction which directly limits or prohibits advocacy ac tivities such regulation underwent rigorous constitutional scrutiny thus although the court has noted in first amendment cases that disclosure seem s to be the least restrictive means of obtaining certain permissibl and important governmental objectives such as the prevention of fraud and undue influence of monied special interests on basic governmental processes such rigorous constitutional scrutiny of laws which merely required disclosures relating to political speech and advocacy were necessary since the court recognized the deterrent effects on the

or regulatory provisions do not place restrictions and c onditions merely upon the use of federal f unds nor merely attempt to control or define the content of government program but rather institute direct restricti ons and prohibitions on political advocacy and expression of certain private entities with their own resour ces as requisite and as condition for those private parties to recei ve federal funds then such legislation must be examined under the heightened scrutiny of first am endment principles the supreme court has noted that restrictions on otherwise constitutionally protected activities could not be justified simply because persons were receiving federal f unds nor was lesser degree of judicial scrutiny required simply because government funds were involved108 as explained by the supreme court in more recent case congress cannot recast condition on funding as mere definition of its program in every case lest the first amendment be reduced to simple semantic exercise109

state contract for example the court ruled that state provision could not be in terpreted to bar an entity that lobbies or hires lobbyists from being eligible for par ticular government cont ract thus in effect barring lobbying by state contractors with their own funds and resources since that would place an unconstitutional condition upon the receipt of government funds in violation of the protected first amendment public advocacy rights of those contractors valid state law cannot be applied in way to thwart the exercise of right guaranteed by the constitution the attorney generals policy burdens and deters the exercise of the first amendment right to petition the government persons and organizations such as plaintiffs are confronted with dilemma forsake lobbying or give up the right to seek contracts or subgra nts from the state of indiana under the first and fourteenth amendmen ts state may not directly abridge lobbying activities or indirectly abridge such activ ities by wit hholding government benefits from those pers ons who lobby or retain lobbyists112 although it is true that private or ganization may simply choose to forego participating in or conduc ting political advocacy voter registration drives or lobbying to be eligible to pa rticipate in particularly re stricted federal program and although one has right to participate in or receive f unding provided by federal program the supreme court under the socalled unconstitutional conditions cases has in the past established the principle that the receipt of federal benefit may not be conditioned upon abdicating ones cons titutional rights particularly ones first amendment freedom of speech for at least quartercentury this c ourt has made clear that even though person has right to valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely it may not deny benefit to person on basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests especially his interest in freedom of sp eech for if the government could deny benefit to person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations his exercise of those free doms would in effect be penalized and inhibited this would allow the governme nt to produce result which it could not command directly

1984amendment rights114 in explicating the principles of prohibiting the denial of federal benefits for private parties who exercise their first amendment rights of speech and advocacy the court noted our unconstitutional conditions precedents span spectrum from government employees whose close relationship to the government requires balancing of important free speech and government intere sts to claimants for tax exemptions speiser v randall 357 us 513 1958 users of public facilities eg lambs chapel v center moriches union free school dist 508 us 384 390394 1993 healy v james 408 us 169 1972 and recipients of small government subsidies eg fcc v league of women voters of cal 468 us 364 1984 who are much less dependant on the government but more like ordinary citizens whose viewpoints on matters of public concern the government has legitimate interest in repressing115 thus while the government may place cer tain conditions on the recipients of federal benefits grants or subsidies and may refuse to subsidize or pay for ones private lobbying or advocacy activities the participation in first amendment expression may arguably not be the basis for denying pub lic benefit as explained by justice blackman concurring in regan v taxation with representation the denial of business expense deduction for l obbying is constitutional but an attempt to deny all deductions for business expe nses to taxpayer who lobbies would penalize unconstitutionally the exercise of first amendment rights and that while denial of welfare benefits for abortion is constitutional an attempt to withhold all welfare benefits from one who exercises right to an abortion probably would be impermissible116 it may be noted in this regard that in speiser v randall117 the supreme court expressly found that the state may not place condition on eligibility even for taxexemption on basis that violates ones first amendment freedoms of speech expression and association t deny an exemption to claimants who engage in certain forms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such speech118 the supreme court under this line of cases thus invalidated federal law which would have placed an advocacy restriction on any recipient of particular grants from federally funded program public broadcasting in federal communications commission v league of women voters of california 119 in that case the federal statutory ban on public broadcasters editorializing was expressly found unconstitutional by the supreme court in the original provisions establishing the corporation for public broadcasting th noncommercial broad cast stations whichhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34725crs29 120 see pl 90129 november 7 1967 81 stat 368 121 468 us at 399401 122 500 us at 173 1991 123 500 us at 196 124 id 125 500 us at 197received any grants or funding from cp b were prohibited from editorializing120 although broadcast stations may be requi red in the public interest to afford opportunities for opposing viewpoints and qual time under the so called fairness doctrine the court found that such broad casters merely because they receive some federal funding through th corporation for public broadcasting could not be prohibited from providing their own expr ession and opinions on matters of public interest as the ban was not narrowly tailore d to sufficiently address the governments asserted justifications for such restri ctions on protected first amendment conduct the court found that although the governme nt may regulate the use of its own appropriations and need not subsidize private advocacy the complete ban on editorializing would impermissibly prohibit th private broadcast stations from using their own resources and funding for such public advocacy activity121 it is obvious that congress may and does institute various conditions and requirements on the receipt of federal f unds although the cases discussed above were found to c onstitute an unconstitutional condition on the r eceipt of federal funds by private parties and on the use of the recipients own resources for protected first amendment advocacy the supreme court has per mitted the government to require restriction on th use of recipients own funds for certain speech within particular program when that program is even pa rtially funded with federal funds in rust v sullivan 122 provision restricting progra ms funded by the government from providing abortion couns eling was upheld by the supreme court the court did note that the restriction examined there was however restriction going only to the program which was partially federally funded and not restriction on the recipient of the funds who could continue parately and indepe ndently to counsel on abortion or even to perform abortions apart from the fede rally funded program the court explained that the government did not place cond ition on the recipient of the subsidy but rather placed the restrictions on the particular program or service which merely require that the grantee keep such activities separate and distinct from the publicly funded activities123 as stated by the court the government is not denying benefit to anyone but is instead simply insisting that public funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized124 chief justice rehnquist writing for the court distinguished this situation from the unconstitutional conditions cases in contrast our unconstitutional conditions cases involve situations in which the government has placed condition on the recipient of the subsidy rather than on particular program or service thus effectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally funded program125httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34725crs30

advocacy are the provisions of the federal election campaign act which allow for voluntary expenditure limitation on campaign expenses when candidate agrees to accept federal funds for his or her politi cal campaign as noted by the supreme court in buckley v valeo supra however that particular provision was not directly challenged by any party in the case and the issue of its constitutionality was not before the court126 the court appeared however to be favorably disposed to the idea of voluntary limitations since it believed the overall provisions providing federal funds to private parties for political advo cacy and campaigning enhanced rather than restricted opportunities to communicate nd advocate to the public subtitle h is congressional effort not to abridge rest rict or censor speech but rather to use public money to facilitate and enlarge public disc ussion and participation127 government speech more recently the supreme court has not ed that when the government funds activities and programs it may limit restrict and fashion the speech of those speaking on its behalf either as government speech or when the government uses private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own programs128 in 1995 the court explained that when the gove rnment disburses public funds to private entities to convey governmental message it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message is neith er garbled nor distorted by the grantee129 what might be considered an exception to the first amendment that is allowing for government regu lation of either government speech or some private speech within the parameters of certain government programs or government created forums would not in any event extend to all activities and programs of individuals or private entities which receive government grants in legal services corporation v velazquez 130 the court overturned rest riction on the legal services corporations grantees lobbying

government from using the forum in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium 133 5 usc 1501 et seq see discussion in this report infra at pp 1618legislature on behalf of client could still not be c onsidered government speech and thus was not subject to regulati on under the government speech doctrine131 in light of the development of the government speech doctrine the supreme court has engaged in certain amount of reinterpretation of so of the previous precedents on what have been characteriz ed as unconstitutional conditions cases the supreme court in velazquez for example discussed the holding in rust v sullivan in terms of government speech the court in rust did not place explicit reliance on the rationale that the counseling activities of the doctors under t itle x am ounted to governmental speech when interpreting the holding in later cases however we have explained rust on this understanding we have said that viewpointbased funding decisions can be sustained in instances in which the government itself is the speaker see board of regents of univ of wis system v southworth 529 us 217 229 235 2000 or instances like rust in which the government used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its programs rosenberger v rector and visitors of the univ of va 515 us 819 833 1995132 along somewhat similar line as the government speech concept may be situations where private organizations serve as what might be described as surrogates or standins for government agencies to perform governmental functions of administering and disbursing public funds thus as noted above in some of these instances federal law has treated these orga nizations for purposes of restrictions on the partisan political activities of their employees as state or local governmental agencies under the provisions of the part of the socalled hatch act which apply to employees of state and local governments133 unlike broad restrictions on recipients using their own resources and funds to engage in protected first amendment c onduct outside of the particular federally assisted programs the particular rest rictions concerning for example the community services block grant program or the head start program appear to apply only within the federally assisted program and do not appear to extend to organizations and their activities outside of and separate from such programs that is that do not use program funds services or personnel connected to this program additionally the existing statutory restric tions on

public or political advocacy the supreme court has struck down as overly broad and not sufficiently connected to the gitimate interest of preventing corruption of candidates and officeholders for example federal law which would have limited the continuedgovernmental interest promoted by the legislation least restrictive means of accomplishing objective the supreme court has found that while first amendment rights are fundamental they are not in their nature absolute134 the court has increasingly resorted to balancing conflicting interests of the government and private parties when possible limitations on first amendment activities are somewhat indirect when the governmental interest in the re gulation is of compelling enough nature and when the statute is drawn with suffi cient precision when provision of law limits burdens or interferes with protected first amendment rights the supreme court will generally examine the law and its purposes to determine initially if there are significant overriding or compelling governmental interests in the restriction that outweigh the impositions on protected fi rst amendment rights if there are such governmental interests in the restrictions on first amendment activities then the court will examine whether the restriction is sufficiently narrowly tailored to promote those interests asserted as the statutes justification in cases involving the limitation of po litical advocacy in campaigns and the disclosure of lobbying activities for exam ple the protection of basic governmental processes by disclosing the sources of pr essures and influences on the legislative process135 and the prevention of the corrupti on of the electoral process and undue influences on candidates and officeholders which may accompany large cash payments and contributions to candidates and political parties136 have been found to be such important governmental interests which may justify in some cases certain limitations or burdens on first amendment activities including voter registration activities by political parties when f unded by unregulated amounts of soft money shortly befo re federal election137 even while such interests have been found to be significant and important however the court has struck down restrictions and direct or indirect limitations on advocacy speech and political activities which were not na rrowly

lobbying cammarano v united states 358 us 498 1959 140 see generally cincinnati soap co v united states 301 us 308 321322 1937 in the instance of legislation which would restrict some private parties who receive monies from the federal governme nt from engaging in public advocacy voter registration and lobbying ac tivities with their own nong overnmental resources it does not appear that the prevention of co rruption of candidates or officeholders or undue influences on basic governmental pro cesses are necessarily the interests that are intended to be forwarde d rather it appears that the principal governmental purposes in such legislation would be two fold one would be to prevent the use and diversion of federal gove rnment funds for private lobbying political and public policy advocacy activities which are not au thorized by congress and the second would be to prevent the federal govern ment subsidizing lobbying advocacy or voter registration activities of private partie s by providing such private parties with federal dollars for other purposes as to the governmental interest of not paying for private lobbying or political activities clearly the federal government need not pay for nor directly subsidize the lobbying or political advocacy of private entities139 to that end it should be noted as discussed earlier that current fe deral law and regulati ons already expressly prohibit the use of contract or grant funds by any governmental contractor or grantee for lobbying and political purposes or the pa ying for or charging off of expenses for political advocacy activities or lobbying to any government contract or grant the federal government may clearly limit the use of the f unds it appropriates in this way for the specific public purposes it desires140 similarly the government need not subsidize through such things as ta x exemptions or specific deductions for lobbying the private advocacy activities of organizations or persons in cammarano v united states the supreme court noted that th denial of tax deduction as business expense for the lobbying expenses of private entity was permissible because petitioners are not being denied tax deduction because they engage in constitutionally protected activities but are simply being required to pay for those activities entirely out of their own pockets as everyone else engaging

th eir tax exemption and the deductibility of contributions to them from the donors fe deral income tax since congress has merely refused to pay for the lobbying out of public moneys 142 if the interest of the government in legislative restriction is merely to avoid directly subsidizing or paying for privat lobbying or political activities out of public monies then the method of restriction in any proposed legislation which barred all privately funded advocacy by grant or contract recipients might arguably in the first instance be considered overinclusiv because it reaches activities speech and conduct paid for completely with private nonfederal monies as well as privately funded activities wholly outside of the realm of the federa l program as such the restriction may arguably be found with respect to otherwise protected first amendment speech and conduct to be unn ecessarily overbroad and burdensome on such first amendment rights as discussed by the supreme court in fcc v league of women voters supra it may be argued that less restrictive means to reach this goal of not paying for private lobbying or political activities out of government funds may be to enact and enforce more effec tive audits restrictions regulations and accounting procedures prohibiting the use of any federal funds for such activities this would reach the presumed goal of limiting the use of federal funds but would not be potentially overlybroad restri ction that would encompass within its prohibition the exercise by private recipients of protected first amendment speech and conduct financed entirely with their own resources and would not punish entities for entering the public debate on community civic and national issues by engaging in protected public advocacy further interest of the government fo rwarded by legislation might also be to prevent an indirect subsidy for groups who engage in political advocacy by providing such groups with federal funds for other nonadvocacy activities studies or services which the government desires as such this purpose is distinguished from the prevention of the use of govern ment funds directly for lobbying or advocacy or the subsidy for lobbying that tax exemption for such activities or all activities of the organization would provide the argument is that money is fungible and grants and contracts fo r proper public purposes to private groups frees up other nonfedera l money which the private grantee may use for any purposes including lobbying or voter registration activities there may be significant questions rais ed however as to whether government grant or contract for one specific public purpose or service performed or product provided by the recipient is or ma be considered subsidy for other private activities of the grant or contract recipien t which are funded wholly by private non federal contributions and funds the supr eme court in another context has foundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34725crs35 143 444 us 646 1980 144 444 us at 658 the government also does not appear to be subsidizing the first amendment activities of private parties as had been found by the courts in the past by for example providing tax deduction for priv ate parties who make contributions to an organization and thus subsidizing the activities of the charity by loss of tax revenue for contributions supporting those activities or by providing direct tax deduction for monies expended for lobbying activities see eg discussion in regan and cammarano supra that such grant is not subsidy of the other nonfederally funded activ ities in committee for public education and religious liberty v regan 143 the supreme court specifically found that providing gran t funds to religious organization for one secular purpose does not constitute federal subsidy of the other private non federally funded religi ous activities of the organization even the fact that federal grant funds to an organization for public purposes might argu ably free up non federal money for other private activities which the government does not want to fund does not make the federa l grant or payment subsidy of those other purposes in specifically rejecting the fungibility of cash argument the supreme court said none of our cases requires us to invalidate these reimbursements simply because they involve payments in cash the court has not accepted the recurrent argument that all aid is forbidden because aid to one aspect of an institution frees it to spend its other resources on religious ends hunt v mcnair 413 us 734743 1973144 the supreme court has thus expressly rejected this theory as realistic or necessary outcome or result of g overnment assistance of some activities of an organization vis avis other independent activ ities and therefore it is logi cal to assume that it would not necessarily be recognized as compelling or overriding interest by the court which could justify direct restrictions on protected first amendment conduct that private entity engages in with its own re sources outside of the governmentsponsored program
