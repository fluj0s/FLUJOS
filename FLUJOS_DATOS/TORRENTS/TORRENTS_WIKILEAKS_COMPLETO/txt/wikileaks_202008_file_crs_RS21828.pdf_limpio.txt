markets are not perfectly integrated internationally they are far more integrated than was true only 20 years ago1 t h i s integration has created pressure s for enhancing transparency in the capital markets and for curtailing risks of contagion2 several supranati onal organizations are addressing these pressures some specifically with respect to insurance new international accounting standards may import new defi nitions of insurance and new transparency standards for reinsurers may help buyers shop for risk fi nancing at the same time many other developed countries are synthesi zing their

internationally active reinsurer the obligation to share information about that reinsurer with other host supervisors it expressly contemplates global supervisory framework based on system of

reinsurers23 regulatory modernization in other countries some developed nations have unified their own supe rvisory regimes for financial services comprehensive regulatory reform of financial services began in australia in 1996 since then the uk germany and japan have also unified their national supervisory regimes for all fina ncial services sectors each country has taken slightly different approach australia formed one agency to craft and administer consistent and comparable disclosure requirements for broad range of products including deposit accounts securities insurance products and pensions it formed another agency to perform prudential supervision for bank and nonbank financial interm ediaries germany unified financial supervision of banks securities and insurance into one regulatory agency to achieve consistent supervision of di fferent sectors and of crosssectoral issues japans new financial services agency whic h reports directly to the prime ministers office supervises banks private insurers securities and securities markets24 perhaps of greatest interest because it is most accessible is the uks undertaking to unify its supervision of financ ial services

promote competition among regulated entities27 according to the fsa the insurance sector is key part of the uk financial services industry it is important both from an econo mic and social perspective that the uk has an insurance market that operates effectively and remains competitive in european and world markets28 according to the fsa its creation as single regulator highlighted differences between the regulation of insurance and other sectors in respect of similar types of risks29 accordingly it has undertaken ma jor overhaul of insurance regulation to strengthen it and to establish common ri skbased approach to regulation across all financial sectors30 in revising its insurance regulation th fsa has cooperated closely with and contributed to both the formulation of eu di

services may not be successful certainly neither australias nor the uks financial supervisory authority has been free from failures the efforts are noteworthy however for two reasons one is that their changes may like the proposed eu directive on reinsurance direc tly affect the competitive positions of us insurers and reinsurers the other is their express emphasis on maintaining the competitiveness of their domestic insurers in worldwide market33 conclusion representative oxley chairman of the house financial service committee has outlined roadmap to insurance regulatory reform he and representative baker chairman of the subcommittee on capital markets insurance and government sponsored entities have proposed achieving uni formity in some aspects of statebased insurance regulation by imposing federa l standards but not federal regulation34 chairman oxley in expressing his support for such reforms said that insurers are facing increasing competition from other financial services sectors which have significantly lower regulatory costs if insurers cannot raise new capital this marketplace is at risk for major collapse without change cons umers face world with fewer options less competition and less coverage35 at the subcommittees hearing on march 31 2004 representative kanjorski expressed suppor t for those goals and initial doubt about whether the proposal as outlined could achie ve them senator hollings ranking member of the senate committee on co mmerce science and tran sportation has introduced s 1373 the insurance consumer protection act to

insurance regulation it remains to be seen whether or how all these efforts will coordinate for the be nefit of the united states as whole
