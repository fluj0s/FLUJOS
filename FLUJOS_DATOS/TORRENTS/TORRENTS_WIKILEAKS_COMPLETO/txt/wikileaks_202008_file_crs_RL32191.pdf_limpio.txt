either commercial or personal consumer imports1 meanwhile congressional legislators have been exploring variety of legislative solutions to the problems posed by rising drug costs during the 108th congress the medicare prescription drug benefits bill hr 1 modified provision of existing law that authorizes the fda to allow the importation of prescription drugs if the secretary of hhs certifies that implementing such program is safe and reduces costs determination that secretary has made in the years since similar certification requirement was established in 2000 2 congress has used the appropriations process to insert provisions prohibiting the use of funds to restrict prescription drug importation most recently pl 110329 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriati ons act 2009 prohibited the us customs and border protection cbp from using funds to prevent individuals from transporting on their person 90day supply of canadian prescription drugs that comply with the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca 3 however few if any prescription drugs from canada will comply with the requirements of the fdca because such drugs are likely to be unapproved mislabeled or improperly dispensed as result the provisi ons in these appropriations bills and the final medicare bill appear to have limited effect and ultimately did not change the law with respect to the prohibition against importing prescription drugs from canada and other foreign countries the debate about drug importation continues on the one hand some policymakers remain opposed to allowing prescription drugs to be imported from foreign countries worried about the risk to consumers these critics argue that with its current resources and authority the fda 1 study by the aarp noted that

the safety or effectiveness of such drugs4 which they contend are more susceptible to being mishandled mislabeled unapproved or counterfeited than drugs sold domestically5 legislators and others have also expressed concerns about the safety of imports in general and the ability of the fda to inspect increasing amounts of imported products entering the united states6 in addition drug manufacturers and other opponents argue that allowing the importation of prescription drugs would stifle investment in the research and development of new drugs 7 on the other hand importation proponents who claim that importation would result in an increased supply of prescription drugs that could result in significantly lower prices for us consumers say that safety concerns are overbl own and would recede if additional precautions were implemented arguing that drug manufacturers are concerned only about their profits proponents of importation contend that us consumers should not subsidize the cost of research and development and that consumers in other countries should share the burden 8 linked to the issue of prescription drug importation is debate about drug costs9 while some comparisons of us and canadian drug prices conclude that us prices are higher than their canadian counterparts other studies do not find such discrepancies in part studies may vary depending on which drugs are selected for comparison and whether or not us generic drugs which tend to be cheaper than canadian brandname and generic drugs are considered10 in addition there is an unresolved debate about whether allowing drug imports would affect drug prices supporters argue that drug prices would drop due to competition if imports were allowed while opponents argue that increased demand for imported drugs and moves by manufacturers to limit supplies of cheaper drugs would cause prices to rise both in the us and abroad and would increase the risk of counterfeit drugs being introduced into the system11 according to study by the congressional budget office cbo the re duction in drug spending from importation would be small in part because of new costs associated with ensuring the safety of imported drugs and because of the likelihood that manufacturers would alter drug formulations or reduce foreign supplies12 furthermore there are questions about how much it would cost to implement safe 4 the canadian government has also stated that it cannot guarantee the safety of drugs exported to the us from canada marc kaufman canadian drug position misinterpreted wash post may 26 2003 at a11 5 see donald g

program the fda has estimated that such program would cost at least 100 million but that the figure could rise as high as several hundred million dollars especially if there was an increase in the volume of imported drugs13 in response to concerns about prescription drug imports number of congressional legislators have introduced bills that would make changes to existing law in these areas bills introduced in the 110th congress include hr 194 hr 380 hr 1218 hr 2638 hr 2900 hr 3161 hr 3580 s 242 s 251 s 554 and s 1082 current regulation of prescription drug importation consists of patchwork of federal and state laws in an array of areas14 at the federal level the fda regulates prescription drugs under the fdca which governs among other things the safety and efficacy of prescription medications including the approval manufacturing and distribution of such drugs15 it is the fdca that prohibits the importationsometimes referred to as reimportationof certain prescription drugs by anyone other than the manufacturer and that requires that prescription drugs may be dispensed only with valid prescription16 after change in enforcement policy by cbp the fda assumed the primary responsibility for determining whether foreign drug imports may legally enter the country17 in addition the drug enforcement agency dea administers the controlled substances act which is federal statute that establishes criminal and civil sanctions for the unlawful possession manufacturing or distribution of certain addictive or dangerous substances including certain prescription drugs that share these properties such as narcotics and opiates 18 at the state level state boards of pharmacy regulate pharmacy practice and state medical boards oversee the practice of medicine thus some of the laws that govern pharmacies and doctors vary from state to state finally although foreign laws are beyond the scope of this report it is important to note that such laws may also affect the importation of drugs from those countries

including the approval manufac turing and distribution of such drugs19 although many states also have their own laws that re gulate drug safety the fda maintains primary responsibility for the premarket approval of prescription drugs while the dea and cbp have somewhat more limited regulatory authority over such drugs the fdca contains several provisions that apply to prescription drug imports first the statute contains an outright prohibition that forbids anyone other than the manufacturer from importing prescription drugs this prohibition affects drugs originally made in the united states second the fdca contains number of other provisions relating to drug approvals and labeling that make it nearly impossible for prescription drugs made for foreign markets to comply with the extensive statutory requirements in part because the fda considers any drugs not made on an fdainspected production line to be unapproved and therefore illegal these provisions generally affect foreign versions of drugs that are approved for domestic sale importation of both usmanufactured prescription drugs and unapproved foreign versions of usapproved prescription drugs are discussed in this next section that section also discusses the change in cbp policy with regard to the seizure of mail order prescription drugs the penalties under the fdca the fdas personal importation pr ocedures state plans to import prescription drugs and businesses that facilitate the importation of prescription drugs in addition this section contains discussion of other legal areas that may affect prescription drug importation including antitrust law trade law and patent law

currently the fdca prohibits anyone other than the manufacturer20 of prescription drug from importing that drug into the united states21 thus it is technically violation of the statute for 19 21 usc 301 et seq 20 id at 381d1 the secretary however is authorized to allow the importation of any drugs that are required for emergency medical care id at 381d2 21 the fdca does not define united states except for in one section which may present unique issues for us territorial possessions however the fdca defines state and territory 21 usc 321a the fdca defines state as any us state or territory the district of columbia and puerto rico 21 usc 321a1 the fdca defines territory as any territory or possession of the united states including dc and excluding puerto rico and the canal zone 21 usc

these insular possessions are outside us customs territory 19 cfr 72 as mentioned above with limited exception anyone other than the manufacturer is prohibited from importing into the united states prescription drugs that are manufactured in state and exported 21 usc 381d1 if the definition of united states in 21 usc 381d1 includes insular possessions then it appears that pharmacies in these insular possessions are also prohibited from importing usmade prescription drugs section 381d1 might be paraphrased as follows drug subject to section 503b essentially prescription drug which is manufactured in state including insular possessions and exported to an insular possession due to its status as outside the customs territory of the us or foreign country may be imported into the united states including insular possessions unless the drug is imported by the manufacturer of the drug for example under this interpretation drug made in iowa and exported to the us virgin islands could only be imported into american samoa or any state by the drugs manufacturer it appears that whether pharmacies in insular possessions are prohibited from importing prescription drugs depends on whether the definition of united states in 21 usc 381d1 includes insular possessions the department of health and human services has argued that united states includes territories d epartment of the

consumers or online pharmacies to import prescription drug back into the country even though the drug was prior to export originally manufactured in any us state or territory the district of columbia or puerto rico and even if the drug otherwise complies with the fdca22 although critics of this law argue that there is rational justification for forbidding the importation of drug that is theoretically identical to its counterpart sold in the united states the fda contends that the agency can longer guarantee the safety of prescription drug once it has left the country and the agencys regulatory control according to the agency the fda cannot provide adequate assurance to the american public that the drug products delivered to consumers in the united states from foreign countries are the same products approved by the fda 23 in response to concerns about the rising costs of prescription drugs however congress adopted importation amendments to the fdca in 2000 under the medicine equity and drug safety meds act24 the fda was authorized to allow pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from canada if certain safety precautions were followed25 the act however stipulated that the importation provision would not become effective until and unless the secretary of hhs determined that the implementation of the provision would pose additional risk to the publics health and safety and would result in significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the american consumer26 citing safety concerns both the current and former secretaries declined to implement this provision in the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 medicare act27 congress revisited the issue of prescription drug importation like the meds act it continued united states in 21 usc 381d1 did not include insular possessions then it appears that insular possessions may not be prohibited from importing usmade prescription drugs the statute could potentially be read as follows drug subject to section 503b which is manufactured in state which includes the insular possessions and exported to an insular possession due to its status as outside us customs territory or foreign country may be imported into the united states excluding insular possessions unless the drug is imported by the manufacturer of the drug 21 usc 381d1 under this

medicare legislation directs the fda to allow pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs if certain safety precautions are followed28 unlike the meds act which covered prescription drugs from specified group of foreign countries the medicare act allows imports from canada only29 in addition the medicare act unlike the meds act also authorizes the fda to allow by regulatory waiver individuals to import prescription drugs for personal use under certain circumstances30 despite these new importation provisions the medicare act like the meds act stipulates that the importation provisions will not become effective until and unless the secretary certifies that the implementation of the provision would pose additional risk to the publics health and safety and would result in significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the american consumer31 as noted above the secretary of hhs has thus far declined to provide such certification absent such certification the ban on the importation of prescription drugs remains in effect

even if the fdca did not contain an explicit prohibition against drug importation the fda maintains that consumer imports of prescription drugs from foreign countries would almost certainly violate other provisions of the act32 for example such drugs are likely to be unapproved33 mislabeled34 or improperly dispensed35 according to the fda the reason that canadian or other foreign versions of usapproved drugs are generally considered unapproved in the us is that fda approvals are manufacturerspecific productspecific and include many requirements relating to the product such as manufacturing location formulation source and specifications of active ingredients processing methods manufacturing controls containerclosure system and appearance moreover even if the manufacturer has fda approval for drug the version produced for foreign markets usually does not meet all of the requirements of the us approval and thus it is considered to be unapproved virtually all shipments of prescription drugs imported from canadian pharmacy will run afoul of the act although it is theoretical possibility that an occasional shipment will not do so put differently in order to ensure compliance with the act when they are involved in shipping prescription drugs to consumers in the us businesses and individuals must ensure among other things that they only sell fdaapproved drugs that are made outside of the us and that comply with the fda approval in all respects 36 the difficulty in determining whether drug is fdaapproved is demonstrated by the agencys response to letter from representative edward markey on october 11 2006 he asked the 28 the medicare act also required the secretary to conduct study on the importation of drugs this study which was released in december 2004 concluded that legalizing drug importation would be likely to result in increased risk to consumers and would not significantly reduce retail drug prices hhs task force on drug importation supra

consumer would know if product is fdaapproved or unapproved37 the agency responded with recommendation that consumers access the fda site to search for the active ingredient or name of drug the names of approved companies for drug will be listed if the manufacturer of consumer drug is not listed the drug may be unapproved or there may be data errors the drug may also be an approved drug but distributed under the name of another company consumers are also advised to check with the drug manufacturer 38 in addition to complying with the requirements regarding fda approvals imported drugs must also meet fda requirements regarding labeling and dispensing for example mislabeling drug is violation of the fdca as is the act of introduc ing or receiving mislabeled drug in interstate commerce39 in order to be properly labeled prescription drugs must be labeled in accordance with the fdas extensive labeling requirements40 furthermore the fdca requires that prescription drugs may be dispensed only with valid prescription41 therefore it is violation of the act to import prescription drugs without legitimate us prescription according to the fda an inspection of prescription drug shipments by cbp found that 1728 of 1982 drug shipments from foreign countries violated the fdca because they contained unapproved drugs that could pose safety problems42 although the reason for the violation varied depending on the shipment the fda and cbp found shipments of drugs that among other things had never been approved by the fda were inadequately labeled eg lacked instructions or were labeled in foreign language had been withdrawn from the us market due to safety concerns could cause dangerous interactions required monitoring by doctor or were controlled substances 43 for example in february 2007 the fda erted consumers that americans who had ordered the prescription drugs ambien xanax lexapro and ativan online instead received product with haloperidol the active ingredient in an antipsychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia 44 separate fda investigation found that approximately 43 percent of the imported drugs that the agency intercepted from four countriesindia israel costa rica and vanuatuwere shipped to fill orders that consumer s believed they were placing with canadian pharmacies of the products believed to be canadian fda reported that only 15 percent actually

department of homeland security via the us customs and border protection agency cbp was responsible for examining imported prescription drugs at the nations international mail centers and borders and for detaining and destroying any fdaregulated prescription drugs that did not meet statutory or regulatory requirements 46 prior to november 17 2005 cbp officials tolerated prescription drug mail orders from canada of up to 90 days worth of medication generally interpreting us laws against the importation of drugs as applying to wholesalers and distributors47 however the cbp began strictly enforcing importation laws on november 17 2005 two days after the beginning of open enrollment for the medicare prescription drug program this policy change lead consumer groups and canadian pharmacies to complain that cbps policy was intended to encourage seniors to enroll in the medicare plan and decrease competition for often costly prescription drugs cbp officials denied this charge noting that the new enforcement policy was designed to protect consumers from potentially dangerous drugs manufactured abroad48 for the next eleven months cbp agents confiscated mail packages with foreign prescription drugs and often destroyed the drugs then mailed letters about the violation to consumers attempting to import the drugs 49 an estimated 37000 to 40000 packages were detained by cbp during this period50 in past years the house committee on appropriations had added provisions to appropriations bills that would have prohibited the fda from using monies to prevent drug importation from foreign countries such provisions were always removed during conferences between the house and the senate representative emerson added similar provision to the fy2007 homeland security appropriations bill prohibiting cbp fr om using funds to prevent importation of fda approved drugs 51 opponents labeled the provision an inappropriate way to address the issue of drug

encounter shortages as result of the provision53 supporters noted that the provision was aimed at forcing fda to assess prescriptions from foreign countries for safety instead of simply blocking all reimported drugs54 the senate committee on appropriations subsequently stripped the homeland security appropriations bill of the importation provision but senators vitter and nelson introduced the cbp funding prohibition for certain seizures of canadian drug imports in an amendment that passed 6832 55 as passed on september 25 2006 section 535 reads as follows none of the funds made available in this act for united states customs and border protection may be used to prevent an individual not in the business of importing prescription drug within the meaning of section 801g of the federal food drug and cosmetic act from importing prescription drug from canada that complies with the federal food drug and cosmetic act provided that this section shall apply only to individuals transporting on their person personaluse quantity of the prescription drug not to exceed 90day supply provided further that the prescription drug may not be1 controlled substance as defined in section 102 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 802 or 2 biological product as defined in section 351 of the public health service act 42 usc 262 56 the provision excludes narcotics biologics internet sales and importations of canadian prescription drugs by mail order57 most importantly the bill appears to allow individuals to transport 90day supply of prescription drugs from canada across the border by foot or vehicle however the provision ultimately appears to have limited effect because it states that individuals may personally import canadian prescription drug s that comply with the fdca by definition most prescription drugs from canada do not comp ly with the fdca as the previous section explained drugs that comply with the fdca must be approved by the fda be dispensed with valid prescription by us doctor and meet among other possible requirements mandates that are manufacturer and product specific manufacturi ng controls and processing methods extensive labeling requirements and source and active ingredient specifications 58 while it is possible that prescription drug could meet fda requirements nd therefore obtain fda approval in almost all cases imported prescription drugs will not comp ly with the fdca thus the provision does not change the current illegal status of most drugs imported from canada and it appears that cbp may still legally use funds to detain canadian dr ug imports that do not comply with the fdca despite the limited effect of the importation provision cbp announced change in its enforcement policy effective october 9 2006 cbp agents now focus on

cbp from using funds to prevent certain individuals from importing canadian prescription drugs the amendment would have appeared to allow an unlimited supply of importationsby mail order internet sales or physical transportation across the borderof canadian prescription drugs that comply with parts of the fdca however like the provision in the previous fiscal years bill the amendment ultimately would likely have had limited effect because it stated that the imported canadian prescription drugs must comply with three sections of the fdca that address adulteration misbranding and new drug applications these three fda provisions require among other things that drugs obtain fda approval comply with good manufacturing pr actices meet strength quality and purity requirements do not contain other mixtures or substitutions of other substances are labeled in accordance with fdca requirements and were manufactured in establishments registered with the secretary of hhs it appears unlikely that prescription drugs manufactured for the canadian market would meet these and other requirements of fdca 501 502 and 505 71 while it is possible that prescription drug could meet fda requirements and therefore obtain fda approval in almost all cases imported prescription drugs will not comply with the fdca thus the provision would not have changed the current illegal status of most drugs imported from canada and it appears that cbp would still have been able to use appropriated funds to detain canadian drug imports that did not comply with the selected sections of the fdca mentioned in the amendment as passed on september 30 2008 535 of pl 110329 the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 did not include the amended provision the consolidated act contained the same text as th fy2007 homeland security appropriations bill please see above for discussion of that provision the department of homeland security had proposed deleting the section from the fy2007 appropriations bill in its performance budget overview for fy2008 because prohibiting cbp from exercising its authority to assist the fda in enforcing current laws designed to protect the health and safety of american consumers is not the best way to address drug affordability 72

consumer knowingly imports drug in violation of these provisions then the violat ion is felony offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison or up to 250000 in fines or both75 despite these designated penalties individuals and corporations that violate the act may face monetary fines far greater than those specified in the fdca because those sanctions are superceded by general fines set forth in the sentencing reform act of 1984 which applies across the board to all federal crimes that statute raised the limit on the maximum penalties that apply to federal crimes as result misdemeanor violations of the fdca are actually punishable by fine of up to 100000 for individuals and up to 200000 for organizations and felony violations of the act are punishable by up to 250000 for individuals and up to 500000 for corporations 76 in addition federal courts are authorized to issue injunctions in order to enjoin violations of the act77 and any drug that is adulterated or misbranded is subject to seizure under the act78 it is important to note that those who aid and abet criminal violation of the act or conspire to violate the act can also be found criminally liable79 federal criminal law generally makes it separate crime to aid or abet any criminal offense against the united states or to conspire to commit criminal offense against the united states80 so illegal importers could potentially be charged with these offenses as well as other general federal crimes such as mail or wire fraud or making false statements in addition the fdca explicitly forbids certain acts as well as the causing of such prohibited acts 81 thus businesses that facilitate the importation of unapproved prescription drugs or usmanufactured prescription drugs may be liable if they are deemed to be causing violations of the act in addition to penalties under the fdca and other federal criminal statutes individuals or businesses that illegally import prescription drugs that are also controlled substances may be subject to penalties under the controlled substances act despite the range of penalties that fda has available to punish those who import prescription drugs in violation of the act the agency has clarified that its highest enforcement priority would not be actions against consumers82 indeed the fda exercises its enforcement discretion leniently in this regard by allowing consumers to import certain otherwise illegal prescription drugs under certain circumstances these enforcement procedures known as the fdas personal importation procedures are described in detail below g22g145g142g561g8g6g3g514g156g561g18g142g155g156g152g151g138g149g561g11g150g153g152g155g157g138g157g146g152g151g561g18g155g152g140g142g141g158g155g142g156g561 because importing unapproved

drugs the fda developed its personal importation procedures under the procedures the fda exercises its enforcement discretion to permit consumers to import otherwise illegal prescription drugs for purposes of personal use recognizing that the agencys limited enforcement resources are best directed at commercial shipments of imported drugs rather than personal imports the fda may at its discretion refrain from taking legal action against illegally imported drugs under the following circumstances the intended use is unapproved and for serious condition for which effective treatment may not be available domestically either through commercial or clinical means b there is known commercialization or promotion to persons residing in the us by those involved in the distribution of the product at issue c the product is considered not to represent an unreasonable risk and d the individual seeking to import the product affirms in writing that it is for the patients own use generally not more than three month supply and provides the name and address of the doctor licensed in the us responsible for his or her treatment with the product or provides evidence that the product is for the continuation of treatment begun in foreign country 84 ultimately the personal importation procedures detail the fdas enforcement priorities for imported drugs but are not intended to grant license to consumers to import unapproved prescription drugs into the united states85 indeed the fda emphasizes that even if all of the factors above are met the drugs remain illegal and fda may decide that such drugs should be refused entry or seized 86 furthermore these procedures do not apply to commercial shipments of unapproved prescription drugs nor are they intended to permit the importation of foreign versions of drugs that are already approved in th united states thus it appears that personal importations of cheaper versions of prescription drugs that are already available in the us do not conform to the fda s personal importation procedures87 nevertheless us consumers continue to import drugs from abroad and one canadian group claims that canadian pharmacies supply two million people in the us or roughly one percent of the us market for prescription drugs88 continued accordingly cbp is supposed to notify the fda if it has detected mail or baggage shipment of an fdaregulated article intended for commercial distribution an article that fda has specifically requested be detained or an fdaregulated article that appears to represent h ealth fraud or an unknown risk to health

modernization act of 2003 congress authorized the fda to allow individuals to import prescription drugs for personal use under certain circumstances provided that the secretary has certified that importation is safe and costeffective89 specifically the act subject to certification requires the secretary of hhs to allow individuals to import prescription drugs from canada if the drug is imported from licensed pharmacy for personal use by an individual not for resale in quantities that do not exceed 90day supply b is accompanied by copy of valid prescription c is imported from canada from seller registered with the secretary d is prescription drug approved by the secretary is in the form of final finished dosage that was manufactured in registered establishment f is imported under such other conditions as the secretary determines to be necessary to ensure public safety90 although the new individual importation provisions in the medicare act appear similar to the fdas personal importation procedures the legislation differs significantly because it contains the certification requirement the current secretary of hhs however has declined to provide such certification in the past and it is unclear what direction the agency will take in the future thus the new individual importation provisions do not appear to represent codification of the fdas personal importation procedures although the fda exercises its enforcement disc retion to permit personal importation such importation remains illegal however an elderly couple from chicago challenged the fdcas prohibition on personal importation in andrews v united states department of health and human services 91 the court rejected the plaintiffs claim that the statutory prohibition on personal drug importation violated their substantive due process rights under the fifth amendment of the constitution the standard of review that cour ts use when reviewing substantive due process claims depends on whether or not the statute in question affects fundamental right if statute affects fundamental right then strict judicial scrutiny is required if the statute does not affect fundamental right then court applies rational basis review in the andrews case the court determined that there is fundamental right to purchase drugs from preferred source at preferred price92 as result the court applying the rational basis test upheld the ban on personal importation because it is rationally related to legitimate governmental interest in ensuring the safety of prescription medications93 89 medicare act

several state and local governments have in place or have considered plans to import or facilitate the importation of prescription drugs in order to save themselves or their residents money on medicines contending that carefully structured state programs will provide sufficient degree of safety states and cities continue to argue that they have duty to explore innovative methods for providing more affordable prescription drugs to their residents even at the risk of violating federal law currently several states and the district of columbia have online prescription drug importation programs and several localities including boston massachusetts are importing prescription drugs from canada 94 interest in importing canadian prescription drugs may be beginning to wane due to factors including the medicare part d prescription drug program temporary increase in seizures by the cbp declining currencyexchange rates and greater use of generic drugs95 for example the first city to import canadian prescription drugs springfield massachusetts reported problems with its canadian prescription drug importation program however it later switched to state health benefits program that does not import canadian prescription drugs96 each state and local importation plan varies somewhat in the details illinois for example has implemented drug importation program known as isaverx under the program the state has established website that offers information regarding pharmacies in canada ireland and the united kingdom that the state has inspected and determined to be reliable sources for prescription drugs the state however does not import drugs directly but rather provides users with information on available drugs prices and order forms currently kansas missouri vermont and wisconsin also participate in isaverx 97 in addition rhode island legislators passed law that allows the state to license canadian pharmacies98 many other states and localities have

the fda in hope that the agency would as it has done with regard to personal drug importation exercise its enforcement discretion and allow states to establish prescription drug importation pilot plans100 the medicare act authorized the fda to provide waivers for individual importation and some lawmakers have argued that the individual importation waiver authority extends to state importation plans because such plans are intended to provide prescription drugs to individual state residents the fda however responded that the waiver provisions in the medicare act become effective only upon certification by the secretary that drug importation is safe and reduces costs 101 if the secretary would grant waiver or if federal law would otherwise allow such program maine would provide access to foreign prescription drugs102 ultimately vermont whose petition for pilot program was rejected by the fda sued the agency claiming that the fdas failure to implement regulations that authorize waivers and subsequent denial of vermonts petition violated the administrative procedure act apa the vermont lawsuit also claimed that the importation provisions in the medicare act constitute an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the secretary of hhs103 vermonts claims however were rejected by federal district court in the case vermont v leavitt 104 the court held that the fda did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the apa because vermonts petition asked the agency to approve program that was illegal the court based its ruling in part on its determination that as the fda had argued the fdca provision authorizing waivers for personal importation becomes effective only upon certification by the secretary that drug importation is safe and reduces costs 105 likewise the court rejected vermonts claim that the certification provision constitutes an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority holding that the provision provides clear guidance to the secretary of hhs by directing the secretary to consider safety and costeffectiveness 106 vermont did not appeal the decision107 montgomery county in maryland petitioned the fda

apa109 specifically the county argued that the fdas action was arbitrary because the agency has tacitly allowed numerous other states and localities to import prescription drugs in violation of the fdca but nonetheless refuses to assist jurisdictions that attempt to import drugs legally under waiver program furthermore the county contended that the fdas failure to act with respect to illegal importation programs indicates that the agency does not believe that importation poses safety risk despite the agencys statements to the contrary 110 the federal district court granted the fdas motion to dismiss the case the court held that the fda complied with the fdca and the medicare act when it denied the countys waiver request nd found the fdas denial did not violate the apa because it was not arbitrary or capricious111 in response to the countys argument that the fda failed to act with respect to importation programs the court held that the fdas failure to enforce the fdca in some situations does not constitute facto certification by the secretary of hhs because the statute gives the secretary discretion to issue such certification that canadian prescription drug importation programs are safe and costeffective 112 the court could not review the secretarys failure to certify importation programs nor could the court grant the county any relief because certification is discretionary113 despite the efforts of such state and local governments the fda continues to maintain that importing unapproved prescription drugs is unsafe and illegal indeed fda representatives have met with and sought to convince state officials to change their minds about importing drugs in apparent violation of federal law at the same time the agency has notified certain states of its legal position regarding drug imports 114 for example according to the fdas response to an inquiry from california officials if an entity or person within the state of california including any state county or city program any public pension or any indian reservation were to import prescription drugs into the state of california from canada or any other foreign country it would violate fdca in virtually every instance 115 the fda provides several legal arguments for reaching its conclusion that state and local drug importation is violation of the fdca first the statute prohibits anyone other than the manufacturer from importing drugs that were or iginally manufactured in the united states second even if an fdaapproved drug is manufac tured outside the us the imported version of the drug will likely violate statutory requirem ents regarding drug approvals labeling and dispensing116 these first two arguments are identical to the arguments that fda has made when continued

of prescription drugs to be statutory violations117 therefore the fda considers virtually any imports of prescription drugs as well as virtually any act that causes such imports to be illegal regardless of whether such imports are conducted by businesses consumers or governmental entities in addition the fda contends that any effort by states to enact legislation authorizing prescription drug imports would be preempted by federal law118 although the fda sets forth several legal arguments for its position preemption of state acts importation provisions does not appear to have been tested in court and there are several instances in which other prescription drug provisions in the fdca have been held not to preempt state law119 finally the agency has warned some states that they could be subject to lawsuits for injuries to consumers who relied on the states endorsement when purchasing prescription drugs from canada for example in letter to minnesota state officials the fda warned of the potential tort liability that state could be subject to if citizen purchases an unapproved illegal drug on your advice and suffers an injury as result 120 despite the fdas position regarding state and local imports of prescription drugs it appears that the agency is currently refraining from taking legal action against state and local governments that have established drug importation programs indeed in warning letter to minnesota which established website that provides information about accessing less costly prescription drugs from canada the agency notably refrained from asserting that the states program violated the fdca and did not describe any potential enforcement action that the fda might take 121 likewise the fda has indicated that it is unlikely to sue the state of illinois which has 117 see supra notes 2146 and accompanying text 118 california letter supra note 117 at 57 in warning letter to rhode island the fda elaborated on its preemption argument in greater detail letter from william k hubbard associate commissioner for policy and planning food and drug administration to patrick c lynch attorney general of rhode island january 28 2005 httpwwwfdagovocopacomhottopicsimportdrugslynch012805html the preemption doctrine derives from the supremacy clause of the constitution which establishes that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding us const art vi cl 2 in applying this constitutional mandate courts have recognized both express and implied forms of preemption which are compelled whether congress command is explicitly stated in the statutes language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose gade v national solid wastes management association 505 us 88 97 1992 quoting jones v rath packing co 430 us 519 525 1977 119 many of these cases however deal

preemption federal common law and other paths to uniform pharmaceutical safety standards 45 d epaul l rev 395 408 1996 it is also important to note that the fdca expressly preempts state law with regard to over thecounter drugs and medical devices but not with regard to prescription drugs as result it is more difficult to predict the outcome of preemption challenge to state laws on prescription drugs detailed examination of the preemption issue however is beyond the scope of this report 120 letter from william k hubbard associate commissioner for policy and planning food and drug administration to the honorable tim pawlenty governor of minnesota 3 february 23 2004 httpwwwfdagovocopacom hottopicsimportdrugspawlenty022304html in the minn esota warning letter the fda explicitly noted that minnesotas own inspection of some of the recommended canadian pharmacies had revealed potential safety violations id at 13 121 id one possible explanation for the fdas silence with respect to the legality of minnesotas actions could be that it is unclear whether the state is causing the prohibited importation activity in violation of the statute in part because the state neither imports drugs from canada nor allows consumers to order directly through its website on the other hand the minnesota website does provide order forms pricing information and instructions on how to submit an order to the recommended pharmacies and such actions may be enough to establish that minnesota is facilitating illegal importation see httpwwwstatemnusportalmnjs phomedoagencyrx to

european countries despite the agencys earlier pronouncement that it would refrain from suing states and localities as long as those entities imported drugs from canada and not from other countries122 one possibility is that the agency is simply waiting for state to actually buy foreign drugs for their residents which would constitute direct commercial importation before taking legal action123 although several localities are importing drugs directly the fda has not gone after these cities because they are too small 124 previously the fda had indicated that it had not yet sued states or localities because the agency wants to first win its case against rx depot giving fda bargaining power for the more difficult task of taking formal action against states and local governments125 however in the rx depot case which involved private company that helped individual consumers import prescription drugs the fda successfully concluded its lawsuit when rx depot agreed to enter into consent decree that pe rmanently enjoins the company from the importation of unapproved prescription drugs 126 the rx depot case is discussed in detail in the following section g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g142g156g561g22g145g138g157g561g8g138g140g146g149g146g157g138g157g142g561g11g150g153g152g155g157g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g18g155g142g156g140g155g146g153g157g146g152g151g561g6g155g158g144g156g561 although the fda has refrained thus far from taking legal action against both states and individual consumers who import prescription drug s in violation of the fdca the agency has pursued legal action against businesses that facilitate the importation of such drugs unlike pharmacies which receive orders from consumers and dispense drugs directly some businesses facilitate drug sales without dispensing drugs directly rather these companies many of which are online act as middlemen between consumers who provide medical and payment information and foreign typically canadian pharmacies which then ship drugs directly to consumers the fda has pursued legal action against at least one such business that case is discussed in detail in this section while separate but related issues involving online pharmacies are discussed in crs report rs21711 legal issues related to prescription drug sales on the internet in united states v rx depot 127 the department of justice doj acting on behalf of

provision prohibiting the introduction into interstate commerce of any drug that violates the acts approval requirements129 although rx depot was not directly importing drugs the company admitted that it was engaged in the business of causing the shipment of usmanufactured and unapproved foreign manufactured prescription drugs from canadian pharmacies to us citizens130 rx depot countered that the fda was not actually concerned about the safety of imported drugs because the agency had never tested the drugs it bought from rx depot as part of sting operation against the company131 similar complaints have been voiced by other businesses that facilitate the importation of prescription drugs critics of fdas importation stance also argue that it fails to protect the public health because it allows individuals to import drugs while prohibiting commercial operations that are in the best position to develop safeguards132 and allege that the fdas importation procedures may violate international trade agreements133 ultimately critics argue that the fdas procedures protect the profits of drug manufacturers at the expense of consumer pocketbooks134 despite these arguments the district court held against rx depot during preliminary ruling in the case concluding that rx depots importation of prescription drugs clearly violates the law the district court issued preliminary injunction enjoining rx depot from facilitating the importation of prescription drugs135 while the courts order was not actually final order on the merits of the case it did indicate that doj had substantial likelihood of prevailing in the lawsuit indeed the court appeared particularly concerned with the safety of imported drugs unapproved prescription drugs and drugs imported from foreign countries by someone other than the usmanufacturer do not have the same assurance of safety and efficacy as drugs regulated by the food and drug administration because the drugs are not subject to fda oversight and are not continuously under the custody of us manufacturer or authorized distributor their quality is less predictable than drugs obtained in the united states for instance the drugs may be contamin ated counterfeit or contain erratic amounts of the active ingredient or different excipients also the drugs may have been held under uncertain storage conditions and therefore be outdated

drugs ordered through the company were often dispensed in quantities greater than prescribed and did not contain the required package inserts although the court acknowledged that the cost of prescription drugs in the us is high and that there are known cases of an individual who has suffered harm from drugs imported through rx depot the court nevertheless concluded that the fda has legitimate safety concerns and that congress is in the best position to resolve the tension between prescription drug safety and cost 137 shortly after the court issued the preliminary injunction rx depot agreed to enter into consent decree with the fda under the terms of the consent decree rx depot admitted liability for causing the importation of unapproved new drugs and usmanufactured drugs in violation of the act and agreed to permanently cease such activities138 in the wake of the consent decree the legal battle continued as the us requested disgorgement of rx depots profits139 the federal court of appeals found that disgorgement was an appropriate remedy under the fdca because disgorgement furthers the purposes of the fdca by deterring future violations of the act which may put the public health and safety at risk140 many companies like rx depot remain in business141 and number of states and localities have contemplated or implemented their own importation programs in response several drug manufacturers have begun limiting sales of their drugs to canadian pharmacies in an effort to prevent the drugs from being resold in the us at cheaper prices these actions have raised questions about whether such behavior violates federal antitrust laws topic that is discussed in the following section g3g151g157g146g157g155g158g156g157g561g14g138g160g156g343g346g344g561 as noted above several major prescription drug manufacturers have responded to the rise in the number of businesses and consumers that are importing cheaper drugs into the us by reducing the supply of such drugs to distributors and phar macies in canada where most of the imported drugs originate 143 although some manufacturers argue that restrictions on sales are designed to prevent drug shortages in canada such moves may instead be intended to limit canadian distributors and pharmacies to selling prescription drugs to canadian consumers only rather than selling excess supplies of prescription drugs to us consumers at cheaper prices than such consumers would pay for similar drugs in the united states as result several members of congress have questioned whether these drug manufacturers are violating federal antitrust laws 144 several bills introduced in the 109th congress would have prohibited such sales tactics145 137 id at 124142 1245 138 press release food and drug administration rx

competitorsunless they have suffered an injury as result of an actionable wrong under the antitrust laws similarly the achievement or implementation of specific programs or goals is not concern of the federal antitrust laws it is not given therefore that existing federal antitrust laws could be successfully employed to challenge pharmaceutical manufacturers whose actions appear either to reduce the us supply of imported prescription drugs or to make it more difficult for americans to purchase prescription drugs from other countries including canada first neither current antitrust statutes nor doctrine make unlawful the marketoriented activities of individual entities unless under certain circumstances the entity is monopolist 149 section 1 of the sherman act150 makes illegal every contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce that provision by its terms may only be violated by multiple parties engaged in concerted or joint action thus it would not currently be

that is wholly unilateral152 moreover the court long ago noted in united states v colgate that the sherman act does not restrict the long rec ognized right of trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal and of course he may announce in advance the circumstances under which he will refuse to sell 153 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit added that the fundamental colgate precept of seller choice set out above is not altered by the applicability of either the patent or copyright law to the items in question unless it is judicially determined that the patent or copyright in question was fraudulently procured154 second whether certain joint activity is unlawful and therefore violates the antitrust statutes is not always susceptible of proof although the supreme court has indicated several times that formal contract may not be necessary to establish the collective action required by section 1 an antitrust violation may be found if the unlawful agreement155 can be inferred from the totality of surrounding circumstances156 in 1984 in monsanto co v sprayrite service corp the court said the correct standard is that there must be ev idence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action by the parties that is th ere must be direct or circumstantial evidence that reasonably tends to prove that the p arties had conscious commitment to common scheme designed to achieve an unlawful objective157 conscious parallelism is the term often given to uniform or synchronous business behavior which while prima face evidence of concerted behavior is not proof of unlawful agreement158 in 152 copperweld corp v independence tube corp 467 us 752

circumstances surrounding imposition by eight motions picture distributors of nearly identical restraints concerning the licensing of firstrun feature films were sufficient to create valid inference that the distributors had acted in concert in violation of section 1 of the sherman act it is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be and often is formed without simultaneous action or agreement on the part of the conspirators acceptance by competitors without previous agreement of an invitatio n to participate in plan the necessary consequence of which if carried out is rest raint of

behavior by itself is not necessarily proof of conspiracy the crucial question is whether respondents conduct toward petitioner stemmed from independent decision or from an agreement tacit or express to be sure business behavior is admissible circumstantial evidence from which the fact finder may find agreement but this court has never held that proof of parallel business behavior conclusively establishes agreement or phrased differently that such behavior itself constitutes sherman act offense circumstantial evidence of consciously parallel behavior may have made heavy inroads into the traditional judicial attitude toward conspiracy but conscious parallelism has not yet read conspiracy out of the sherman act entirely 160 although the supreme court has stated and lower court decisions have continued to illustrate that an unlawful agreement or conspiracy in restraint of trade may be proved by consciously parallel behavior that is accompanied by any of several plus factorsthe additional facts or factors required to be proved as prerequisite to finding that parallel action amounts to conspiracy 161there has not been much agreement or standardization concerning exactly which plus factors are to be given what if any evidentiary weight162 the plus factors courts have considered favorably include artificial standardization of products163 and raising prices in

at best ambiguous evidence of conspiracy166 the bottom line appears to be whether the parties acted in their own selfinterest where there is direct evidence of conspiracy be havior as consistent with desire to maintain profitability or to remain in business at all as with any participation in injurious or unlawful conduct does not constitute sufficient indirect evidence of an alleged conspiracy167 similarly where defendant would have little or motive to enter conspiracy his actions will be considered unilateral and independent 168 based upon these cases and assuming that there is evidence that the drug manufacturers in question conspired or colluded when reducing drug supplies to canadian distributors and pharmacies it would appear difficult to sustain charge that the drug companies that limit sales to canada have violated the sherman act indeed there may be lawful reasons for their actions for example the manufacturers may be capable of supplying only the united states market and to lesser extent foreign markets because of limited production capacity they may also need to recoup research and development costs by obtaining profit margin through sales primarily in the united states however if one were able to show that the drug companies did in fact conspire or collude or that they engaged in parallel behavior accompanied by other factors case might be made for sherman act violation in the first federal court case on the question in re canadian import antitrust litigation group of consumers and organizations from minne sota who purchased prescription drugs in the us from american drug companies challenged the defendant drug companies 169 the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants violated federal antitrust laws by engaging in course of conduct designed to suppress the importation of prescription drugs purchased from canadian pharmacies for personal use in the united states170 the district court held that prescription drugs imported from canada are misbranded and that the transport of drugs for personal use into the united states constitutes an introduction into interstate commerce 171 the introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce violates the fdca172 noting that the plaintiffs lacked standing 165 see eg greater rockford energy tech corp v shell oil co 998 f2d 391 7th cir 1993 carpet group international v oriental rug

because the importation of these drugs is unlawful and therefore not the type of activity which federal antitrust laws were designed to protect the district court dismissed the case173 the district court also dismissed the state and common law claims which were ancillary to the federal antitrust claim after deciding not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them174 on appeal the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed the district court judgment finding that the importation of prescription drugs from canada is illegal and that the plaintiffs did not have standing under antitrust laws to maintain the suit even if importation were legal according to the court th antitrust injury that the plaintiffs encounteredan absence of competition from canadian sources in the domestic prescription drug marketwas not result of the defendants behavior and was not an injury that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent rather the injury to the plaintiffs was caused by the federal statutory and regulatory scheme adopted by the united states government 175 although this decision is not binding on courts in other jurisdictions it provides an initial glimpse of how the antitrust issue may play out in the courts despite the apparent lack of violation of federal antitrust law drug manufacturers that limit sales of prescription drugs to canadian distributors

whether gsk violated minnesota antitrust laws179 filed court motion seeking to compel gsk to release information located in canada and the united kingdom about the companys decision to stop selling drugs to canadian pharmacies that then sell the drugs to us consumers according to the ag gsk conspired to limit drug sales to canada and gsks refusal to supply prescription drugs to canadian pharmacies that sell drugs to minnesota buyers violates state laws180 in reply gsk argued that importing drugs from canada is illegal and drug company can take steps to stop illegal sales of its products181 and also that federal law preempts minnesotas antitrust laws ultimately the district court of hennepin county minnesota ordered gsk to produce the records and information sought by the ag 182 the court ruled that even if gsks position that the importation of nonapproved drugs from canada is illegal under the fdca and there cannot be conspiracy in violation of the antitrust laws to restrain trade in illegal goods 183 were correct which the court questioned enforcement of fede ral law is the responsibility of the fda not of gsk especially since the fda has never even reviewed gsks boycott much less specifically approved it184 the district court judge obliquely addressed the preemption argument finding sufficient authority for the minnesota ags investigation and the document request in pursuit of that investigation under the minnesota statute that mandates that the attorney general investigate violations of the business and trade laws of this state 185 based on information revealed in the gsk documents that were turned over the minnesota ag filed lawsuit against gsk in 2004 alleging that the company had violated state antitrust laws186 gsk and the minnesota

feasibility of prescription drug importation on the one hand permitting some importation of prescription drugs may be seen as removing an existing barrier to trade or trade liberalizing on the other hand the united states international trade obligations may present obstacles to prescription drug importation furthermore legislative andor regulatory proposals regarding importation may be inconsistent with provisions of various international trade agreements including but not limited to the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1994 gatt 1994 the agreement on technical barriers to trade tbt and the general agreement on trade in services ga ts all of which are part of the world trade organization wto agreement to which the united states is signatory member 190 at the same time

contain provisions that may affect prescription drug imports generally article iii governs the application of domestic regulatory measures requiring that laws regulations and requirements affecting the internal sale offering for sale purchase transportation distribution or use of products should not be applied to domestic products so as to afford protection to domestic production article iii4 specifically obligates member countries with respect to all such domestic measures to provide national treatment to imported products from other wto member countries simply put national treatment requires that member countries not discriminate against imported goods relative to like domestic products in addition to the national treatment obligation internal regulatory measures are also required to comply with article i1 the mostfavorednation mfn clause mfn requires that any advantage favor privilege or immunity granted by any contracting party to any product originating in or destined for any other country shall be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the like product originating in or destined for the territories of all other contracting parties the inclusion of article iii measures within the article i1 mfn obligation was intended to extend the obligation to them regardless of whether national treatment is provided with respect to these matters 191 to the extent that any legislative or regulatory proposal contains requirements affecting the internal sale offering for sale purchase transportation distribution or use of prescription drugs in the united states it could be viewed as falling within the purview of article iii the provisions of article iii have been interpreted broadly with the use of the word affecting having been interpreted as implying that the drafters of the article intended it to apply to not only the laws 189 this section was written by todd b tatelman legislative attorney in the american law division of crs 190 it should be noted that many of the same issues raised in the wto context may also arise with respect to the north american free trade agreement nafta to which the united states canada and mexico are

or purchase but also in any law or regulations which might adversely modify the conditions of competition between the domestic and imported products in the international market192 given this broad interpretation it appears that any proposals containing provisions affecting the labeling of imported drugs193 or requiring that prescription drugs produced in foreign countries for importation be destined only for the united states may be interpreted by the wto as inconsistent with our national treatment and mfn obligations in addition to potential conflicts with articles iii4 and i1 gatt article xi1 prohibits member country from instituting or maintaining quantitative prohibitions or restrictions on the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party 194 the language of article xi has been interpreted to be comprehensive applying to all measures instituted or maintained by contracting party prohibiting or restricting the importation exportation of the products other than measures that take the form of taxes duties and charges 195 measures may fall within the scope of article xi1 if they prevent the importation of goods as such196 or affect the right of importation as such197 furthermore article xi1 requires that any quantitative restrictions that are imposed be instituted on nondiscriminatory basis in other words that all exports of like products to and imports of like products of third countries be similarly restricted or prohibited therefore to the extent that any legislative or regulatory proposal appears to prohibit or authorize proh ibitions on the importation of prescription drugs under specific circumstances there is possibility that the proposals may constitute or result in measure affecting importation as such and thus may be challenged under article xi1 article xx contains the general exceptions to the ga tt these general exceptions permit members to impose otherwise ga ttinconsistent measures to fulfill certain

characteristics of the product these product characteristics may be intrinsic or they may be related to the product they may be prescribed or imposed in either positive or negative form third compliance with the product characteristic must be mandatory 206 the tbt agreements primary obligations require that the central governments of wto members provide national treatment with respect to technical regulations207 in addition wto members must also ensure that technical regulations are not prepared adopted or applied with view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade208 this means that technical regulations shall be more traderestrictive than necessary to fulfil legitimate objective taking account of the risks nonfulfillment would create such legitimate objectives include the prevention of deceptive practices and protection of human health or safety moreover members are obligated not to maintain technical regulations if the circumstances or objectives giving rise to their adoption longer exist or if the changed circumstances or objectives can be addressed in less traderestrictive manner 209 conformity assessment procedure is any procedure used directly or indirectly to determine that relevant requirements in technical regulations or standards are fulfilled210 such procedures may include among other things procedures for sampling testing and inspection evaluation verification and assurance of conformity registration accreditation and approval as well as their combinations obligations concerning conformity assessment procedures are primarily contained in article 5 of the tbt agreement which requires wto members to ensure that number of specific requirements are met where positive assurance of conformity with technical regulations is required211 these include requirement that the procedures be prepared adopted and applied in accordance with the principles of national treatment212 the tbt agreement further provides that access entails suppliers right to an assessment of conformity under the rules of the procedure213 in addition conformity assessment procedures may not be prepared adopted or applied with view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade214 meaning among other things that conformity assessment procedures shall not be more strict or be applied more strictly than is necessary to give the importing member adequate 206 appellate body report on european communitiestrade description of sardines wtds231abr september 26 2002 176 207 see tbt agreement

regulations taking account of the risks nonconformity would create215 application of the tbt agreement will depend on the details of any prescription drug importation program that might be enacted the ab has speculated that measure consisting only of prohibition on product might not constitute technical regulation thereby placing it outside the scope of the tbt agreement216 on the other hand measure that has both prohibitive and permissive elements may potentially be covered by the agreement217 if legislative or regulatory proposal were to be considered solely in light of provisions that would allow importation of drugs from limited set of approved countries the proposal could potentially be viewed as constituting solely prohibition albeit implied on importing prescription drugs from countries other than thos named or designated as such one might thus be able to argue based on the abovequoted ab statement that there are issues under the tbt agreement on the other hand were any such proposal to be viewed more broadlythat is as having both prohibitive and permissive elementstbt obligations may come into play while the tbt agreement does not contain separate article with general exceptions there is language within the agreement that appears to pr ovide for something similar to an article xxb exception specifically the preamble to the tbt agreement states that country should be prevented from taking measures necessary for th protection of human animal or plant life or health 218 given that there has been wto panel or ab ruling to date with respect to this language it remains unclear as to what if any weight or interpretation this language would be given especially considering it appears only in the preamble and is not within the body of the agreement

the issue of prescription drug importation crossborder supply or supply from the territory of one member into the territory of any other member mode 1 and consumption abroad or supply in the territory of one member to the service consumer of any other member mode 2221 for purposes of the gats the phrase measures by members affecting trade in services has been interpreted broadly encompassing any

governs the supply of service or whether it regulates other matters but nevertheless affects trade in services222 basic obligation of the gats is the unconditional mostfavorednation mfn obligation set forth at article ii1 the obligation applies to any ga tscovered measure though members are allowed to exempt specific national measures pursuant to article ii1 and the annex on article ii exemptions and may accord preferential treatment to countries that are members of regional trade agreements see gats arts v and v bis the other fundamental ga ts obligations are the market access and national treatment obligations made with respect to members specific scheduled sectoral commitments 223 these are set forth with any limitations in the members schedule of specific commitments by mode of service supply as with the tbt agreement application of the gats will depend on the details of any specific prescription drug importation that might be enacted for example in the event that legislative or regulatory proposal affects the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs the measure may be subject to wto challenge as inconsistent with our specific ga ts commitments gats obligations are also subject to various general exceptions at article xiv including one for measures necessary to protect human animal or plant life or health general exceptions are subject to requirement that such measures are not applied in manner which would constitute means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where like conditions prevail or disguised restriction on trade in services while there does not appear to be any wto jurisprudence on this exception to date it would seem that the same or similar test as the gatt article xxb exception would also be applicable with respect to the ga ts article xiv it should be noted however that the ga ts contains the phrase like conditions as opposed to the phrase same conditions found in the gatt in the absence of any wto jurisprudence it remains unclear whether this change in language would have any effect on the application of the exception 224 g18g138g157g142g151g157g561g14g138g160g561 in addition to raising questions about antitrust law and trade law the issue of prescription drug imports has also prompted inquiries regarding whether or not drug importation program would violate patent rights in particular federal court case jazz photo corp v itc 225 has raised the prospect that drug manufacturer could under certain circumstances sue drug importer for patent infringement and block us imports of drugs the company sells abroad under patent law the first sale of patented product in given market extinguishes or exhausts the patent 222 panel report on ecregime for the importation sale

affected by the change 224 should the united states take any legislative or regulato ry action with respect to the importation of prescription drugs any challenges that are brought on international trade grounds will be required to be adjudicated under the procedures set forth in the specific agreement for example if challenge is brought pursuant to wto agreement that challenge will be required

in the product prior to the jazz photo decision some legal commentators believed that this exhaustion doctrine extended internationally meaning that the sale of patented product abroad would exhaust the patent rights in the us and elsewhere thereby allowing the purchaser of the product to use sell or otherwise do as he pleases with the product without regard to the patent holder unless the purchaser is contractually restricted from importing into the us in jazz photo however the court which addressed the exhaustion doctrine question only briefly stated united states patent rights are not exhausted by products of foreign provenance to invoke the protection of the first sale doctrine the authorized first sale must have occurred under the united states patent226 under this ruling because the us patent is not exhausted by the foreign sale the patent holder retains its patent rights thus drug manufacturer could exercise these rights to block imports of its patented drug products into the us it is important to note however that some legal commentators have questioned the validity of the ruling in the jazz photo case and bills proposed in the 109 th and 110th congresses would have overturned the ruling with respect to patent exhaustion for pharmaceutical imports227 for further information on the subject see crs report rl32400 patents and drug importation by john r thomas

imported drugs many us consumers in search of affordable prices continue to purchase and import such drugs as result legislators and interest groups have suggested variety of changes to current law including encouraging the development of more generic drugs negotia ting lower drug prices through bulk purchase programs increasing prescription drug insuranc coverage lowering copays allowing drug imports but restricting ports of entry establishing state pilot programs allowing only certain drugs to be imported educating consumers about the dangers of imported drugs allowing drug imports from
