these fees commonly referred to as dishonour fees are charged for rejected cheques debit orders and stop orders the analysis concentrates on the fees charged by the major banks for rejected debit orders an area where there are clear indications of growing ab use the amount of revenue of almost r1 billion of about r11 billion noninterest revenue for personal transaction accounts that was generated by the big four banks in 2006 from around 24 million dishonoured or rejected transactions is highlighted in our view the abuse of debit order dishonour fees need s to be addressed without

against the background of competition law it is necessary to highlight some of the reasons for the enactment of the competition act in south africa and its purpose as well as the functions of the south african competition commission where these may be relevant to this enquiry 12 the act and the commission the competition act 89 of 1998 was enacted in order to provide all south africans equal opportunity to participate fairly in the national economy achieve more effect ive and efficient economy in south africa provide for markets in which consumers have acce ss to and can freely select the quality and variety of goods and services they desire create greater capability and an environment to compete effectively in international markets restrain particular trade practices which undermine competitive economy regulat the transfer of economic ownership in keeping with the public interest establish independent institutions to monitor economic competition and give effect to the international law obligations of the republic1 the purpose of the act is to promote and maintain competition in the republic in order to promote efficiency adaptability and development of the economy b to provide consumers with competitive prices and product choices c to promote employment and advance the social and economic welfare of south africans d to expand opportunities for south african participation in world markets and recognise the role of foreign competition in the republic 1 preamble of the competition act banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 1 enquiry process 4 to ensure that small and mediumsized enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in the economy and f to promote greater spread of ownership in particular to increase the ownership stakes of historically disadvantaged persons2 some of the functions of the competition commission hereinafter referred to as the commission are i to implement measures to increase market transparency ii to implement measures to develop public awareness of the provisions of the act iii to investigate and evaluate alleged contraventions of certain listed prohibited practices iv to refer matters to the competition tribunal and to appear before the tribunal v over time to review legislation and public regulations and to report to the minister concerning any provision that permits uncompetitive behavior 3 in addition to these functions the commission may also vi report to the minister on any matter relating to the application of the act vii enquire into and report to the minister on any matter concerning the purposes of the act viii perform any other function assigned to it in terms of this or any other act4 to obtain better understanding of the establishment of the enquiry it is important to sketch some of the events leading up to its launch 13 historical perspective 131 the task group report during may 2003 task group5 was established by the national treasury to undertake study on the competitiveness of the south african banking industry this report entitled competition in south african banking was released in april 2004 it is not the intention of the panel to deal in great detail with the task groups report save to highlight any recommendations that were made that may be relevant to the subsequent decision s made by the commission in the establishment of this enquiry6 2 section 2 of the act 3 these functions are listed amongst others in section 21 1 to l of the act 4 section 212 of the act 5 members of this task group were dr hans falkena chairman mr gabriel davel dr penelope hawkins mr david llewellyn mr christo luus mr elias masilela mr geoff parr mr johnny pienaar and mr henry shaw 6 the full recommendations of the task group are contained in cha pter 12 of the task group report banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 1 enquiry process 5 some of the recommendations made by the task group were that access by second tier banks to the payment system on competitive terms sh ould be facilitated interoperability in the payment system and transparency of access requirements should be extended penalty fees charges for essential services or charges for services not open to competition should be on costplus basis and open to regulatory oversight government should prohibit any preferential processing mechanisms for payments the competition commission should investigate the possibility of complex monopoly in the governance and operation of the payments system following on these recommendations of the task group the commission reach ed decision that more comprehensive and comparative study into the issues around the payment system was essential feasibility pty ltd an economic research company headed by dr penelope hawkins and prof olu akinboade of unisa were appoin ted to provide such study with distinct areas of work being specified to each of the parties7 this report has become known as the feasibility report 132 the feasibility report the feasibility research report titled the national payment system and competition in the banking sector was completed and handed to the competition commissioner during march 2006 in the commissions response to the report8 which will be dealt with in more detail hereinafter the commission stated that the feasibility report presented comprehensive analysis of the national payment system nps the commission went on to s ay that the report revealed that the south african nps is highly efficient and sound system and perhaps more advanced than similar networks in more economically developed countries but an efficient and sound system may nevertheless lack features which could ensure fairness as far as consumers are concerned the feasibility report highlighted the following regarding the state of the banking industry at the time of the report the banking industry earned roughly 38 per cent of its revenue from fees related to the payment system any link that there might be between the operating costs associated with payment transaction and the charges made by banks for that 7 the main body of the report presents the research effort s of feasibility while the research annex dealing with international comparisons is the work of prof akinboade 8 the commissions official response is set out in the press statement release to the media on the 20 april 2006 which statement is available on the enquirys website huwwwcompcomcozabanking uh banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 1 enquiry process 6 transaction was not transparent it thus might be the case that bank fees have less to do with the cost of the payment system and more to do with the market po wer of the big banks in setting fees not only the clearing banks but also those that participate under the auspices of the clearing banks in the nps appeared to find their activities in that regard very profitable indeed this might explain the clamour of others to gain access only the samos system9 within the nps operated by the reserve bank and limited to participation by registered banks appeared to work on cost recovery basis apart from samos the pricing arrangements for each payment stream within the nps fell outside the remit of regulation and it was believed that in the past these had been negotiated between participants on multilateral basis while some smaller players were concerned that bilateral negotiations might place them at disadvantage as they wielded so little ma rket power it seemed possible that bilateral negotiations might benefit the consumer further inquiry regarding the pricing arrangements in each payment stream seemed to be warranted there might well be aspects of the nps where uniform pricing could give way to competitive pricing without compromising the soundness or efficiency of the system the banks operated switching arrangement between themselves called bankserv although bankserv costs made up only fraction of the price of payment transaction the current profitability of bankserv and the control and ownership of this essential infrastructure by the banks raises the question of broader representati on on the board of bankserv there was international precedent for this there was an absence of market conduct regulation throughout the banking industry and the nps in particular there was also an absence of transparency disclosed pricing is often difficult to evaluate because of bundled offerings in country where there was an obvious need to improve the access of underserved consumers to financial services the absence of market conduct regulator was likely to be particularly keenly felt legislation and regulation have focused on banks this had left regulatory gap in terms of the rules of participation for nonbanks and highlighted the need for an overall strategy to the extent that collaborative infrastructure and uniform pricing is necessary for sustaining sound and efficient nps for the benefit of consumers there might also be need for regulatory oversight 133 the competition commissions response for the commission the feasibility report raised number of concerns the main ones being the concerns around access to the payment system by wouldbe service providers 9 see glossary for explanation of the samos system chapter 1 enquiry process 7 10 see press statement released by the commission on the 20th april 2006 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information banks and nonbanks and charges levied by banks for payment transactions both of these impacted on access to competitive banking services for south african consumers b they businesses or individuals 10 the commission was furthermore of the opinion that while the feasibility study provid ed detailed understanding of how the system works in general it did not extend to indicating whether or not actual contraventions of the competition act were entailed in the current structure and operation of the national payment system having regard to its responsibilities and powers the commission decid ed to conduct public enquiry in order to obtain further information and input about the c ompetition concerns highlighted in the feasibility report in its announcement the commission stated that such an enquiry was t be held in terms of section 211 of the competition act which gives the competition commission the responsibility to implement measures to increase market transparency section 212b empowers the commission to enquire into and report to the minister of trade and industry on any matter concerning the promotion and maintenance of competition in the republic the commission invited all interested persons and stakeholders including the bank s to respond to the feasibility report and voluntarily to provide detailed information and answers on relevant questions to the enquiry the commission pointed out that the enquiry would be on the record which would be made public subject only to the protection of genuinely confidential information as provided for in the competition act the commission envisaged that public hearings would be held and that the views of regulators and other overseeing authorities would also be sought and considered during the course of the enquiry the outcome of the process would be report with recommendations being submitted to the commissioner after this announcement the commission began to take steps to have t he enquiry established as it was the first time that the commission had undertaken an enquiry of this nature the commission looked to other jurisdictions for guidance and assistance chapter 1 enquiry process 8 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 14 visit to the united kingdom in

interacted regularly with officials from the central bank hm treasury and industry through working groups there are valuable lessons to be learned here on how to establish representative forum to bring about voluntary compliance with certain recommendations this approach may prove useful in implementing some of the recommendations arising from th enquiry panels report the delegation also held discussions with oft officials regarding their investigations into interchange fees of fourparty payment card schemes the meeting with the uk competition commission proved to be most benefici insofar

where these raised matters that fall within the jurisdiction of the ombudsman for banking services they should be referred by the commission to that office many of the submissions from business entities were made under claims of c onfidentiality in terms of sections 44 45 and 45a of the competition act we did not deem it necessary to challenge the confidentiality claims as they did not impede the enquiry in its work the commission will need to ensure that confidential information is placed in the public domain the submissions are not deal with in any detail in this chapter as they are discus sed under the relevant subject headings in subsequent chapters the commission and the panel have from the outset maintained that th enquiry would be public and that all submissions unless covered by claims of confidentiality would be made available to the public as many of the submissions had been made under claim s of confidentiality public disclosure of the submissions presented challenge to the enquiry the enquiry was greatly assisted in surmounting this by many of the banks and card associations who provided the enquiry with nonconfidential versions of th eir submissions which the enquiry was able to make available to the public on the enquirys website on receipt all submissions were briefly analysed by the enquirys tec hnical team and where necessary the stakeholders making such submissions were asked to ve rify clarify and amplify the submissions thereafter in consultation with the pan selected organisations were then invited to appear before the panel at the first p ublic hearings chapter 1 enquiry process 20 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 110 first public hearings during the course of the enquiry the panel held two sets of public hearings the fi rst being during november 2006 and the second in the period april to july 2007 in t otal 21 days of public hearings were held by the panel during the existence of the enquiry the first public hearings november 2006 afforded selected stakeholders an opportunity to make public presentations regarding their submissions and organisation only part ies who had furnished the enquiry with written submissions by the closing date of t he 27th october 2006 and who had been specifically requested by the enquiry to appear were entitled to appear to make oral presentations at these first public hearings the panel reserved the right to invite other persons to appear if it considered that their appearance w ould assist the enquiry in an attempt to increase public awareness and greater participation by the stakehold ers in the process the enquiry held these first set of public hearings in several cities and as f ar as was reasonably possible the enquiry attempted to arrange venues that were most convenient to stakeholders wishing to make presentations the enquiry also rese rved the right to expand the hearings to other cities if the number of submission re ceived justified such decision the first hearings were held on the dates and in the cities set out hereafter 1st to 3rd november 2006 pretoria 9th november 2006 pretoria 13th november 2006 cape town 29th november 2006 durban 30th november 2006 pretoria to ensure that stakeholders understood the enquirys adopted procedure fo r its first public hearings and to assist stakeholders in presenting their submissions at such hearings the enquiry released further set of guidelines dealing with the first public hearings the guidelines provided for the orderly conduct of the hearings to be held in public exceptions to this would only occur if the panel decided to conduct any portion th ereof in private involving subject matter in respect of which claim of confidentiality had been made or if the panel considered that such decision was necessary for the effective conduct of the enquiry the nature of these presentations was such that the invited parties we re to provide the panel with an introduction to the organisation itself and then enlighten the panel on how they had dealt with or were dealing with the issues that are the subject matter of t he enquiry chapter 1 enquiry process 21 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information these presentations were to be one hour of duration with parties being expected to summarise and highlight the main thrust of their submissions the general rule at the public hearings was that only the panel members would b entitled to put questions directly to anyone making submission or presentation and any deviation from this rule would only be allowed if the panel was of the opinion that compelling reasons existed for doing so all proceedings at the hearings were recorded and transcribed and subject again to the preservation of confidentiality provided for in the terms of reference all transcripts of the hearings were made available on the enquirys website as soon as was reasonably possible by the enquiry manager at the time of these hearings the panel had not had an opportunity to read the detailed submissions made by the banks and thus the presentations made were not probed in great detail by the panel at these first hearings the panels interaction with th ose appearing was mainly intended to clarify and test at general level the significance and relia bility of the presentations made the panel made every effort to deal with the substantial merits of the issues with minimum of legal formalities and thus all proceedings were conducted i n an informal manner all those appearing before the panel were however entitled to assistance when they presented their submissions and although all the hearings were conducted in english interpretation services were made available to any party desiring such service the first to be given the opportunity to make presentations were the bank s and card associations followed by consumer groups and members of the public as was the case with the banks only those consumer groups and members of the public who furnished the enquiry with written submissions were afforded the opportunity to make presentations full details of all the parties that appeared and made presentations at thes first public hearings are reflected in the appendix entitled november 2006 hearings schedule chapter 1 enquiry process 22 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 111 further analysis and engagement after the completion of the first public hearings the focus of the enquiry shifte d from the procedural to the analytical with the panel and the technical team commencing with the task of analysing the submissions made by all parties in greater detail and attempting to identify the main issues of concern from competition law and policy perspect ive detailed schedule of technical meetings between the technical team and the b anks card associations and other identified stakeholders with the aim of obtaining better understanding of the submissions received was drawn up and followed where the technical team was of the opinion that additional information was required questionnaires were prepared and forwarded to stakeholders to enable th em to clarify or amplify any portion of submissions received or any other matter that the technica l team considered to be in need of such clarification or amplification supplementary submissions were also requested stakeholders were also in oneonone meetings requested to clarify any aspect of their presentations and submissions stakeholders were also encouraged to make supplementary submissions in response to any issue raised during the course of the enquiry 112 second public hearings unlike the first public hearings held in november 2006 the second set of public hearings focused mainly on specific subject matters that had been identified by the nquiry as requiring further airing in public the subject matters that the enquiry had initially identified were atm charging and related issues payment cards and interchange fees access to the national payment system market power and the level and structure of bank charges the enquiry extended invitations to specific parties to appear before the panel and t make brief presentations and answer questions on the specific subject matter being dealt wit h at the time only parties who had been specifically requested by the enquiry appeared at these second and final hearings such parties were given the opportunity to mak supplementary submissions on any relevant issue andor in response to any allegation made by any party whether in submission or at the first public hearings chapter 1 enquiry process 23 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the hearings into each of the subject matters commenced with the enquirys technical team making presentation that provided an overview on the subject matter the technical team presentations attempted to identify the main areas of concern in respect of each of the topics and such areas of concern were crossreferenced with submissions regulations and even academic material on the subject matter for the panel the greatest challenge surrounding these second hearing s was how to deal in public forum with all the confidential information contained in the original and supplementary submissions the questionnaires sent out by the technical team had requested detailed disclosure of further data and all the major banks had indicated that they would be claiming confidentiality over large proportion of their responses the smooth running of the enquiry would clearly be affected if disruptive situation arose where the hearing room was being constantly cleared to deal with confidential informatio n and then reconvened and perhaps only to be cleared again in addressing this issue the panel adopted the approach that the enquiry was public process and any stakeholder requesting deviation from this position had to specifically request that the panel hear them in closed session the enquiry acknowledges the co operation received from the parties appearing at these second hearings who i n general agreed to the hearings being conducted in public during the entire hearings process the public was excluded on one occasion only16 the details of the second

banking enquiry stated in paragraph 6c of its terms of reference was to engage with the banks other providers of payment services the appropria regulatory authorities and other stakeholders in order to ascertain the extent t which consistent with the soundness of the banking and payments system there could r ealistically be improvements in the conditions affecting competition in the relevant markets including increased access to the national payments infrastructure with this in mind the enquiry panel requested the technical team to arra nge meetings with banks and other relevant stakeholders in order to explore the feasibility and practical implications of certain possible recommendations andor changes which were mooted in public hearings and which could come to fo rm part of the eventual recommendations of the panel these exploratory meetings focused on three distinct topics proposed change to direct charging for atm transactions and greater access for additional including nonbank atm service providers the introduction of an independent objective and transparent process for determining interchange in all payment streams in which interchange is necessary combination of measures to improve the ability of bank customers not only to compare product offerings and prices but also to switch providers with the minimum of cost and difficulty the possible measures to be considered here in cluded the availability of one or more basic banking product bundles participation in the process did not commit any participant to support or endorse any particular change or measure which was mooted for exploration nor was the process or its topics taken to imply definite findings or recommendations by the enquiry panel it was emphasised that nothing said at those meetings would be considered as being on the record chapter 1 enquiry process 25 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information of the enquiry unless specifically advanced and recorded as an ontherecord statement at the instance of or by agreement with the participant concerned series of exploratory meetings were arranged on the 15th august 3rd and 4th september and 30th october 2007 these were attended by representatives of banks system operators card schemes consumer groups and retailers the process contributed to further understanding of the topics through both oral debates and working documents for discussion that remained off the record the understanding so gained has been drawn upon to varying degrees in this report the completion of the exploratory meetings generally marked the end of engagem ents and interactions by the panel and technical team with stakeholders the enquiry team then focussed its attention on the writing of this report having provided an overview of the enquiry process we deal with t he subject of market power in the subsequent chapter in the panels opinion banks market power has bearing on every facet of

commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 2 market power 28 21 introduction and synopsis 211 competitive banks or banking cartel banks maintain that they compete vigorously with each other1 popular suspicion on the other hand is that banks are cartel2 where does the truth lie we have come to the conclusion generally that banks in south africa operate n ot as cartel but rather as oligopolists3 that maximise their profits by avoiding outright price competition where they can4 although competing for customers in other ways and by taking advantage of the degree to which customers once recruited become locked in to particular bank it is by differentiated product offerings and complicated pricing structures rather than by combining to fix prices that banks ensure the high profitability of their rvices the cost and trouble involved in switching banks further weakens the competitive effect of price differences where those can be identified by customers and allows supracompet itive pricing to be maintained at the same time because banking is closelyknit industry with relatively fe w players and because so much of banking revolves round payment transactions banks are constantly dealing with each other and must get together frequently at high level to discuss and agree on issues concerning interoperability in the payment system banks know gr eat deal about each other and are wellplaced to shadow each others business strategies as well as to set rules and conditions collectively favouring themselves consumers as well as wouldbe competitors are vulnerable to the effects of decisions made by the incumbent banks or their representatives behind closed doors we have tried during the enquiry to gain clear understanding of the payment s ystem in order to identify any respects in which banks may be overstepping the bounds of legitimacy in their interbank arrangements or in which actual or potential abuses may warrant intervention under the competition or consumer protection laws or action by the banking and payment system regulators while concluding generally that banks do not perate as 1 standard bank october 2006 first submission p 8 frbs ce mr nxasana said we believe that competition in the financial services industry is intense and banks and other playe rs complete vigorously transcript 9 november 2006 p 5 nedbanks mr shuter said so what is our perspectiv on the level of competition i can certainly say i having been involved in retail banking now for two years that ur experience is that the industry is very competitive transcript 2 november 2006 p 25 absas mr booysen said the fact that banks have been willing to facilitate entry by nonbanks is an indication of the competitiveness of the bank ing industry then the ceo states competition between the various players in the market becomes quite notice able when one considers the impact of competition on innovation performance and access transcript 30 november 2006 pp 56 10 2 essentially cartel is combination of producers that fixes pri ces or otherwise deliberately restricts output and competition 3 as distinct from monopoly with single supplier the monop olist market dominated by few large suppliers is characterised as an oligopoly and those suppliers as oligop olists the significance of this is discussed below 4 see appendix on complex monopoly collective dominance an d tacit collusion banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 2 market power 29 cartel we have found number of particular instances and aspects where in ur view the conduct of banks and others in the payment system does require such action or intervention these matters are addressed in detail in subsequent chapters of this report 212 personal transa ction accounts ptas our focus in the present chapter is on whether or not banks have significant market power in the provision of personal transaction accounts ptas and related pay ment services and if so what can be done to reduce it market power essentially means the ability of firm to sustain its prices above the level that would prevail in competitive market5 for reasons explained below we have come to the conclusion that the major banks at ast do indeed have significant market power in the provision of ptas and related payment services by ptas we mean the ordinary current accounts and transmission accounts savings accounts with transactional facilities that are used by individual consumers6 the terms of reference of the enquiry are specifically concerned with the payment services aspect of retail banking and ptas are central in this regard the traditional role of the bank from consumers perspective is to len d money and to invest savings however having bank account also allows the consumer to plug into the national payment system and as such enables and facilitates economic activi ty in number of areas for example consumers make use of payment services whenever they pay rates taxes purchase items with credit or debit card and otherwise receive or make payments other than in cash for the unbanked there are considerable costs and risks asso ciated with the handling of cash by being able to rely on bank deposits and draw on funds to receive cash or make payments as required individuals can manage their money mor safely and efficiently and become financially empowered without bank account and access to payment services it would be difficult if not impossible for an individual to participate effectively in any modern economy to day bank account is usually required in the formal economy in order to receive wages and salaries make wide variety of routine payments and access savings and credit faci lities there are currently real alternatives for individuals and businesses that want to partic ipate in the formal economy most employers insist on depositing salaries electronically into employees bank accounts and many other payments are made via debit orders and other electronic payment systems credit facilities including home loans are generally only available to those able to service the debt via transaction account 5 the concept of market power is discussed below 6 the expression transmission account arose historically to des cribe an account on which the accountholder may carry out payment transactions without using cheque it thus refers essentia lly to savings accounts as distinct from current or cheque accounts term deposit accounts of course are not transaction accounts at all banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 2 market power 30 banking thus plays central role in the economic life of society lack of effective competition in banking and payment services has far reaching consequences for consumers and the economy at large it not only raises the cost to consumers of managing their money and making or receiving payments it also drives wedge into wider areas of economic activity by introducing inefficiencies and raising transaction costs f or both individual consumers and businesses 213 structural concentration in the market for ptas the market for ptas and related payment services is highly concentrated the four largest banks absa standard bank fnb and nedbank the big four together supply more than 90 per cent of this market barriers to entry by additional firms and barriers to their competitive expansion are high the market for ptas in south africa as well as the market for most other retail banking services can be characterised as an oligopoly with fringe of sm aller players even important fringe players such as capitec have not to date posed serious competitive threat to the big four banks in their established market although there is potent ial for greater competition from innovative firms like capitec as well as other banks and nonbank players in the payment system the extent to which they can impose an effectiv competitive constraint on the big four banks across the retail market will depend on whether existing restrictions on competition both on the supply side and the demand side can be effectively addressed the reality remains however that the cost structure of retail banking high fix ed and common costs drives concentration in banking and places certain limits on the exte nt of competition economies of scale and scope are of vital importance to an eve r increasing extent therefore retail banking has become volume business in which even mediumsized enterprises find it difficult to succeed the concentration of banks produces an oligopoly structure which facilitates strategic interaction among the participants an d obstructs competitive outcomes the individual customer becomes and feels like statistic with the evergrowing volume and sophistication of payments in the mo dern economy banks have naturally extended their traditional deposittaking and lending functions into the provision of payment services linked to bank accounts banks revenues and profits have increasingly come to reflect their activities and dominant role in the payment system at the same time technological innovations are creating new possibilities for smaller firms to operate successfully in providing various payment services or components of payment services that are not intrinsically dependent on deposittaking faced with this challenge banks will naturally seek to leverage their strategic advantage as providers of ptas which combine payment services with deposit and credit facilities elsewhere in this report w deal extensively with the need to open up access to the payment system on carefully regulated banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 2 market power 31 basis to qualified nonbank service providers 7 in competing with each other for pta customers banks recognise the unde rlying threat to their profits posed by the essential homogeneity of the services which they provide the processes involved in the banks operation of transaction accounts and paymen t services on mass scale are increasingly standardised and automated thanks to new t echnology this relentless commoditisation of banking services brings with it vulnerability of banks to intensified price competition and to the erosion of profit levels even in highly concentrated market to counteract this vulnerability and to preserve market power incumbent banks typically resort to measures which serve as buffers against price competition by these measures and by avoiding challenges to each other which could end up spoiling the game for all the banking oligopolists are able to sustain supracompetitive pricing and profits especially in segments of the consumer market judged able to bear the burden these measures and the resulting dynamics are explored in further detail in t his chapter below here brief outline must suffice 214 product differentiat ion and price complexity to keep essentially homogeneous products or services differentiated so that their prices are not readily compared by consumers is considerable art from consumer welfare perspective of course there are advantages and disadvantages arising from product differentiation on the one hand it allows suppliers to serve variety of consumer needs through differentiated offerings on the other hand however it complicate s choices for the many consumers who are really looking for something quite simple and uniform our argument is not against product differentiation per for that would risk inhibiting the development of innovations that would benefit consumers however we find that in current banking practice much of what passes for product differentiation arises from different combinations of product features and different pricing structures and not from intrinsic differences in the product features themselves the incumbent fullservice ba nks all offer the same set of accountholding and transaction facilities it is the manner in which these facilities are bundled packaged and priced which varies from bank to bank we fi nd that this unnecessarily complicates choices for consumers and thus weakens price competition we believe that there is need for simplified offerings that can be readily compared in both price and content across the banks and thus be subject to more direct price competition the information contained in the chapter on costing and pricing substantiates this 7 see the chapter on access to the payment system chapter 2 market power 32 8 see discussion below on switching and switching costs banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 215 information asymmetries information asymmetry describes the situation in which one party to cont ract has the advantage of having more information than the other so that the latter is effectively in the dark when weighing up the likely costs and benefits of the deal there are considerable information asymmetries in the market for ptas and related services which tend to benefit the banks but are detrimental to consumers these asymmetries arise not only from the complexity already described but also from inadequate transparency and disclosure in respect of the features and pricing of transactional banking products further each bank uses its own terminology and nomenclature to describe its products and related product features and fees this makes it very difficult for consumers to understand and assess the different offerings of the banks as consequence the great majority of consumers do not actively investigate what they are paying in bank fees nor do they respond readily to changes in prices by seeking out an alternative provider this is an important factor conferring on banks an appreciable degree of market power over their customers 216 switching and search costs we have found that the cost to customers of switching banks including the search co sts in finding an alternative are generally enough to create significant degree of customer captivity and so confer on banks an appreciable degree of market power we were able to quantify the minimum objective costs likely to be incurred by customers when switching typical transactional account from one bank to another acc ording to our calculations total switching costs as percentage of the net present value of average annual banking costs over three years are likely on conservative estimate to be well in excess of 5 per cent8 we have concluded that on the basis of these switching costs alone the market power of each bank is appreciable as each bank is in position to impose small but significant nontransitory increase in price without losing its cus tomers customers would have to find an alternative bank which is substantially cheaper than their ow n and likely to remain so in order to justify the expenditure of time and money in switching to switching costs must be added the search costs of finding suitab substitute in addition to problems of transparency and disclosure the greatest obstacle faced by consumers in the search process lies in the difficulty of making meaningful comparisons across the product offerings of the banks we found that there is uniformity in the manner in which the packaged offerings are structured and priced it is therefore impossi ble to make direct price comparisons between the offerings without having to input detailed information about the transactional behaviour of the prospective customer and then perform fairly chapter 2 market power 33 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information lengthy calculations based on the different pricing formulas of the banks in their submissions the banks themselves have argued that price is not the most important factor influencing consumer choice and that consumers are driven by other considerat ions in selecting bank and product offering while the quality of service may well differ competitively as between banks we do not consider such differences to be dramatic or fundamental the evidence presented here suggests that the overriding reason consumers do not make choices primarily on the basis of price is that the cost and effort required to make such determination with any accuracy is simply prohibitive f or the great majority of consumers this reinforces customer inertia when it comes to changing banks and accentuates the degree of market power that banks have inertia is not difficult to account for even though expressions of discontent are widespread consumers in particu lar those who depend on range of banking and payment services provided by the fullservice banks have little reason to conclude that they would be substantially better off by switchin g this is certainly not because prices are at keenly competitive level 217 lack of effective price compet ition in an oligopolistic market we find that appreciable customer inertia having regard to all the underlying reasons for it tends to facilitate price shadowing behaviour between the banks while ince ntives for competitive price cutting tend to be mitigated further due to the interban k arrangements which underlie the various transaction services generally speaking at least within established market segments banks tend to set their fees within close enough range of each other such that none would be likely to impinge greatly on the market share of the other their conduct is in that sense rational behaviour of oligopolists who stand to gain more in the medium and longer term if they refrain from competing prices do wn in the short term for the sake of temporary gains in market share in the rapidly expanding lowerincome market for basic banking services interbank competition is keener9 but the incumbents have been careful not to allow this to erode the surplus accruing to them in the more established parts of the retail mark et the segmentation of which they are astute to maintain in our view that is the main reason f or their resolute resistance to the idea of basic banking product or products to be offered to the entire market in order to facilitate comparison and intensify price competition across t he board the analysis of banks pricing and costing data in the next chapter of this re port reveals the absence of any identifiable relationship between the prices of ptas and related services and the costs to the banks of providing them this is not what one would expect in market characterised by effective price competition 9 given that banks seek to capture new customers through their entry lev offerings chapter 2 market power 34 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information clear evidence that banks prices in major part of the market have continued rising or have not been lowered significantly while there has been sustained rise in customer and transaction volumes accompanied by sustained fall in average total costs i unit costs satisfies us that the banks do not in fact subject each other to effective price competition the fall in unit costs has simply provided the basis for increased profit whereas in competitive market prices would have come down markedly this combination of factors leads us to conclude that banks the major or fullservice banks specifically have an appreciable degree of market power over their ordinary customers in the provision of ptas and related services throughout the country and that they do exercise that power in keeping prices above levels that effective competition would dictate 218 recommendations to the extent that these problems are rooted in the conditions which produce banking concentration global as well as south african phenomenon they are not suscepti ble to being resolved fundamentally by any recommendations that we can make here however there are number of particular changes that can be made which would serv to improve competitive conditions many of them are presented and explained in the subsequent chapters of this report in this chapter we concentrate on remedies that we believe would stimulate price competition between banks in the provision of ptas and related services we recommend combination of measures aimed at improving the ability of bank customers to compare product offerings and prices and aimed at enhancing their ability to switch providers with minimum of cost and difficulty these involve codes of conduct and other measures to ensure greater transparency and disclosure of product and price information by banks to reduce search costs and improve comparability of products and services to reduce switching costs and assist consumers in the process of switching we recommend that the role of the ombudsman for banking services be expanded to include enforcement and monitoring of compliance with the proposed codes of co nduct for information disclosure and switching 22 the meaning of market power in the technical sense says the american antitrust scholar herber t hovenkamp market power is firms ability to deviate from marginal cost pricing further marginal cost or competitive pricing is an important goal of the antitrust laws marginal cost i s therefore useful base from which to measure market power the greater the ratio of firms profit maximizing price to its chapter 2 market power 35 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information marginal cost the more market power the firm has10 this view based on the lerner index looks at performance of th firm rather than industry concentration levels to assess market power11 one must however take care in applying this concept by marginal cost or competitive pricing prof hovenkamp is referring to what usually takes place under perfect competition marginal cost is the additional cost incurred by firm when increasing its output by one unit of the product concerned since firms fixed costs remain unchanged at that point marginal cost will consist entirely of the increment in variable costs under perfect competition the market price is set by the intersection of the industry demand and supply curves for the individual firm this is typically where mr marginal revenue12 mc marginal cost and will be at the minimum of the average total cost curve in the long run being price takers all such firms have ability to exercise market power over the industry price when seeking to apply this concept of market power under conditions of imperfect competition or monopolistic competition or oligopolistic competition one looks for indications of firms ability to price their goods and services above the level w hich over the medium to longer term would return normal profit to an efficient pr oducer in short one tries to determine whether or not competition is effective in the relevant market rather than whether it is perfect or not in the hypothetical perfectly competitive market characterised by marginal cost pricing the firm faces demand curve in the form of horizontal line because of the horizontal demand curve firm cannot raise its price without losing all its customers to rivals the demand for the firms product is thus completely elastic the possibility of market power rises in market in which firm can raise the price above marginal cost without losing all its customers to competitors in this case the firms demand curve slopes downward13 the deviation between the price set by the firm and the marginal cost which fo rms the basis of the lerner index introduced above can provide measure of market power14 we shall be 10 federal antitrust policy the law of competition and its p ractice 3rd edition p 80 the simplest formulation of this in terms of the lerner index is where p is the firms price at its profitmaximising level of outpu t and mc is the firms marginal cost at that same output if the firms price is equa l to its marginal cost then the index reading for the firms market power would be zero as price rises above mar ginal cost or conversely as marginal cost falls below price the index reading rises above zero if price were t reach infinity or marginal cost were to reach zero then an index reading of 1 for market power would be obtained however this ind ex is of practical use unless the firms marginal cost is known as the chapter of this report on costing and pricing explains it has not been possible to establish relationship between costs and prices from the data bmitted by the banks 11 bilas 1971 microeconomic theory p 267 12 marginal revenue is the firms additional revenue from sellin g the additional unit of output 13 alfred marshall reputed to be the father of the elasticity conce pt wrote the elasticity or responsiveness of demand in market is great or small according as the amount demande d increases much or little for given fall in price and diminishes much or little for given rise in price principles of economics 8th edition p 102 14 sullivan and grimes the law of antitrust an integrated handbook 2nd edition p 27 provide graphic illustration of market power the firm whose demand curve is depicted is able to exercise significant market power over certain range of prices ie within that range its price changes wil l have little effect on quantity demanded output and so it is able to raise its price profitably above the price that would preva il if competition were really effective at much higher or chapter 2 market power 36 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information returning to this index below american antitrust scholars sullivan and grimes deal with the implications of these realities for competition policy as follows15 some writers draw distinction between the term market p ower as used in economic literature and the use of that term in antitrust in economic s any downward sloping demand curve may describe measure of market power in antitrust the focus is on substantial and nontransitory market power that suggests injury to competition i nelasticity of demand that is transitory or although nontransitory is sustained over very narrow range of prices would not be considered the type of market power that warrants antitrust inter vention each of these points may be illustrated if firm markets an improved product that performs better than competing offerings it may increase its price lowering it s output below the level that perfect competition would produce or if retailers newly adopted warehouse mode of operations allows it to sell more efficiently it may sell at price t hat passes only part of that gain on to consumers preserving the remainder as higher return each firm faces downward sloping demand curve consistent with market power for each has the ability to raise or maintain price above the competitive level without losing substantial sales in eac h of these cases the higher profitability although it may be substantial may prove transitory high profits will encourage rivals to emulate the improved product or innovative retailing method the high profits serve as an incentive for rivals to mimic new comp etitive initiative for antitrust purposes then market power must involve inelastic ity of demand that is both nontransitory and covers more than narrow range of prices suc h power might be exercised for example by monopolist by an oligopolist engaging in strategic behavi our by cartel by patent holder or branded product seller that has differentiat ed its product in way other sellers cannot easily replicate by seller controlling i ts aftermarket by seller that exploits buyer information voids to extract higher return or by s eller or buyer in vertical relationship with smaller and dependent firm as in franchising these exerci ses of power are possible targets of antitrust but are not uniformly vulnerable cert ain exercises of market power may be tolerated to obtain other social goals patent monopoly is tolerated indeed fostered to encourage innovation some manifestations of franchiso r power over franchises may be tolerated as enhancing the efficiencies of franchising the monopolies thought to be efficient such as utilities providing gas electricity or water may be permitted subject to public regulation of rates our competition act16 links the concept of market power to that of dominance it requires an especially high standard of behaviour from firms deemed to b dominant they are not allowed to abuse their dominance whether over customers or rivals in various ways specified in the act17 there may be number of dominant firms in the same market this is much lower prices however the effect of further price change upon quantity demanded can become considerable showing that market power would be lost by pricing outside the middl range 15 op cit pp 2729 16 act 89 of 1998 as amended 17 this applies only to firms whose annual turnover or assets exceed threshold determined by the minister of trade and industry and published in the government gazette all the firms we are considering here exceed this threshold chapter 2 market power 37 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information because section 7 of the act conclusively presumes firm to be dominant if it has 45 per cent or more of the market in question b ra ises presumption of dominance if firm has at least 35 per cent but less than 45 per cent of the market unless it can show that it does not have market power and c provides for any firm to be held to be dominant if in fact it has market power for reasons indicated below we are unable to conclude that any bank in south af rica has crossed the threshold where its share of the market that we consider relevant f or current purposes that for ptas and related payment services would create presumption of dominance18 our focus is therefore on the question whether as matter of fact banks should be found to have market power as contemplated by the competition act19 section 11 defines market power as meaning the power of firm to control prices to exclude competition or to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors customers or suppliers20 in other words the mere existence of some slight degree of market powe r in the economic sense outlined above would not amount to market power under the competition act the extent of the firms independence from say its customers would ve to be more than merely capable of being perceived21 it would have to be considerable22 that is to say notable and of consequence in order to meet this test for dominance laid down by the act firm would be able to behave independently of its competitors and custo mers to an appreciable extent if for instance it could raise prices appreciably and sustain the increase for an appreciable period of time without thereby losing sales to the exte nt that the additional currently r5 million many times over and so qualify to be sub jected to the dominance test see section 6 of the competition act 18 statistical data showing that particular banks have share of 35 or more of particular transaction type eg credit cards see data provided by absa october 2006 first submission p 38 do not in themselves support finding of market power inasmuch as the statistical categories concerned do n ot constitute distinct relevant markets for competition analysis 19 where market shares must be established in order to reach concl usion of dominance accurate definition of the boundaries of the relevant market in product and geographical t erms is obviously necessary if market definition were lacking then substitute products andor suppliers could be wron gly excluded or wrongly included when it came to calculating particular firms market share however where other factors including the behaviour of firm itself provide the evidence that it possesses market power then market definiti on loses its analytical importance it is then enough to be able to describe the product and area in respect of which the p ower is held as the competition tribunal expressed it in natal wholesale chemists pty ltd v astra pharmaceutical distributo rs pty ltd 20012002 cplr 363 ct case 98irdec00 pp 376377 we concur with the comp lainant that the purpose of defining relevant market is to identify the exercise of market power as defined in the act and that market definition is only tool for estimating market power not scientific test if the exercise of ma rket power as defined is identified if for example the firm is able to raise appreciably the price of its product without occasion ing significant reduction in demand then market relevant for the purposes of the enquiry will have been ident ified 20 emphasis added the afrikaans text of the act renders the expr ession to an appreciable extent as in n noemenswaardige mate 21 cf blacks law dictionary 8th edition sv appreciable 22 see the shorter oxford english dictionary 5th edition sv appreciable chapter 2 market power 38 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information profit derived from making the increase in the first place would be eliminated23 likewise its independence would be appreciable if over sustained period when unit costs throughout the market were falling appreciably it could maintain its prices at former levels without losing its customers to rivals and so reap greater profits we proceed to examine and assess number of indicators as to whether south african banks do indeed have appreciable market power 23 profits of sa banks and the respon of prices to falling unit costs in thorough initial submission in october 2006 absa included as annex 4 study of competition in the south african banking industry by the international economic consultancy cra international24 which the bank had retained to assist it in the enquiry25 in the course of this study26 cra provided critique of the profitability analysis that had been made in the task group report for the national treasury and the south african reserve bank competition in south african banking april 2004 commonly known as falkena iii27 also included as annex 6 to the submission were absas own comments on that report repeating essentially the same points although misgivings were expressed in falkena iii regarding the use of profitability figures as measure of competition the report had nevertheless concluded that the average return on equity of south african banks wa s with the exception of 2002 consistently higher than the weighted average of the world s leading banks over the study period28 in its critique cra acknowledged that high profits can be indicative of lack of competition and market power but high profits can also be the result of superior efficiency29 that may be so but if one is confronted by pattern of high profits across an industry based on the returns of all the major players the superior efficiency of particular firm or firms can scarcely provide the explanation nevertheless as both falkena iii and cra p ointed out international comparisons of profitability are severely limited in their usefulness 23 we assume here that the firm is operating on the inelastic portion of its demand curve as for example depicted in footnote 14 24 competition in the south african banking industry prepared by robert stillman kyla malcolm

acknowledged this p 19 chapter 2 market power 39 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information this subject was raised at the hearing on 17 july 2007 where the following question was posed to representatives of absa adv petersen of the panel let start by agreeing with the following which is in your main october 2006 submission in annex 6 which is not confidential page 24 paragraph 241 in competitive market it is the marginal firm that makes the return equal to its cost of capital other more efficient competitors make higher profits on av erage therefore firms will make more profits than the costs of their capital given tha t firms would only choose to make investments if the expected returns are above the cost of capital this should be of surprise i have trouble with that but my question following from that is what are the indicators that we should be looking for in order to determine whether the profits of efficient firms are at level suggesting the absence of effective competition30 in response mr stillman of cra appearing for absa said the simp answer is that there is real consensus and clear bright lines that one can apply in this area when using evidence of profitability to assess the intensity of competition and whether it is effective31 he went on to accept however that the level of profitability would be one of number of factors that one would look at in making t he assessment and that it would also be of some relevance to compare banking profits locally with those in other parts of the world32 we recognise that the weight that can be given to such international comparisons is necessarily limited adv petersen let us take annex 6 page 26 paragraph 244 where you point out the problems with international comparisons 1 the markets are dif ferent 2 the business cycles are or may be different 3 inflation is different although you go on to deal with that factor and 4 the risks are different it seems to one could add and this seems to quite fundamental point that we do not know whether and we do not know the degree to which banking is truly competitive in any other country with which comp arisons might be made33 mr stillman agreed34 cra had been critical of the fact that the analysis in falkena iii did not adjust the various countries profitability figures for inflation and that it appeared that developing c ountries had not been included in the comparison study cra subsequently carried out its own study in which it adjusted for inflation and included certain developing countries 30

falkena report that the profitability of south african banks has been consistently and significantly greater than the profitability of banks in other countries35 the cra analysis nevertheless shows that south african banks consistently rank among the most profitable in the world adv petersen now i want to ask you whether you would agree with the f ollowing that over the whole period from 1996 to 2005 south african banks have had subst antially higher rate of profit on tier one capital return on equity adjusted f or inflation than banks in europe kenya brazil and malaysia that is not the whole picture but i ask you whether you agree with that mr stillman that is what the data sure i am referring to figure 54 in the cra study mr von zeuner correct adv petersen i have understood that correctly and that sout h africa essentially matches the rate of return in australia nigeria india th uk and the usa mr stillman yes adv petersen and then let put this to you would you agr ee that significant country has been identified in your very thorough study that shows substan tially higher rate of profit in banking adjusted for inflation over that tenyear peri od than south africa mr stillman yes and that is correct36 evidence or argument to the contrary was forthcoming during the enquiry accordingly we conclude that south african banks rank among the most profitable in the world see the appendix on updated statistics on the task group falkena iii r eport this would be consistent with the banks having ma rket power however it is not conclusive particular difficulty in evaluating the significance of the general level of profitab ility of banks is that as cra pointed out 35 cra study p 27 36 transcript 17 july 2007 pp 5152 chapter 2 market power 41 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information banks are multiproduct firms and the effectiveness of competition may vary across bank products this means that if one were going to use profitability evidence to h elp assess the effectiveness of competition one would want to examine the profitabili ty and rates of return on the banks activities in particular products37 mr stillman confirmed the correctness of this at the hearing38 as it happens absa did provide information in its initial submission which when carefully pieced togeth er allows reliable evaluation to be made we very much appreciate the contribution this has made to the enquiry in assessing the profitability of banks in the provision of ptas and related services we have reference to financial data provided by absa for its flexi banking services fbs and retail banking services rbs segments 39 according to its submission absas fbs segment provides transmission s avings and investment and lending products to the mass market which absa defined as individuals earning less than r5000 per month40 ptas include transmission accounts which as noted by absa are the primary formal banking products utilized by mass market customer s in south africa41 of the total number of accounts provided by fbs in 2006 approximately 85 per cent were ptas42 absas rbs segment provides transmission cheque savings investment and lending products to the middle market which absa defined as individuals with personal monthly income between r5000 and r4166643 pta products transmission and cheque accounts also constitute significant part of the rbs segment approximately 71 per ce nt of all accounts provided in the rbs segment in 2006 were pta products44 we have reason to believe that the lending and investment components in both fbs and rbs are sub ject to less competitive constraint than transaction account services absa provided data showing profit growth in the fbs segment at compound av erage

increases in volume and not to an increase in profit margins measured as percentage of revenues45 in the rbs segment the amount of profit grew even faster at cagr of 40 per cent per annum over the period 2002 to 2005 here however revenue operating income gre w at cagr of only 9 per cent per annum and oper ating expenses at 5 per cent thus it is clear that profit margins did increase46 given that the number of rbs customers also grew at an annual average rate of only 5 per cent over this period higher transaction volu mes at lower unit costs provide the fundamental explanation for the increased profits absa concluded and we agree that this means that the growth in profit margins at rbs between 2002 and 2005 can be attributed largely to economies of scale47 in short unit costs came down sufficiently to provide the main basis for 40 per cent compound annual g rowth in profits over the whole period it is evident that absa failed to pass on these unit cost savings to any signific ant extent to it s customers by way of price reductions choosing instead to retain most of these savings as profits absa was able to increase prices on its main transaction account products ov er the period 2002 to 200548 at rate roughly in line with or slightly below inflation during those years49 despite benefiting from substantial unit cost reductions as result of economies of scale we were not able to conduct the same specific analysis for the other banks primarily because they did not provide data on operating expenses going back far enough i n time to be useful for this purpose however there can be little doubt that in the prevailing conditions of market expansion all the major banks benefited from economies of scale50 as evidenced in the figures provided by absa there has been real competitive pressure to reduce prices from other banks indicating that they too have retained the greate r portion of savings from unit cost reductions as profits rather than pass them on to cons umers through lower prices indeed effective competitive pressure on prices has generally be lacking from rivals in this market if the market were characterised by effective competition then surely

effective competitive pressure when it comes to pricing of ptas particularly in the retail banking or middlemarket segment this was put to absa at the hearing on 17 july 200751 after some initial wrestling which failed to get to grips with the essential point the absa team sought the oppo rtunity to respond specifically in further written submission52 that submission came in the form of theoretical argument prepared by mr stillman53 he first set out the issue to be addressed absa has presented evidence showing that fees on absas silver cheque accoun t cheque account designed for its retail banking services or middle market segment54 have increased over the past several years broadly in line with inflation55 during absas 17 july 2007 hearing on pricing behaviour and market power the panel raised questions about how this evidence should be interpreted suggesting an argument along the followi ng lines in particular in relation to absas middle market segment 1 as absa and other banks have emphasized very high percentage of banks cost structure perhaps as much as 80 is accounted for by fixed costs56 2 this means that average total costs unit costs decline as volu increases in other words that banks experience economies of scale57 3 the south african economy has been growing strongly in recent year s and it is reasonable to assume that the demand for transactional banking rvices has also been growing over this period58 4 this implies that the banks unit costs of transactional servic have also been declining 5 the panel asked whether if the market for banking were highly co mpetitive then these reductions in unit costs would be passed through to consumers at l east in part in the form of reductions in inflationadjusted fees 6 it was suggested that the fact that fees on key product such as absas silver cheque account have not declined in real terms during this period of growing demand but instead have moved with inflation is possibly evidence that the industry is not as highly competitive as the banks have claimed confidential absa 51 transcript 17 july 2007 p 67 pp 7576 pp 7980 pp 8486 52 id p 86 53 cra international price changes and demand

part data request table 11 page 1 and table 12 page 3 of the accompanying spreadsheet confidential absa confidential absa confidential absa confidential absa chapter 2 market power 44 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information this note explains why the final two points in the above line of r easoning are incorrect and why more generally the manner in which prices respond to shift in demand does not provide any information about the degree of competition in market59 the cra argument concluded that first it is marginal costs not unit costs which are relevant in determinin g how prices change accordingly the panel had been wrong in its intuition that at least in competitive markets reductions in unit costs average total costs sh ould lead to reductions in prices second the potential effects on price of shift in demand are various and nothing meaningful can be inferred about the competitiveness of market from the manner in which price responds to shifts in demand on close examination we find that these assertions and their accompanying elaboration while not lacking in ingenuity do not address the case in fact indirect ly they reinforce the conclusion towards which the panel had been feeling its way during the hearing moreover to large extent mr stillmans analysis ignores his point 3 above this of course is key to the question posed by the panel nonetheless we continue to explore his argument mr stillman set out his argument in the following way it is first principle of econ omics he wrote that firm maximizes profits by producing at the level at which marginal c ost equals marginal revenue marginal revenue being the revenue earned from selli ng an additional unit of output60 at that quantity of output the price which the firm can charge is determined by the demand curve which it faces and this is true in competitive and uncompet itive markets alike changes in unit costs do not change either the demand curve or the point at which marginal revenue coincides with marginal cost for firms price to c hange there would have to be change in marginal cost or shift in the demand curve affe cting the elasticity of demand marginal costs may be assumed to be constant in this analysis the focus being on changes in fixed costs per unit of output and there is reason to assume change in the elasticity of demand when the demand increases whether shift in demand will increase the elasticity of demand has to do with the factors leading to the increase in demand eg whether demand is increasing primarily because existing consumers have become wealthier or primarily because new customers have been added who may be more price sensitive it has nothing to do wit h the competitiveness of the market61 let us now turn to diagrammatic view of the argument provided by mr stillman him self it 59 id p 1 60 id p 2 61 id p 5 chapter 2 market power 45 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information appears as figure 2 in the figure price exceeds average total cost and wh ether the average total cost curve is assumed to be high or low the firms profitmaximis ing price remains unchanged figure 2 mr stillmans diagram source cra international price changes and demand shifts robert stillman 10 august 2007 what is striking about this argument and the diagram is that we are not told if it represents the position of the firm before or after demand has increased the firm faces single downwardsloping demand curve62 the equilibrium is where marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue and is established at level where price is comfortably in excess of average total cost unit cost whether the latter is assumed to be high or low all m r stillman has demonstrated is that the equilibrium price will not be affected by whether average total costs are higher or lower after output has settled at its new equilibrium level if the two average total cost curves are intended to present beforeandafter pi cture then one would have expected before and after demand curves to have been drawn in as well to say that changes in the firms level of unit costs will then only affect perunit profit and not directly affect the firms perunit price does not address the question pos ed the question concerned is the process by which new equilibrium price would be established when the output of the firm and that of its rivals have increased and when avera ge total cost unit cost has fallen63 and how the outcome would differ over period in which further 62 downwardsloping demand curve is itself indicative of the existence of market power but is per proof that competition will be ineffective 63 the question related to changes in average costs with changes i n output ie movement along some atc curve and chapter 2 market power 46 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information adjustments may follow depending on whether the market is competitive or not firms demand curve is affected by the price at which its rivals offer substitute products thus the supplier of butter for example wi ll face two quite different demand curves different in both position and slope depending on whether the prevailing price of margarine is high or low64 and will be constrained accordingly in the price it can charge the same must pply in any market where the substitution by the consumer of an existing product with rivals product of the same kind would be relatively straightforward in his written submission mr stillman does not use the term oligopoly prior to his written submission he referred at the hearing on 17 july 2007 to pricing in an oligopoly where you have multiproduct firms and lot of fixed costs65 and in the same sentence indicated that it would be useful to present short note on economics that illustrated th concepts involved we accordingly classify mr stillmans approach in his written submis sion the short note as one that embraces oligopoly since he presents picture in which excess profits are not eliminated by the entry of competitive firms we can regard it as closed model in other words one in which entry is not allowed66 it should nevertheless be noted that the diagram is also compatible with monopoly and monopolistic competition as long as there are barriers to entry while mr stillmans employs the profitmaximising princi ple marginal cost equals marginal revenue to his model of oligopoly it can also be applied to monopolistic competition and monopoly and for that matter to perfect competition let us investigate for moment what mr stillman is showing in his diagram of firm in conditions of oligopolistic competition such firm has some degree of market power and is neither perfectly competitive firm nor an outright monopolist here so mr stillman would have us assume the firm is already producing at the profit maximizing leve l of output consistent with the marginal cost equals marginal revenue condition this ans the firm would make loss on every additional unit of output produced as its marginal cost would not an upwards or downwards shift of the atc curve at fixed level of output as depicted in the diagram 64 that is illustrated for example in milton friedman price theory transaction publishers edition 2007 p 24 samuelson and nordhaus economics 12th edition p 503 state the perfectly competitive firm can sell all it wants to along its horizontal demand curve never depressing market price b ut the imperfect competitor will find that its demand curve slopes downward as its increased q forces down the p it can get and unless it is sheltered monopolist cut in its rivals ps will appreciably shift its own downwardsloping demand curve leftward emphasis added american economic writers often use the term m onopolist to refer to firms having significant market power and do not confine it as we do to firm having the whole market to itself 65 transcript 17 july 2007 p 83 emphasis added 66 see koutsoyiannis 1987 modern microeconomics second edition macmillan p 228 chapter 2 market power 47 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information then exceed its marginal revenue all else remaining constant it has nothing t gain from lowering price in order to increase the quantity demanded in mr stillmans analysis the persistence of the price above the average total cost curv also implies that there is whittling away of profits by competitors undercutting the price be they incumbents or new entrants this is consistent with the existence of barri ers to entry as well as existing rivals choosing to refrain from price competition either the latter l have nothing to gain even in the short term from presenting such competition colossal assumption to make or else they prefer to live quite life where pricing is concerned67 aspects of mr stillmans analysis can be challenged both on points of theory an d with reference to market conditions experienced in the banking industry in recent years we begin with the theoretical challenges mr stillman presents the assumption that all firms are in fact producing outp ut at the point where mc mr as if it were an inviolate principle above reproach brief glance at the history of economic thought indicates otherwise the mc mr argument employed by mr stillman came to the fore around 1880 durin g the socalled marginal revolution the mc mr principle was applied in the theory of perfect competition and in the theory of monopoly it was also subsequently applied to models of oligopoly by the 1920s economists were growing increasingly skeptical of the perfect competition model in 1933 joan robinson68 in england and edward chamberlin69 in the usa independently put forward models of monopolistic competition although robi nson preferred to use the term imperfect competition here firms produce products that re close substitutes even though each firm tries to promote differentiated product an individual firm faces downward sloping demand curve for its product in the theor of monopolis tic competition the profit maximising condition mc mr is retained in the theory of monopolistic competition firms are generally assumed to have freedom of exit and entry the existence of supra normal profits sometimes referred to as pure profit70 lures firms into the arena and their entrance in turn puts excess profits under pressure firms are assumed to act independently of each other bilas points ou t that pure 67 as bilas 1971 points out the lerner analysis shows what firm is doing rather than what it is able to do so firm with market power may refrain from charging the highest possible pric if that helps preserve its market power the greatest of all monopoly power is the quiet life op cit p 268 68 robinson j 1933 the economics of imperfect competition macmillan 69 chamberlin h 1933 the theory of monopolistic competition harvard university press 70 see bilas op cit p 267 chapter 2 market power 48 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information profits can exist in monopoly and oligopoly but not in perfect competition and not in monopolistic competition71 this provides further evidence that stillmans diagram depicts oligopolistic competition although many oligopoly models saw the light of day from about 1940 onwards writings on oligopoly can be traced back to 1848 when augustin cournot presented duopoly model so we can say that by the late 1930s at least four theories of the firm were in place perfect competition monopoly monopolistic imperfect competition and oligopoly although oligopoly had yet to come into its own for present purposes the critical feature of all four approaches was that all four employed the assumption of profit maximisat ion with its associated mc mr condition what we have shown is that mr stillmans diagrammatic approach i s firmly entrenched in the marginalistic tradition that had pervaded conventional theories of the firm by th late 1930s if there had been further development in the theory of the firm sinc the 1930s mr stillmans argument that it is first principle of economics that firm maximises profits by producing at the level at which marginal cost equals marginal revenue could perhaps be maintained however lot has happened in economic theory since then koutsoyiannis writes in 1939 hall and hitch published some results of research undertaken at oxford the most startling results of the studies of the oxford economists research group reported by hall and hitch were that firms did not attempt to maximize their profi ts that they did not use the marginalist rule mc mr and that oligopoly was the main mark et structure of the business world up to then the theory of monopolistic or imperfect competition f chamberlin and joan robinson had been generally accepted as typical or relevant the firms were ssumed to be able to act atomistically ignoring their rivals reactions and pursui ng their shortrun and long run profit maximization by equating marginal cost to marginal revenue in each time period hall and hitch found that firms do not attempt to maximize shortr profits by applying marginalistic rules mc mr but aim at longrun profit max imization firms set their price on the averagecost principle that is firms do not set their price and output at the levels determined by the intersection of the mc and mr curves but they set price to cover the average variable cost the average fixed cost and normal profi t margin usually 10 72 koutsoyiannis adds that the hall hitch study points to number of factors firstly shortrun profit maximization was rarely stated by businessmen to be their goal most firms reported that they aimed at fair level of profit and that they had also other goals secondly the demand curve and its price elasticity on which marginali sm so heavily relies are unknown in practice because neither consumers preferences nor competitors reactions are known with certainty thirdly marginal costs are also unknown in multiproduct firms fourthly even if mc and mr were known and firms aimed at the maximiza tion of their short run profits the adherence to this equality would require continuous changes in the price in view of the continuous changes in costs and demand such frequent changes in prices are 71 id 72 op cit p 263 chapter 2 market power 49 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information not desirable and prices have exhibited considerable stickiness despite changes in shortrun costs and demand73 torrent of articles on the subject ensued giving rise to the socalled marginalis t controversy of the 1940s and 1950s the details need not detain us here enough has been said to illustrate that it is misleading to present profit maximisation on t he basis of mc mr as an inviolate principle microeconomic texts display staggering collection of different theories of the firm to give flavour of the argument we simply list three of them bains limitpricing theory 1949 deals with the threat of potential entry74 the behavioural model of cyert and march 1963 indicates that firms have many goals not just single goal of profit maximisation75 baumols theory of sales revenue maximisation 1958 suggests th at firms attempt to maximise sales revenue rather than profits76 how firm will actually behave depends on its specific set of factual circumstances mr stillman argues that when fixed costs change output is not affected this follows from his mc mr condition with change in fixed cost not affecting marginal cos t because baumols theory makes use of the sales maximisation principle rather t han profit maximisation baumol can argue that firms will change output and price when overheads change77 note that even in mr stillmans approach it is not generally true that change in fixed cost will have affect on output and price if the change in fixed cos t impinges upon the shutdown position the equilibrium level of output will be affected78 mr stillman fails to address the reasons for the fall in average total costs for example as might occur if demand shifts outwards and economies of scale are realised and instead focuses all our attent ion on change in fixed cost which by his reasoning doesnt change price or output to forestall his mc mr reasoning from degenerating into tautology mr stillman here speaking for absa should have provided concrete evidence that the firms in question do in fact produce at point where marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue evidence whatsoever was produced to show that absa or any of the other banks is producing at such point we now

costs but also banks marginal costs themselves are probably coming down wit h the fall in unit costs which this implies space would clearly have been created for prevailing prices to come down yet at least in the important segment of the market for ptas that we are analysing here this has not occurred the question remains why not in terms of mr stillmans diagram we are still in the world of excess ie ab ove normal profits excess profits invite competitive challenges from rivals who could reduc their prices in order to gain market share in an oligopolistic market however firms readily appreciate that by competing vigorously on price they may spoil the market and reduce their profit in the longer run79 in such market the lure of excess profits means that the possible entry of additional firms must be taken into consideration if there is entry of firm s and excess profits persist it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the incumbents individually have some market power and are refraining from competition that would spoil their abili ty to exercise it it does not require actual combinations or understandings among competitors to bring forth individual behaviour calculated to avoid longerterm competitive spoiling sullivan and grimes explain the players in an oligopolistic market can actually increase the ret urns that all of them receive through disciplined pricing to achieve this discipli ne the oligopolists must recognize their interdependence and act accordingly this is distinguished from th independent behavior assumed for the theoretical models of perfect competition or pur monopoly but in most real markets each market participant recognizes that its utput and pricing decisions will have an impact on and will draw response from competi tors for such players output and pricing decisions are taken with an eye to what the competitive re sponse will be80 as charles mueller explains further when defining oligopoly in his glossary of antitrust terms81 given situation in which there are only few sellers phenomenon called oligopolistic interdependence is expected whereas the individual firm in an atomisti c industry one characterised by many sellers has such small share of aggregate indust ry sales that nothing it can do will perceptibly influence the overall marketwide price eg the withdrawal of its entire supply from the market would not affect that market price the i ndividual firm in an oligopolistic industry is by definition sufficiently large that any bstantial change in its output volume will have perceptible effect on the overall marketwide price and hence on the volume of sales and price received by each of its rivals the latter are thus expected to 79 marshall observed long ago that the chief motive of all open combinations and of all informal silent and customary understandings whether among employers or employed is the need for prev enting individuals from spoiling the common market by action that may bring them

ze their joint profits ie the industry profitmaximizing price level the same price as that single fir m monopolist would charge the possibility of this result actually being reached is dependent on other fact ors however particularly on 1 whether the industry in question belongs to the tightk nit or loose subcategory of oligopoly that is whether its concentration ratio is ve ry high or only moderate and on 2 whether its entry barriers are high enough to permit the exercise f that pricing power without inducing new entry tightknit oligopoly market structure so highly concent rated that prices are expected to be significantly above and output significantly below the competitive norm in general empirical studies suggest that this result is to be expected when the four largest sellers have 50 or more of sales in market or when the eight largest have 70 or more82 with the big four banks having more than 90 per cent of the market for pt as in south africa it is not difficult to conclude that tightkni t oligopoly exists at the same time the barriers to new entry are substantial mr stillman observes that in the case of constant marginal costs the impact of shift in demand on price depends solely on how the shift changes the elasticity of demand83 mr stillman employs the lerner index to indicate that while an increase in d emand can lead to an increase in price nothing can be inferred about whether or not the process has rendered the market less competitive once again his argument does not expand on the fact that in competitive markets the presence of excess profits should lure other s uppliers into the arena84 here we should bear in mind the rationale behind the lerner index which first saw the light 82 these passages were quoted with approval and applied by the

varian writes as more and more firms enter the industry for particular kind of product how would we expect the demand curve of an incumbent firm to change first we would expect the demand c urve to shift inward since we would expect that at each price it would sell fewer units of output as more firms ent er the industry second we would expect that the demand curve facing given firm would become more elastic as more firms produced more and more similar products thus entry into an industry by new firms with similar products will nd to shift the demand curve facing existing firms to the left

enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information of day in 1934 the index suggests that the gap between market price and margin cost provides an indication that market power might be present if demand increases and the gap widens that in itself does not indicate t hat monopoly power has increased if there are barriers to entry the size of the gap will be affected by the behaviour of competitors if there are barriers to entry the persistence of the gap raises the possibility that market power is playing role in spite of the increased volumes unit cost savings and sustained profitab ility enjoyed by absa over an extended period it has not lowered its retail banking prices substantially85 the fact that it has not done so is because competitive pressures have not existed or been brought to bear compelling it to do so this conclusion although drawn from an analysis of absas data and submissions does not point finger at absa in particular what absas position reveals is the unsatisfactory state of competition in the market as whole standard bank86 and fnb87 have also enjoyed increased number of transactions unit cost savings and increased profits without using these as an opportunity to mount vigorous challenge to their rivals by way of price competition although nedbank has reduced its prices we find that this has been from levels above broad alignment with other major banks which had caused it to lose significant share of the market88 we have found reason to conclude that nedbank is now undercutting its rivals in the middle market to any

confidential information customer base considerably by offering lower priced transaction accounts it s as yet not posed significant competitive threat to the big four banks in their traditional ar eas of dominance90 our conclusion is that for absa and for the other major banks the sustained fall in unit costs with real fall in unit price indicates that competition has not been effe ctive in constraining the banks from keeping prices above competitive levels over significan t period of time we consider this to be strong evidence that there is appreciable market power on the part of these banks in the provision of ptas and related services to the retail segment of the market in the subsequent sections in this chapter we examine the various structural and behavioural factors influencing the effectiveness of competition in constraining the ability of the banks to behave to an appreciable extent independently of their customers and competitor s in the provision of ptas and related services generally 24 market structure the task group falkena iii report found that the concentration levels of the south african banking industry are high in terms of market share of assets but not out of line wi th other emerging markets91 however it is in the market segments rather than at firm level that concentration is even more marked for example while the big four banks accounted fo r 83 per cent of the total deposits of the public in june 2003 they accounted for 92 per cent of mortgage loans and 89 per cent of bank financed installment sales92 although there was some variation in the banks estimates of their ma rket shares and in the manner of calculating market shares an examination of the figures submitted to the enquiry shows that the market for personal transaction services is highly concentrated both at the broad level and within the income segments table 1 shows market shares in the provision of personal transaction services by monetary value of month end balances as of july 200693 90 we deal with this issue in greater detail in the discussion on barr iers to entry and expansion 91 op cit p 29 92 id p 34 93 personal transaction services here include cheque and

characteristic of banking mark ets around the world95 this suggests that the cost structure of banking is such that there is limit to the number of fullservice banks that can be sustained over time in any particular market in their submissions most of the banks have noted that approximately 80 per cent of thei r costs are fixed96 fnb argued that with highfixed cost structure it is unsurprising to find that the number of large banks is somewhat limited high fixed cost structure requires that firms price in excess of their variable cost in order to survive in the industry97 high fixed cost structure will limit the number of firms in market because if we assume all other f actors remain constant with each additional firm there will be proportional increase in fixed costs that must be recovered from net revenues in the sector98 mr stillman speaking for absa noted it is clear that there are very large fixed costs in the banking industry it is one of the themes that i think has been emphasised by all the banks in their presentati ons and i think rightly so i think that in the order of 70 80 of the cost structure can be regarded as fixed cost and that those costs in turn are common costs that are very difficul t to allocate to particular products or even in some cases business units so as consequence what you necessarily are going to have in our world are very large economies of scale so in this kind of industry you are going to have prices that are in excess of and indeed consi derably in excess of the marginal cost of providing any particular service that is necessary to be able to cover all those fixed costs and provide return to shareholders99 confidential frb 94 totals do not add up to 100 per cent due to rounding 95 fnb presented information showing

transcript 17 july 2007 pp 3738 confidential frb chapter 2 market power 55 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information this particular cost structure ie high fixed and common costs drives c oncentration in banking and places certain limits on the extent of competition the concentration of banks produces an oligopoly structure which facilitates strategic interaction among the participants and confers on each of the banks degree of market power at least sufficient to cove r fixed costs the potential for banks to exploit this market power to earn excessive returns will dep end on the extent to which entry and expansion by new and existing firms effectively const rains the incumbent banks in this regard we examine barriers to entry and expansion in retail banking in south africa 25 barriers to entry and expansion we find that barriers to entry and expansion are high in retail banking genera lly including the provision of ptas the high proportion of fixed and common costs including the cos t of branch networks other infrastructure and ensuring interoperability and t he consequent importance of economies of scale and scope are themselves major barriers to the entry survival and competitive expansion of new firms the multiproduct nature of r etail banking also creates opportunities for crosssubsidisation by incumbents which potentially increases the handicap facing new firms other barriers include the regulatory require ments for entry and participation in the banking industry the costs faced by customers of incumbent banks in switching to new providers and the effects of brand loyalty 251 regulatory requirements we have seen number of players in our industry who handed back their banking licences because of the high cost of holding banking licences mr sizwe nxasana ceo of firstrand bank 100 the banks act101 requires banking license and registration with the south african reserve bank sarb office for banks as prerequisite to operate as bank banking license is required in order to offer deposittaking services such as cheque and tra nsmission accounts offering deposits savings and payment facilities the banks act supple mented by regulations sets out certain prudential requirements that must be m et upon application for banking license and prior to registration prudential requirements are primarily concerned with the protection of depositors funds and reducing the risk of bank crises the primary prudential requirement is to ma intain 100 101 transcript 9 november 2006 p 7 act 94 of 1990 as amended chapter 2 market power 56 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information minimum level of capital and unimpaired reserves in the republic to absorb potenti losses in the event of risks materialising and to safeguard against the risk of insolv ency currently the general requirement is for banks to maintain minimum capital and re serve balance of r250 million the regulatory and prudential requirements set out in the banks act are intende d to protect the public the fact that they are in place also provides regulators with means of controlling financial conditions they nevertheless pose considerable barrier to entry by new firms and are an objective factor in any analysis of the degree of market power enjoy ed by incumbents it is notable that since 2002 new bank licenses have been granted although ther have been some purchases of existing bank licenses the number of registered bank s102 has fallen from 41 in 2002 to 17 in 2006 our focus here is on conditions affecting competition in the market for the provision of ptas and related services as deposittaking is involved this is the preserve of banks issues of access to and participation in the payment system historically but not nec essarily in itself the preserve of banks are dealt with comprehensively in the chapter of this report on access to the payment system nevertheless insofar as the provisi on of ptas necessarily involves banks in the payment system the cost of that involvement must be taken into account when assessing barriers to entry for banks themselves in south africa registered banks may become clearing banks by obtaining samos settlement account with the sarb and membership of the payment assoc iation of south africa pasa and the banking association103 there are membership and usage fees to be paid in this regard and ultimately fees to bankserv or any other operator or assoc iation like mastercard and visa in which the bank participates or whose services it uses all of these are explicit costs that would mount up as new entrant expands its participation i n more payment streams104 here too the volume of business that firm can expect in entering and remaining in the market must play crucial part in any decision to do so 252 switching costs and customer inertia any new entrant faces the difficult challenge of having to attract new customer s in retail banking this is made particularly difficult by the inherent inertia of customers in this complex industry and the established reputation of incumbents brands as will be demonstrated in 102 103 104 apart from 15 local branches of foreign banks which are not full s ervice banks and 2 mutual banks it was indicated during the enquiry that the lastmentioned requirement was in the process of being dropped these matters are expanded in both the chapters on the payment cards and interchange and access to the payment system chapter 2 market power 57 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information detail further in this chapter switching costs are high and consumers are not very responsive to price this means that any new entrant would face considerable difficulties attempti ng to attract customers on the basis of competitive pricing it would have to be abl to offer significantly lower price and satisfy consumers that it would sustain that price differe nce in order to attract customers from the incumbents this factor adds considerab ly to barriers to entry and so reinforces the incumbents market power every time customer transfers funds from his or her accoun t to somebody who banks at another bank the bank from which funds are transferred will lose reserves during the course of the trading day there will of course be funds flowing in the opposite direction with stable market shares the banks have good idea of how much to keep in the form of excess reserves to alleviate risk one of the problems facing new bank is that until it has achieved reasonable market share it will have to keep enough excess reserves to deal with such drain on its reserves 253 reputation and brand loyalty consumers tend to place high premium on the reputation of incumbents brands this is particularly true in the case of banking where consumers perceive an established br and as being representative of the stability of the bank and thus the security of their deposits the consumer survey conducted for the enquiry by kla found that consumers perceived larger banks to be more secure and stable it was noted that advertising i s more strongly associated with bigger banks which in turn emphasises their stronger sens of establishment105 trust and security were among the themes typically invoked further in differentiating between small banks and large banks the majority of participants in the survey associated greater stability and financial security with big banks as opposed to small banks106 consumers appear to have bought into the notion of some banks being too big to fail already inert customers will not easily choose new bank that does not have an established brand it is thus not surprising that the banks spend substantial amounts of money on brand awareness and topofmind advertising107 fnb note that building the brand takes the form of advertising as well as sponsorships brand building via advertisin g takes place 105 106 107 kaufman levin associates qualitative research to understand what the main factors are that drive consumer choice when choosing bank for the first time and when considering whether to switch to another bank july 2007 exhibit ggg slide 13 id slide 14 hal r varian observes op cit p 453 that if firms can succeed in convincing the consumers that t heir product has close substitutes they will be able to charge higher price f or it than they would otherwise be able to do this leads each producer to invest heavily in creating distinctive brand identity laundry soap for example is pretty standardized commodity yet manufacturers invest huge amounts of money in advertisements that claim cleaner clothes better smell and generally happier existence if you choose their brand rather than competitors this product positioning is much like the ice cream vendors locating far away from each other in order to avoid headto head competition chapter 2 market power 58 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information across the market however extra efforts are made in market segments where fn b is focused on improving market perception108 fnb spent more than r15 million on sponsorships in 2006109 brandbuilding is linked to product positioning and product differentiation discussed further below our impression is that different ial colourbranding and general imagebuilding have tended to be emphasised in the maj or banks advertising rather than hardedged messages advancing competitive prices this poses significant barrier for new entrants who must incur substantial sunk costs from spending on advertising and brand awareness 254 extensive branch networks and infrastructure requirements although there are alternative distribution channels for the delivery of personal transaction services physical branches have played and are likely to continue to play an important role in the channel strategy of retail banks the costs of establishing and maintaining physical branch networks are substantial and pose significant barrier for new entrants who do not have established branch infrastructure the importance of physical branches is evident in the banks response to the requirements of the financial sector charter to provide banking to lowincome individuals absa submitted to the enquiry that it plans to increase its branch network over the coming years and noted that network expansion will follow from the requirements of the financial sector charter related to providing access to lowincome individuals and will also flow fro m absas long term growth across all customer segments110 255 limited expansion by fi rms in the competitive fringe oligopoly write lipsey courant

for ptas while clearly an oligopoly may be characterised as having competitive fringe112 in this regard it is important to assess whether competition from firms on the fringe effectively constrains

enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information features of the market have been consistent since 1993 the first is that the market has been dominated by the four largest banks the second is that new fullservi ce bank has emerged to challenge the dominance of the big four there is currently indication of foreign bank intending to enter the market on green fields basis even the recent entry into south africa of barclays plc one of the largest banks in the world was by way of acquisition of control of absa one of the existing big four given the barriers to entry discussed above as well as the particular challenges faced by smaller banks there is little prospect for banks on the fringe to expand and p ose serious challenge to the dominant positions of the incumbent fullservice banks the fringe consists of number of smaller banks these include investec capitec postbank116 south african bank of athenswizzit mercantile bank teba bank and ithala117 in this section we discuss some of the key fringe competitors and evalu ate the scope for their expansion and whether or not they are likely to pose competitive constraint investec investec did not make submission to the enquiry it is predomina ntly an investment bank focusing on serving the needs of select market niches where the group can compete effectively118 this approach also applies in the case of transactional banking where investec targets highnet worth individuals only it has shown sign of dev iating from this business model and thus cannot be considered as an existing or potential competitive constraint in the broader low and middle market for personal transaction accounts although it does compete with the big four for high net worth individuals capitec of all the smaller banks capitec may have the greatest potential to introduce serious competition for the currently dominant banks in its submission to the enqui ry in 2006 capitec stated an ambitious vision to be the dominant mass market bank119 this goal could be achieved it submitted by offering affordable services to the low income market capitec has had success in this regard fees for transaction services on its p roducts are significantly lower than those of the other banks and it has increased the number of account holders from 399000 in 2004 to 1010000 in 2007120 116 117 118 119 120 the postbank is

competition commissioner contains confidential information capitecs core business is in making loans to lowincome consumers its transactional products are similarly targeted at lowincome consumers capitecs offerings are thus limited to particular segment of the market its business model is thus one of niche banking targeted at specific segment as noted in its submission small banks have the ability to compete with large banks not directly with all the products but they can speci alise in niche121 this suggests that capitec do not see much scope for development into full service bank that would compete with the dominant banks in the broader middl market122 in its submission capitec highlighted number of factors that restric t small banks ability to expand and compete headon with the larger banks the requirement to be interoperable with the incumbent banks limits the s cope for smaller banks like capitec to expand and innovate capitec noted in its submission that due to the concentration of clients in the large banks i t would be almost impossible to implement new innovative payment services unless all the large banks buy in to the concept and see business case smaller banks can implement payment instrum ents on their own but the success and volumes will only come when there is interop erability with the clients of the large banks the market is therefore dependant on the ability of the large banks t move with new ideas123 public perceptions that smaller banks are risky present challenge to small banks attempting to attract depositors away from larger banks as noted by capitec individuals therefore tend to place their deposits with large banks that are too big to fail this creates the challenge to small banks to attract depositors normal ly paying higher interest rates as risk premium from large banks in order to grow their cli ent base124 south african bank of athens wizzit the south african bank of athens focuses on lending to small and medium sized businesses generally owned by members of the greek community125 although it accepts deposits and offers transactional products this is limited part of its business and thus it cannot be considered

transactional services however wizzits experience also illustrates the difficulties that nonbank innovators face in entering the market it is noteworthy that wizzit ori ginally arose as business model

increasing their costs and delaying time to market the result is technically bankled model that is only ma rginally branchless in that the banks infrastructure and personnel are used for all cash

fundamental change in the competitive landscape 26 product differentiation antitrust economists viscusi harrington and vernon write discussion of oligopoly theory would be complete without mentioni ng product differentiation one of the most significant ways in which firm s compete is by trying to make their product unique relative to the other products in the market the reason is that the more differentiated ones product is the more one is able to act like monopol ist that is firm can set higher price without inducing large numbers of consumers to swi tch to buying competitors products131 in their submissions and presentations during the hearings the major banks s tressed that they compete on the basis of number of factors of which price is not the most important 132 although product differentiation is limited in the low income segment particularly in the case of mzansi in the middle and high income segments the product offeri ngs of the banks ie transmission and current accounts are characterised by high degree of differentiation each bank has emphasised the importance of being able to differentiate its offerings in order to meet the increasing variety of consumer preferences transaction services are delivered through number of different channels and consumers differ with regard to th eir usage of and preference for these different channels banks develop different product packages 131 132 economics of regulation and antitrust 4th edition pp 113114 see also transcript 17 july 2007 pp 9298 see further the chapter on costing and pricing chapter 2 market power 64 banking

understanding of their customers and their behaviours as the ability to manage data and evaluate customers preferences on channels has improved customers have in turn displayed their preferences in unique combinations which allow them t optimise their lifestyle choices with increased diversity of channel access133 evidence of this can be found in the fact that while certain customers prefer to do their banking through electronic means such as the internet and payment cards other customers who perhaps do not have access to the internet make greater use of branches nd atms customer usage of different channels is also influenced by differences in income for example access to and frequency of use of payment cards will vary depending on the level of income of the customer134 banks therefore compete to develop products which best match the behavioural characteristics of customers the closer the fit between the features of the product and the behaviour and preferences of the customer the more willing the customer will be to pay higher price of course consumers willingness to pay is greatly influenced by income levels with higher levels of income being associated with greater willingn ess to pay this explains why there is greater product differentiation and product variety in the middle and higher income segments than there is in the low income segments the consequence of this form of product differentiation is greater product variety and given the presence of alternative channels of distribution greater product complexity it is important to note however that di fferentiation arises from different combinations of product features and different pricing structures and not from intrinsic differences in the product features themselves the fullservice banks all offer the same set of transaction facilities it is the manner in which these facilities are packaged and priced which varies f rom bank to bank the consequence of the prevailing practice of product differentiation by the banks i n south africa is that it is fait accompli that each of the major banks will have degree of market 133 134 sbsa july 2007 comparison shopping for banking services p 4 id chapter 2 market power 65 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information power over its customers what is disputed however is whether this market power is appreciable in the following section we explore the extent to which the market power of each of the banks which is inherent in model of product differentiation is enhanced as result of the information asymmetries and costs of searching and switching which are prevalent in the market for personal transaction accounts 27 information asymmetries when customers have sufficient information they are able to use this informat ion to make efficient and rational choices firms thus have an incentive to provide products that best meet the needs of customers and are forced to compete with one another as consumers are sufficiently informed to be able to differentiate between the offerings of the different firms competition tends to result in prices that reflect the value to the consumer of the particular product or service rather than the ability of the firm to exercise market power however when firms have more information than their customers about t he attributes of their products this information asymmetry confers on these suppliers degree of market power over their customers in such circumstances it may be diff icult for consumers to assess the attributes of the products or to differentiate between the different off erings of the firms this may be because of the complexity of these products or because th ey are purchased infrequently where customers are not adequately informed and suppliers d not adequately disclose relevant information competition on price quality and other factors is likely to be diminished there are number of factors which contribute to and exacerbate information asymmetries in the market for personal transaction services these are discussed below 271 limited knowledge and understa nding of fees paid by consumers there are several products in the market for ptas and related services where pric ing is not transparent these include the payasyou transact and packaged cheque and current account services of the banks the actual cost to consumers of purchasing these products depends on the interest rates and fees applied to the accounts as well as the various fees for payment services the combination of these elements makes it very diffic ult for consumers to determine exactly what they will pay for particular products and t hus also makes it difficult to compare products the kla study for the enquiry showed that most of the focus group participants had limited knowledge about what they were being charged for transaction account serv ices in particular the study reported that the sheer variation with respect to fees different for chapter 2 market power 66 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information different banks and different applications is experienced as very confusing135 and difficult to calculate136 as result participants felt disempowered and were forced to rely on and trust the experts namely the banks it was reported that there was an element of bli nd faith among consumers entering into relationships with the banks and that c onsumers are not able to interrogate confront and challenge these experts due to lack of knowledge experience and confidence137 these problems are exacerbated where many consumers suffer the additional disadvantage of low levels of formal education focus group study done by the monitor group for the banking association produc ed similar results138 in particular monitor found that customer awareness of fees and fee levels is limited many customers do not use the cheapest channels although price is driver of behaviour customers find it difficult to understand fee information and tables in bank statements and other bank documents at the hearing on 9 july 2007 mr shuter of nedbank discussed some of the findings of nedbanks own research indicating that consumers have little knowledge of and do not really interrogate what they pay in bank fees one of the challenges with bank fees is we still do not see huge t rend of clients actively inquiring on what their fees are inasmuch as all of the information is available in the branch space and the things are printed out and all of that the research we have done on people opening current accounts in our branch system is that they are not actively inquirin g on fees as to one of the challenges we have had because we have to must explain to our stakeholders shareholders why it is important that we are competing so strongly on the price element when some of our own internal research says that much as th ere is sort of general view that banking is expensive and people are being charged too much there is not great deal of inquiring at an individual level on the cost of banking and you only hav got to do you know pop surveys just amongst just our own peers very few people had actually interrogated what they are paying so i would not accept the argument that clients are trying very hard to compare but it is so difficult that they are actually now focusing on service and product139 mr shuter appeared to conclude that perceptions of lack of transparency are unfounded and that consumers ignorance arises from apathy and consequent failure to question what they pay for bank fees rather than inadequate disclosure of information on the part of the banks140 in this regard he referred to anecdotal evidence as well as research condu cted by 135 136 137 138

consumers would challenge this however mr n kholisile of the fscc noted how fees are charged without adequate explanation i did some of the research andeven went to my own bank statements and got

confidential information nedbank not supplied the kla and monitor studies also support the finding that consumers generally do not actively question what they pay in bank fees however this is not because the level of fees is unimportant to them lower bank fees would be ke factor when choosing bank141 we find that consumers failure to question fees is symptomatic of num ber of factors consumer apathy certainly plays role but it is not surprising that consumers are apathetic given the difficulties they face when trying to decode complex product features and pricing structures see further below proactive measures need to be taken to improve transparency and disclosure so that consumers are able to actively interrogate the ir bank fees142 this will stimulate competition as the situation currently stands consumers failure to question fees means that in general consumers are not responsive to changes in price this is constraint on effective competition as it makes demand more inelastic and is thus source of market power for the banks 272 price and product complexity as noted in the discussion of product differentiation above there are number of alternative channels available for the distribution and delivery of various transaction services transactional products are complicated because they consist of combinations of channels with differing pricing structures for each while it is possible to simplify pricing structures transactional products are likely to remain inherently complex in addition to problems of transparency and disclosure the greatest diff iculty faced by consumers in the searching process lies in the ability to make meaningful comparisons across the product offerings of the banks at the request of the panel the enquirys technical team compiled table containing the product features and pricing of the basic packaged offerings of absa standard bank fnb and nedbank it is evident from the comparison table that there is uniformity in the manner in which the packaged offerings are structured and priced it is therefore impossible to make direct price comparisons between the offerings without having to input detailed information bout the transactional behaviour of the prospective customer and then perform fairly lengthy calculations based on the different pricing formulas of the banks143 141 142 143 november 2006 p 85 transcript 17 july 2007 p 165 note that consumer groups called for improved and even mandatory education of consumers transcript 2 november 2006 p 10 an added difficulty for the customer would be to factor in dif

2007 pricing brochures146 in our assessment the difficulties involved in making direct price comparisons are prohibitive for most consumers the reality is that most consumers do not make product choice s on the basis of price because they cannot do so readily and effectively 146 verified by the appropriate banks in july 2007 chapter 2 market power 70 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in their submission fnb note that banking services are inherently complex products and the structure of pricing must reflect that in particular most banking products are compound goods combining number of elements and services147 during the hearings mr shuter of nedbank said we have got complex geography complex array of clients we segment the market and we try very hard to differentiate and lot of the complexity comes f rom that now there is one school of thought that says that is bad thing one can compare there is another school of thought that says the complexities arise from the fact t hat there is competitive environment where people interpret clients needs differently and one bank adds in this while another takes it out148 it is clear that product complexity is an inherent property of product differentiati on across multiple channels what has not been demonstrated is that such differentiation has been successful in maximising consumer welfare by delivering affordable bank ing that meets the needs of consumers as has been discussed above and is pursued subsequently in this chapter there is inadequate transparency and disclosure in respect of the features and pricing of transactional banking products the inherently complex nature of composite transactional banking products serves to aggravate this problem and further highlight s the need to introduce proactive measures to improve transparency and disclosure 273 confusing terminology in differentiating their product offerings each bank uses its own terminology to d escribe its products and related product features this makes it all the more difficult for cons umers to understand and assess the different offerings of the banks nedbank for example while arguing that product differentiation is part of healthy competition agreed that where you have exactly the same fee but it is called different name we do not think that is particularly helpful we think some standardisat ion on the vocabulary would be helpful149 currently there are codes providing for standardisation of terminology in respect of personal transaction services this hinders comparability and is thus likely to soften considerably the degree of effective price competition the need to standardise terminology runs together with the need for industry standards generally to facilitate price comparisons 147 148 149 frb october 2006 first submission p 23 transcript 9 july 2007 pp 7172 emphasis added see id pp 4546 chapter 2 market power 71 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 28 switching and search costs competition tends to be more robust when consumers are able to easily swit ch from one supplier to another in response to competitive price or some other factor that offers the customer better value for money however when consumers are restricted from switching whether deliberately by the banks or otherwise150 competition is inhibited in particular when consumers face switching costs they become captives of their suppliers thus conferring on the latter degree of market power in particular higher switching costs mean that consumers will be less responsive to changes in price and thus the demand for firms products will be relatively price inelastic banks assured the enquiry of their willingness to assist customers in switch ing as mr jordaan of fnb puts it what we try and do is from our side make it as easy as possible for customers to switch to us151 we believe that all banks do assist customers in switching their accounts to them assisting customers who want to switch their accounts to another bank is not something that can appeal to an incumbent as fnb frankly acknow ledged it is imperative for the bank that each account opened remain active for as long as possible152 useful way to determine whether the banks have an appreciable degree of market power is to test whether each bank would be able to implement ssnip sma ll but significant nontransitory increase in price without losing so much business to rival sup pliers that the increase would not be worthwhile153 ordinarily sustained price increase of 5 per cent or more would be sufficient in this regard to enable signif icant degree of market power to be identified154 the european commission guidelines on market analysis and the assessment of significant 150 151 152 153 154 the difficulty for customers in switching banks derives to rge extent from the complexity and combination of services they receive from full service banks which tend to di scourage them from switching banks unless they are intensely driven to do so for most bank customers switching bank s will also entail rearrangements with service providers employers etc all of which will add to the hassle fac tor of switching transcript 9 july 2007 p 196 frb response to the request for information from the competi tion commission

evaluations has been applied more generally where the existence of market powe r needs to be determined and has gained general acceptance internationally here it has been specifically approved by the competition appeal court in patensie sitrus beherend bpk v competition commission 2003 2 cplr 247 cac at 257 hi see also medicross healthcare and another v competition commission 2006 1 cplr 1 cac at 9 d10c in the usual application of the ssnip test the assumption would be that the existing price charged is at more than an effectively competitive level however the existing pri ce may in fact be higher the real test is therefore wheth er price 5 per cent or more above the competitive level could be charged without losing the customers the ssnip test provides possible means of establishing that where say mono polist is already charging customers supra competitive price at the limit they can bear even the smallest further increase could cause the loss of customers who simply fall out of the market where however sustained incr ease of 5 per cent or more could be imposed without the loss of customers one can without having to pin down t he notional competitive price safely conclude that significant market power prevails chapter 2 market power 72 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information market power under the community regulatory framework for electro nic communications networks and services state the possibility for consumers to substitute product or service for another because of small but significant lasting price increase may be hindered by c onsiderable switching costs accordingly in situation where end users face sig nificant switching costs in order to substitute product for product b these two products should not be in cluded in the same relevant market 155 by parity of reasoning if customers would be deterred from switching banks by the co st of doing so even if the price charged by their existing supplier were to rise by 5 per cent or more above that charged by its rivals and kept there it must follow that that supplier enjoys appreciable market power likewise such conclusion would follow if riv would have to offer price that is lower by more than 5 per cent over significant period all els being equal in order to induce the others customers to switch for this reason calculation of the switching costs faced by bank customers provides the basis for applying variant of the ssnip test in order to assess the degree of customer captivity and thus of banks market power156 before proceeding to that calculation we must deal with preliminary issue in their submissions the banks have argued that switching costs faced by their customers are not significant in this regard they refer to churn figures which they sa indicate substantial customer mobility and thus relative ease of switching the following table presented by standard bank at the hearing on 13 november 2006157 shows annual churn figures for standard bank for number of different market segments in personal banking158 155 156 157 158 2002c 16503 1172002 50 of course sure way for customers to escape captivity in the hands of their suppliers is to drop out of the market altogether and simply go without in the case of retail bank ing services such course would imply such adverse consequences for the great majority of customers that we can safely assume that small but significant nontransitory increase in price from current levels would not generally induce so dr astic step customer would generally remain available for exploitation by their captors exhibit v slide 9 these churn figures are more or less consistent with the nquiry technical teams calculations based on confidential data submitted by all the major banks

exhibit v slide 9 we do not accept that these churn figures reflect switching churn has been calculated as u of accounts opened of accounts closed 2 x total of accounts at the beginning of the year the figures thus include all forms of account closure and opening and do not isolate those instances where individuals close their account at one bank and open an account at another bank first churn figures based on the above formula will reflect the large increase in the number of accounts opened by people who have not previously been banked second churn figures will include accounts opened in error and subsequently closed accounts closed as result of death facilities being repaid ie home loans and personal loans where relevant and accounts closed as result of abandonment as customers exit the banking system or leave the country third included in churn would be those accounts opened and closed by customers who change products but stay with the same bank the following exchange took place during the hearings mr pintusewitz for fnb mrs nyasulu of the panel i am trying to understand on th issue of the switching to rival bank whether you are able to isolate specifically those figures as opposed to someone just saying i do not like this product because you are overc harging on it i am still your customer but i do not want your cheque account anymore are you able to isolate the specific number of people who just pack up in toto and move to another bank mr pintusewitz the numbers we have got include both so we cannot sho w you the one piece and the other mrs nyasulu you cannot isolate mr pintusewitz so we cannot isolate it at this time and as i say we do those customer surveys to try and understand that as well as possible 159 therefore churn cannot be said to quantify switching in any sense of the word 159 transcript 9 november 2006 pp 3738see also id pp 4648 bank was able to supply the enquiry with figures for actual switching chapter 2 market power 74 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information however even accepting that there must be some level of actual switching this says nothing about the level of switching costs or whether or not firms have market power in very competitive market with zero switching costs switching rates may in fact be very low because the satisfied customers of competitive firms would have little inc entive to switch to equally competitive rivals160 however firm with significant market power may raise price to level where other perhaps less optimal substitutes become viable for the customer161 in the market for personal transaction services prevailing prices would already reflect the market power conferred on the banks as result of search and switching cos ts even if churn reflected switching the fact that we observe churn at prevailing prices s ays nothing about the degree of pricing power conferred on the banks due to search and switching costs nor does it say anything about whether this market power is appreciable or not the degree of pricing power conferred on the banks as result of search or switching costs can only be determined by calculating directly the actual costs of searching and switching as percentage of the competitive price in its report referred to above genesis economic consultants assisting standa rd bank estimated actual switching costs for personal transaction accounts by c osting the steps required to switch from one provider to another162 genesis assumed that consumers would typically be likely to keep the same banking account for period of three years and calculated the base price as the net present value of three years of bank fees fo r products in the middle income segment switching costs calculated as percentage of this base price were estimated to be less than 3 per cent163 genesis argued that at this level switching costs are sufficiently low that any transaction account holder who wishes to switch to bank offering 3 per cent lower fees would b able to do so and recover their costs within three years although not explicit ly stated it appears that because that percentage falls below the 5 per cent threshold required for ssnip genesis concluded that switching costs do not confer meaningful market power on standard bank 160 161 162 163 cf frb august 2007 frb view on the costs of

pp 2024 see also transcript 18 june 2007 pp 192195 chapter 2 market power 75 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in our opinion there are number of problems with the genesis analysis which invalidate the conclusion that switching costs do not confer meaningful market power on standard bank and by implication on other banks first genesis underestimated the costs associated with certa in important steps in the switching process these include transport costs incurred in the switching proc ess and the opportunity cost of time spent by the customer instructing the new bank abo ut the customers previous banking arrangements eg salary deposits and debit orders etc second genesis failed to take into account the cost of searching alth ough searching is distinct from switching the cost of searching is important in assessing market pow er as consumers must first search for the best alternative before they can switch to it third the base price used by genesis relies on prevailing prices this is incorrect the ssnip test is appropriately applied to the notional competitive price not prevailing prices164 nevertheless we shall for

anything to favour the bank for example significant waiting in queue at bank has been assumed not to occur165 but like genesis we have considered it inappropriate to assume that typical customers will close existing bank accounts by telephone166 and like genesis we do not 165 166 contrast in this regard the experience of customers surveyed by kla transcript 17 july 2007 p 175 cf transcript 18 june 2007 p 197 standard bank chapter 2 market power 77 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information accept that the value of customers time can be disregarded167 according to these calculations total switching costs as percentage of the n et present value of average annual banking costs over three years is likely on conservative estimate to be well in excess of 5 per cent this means that on the basis of switching costs alone the market power of each bank is appreciable as each bank is in position to impose small but significant nontransitory increase in price even from current price levels w hich are in all probability already supracompet itive we do not accept the argument that existing customers are protected from the exercise of such pricing power by the existence of vigorous price competition between t he banks for new customers all the indications are as this chapter has explained that the banks competition for new customers is not based fundamentally on price competition th us the real dynamic is that the market power of banks over existing customers is extended int the market for new customers the above calculations make allowance for one of the most formidable barriers to switching namely the procedures requirements under the financial intel ligence centre act fica for verifying the identity of bank customers necessary though th procedures may be for combating financial and other serious crime they constitute an additional deterrent that impedes customers from readily switching banks furthermore the above calculations include only those switching costs readily capabl of being quantified and thus represent the minimum level of switching costs they are lik ely to underrepresent the full extent of switching costs faced by consumers in this regard we note that there are also other switching costs that cannot easily be measured168 for example perceptions play an important role in influencing customer behaviour if some costs are perceived rather than real they will nevertheless factor into the custo mers calculation of what it costs to switch if these percepti ons are shared by significant number of customers then they must be factored into the calculation of the actual switching cost the r esults of the kla survey 169 and the monitor report discussed above show that there is strong perception among consumers that switching is costly in the monitor report it is suggested that the perceived cost of switching is greater than the actual cost of switching170 the analysis of switching costs by genesis assumed that the customer in question has 167 168 169 170 cf transcript 9 july 2007 p 196 fnb cf shy quick and easy method for estimating switching costs international journal of industrial organisation vol 20 pp 7187 the reality is that it would be very difficult i f not impossible to directly observe actual switching c osts as noted by shy the reason why switching costs are not observed is that they are partly consumerspecific reflecting the individuals human capital needed for switching among systems and are therefore treated as utility loss which cannot be directly calculated from any data exhibit ggg slides 4142 monitor group competitiveness report 20 october 2006 p 158 chapter 2 market power 78 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information already made herhis choice and identified herhis preferred provider genesis thus completely ignores the costs involved in shopping around searching for and identifying the most competitive alternative while switching costs may be distinct fro m search costs search costs cannot be ignored when assessing the market power of firms171 assuming access to the internet we estimated that relatively well infor med middle income individual would take at least one hour to search for suitable alternative and calculate which alternative is most affordable monetary estimate of the value of t his time to the consumer is contained in table 5 we note again that this is conservative estimate and is meant to reflect the minimum time and minimum cost associated with searching although some search costs are unavoidable the enquiry found that search c osts in the market for personal transaction services in south africa are inordinately high these inordinate search costs are the result of lack of transparency and inadequate disclosure of product and price information these factors increase considerably the amount of time that consumers must spend searching in order to determine which product is most competitive actual search costs in the market for personal transaction services in south africa are thus likely to be much greater than indicated in table 5 29 nature of strategic interaction among firms we have seen that retail banking in south africa and the market for personal transaction services in particular is an oligopoly consisting of four banks that collectively hold in excess of 90 per cent of the market and competit ive fringe the defining characteristic of an oligopoly is that each firm makes strategic decisions based on the expected reactions of its rivals172 whether or not firms strategic decisionmaking will result in effective competition depends on the structural and behavioural features of the relevant market173 strategic interaction between oligopolists is distinct from outright collusion174 it refers rather to the situation where firms are able to anticipate and rely on each other s behaviour without either expressly or tacitly entering into an agreement or understanding to coordinate we find that in the market for ptas and related services the nature of strategic interaction 171 172 173 174 cf wilson markets with search and switching costs mpra pa per 131 httpmpraubunimuenchende131 wilson notes due to the assumption that search costs unlike switching costs are incurred unconditionally on the decision to switch suppliers it is shown that the antico mpetitive effects of search costs are consistently larger than t hose from an equivalent level of switching costs the findin g suggests that obfuscation practices that aim to deter consumer s from searching such as competing on deliberately complex tariffs may be particularly powerful relative to practices that increase the costs of substitution between firms such as loyalty prog rams or termination fees oligopoly behavior is necessarily strategic behavior olig opolists must take into account how their rivals will react to their actions in deciding on strategies oligopolists face basic di lemma between competing and cooperating the firms in an oligopolistic industry will make more profits as group if they cooperate any one firm however may make more profits for itself if it defects while the others cooperat lipsey courant and regan op cit p 261 the outcome cannot be determined priori see mark blaug economic theory in retrospect 5th edition cambridge university press 1997 pp 302303 see appendix on complex monopoly collective dominance an d tacit collusion chapter 2 market power 79 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information among the four major banks is such that effective competition tends to be restrict ed rather than enhanced there are two main factors present in this market which facilitate competitionrestricting strategic interaction among participants the first factor arises from customer inertia or captivity the expect ed reaction of rivals to price changes is affected by the responsiveness of consumers to price changes in the course of this chapter we have examined range of indications pointing to market power of banks in providing ptas and related services this power rests on combination of objective and subjective factors we found that the nature of product differentiation the extent of information asymmetries and the considerable costs of searching and switchi ng all provide strong evidence of high degree of inertia on the part of the majority of consumers of personal transaction services in south africa hence these consumers are not very responsive to price changes in the short to mediumterm their demand is thus inelastic an important consequence is that small but significant reduction in price by one firm will result in an immediate reduction in its revenue without an increase in its volumes t make up for that under these conditions it makes more sense for the rational oligopolist to raise prices cautiously or at least leave them unchanged for example because of the degree of customer inertia or captivity small increase in the firms price would result in an immediate increase in its revenue strategically the best response of its rivals would be to leave their prices unchanged or to raise prices in line with the leader the second factor arises from the fact that interbank arrangements are req uired in order for the payment system to work effectively interoperability obviously has posi tive benefits but it also has the potential to restrict competition because it brings competitors togeth er on common platform we have found arrangements in certain payment strea ms that facilitate noncompetitive outcomes the chapters of this report dealing with atm transactio ns and interchange arrangements between the banks provide illustrations of this the nature of interbank arrangements that underlie many personal transaction servic are such that unilateral moves to reduce transaction fees would tend to disadvantage the fee cutter relative to the rivals who do not change their fees the disadvantage for bank in moving alone to reduce its charge to custo mers when its fee arrangements with other banks are unchanged was graphically illustrated during the hearing on 3 april 2007 in 2006 fnb had recommended that the socalled saswitch premiu m ie the disincentive fee that bank charges its customer for using another banks atm should be eliminated however fnb had argued that it would not be commercially viable f or one bank to unilaterally eliminate its disincentive fee for offus atm transactions it recommended that such move would have to be done at an industry leve l ie all the banks would either have to agree or be compelled to eliminate their disincentiv fee for off us atm transactions at the hearing the panel asked fnb to explain why it would not be possible for fnb to chapter 2 market power 80 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information unilaterally eliminate its disincentive or saswitch premium175 mr jordaan replied that fnb would then lose lot of volume from its own atms which would go to com peting atms it would be extremely naïve from commercial perspective if we were to do something like that this would really have to be an industry solution that would involve all the banks176 crucial in this reasoning was that fnb believed that if it acted alone it would probably t be able to attract enough customers from the other banks to make up for the l oss in revenue that would follow as result of the reduction to zero of its own disincentive or sas witch fee this is summed up in the following comments by ms durbach and mr jordaan of fnb ms durbach and if i can also just address the possibilit of us attracting enough customers by dropping that fee to cover the very significant ss that we would take in our assessment its probably unlikely i know in our previous submission we also addressed and i think to some extent in this one what actually attracts customers to banks i know its not topic of this hearing but with reference to your question about would more customers come to fnb there are wide range of factors that drive the choice of banking and it is very uncertain whether the drop in this fee would attract sufficient to ju stify it mr jordaan we would be uncomfortable discussing the exact number but i mean just to illustrate the point not theoretical point it is on th bottom of page 7 of our submission we have modelled what that then will do to fnb and i think if you look t that figure in the second column at the bottom it has got minus next to it177 the fact that fnb would not be able to attract enough customers from ot her banks to cover their direct revenue losses indicates that the customers of those other banks are effectively captured when it comes to their ability to exercise choice in respect of what they pay for off us atm cash withdrawals178 in addition to the immediate loss of disincentive or saswitch fee revenu the expected revenue loss would also be consequence of the fact that many of fnbs own account holders would have reason to avoid using other banks atm infrastructure whenever convenient thus increasing the amount of interbank carriage fees that fnb would have to pay out to other banks179 therefore the nature of the interbank arrangement in respect of atm transactions is such that any unilateral reduction of the disincentive fee for offus atm withdrawals would r esult in significant losses for the bank reducing the fee180 consequently individual banks gain much more from shadowing each other in respect of upward movements in price as the face 175 176 177 178 179 180 transcript 3 april 2007 pp 106107 id p 108 id pp 109110 the reference is to frb march 2007 second

generally in strategy of differentiated pricing aimed at segmenting the mark et so as to maximise revenues generated from different customer groupings th bank may charge lower fee or fee for particular transaction service in order to differentia its product however for the same product it will be prepared to charge higher fee than its competitors for another transaction service this suggests that the banks will exploit inelastici ties in respect of individual transaction services in order to maximise revenue at the product level in this regard the banks are cautious that their fees are not set so out of line with those of the competition that it would weaken the hold of the differentiated offering evidence regarding the setting of offus atm fees where price comparison is relatively simple sugg ests tendency on the part of the banks to set their fees within sufficiently close range of their rivals such that rival would be likely to impinge on the market share of the other given high degree of customer inertia and substantial switching costs we consid er that this behaviour tends to result in price rigidities with prices moving gradually upw ards over time181 as is demonstrated in the costing and pricing chapter of this report the lack of any identifiable relationship between the cost of providing ptas and related serv ices and the 181 see shy the economics of network industries p 309 this kind of behaviour is formalised in shy in terms of the undercutproof equilibrium upe upe states that firm will c harge the highest price it can while preventing its rival from undercutting and grabbing firm as customers in terms of upe prices tend to rise with distaste costs distaste costs include transport costs and switching costs chapter 2 market power 82 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information price charged for them points strongly to the exercise of market power by th major banks whose figures are presented and analysed in the case of penalty fees on debit order transactions its abuse is absolutely manifest 210 conclusions on market power although there is considerable scope to improve the competitive conditions of try and participation particularly in the case of payment services the persistence of high fixed costs and scale economies is such that competitive conditions on the supply side in fullservice banking are likely to continue to be restrictive competition problems on the supply side in the payment system are dealt with in detail in the chapter on access to the payment system as well as in the chapter on atm s and direct charging proposed remedies to address these problems are put forward in those chapters it is particularly important that the supply of payment services and components of payment services independently of deposit taking should be encouraged and thus cease t be the preserve of the banks the growing potential for this should be assisted throug h the removal of unnecessary barriers and through proactive and effective regulation which aims to facilitate rather than deter such development in our view change of mindset on the part of the regulatory authorities is called for in this regard we find that there are five main features of the market for ptas and related services which either singly or jointly confer on at least the major banks an apprec iable degree of market power and which tend to prevent restrict or distort competition in resp ect of the provision of ptas and related services throughout south africa complexity both inherent and undue in the provision of products and th structure of charges and fees inadequate disclosure and inadequate transparency of information in respect of product features and charging structures failure of consumers to actively question fees and charges associated with personal transaction accounts both for objective and subjective reasons considerable costs of searching and switching and resulting failure of consumers to actively search for competitive alternatives and switch to them oligopolistic conditions which reduce any incentive to lower prices reinforc the confidence of each bank in the expected reactions of its rivals engender price rigidities and produce tendency towards upward pricefollowing behaviour to the extent that these problems are rooted in the conditions which produce banking concentration global as well as south african phenomenon they are not suscepti ble to being resolved by any recommendations that we can make here however there are chapter 2 market power 83 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information number of particular changes that can be made which would serve to improve competitive conditions many of them are more appropriately presented and explained in the subsequent chapters of this report in this chapter we concentrate on remedies that we believe would stimulate price competition between banks in the provision of ptas and related services 211 recommendations there is clear need for measures aimed at improving the ability of bank customers to compare product offerings and prices switch providers with minimum of cost and difficulty in order to achieve these objectives we recommend the following182 2111 standards and criteria for transparency and disclosure the banking association after consultation with the ombudsman for banking services183 consumer protection agencies and organisations the regulatory authorities th competition commission and other relevant bodies should develop set of minimum standards fo r the disclosure of product and price information to be included in the banking associati on code of banking practice this code should at least include criteria regarding standardisation of terminology and plain language requirement communication and provision of information to clients requirement for at least certain minimum information to be included in bank statements summary and breakdown of charges and interest both debit and credit on every account 182 183 we have been greatly assisted in deciding on these recommend ations by the offtherecord and nonbinding exploratory process which was undertaken by the enquirys technica l team with the participation of all the major banks and several others after the formal hearings had been concluded the ex ploratory process took place as part of our engagement with the banks and others envisaged by paragraph 6c of t he enquiry terms of reference on this basis meetings to consider the practicality of various measures to improve comparability of bank products and prices and to improve the ability of customers to switch banks were held on 15 august and 4 september 2007 while we have drawn on ideas raised and points debated during those consultations th views formulated here are our own and are not attributed to any participant the particular remedies tha t were formally proposed by different banks in their extensive written submissions and at the public hearings became subsumed into broader discussions during the exploratory process accordingly we do not deal with them separately here i n the form in which they were originally advanced nor do we identify them as having emanated from particular banks those ori ginal proposals remain of course on the record of the enquiry should it be necessary to refer to them spe cifically see huhttpwwwobssacoza uh the ombudsman for banking services is an incorporated association not for gain registered under section 21 of the companies act 61 of 1973 as am ended it was established by the banking industry to provide an independent impartial dispute resolving service for bank customers and their banks the service is provided free to bank customers who have failed to resolve their di spute with their bank through its own internal procedures its jurisdiction is limited to banks that are m embers of the banking association and it may not assist in disputes involving banks commercial decision about lending or credit interest rates or bank charges unless there has been maladministration or fee or charge has been incorrectly applied the ombudsman for banking services is recognised in terms of the financial services ombud schemes act 37 of 2004 which commenced on 1 april 2005 see obs annual report 2006 p 2 the act serves inter alia to ensure the independence of ombuds both in the manner of their appointment and in the procedures for resolving compl aint or making determination see section 10 chapter 2 market power 84 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information advance notice of new charges and altered charges regular rights reminder to customers the code on transparency and disclosure should be subject to process of periodic review involving similar consultation the provisions of the code should be incorporated by reference into banks standard customer contracts so that the protection which they afford to customers be come part of the customers contractual rights capable of being enforced with the assistance of the ombudsman for banking services although membership of the banking association is not compulsory for banks and its code is therefore not binding on every bank all the major banks are members and would be bound by changes to its code should t his position change or should the provisions of the voluntary code prove inadequate for the purpose described legislative or regulatory intervention would be warranted to impose appropriate standards on all banks 2112 measures to reduce search costs and to facilitate comparisons while improvements in transparency and disclosure of product and price information should help reduce the costs of searching more direct and proactive measures are ne eded to simplify comparisons between the prices and product offerings of different banks generic customer profiles we recommend that generic customer profiles be drawn up and publicised to facilitate comparison shopping in this regard generic profile is essentially typical combi nation of customer needs for this purpose the banking association should initiate and support an independent process carried out by persons of standing and experience or expertise who cannot be considered to be beholden to or interested in supporting the preferences of any particular bank to establish limited number of generic profiles that would apply to various typical customers of all banks in the middle market segments this will not be simple task as banks themselves apply somewhat different cr iteria when deciding on the segmentation of their product market thus the profiles must be constructed from the point of view of various typical customers and not from the point of view of particular banks to the extent say that some customers may typically pref er product bundle emphasising electronic payment channels and others the facility of branch and paperbased transactions that would have to be taken into account in dec iding on the range of appropriate profiles chapter 2 market power 85 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information too many profiles would defeat the remedy whilst too few profiles would tend to distort investment decisions and stifle needed variety in banks offerings and the range of consumer choices once the profiles are established and publicised by the banking association the different banks can reveal in their own advertising and other information whether how and to what extent they accommodate them and their respective prices in that regard misleading advertising could then be combated via the advertising standards authorit y184 or with the assistance of the ombudsman for banking services regular review would be needed to account for changes in technology and consumer behaviour to monitor the effectiveness of the process in facilitating comparability and stimulating price competition to determine whether or not any changes to profiles andor the process is necessary in order to achieve the stated objectives banking fee calculator in addition to the process around generic customer profiles we are also in favour of other measures to facilitate comparative shopping one that has been suggested is centralised banking fee calculator service established by the banking association on similarly independent basis this should provide an accessible facility for consumers to input their own product requirements with assistance if necessary and obtain without cost an automatic objective indication of where they could obtain exactly those serv ices and for what prices it would be up to the banks to make available reliable product and pricing data open to public inspection and to audit and correction by the banking association in th event of dispute if they wish their services to be included in the answers supplied by th calculator service comparative advertising it was suggested by one of the major banks that laws and codes currently prohibit ing or restricting comparative advertising by firms should be changed to allow banks to compare their own prices and product offerings directly and explicitly with those of their rivals there is much to be said for this proposal however because it might require changes to trade mark and other complex legislation which might have various consequences in other industries that we are not in position to assess we refrain from making definite rec ommendation to 184 huhttpwwwasasaorgza u chapter 2 market power 86 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information that effect we recommend that the competition commission propose to the minister of trade and industry that serious consideration be given to such step basic banking product or products during the hearings on 18 june and 9 july 2007 the enquirys technical tea m mooted the idea that competition between banks would be enhanced if banks operating in the retail market were obliged to provide one or more basic banking products with si milar content capable of being simply and directly compared185 this would enable customers whose needs would be satisfied by such particular product to compare prices and c hoose their bank accordingly that in turn would intensify price competition and cut across the existing segmentation of the market at least to the extent that segmentation has been c ontrived by banks in order to maintain market power this gave rise to protests from banks with strong echoes in the financial press in our view this resistance to the extent that it is not based on misunderstanding is mainly because banks supracompetitive pricing in the retail market is heavily dependent on unnecessarily complex product bundling and segmentation of the market much of the argument raised against the basic banking product idea seems specious although initially conceived as single package it was not maintained that one si ze should fit all there is reason why there could not be several different basic pr oduct bundles offered just as there could be several generic profiles see above moreover there would be nothing to prevent banks offering addon features separately priced or bundling complete parallel offerings as they do at present provided the basic product or products were also offered alongside186 nevertheless to compel the adoption of such measure would invo lve considerable difficulties in practice and might serve to hamper product innovation thus benefi ts through intensified price competition might be offset by disadvantages to consumers which are difficult to assess in the abstract our recommendation is therefore that the basic banking product or products idea shoul d be put on hold if after two or three years the other recommendations put forwar d in this chapter have not been implemented or once implemented have not had the desired effect of increasing price competition and bringing prices for ptas and related services down significantly then the competition commissioner should revisit th idea with view to 185 186 exhibit yy slides 3335 transcript 18 june 2007 pp 3335 transcrip t 9 july 2007 pp 1213 this was made clear from the outset id slide 35 chapter 2 market

measures to reduce switching costs and to assist consumers in switching easier product and price comparison will not help consumers much if it remains too expensive or troublesome to switch banks measures to reduce switching costs and assist bank customers in switching are therefore of crucial importance code of switching practice we recommend that the banking association after consultation with bodies referred to in paragraph 2111 above develop set of criteria for switching code to be included i n the banking association code of banking practice this code should include criteria regarding the provision of sufficient information and documentation by banks to new and existing customers explaining the process of switching in their branches schedule in terms of which the old bank is to provide the new bank with information on standing orders and direct debits within specified period of time of receiving the request to do so schedule in terms of which the balance on the account standing orders and direct debits net of any charges and interest but including any interest due will be transferred from the old bank directly to the new bank and the account with the old bank closed within specified period of time provision to be made for customers to be exempt from paying or be refunded any fees andor interest charges which are incurred within specified period after t he new account is opened as result of failure in the switching process the code on switching should also be subject to an independent process of perio dic review following similar consultation central fica

such hub this has number of complex implications which we have not been in pos ition to explore nevertheless the potential benefits in facilitating switching are such t hat we would recommend that the national treasury encourage and pursue this investigation in consultation with the banking industry to see whether such central hub could be chapter 2 market power 88 banking enquiry report to the

number of other jurisdictions bank account number portability ie the customer retaining the same account number irrespective of bank has been explored wi th view to facilitating switching all the major banks at our request made detailed s ubmissions on the implications of introducing such measure here187 it seems clear that while bank number portability would facilitate debit order switching to some extent the costs that w ould be entailed in introducing such change throughout the banking industry would far outweigh the potential advantages accordingly we do not recommend the introduction of s uch measure we note that this was also the conclusion reached by the competition commission in the uk however particularly because great deal of comparative research material on the matter has already been gathered by the banks bank account number portability should be kept under consideration by the banking association as new technology develops 2114 expand the mandate of the ombudsman for

african banks to charge fee for almost every service associated with bank account sets them apart from banks in many other countries in 2005 study for the finmark trust in which south africa was compar ed with india kenya malaysia mexico and nigeria it emerged that south africa was the only country that charges fee for cash deposits and one of only few that charges fee for branch and atm cash withdrawals1 when compared with developed countries similar picture emerges for example in the 2004 task group report falkena iii it wa s noted that south african banks charge fee for transaction services for which there is explicit fee in many other countries2 the charging of an explicit price for service is generally desirable practice insofa r as it conveys useful information to consumers this can be contrasted with situ ation where services that are not directly charged for are subsidised by revenue collected from the consumer in other ways that can lead to inefficient outcomes as it may convey misleading information to consumers we note that the mere absence or presence of an explicit price for service does not say anything about whether or not competition is effective with respect to the provision of that service service which appears to be free may convey misleading informat ion to the consumer about the true cost of the service however an explicit price may be either higher or lower than the competitive price also conveying misleading information to the consumer in competitive market consumers should be able to make rational choices on the b asis of appropriate price signals this is because effective competitive pressure t ends to align the incentives of producers with the preferences of consumers in particular this bala ncing of consumer and producer interests should result in an efficient allocation of resourc in which the price reflects both the value of the service to the consumer and the underlyi ng costs associated with providing the service in our analysis of market power in chapter 2 we have shown that the banks do not compete fundamentally on price and that clear price signals are very difficult for customers to obtain 1 genesis an

group falkena iii report banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 3 costing and pricing 92 with view to assessing whether or not competition is effective as fa r as the provision of retail banking andor payment services is concerned the terms of reference of the banking enquiry required us to address the following subject matter the relation between the costs of providing retail banking andor payment services and the charges for such services the process by which charges are set the level and scope of existing and potential competition in this regard in this chapter we focus on the first two points above and not the level and scope of fees and charges however subsequent chapters of this report are devoted to particular pricing issues such as atm and penalty fees and their impact on consumers we commence section 32 by providing an overview of the charging practice s of the banks in this regard we look at the payasyoutransact and bundled packages of the banks and examine the fee structures applicable to them we find considerable price comp lexity in the fee structures of the banks who apply combination of ad valorem and flat fee formulas although bundled packages with fixed fees are easier to understand for consu mers they are currently differentiated to such an extent that comparison is almost imposs ible further complex payasyoutransact pricing is applied to bundled packages for transaction s which exceed the limits set by the bank providing the package such transaction pric ing is also applied to transactions which the bank does not include in the bundle next we examine the process by which charges3 for personal transaction accounts are generally set section 33 deals with unbundled options and section 34 wit h bundled options we find that pricing decisions of the banks are driven by number of considerations but are generally constrained only by what the customer will bear competition is not driven by price but rather by strategic positioning on the basis of differentiated product offerings the prices of which are difficult to compare in particular the banks employ strategy of differentiated packaging that seeks to segment customers into groupings based largely on patterns of usage and divided on the basis of income levels and ability and willingness to pay in this regard each bank will conduct market research an d on the basis of their understanding of customer preferences and behaviour will implement price structures and set price levels which they calculate will maximise profit generated from these customers in the medium to longer term4 we go on to examine the relationship between the costs of providing transac tion services and the charges for those services section 35 we find that banks do not consider per transaction costs in the setting of transaction fees until recently most of th em have been 3 the terms charges fees and prices are used interchangeably 4 see the analysis of oligopoly behaviour in chapter 2 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 3 costing and pricing 93 either unable or unwilling to find out what these costs are we find that while there m ay be objective difficulties of measurement and interpretation arising from the high fixed and common cost nature of multiproduct banking the fact that the banks have not had direct reference to the costs of transactions in the setting of prices reinforces our conclusion that they are sheltered from effective pricecompetitive pressure5 the fact that banks in south africa have not been subject to vigorous price competition explains in part why th ey have had little or interest in determining costs at the transaction level and why fees for transaction services do not bear any identifiable relation to the costs of providing those transaction services 32 overview of charging practices of the banks banks offer an array of transaction accounts and pricing options to consumers transaction accounts are broadly divided into current ie cheque accounts and transmissi on accounts the services provided by these transaction accounts generally include receiving deposits either from the customer directly or indirectly by receiving payments to the credit of the customer from third parties whether by cash cheque or electronic transfer repaying funds deposited either directly to the customer eg by cash dispensing through an atm or otherwise or indirectly by way of payments to third parties n the customers behalf the pricing structures on each of the transaction services within the tran saction accounts as well as the pricing packages for transaction accounts themselves differ greatly there are two main transaction account charging packages 321 unbundled payasyoutransact options with this option the bank charges fee per transaction or service the st ructure of the fee ie whether it is flat fee or an ad valorem6 fee will depend on the type and value of the transaction there will also usually be other basic charges like subscription fees and monthly account fees which do not directly relate to transactions on the account 322 bundled package options most package options offer specified bundle of transactions for fixed fee limits are placed on the type and number of transactions included in the bundle if the allowe d number 5 under effective competition the banks would surely need to better derstand per transaction costs to determine whether internal resources are being allocated efficiently 6 fee paid according to the value of the transaction banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 3 costing and pricing 94 of transactions is exceeded there will be additional charges transactions which are excluded from the bundle eg in many instances offus atm withdrawals are available to the consumer but are charged on payasyoutransact basis some banks offer packages where specified bundle of transactions are provided free for as long as the customer maintains minimum balance in their account7 if the balance falls below the required minimum per transaction charges are applied 33 pricing of unbundled options banks apply number of different pricing formulas transactions are charged on flat fee basis an ad valorem basis or on banded fee basis there are certain accounts offered by banks which charge monthly account administration fee in addition to charg ing on per transaction basis we describe each type of pricing formula below 331 flat fees flat fee simply refers to fixed amount th at is charged per transaction for example absa flexi account holders are currently charged flat fee of r550 for external debit orders8 the fee stays the same for each debit order transaction regardless of the v alue of the transaction for some accounts tiered flat fee structure applies whereby limit ed number of transactions are charged at lower flat rate per transaction after which high er flat rate applies per transaction for all subsequent transactions beyond the limit this penalty applies in varying degrees to specified transactions on the mzansi accounts provided by the banks9 for example for absa mzansi account holders in 2006 the following transaction limits applied you are allowed 5 credit transactions for depositing money into your account eg cash deposits or transfers into your account and 5 debit transactions for using the money in your account eg cash withdrawals or debit card purchases per month on your bsa mzansi account from the sixth debit or credit transaction onwards you will be c harged the normal transaction fee plus r1250 per transaction10 7 this option is not truly free because the customer will forgo th interest that would have been earned had the money been placed in an account that does earn interest 8 absa 2008 pricing brochure absa flexi account p 7 by an ext ernal debit order we mean one where the beneficiary is customer of another bank 9 mr rowlinson of wizzit pointed out i have never heard of product that penalises you for use with mzansi you get your first few transactions really cheap and or nearly free but i f you go and do ten transactions month you are actually penalised to the extent that those extra five are more expe nsive than charges on one of the traditional accounts

332 ad valorem fee structures under an ad valorem formula the fee will increase as the value of the transaction increases there are three different ad valorem pricing formulas that can be applied threepart formula most ad valorem fees have threepart formula that consists of minimum fee valuerelated fee maximum amount that can be levied the second part of this formula the valuerelated fee can either be inclusive of the first r100 paid or exclusive of that first amount to illustrate table 1 threepart ad valorem fee absa flexi account atm withdrawal sbsa classic current account debit orders pricing structure r 300 r060 r 1250 r325 110 r2900 result r300 for the first r100 withdrawn r060 for each subsequent r100 withdrawn or part thereof and maximum charge of r1250 which can be levied per

part of this for mula the valuerelated fee can either be inclusive of the first r100 paid or exclusive f or example see table 2 11 absa 2008 pricing brochure flexi account 2008 p 6 12 standard bank

transaction account products to illustrate the application of standard onepart twopart and threepart ad valorem formulas standard bank and nedbank apply similar ad valorem formulas in their pricing structures although not necessarily for the same transaction types fn b also applies ad confidential valorem formulas however as will be discussed below fnb has moved away from three frb part ad valorem formulas in favour of valuebanded fees for certain t ransactions15 in addition to applying the standard ad valorem formulas discussed above nedbank also applies its own somewhat different ad valorem formulas to certain transactions for example in the nedbank pricing brochure for 20062007 the following formula is applied to cash deposits r110 r10 min r10 which means according to nedbank you will pay r110 per r100 or part thereof with minimum of r10 to illust rate on r750 cash deposit you will pay r110 x 8 r880 however the minim um applies and you will therefore pay r1016 13 absa 2008

transaction plus r090 per r100 or part thereof absa applies the following formula to offus17 atm withdrawals on flexiselect accounts r600 r300 r095 which means r600 per transaction plus r300 for the first r100 withdrawn and r095 for each subsequent r100 withdrawn18 333 banded fee options fnb has argued that the threepart ad valorem formula is not well understood by customers in order to simplify pricing for their customers fnb replaced the threepart fo rmula with banded fee for certain transactions19 for example in november 2005 fnb introduced the following threeband formula for fnb atm cash withdrawals r5 r10 r15 which means r5 for up to r500 cash withdrawal r10 from r501 to r1000 cash withdrawal r15 for more than r100120 banded fee options like this have not as yet been adopted by the other banks fnb also stated that it is likely that banded fee option will be retained for atm cas h withdrawals as the reduced fee charged to customers making smaller withdrawals encouraged usage by account holders who would not otherwise use atms21 17 offus in this context refers to withdrawal from anot her banks atm absa refers to this in its pricing schedul as saswitch atm cash withdrawal 18

informationchapter 3 costing and pricing 98 nevertheless revenue per transaction on fnb atm cash withdrawals increased by 11 per cent following the introduction of the banded formula22 we now examine the banks rationale for adopting ad valore m pricing formulas 334 rationale for ad valorem pricing formulas in february 2007 the enquiry technical team addressed number of questions to t he four biggest banks regarding ad valorem fee formulas23 in addition to providing detailed information regarding ad valorem fee formulas the banks were asked to explain their rationale for applying ad valorem formulas to particular transactions the implication for each bank of changing from an ad valorem formula to simple or flat fee formula why it would not be feasible to change from an ad valorem formula to flat fee per transaction in their submission absa identified three main factors to justify t he use of an ad valorem pricing mechanism ad valorem pricing is used more generally by absa where one or more of the foll owing factors apply 1 to enable pricing to be varied across customers in par ticular to reduce the charges faced by lower income customers or customers making low val ue transactions 2 where costs andor risks vary with the magnitude of the transac tion eg atm cash withdrawals where cash handling costs increase with the value of th cash withdrawn 3 where competition and substitution between alternative means of pay ment must be considered where means of payment competes with an alternative payment mechanism which is priced on an ad valorem basis absa uses ad valorem pricing to encourage customers to use the more efficient lower cost means of payment for example electronic payments are encouraged over cheque payments24 similar reasoning is echoed in the responses of standard bank25 and nedbank26 both banks confidential frb confidential absa confidential emphasised that ad valorem pricing is necessary where the risk associated with the nedbank transaction increases as the transaction value increases it was submitted that the ad valorem formula allows the bank to lower its fees to customers making w value transactions by preventing the subsidisation of customers making high value transac tions by 22 id p 6 23 competition commission data request part addressed to ab sa standard bank fnb and nedbank february 2007 question 5 regarding

low value transactions which would occur if flat fee f ormula were confidential nedbank applied absa standard bank and nedbank argued that this is beneficial to low income customers who typically make low value transactions27 fnb has over time changed most of its ad valorem fees to flat fees or banded fees stating that customers better understand banded or flat fee formulas they do however argue that with certain transactio ns where risks and costs increase with the value of the transactions flat fees would not be feasible28 the subsidisation argument which the banks claim as consumer welfare justificatio n for ad valorem pricing implies that in the absence of an ad valorem formula and in the presence of flat fee structure the current pricing to low income customers would not be suffic ient to cover the costs of providing the services to those customers accordin gly higher flat fee would have to be charged for low value transactions the concomitant implica tion is that at least in respect of transactions where transaction costs do not vary significantly wit h value ad valorem prices for lowvalue transactions are generally set below cost this is illustrated in the figure 1 figure 1 flat fee vs ad valorem fees the banks subsidisation argument regarding the application of an ad valorem fee structure seems to imply that for low value transactions the cost of the transactio n is above the prices charged to those consumers ie c1p2 the application of flat fee would require price higher than the current price charged for low value transactions ie p1p2 however the banks have not provided any costing information to substantiate this we therefore cannot accept the subsidisation argument implicit in the banks consumer welfare justification for ad valorem pricing plausible though it may sound given the presence of market power in the provision of personal transaction accounts it may well be the case that 27 absa march 2007 second submission part data request p 11 in some instances lowincome customers prefer to make only few high value transactions see transcript 4 april 2007 p 21 where capitec point to the difficulties of steering client behaviour away from withdrawing all their funds on payday 28 fnb march 2007 second submission part data request pp 3 and 6 chapter 3 costing and pricing 100 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information even the lowest ad valorem prices applied are enough to cover those transaction costs that are not valuedependent furthermore it is likely that at cu rrent ad valorem fee levels in respect of such transactions customer preferences regarding high value and low value transactions would be distorted relative to what one would find in competitive market we find that there is not straightforward relationship between the pricing f ormula applied and the benefit to the consumer it would be naïve to accept that banks are driven simply by consumer welfare objectives when deciding what pricing formula to apply i n this regard it is instructive to examine the response of the banks to the question of the implication and feasibility of shift from an ad valorem formula to flat fee in its submission of 10 august 2007 standard bank confirmed that there is simp answer to this question regarding the revenue implication for the bank of such change banks noted that the impact could be either positive or negative depending on the level at which that flat fee is set if the flat fee is t at level higher than the current average fee value then the revenue of the bank will increase howe ver if the flat fee is set at level that is lower than the average fee value then revenue to the bank will decrease all else equal29 unfortunately none of the banks was able to quantify the impact on revenue of shift from an ad valorem formula to flat fee formula as noted by absa in its submission the amount by which customer fees for low transaction amounts would increase the impact on customer transaction behaviour and hence the precise magnitude of the impact on absas revenues will depend on factors including the pricing structure and level of competitor offe rings and customer reactions to changes in fees30 we do not suggest that ad valorem pricing is never appropriate competitive costrelated pricing would itself imply that price would vary with transaction value in respect of those transactions where cost varies with value but in that case subsidy would not ter into the variations in price in their submissions absa standard bank and nedbank emphasised that flat fee is not confidential appropriate where the level of risk to the bank increases with increases in the value of the nedbank transaction standard bank points out that the transaction costs and risks of cash and cheque withdrawals and deposits at the branch are directly related to the unde rlying transaction value and tend to increase as the transaction value increases ther efore for these transactions flat fee would not be appropriate31 29 standard bank august 2007 part data request question 5 30 absa march 2007 second submission part data request 2007 p 17 31 standard bank august 2007 part data request question 5 chapter 3 costing and pricing 101 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information while not referring explicitly to risk considerations regarding the application or not of an ad valorem formula fnb stated atm cash withdrawals branch withdrawals and deposits could not feasibl be charged at flat fees under flat fee system the average fee paid would have to increase above the current average paid in order to maintain revenues that cover the fi xed costs of providing these services flat fee at the current average rate would t be sufficient due to the decline in transaction volumes that would result from some f those customers previously paying the discounted rate for low value transactions not being willin g to pay the higher flat fee32 as we have pointed out in the absence of adequate costing information fr om the banks we are unable to accept the bald assertion that the average flat fee paid would have to increase in order to cover fixed costs nevertheless we accept in principle that ad valorem pricing may well be appropriate in instances such as those pointed out above wher transaction costs obviously rise with transaction value whether or not it might b acceptable in other cases would depend upon first establishing reliably what competitive costrelated price for the transaction would be and then considering the consumerwelfare argument for differentiating between customers based on their ability to bear the tru cost burden bank has put us in position to make such an evaluation and we remain convinced by the consumerwelfare argument advanced fnb acknowledges that for certain transaction types the demand for low value transactions is very price elastic while the demand for high value transactions is relativ ely price inelastic the ad valorem fee also has the effect of creating demand by charging less for small value transactions33 the ad valorem formula is therefore mechanism by means of which banks pricedifferentiate between low value transactions and high value transactions based on the different price elasticities of demand for these transactions irrespective of diffe rences in cost between low value and high value transactions that they are able to do s is itself manifestation of degree of market power or put differently of the degree to which they are sheltered from simple and direct price competition in respect of each of these services banks decision on whether or not to shift to flat fee would depend on th extent of revenue losses arising from reduced volumes of low value transactions this r eduction in volumes would be due to the increase in the fee for low value transacti ons that would be required to bring the level of revenue generated from the flat fee on par with the current level of average revenue which is not to be equated with the average level of costs if there are economies of scale the loss of volumes of low value transactions would push up average costs thus reducing profitability or potentially leading to losses for the bank 32 frb march 2007 second submission part data request p 6 33 id p 3 chapter 3 costing and pricing 102 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information calculating the magnitude of loss or profit arising from move to particular fl at fee for particular transaction would require knowledge of the average cost of that transaction however as will be discussed subsequently in this chapter the banks have submitted that they do not set fees on the basis of per transaction costs rather fees are reviewed with reference to the overall revenue generated from the customers entire transac tion basket to repeat without reference to the cost of the transaction one cannot s ay what level for the flat fee would be sufficient to cover costs given the presence of apprec iable market power on the part of the banks it is likely that the prevailing average fees under ad valorem structures for particular transactions are above competitive levels any change to flat fee structure would thus result in fee that would be high relative to the compet itive benchmark so long as the banks are able to exercise market power in their pricing decisions the claimed benefit of ad valorem pricing to lower income customers transacting on standard transmission accounts the claim that such pricing enables the banks t reduce the charges faced by such customers34 is not reflected in the actual pricing structures applied by the big four banks see

this is banded fee and changes with the value of the transact ion hence this cannot be seen as flat fee chapter 3 costing and pricing 103 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information for example in the case of mzansi accounts atm withdrawals are pri ced on flat fee basis at lower price for limited number of transactions and at higher price for subsequent transactions absa notes that the flat fee on mzansi atm cash withdraw als is to ensure financial sector charter compliance absa also applies flat fee for cash withdrawals on the mega save account to ensure affordability for youth market customers36 both mzansi and mega save account holders are likely to be lowincome customers this do not reconcile with their earlier arguments advanced regarding the benefits of ad valorem fees standard bank applies flat fee to its low income mzansi and plan customers however unlike absa the majority of standard banks current account customers are on bundled packages where neither ad valorem nor flat fee structures apply fnb argued that banded flat fee formula benefits consumers because it is easier to understand than an ad valorem formula and the reduced fee charged to customers making smaller wi thdrawals encourages usage by account holders who would not otherwise use atms37 while an ad valorem structure may result in lower unit charge for low value transact ions it does not necessarily lower the overall cost and utility to customers of doing transactional banking there are number of reasons behind this the ad valorem formula contains built in mechanism for fees to increase over time with inflation as average transaction values rise ad valorem fee revenue rises per transaction without the fees having to be explicitly raised while this generates more revenue for the banks it is harmful to consumers who end up paying more in fees in its submission fnb acknowledged that average revenue from ad valorem based fees increases over time as transaction values increase with inflation so if the ad valorem fee remains unchanged average revenue will increase with inflation38 an ad valorem structure is likely to increase the demand and thus volume of low value transactions relative to high value transactions this will not nec essarily lower the cost to the consumer for example it is possible that an increase in the number of low value transactions relative to the number of high value39 transactions could be more costly for consumers the outcome here would depend on consumers behaviour preferences and incentives regarding the optimum number of transactions to minimise overall costs ad valorem fee structures are not always understood properly by consumers who may end up making suboptimal decisions 36 absa march 2007 second submission part data request p 13 37 frb march 2007 second submission part data request p 4 38 id p 56 39 simply because transaction is classified as high value do not mean that low income consumer will not want to make it for example low income consumer who earns r2000 month may prefer to make single withdrawal of r1000 rather than number of smaller low value transactions chapter 3 costing and pricing 104 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information while the ad valorem structure may well result in lower unit charge for lowvalue transactions lowincome customers are not afforded this benefit 335 findings regarding payasyoutransact fee structures we have recognised that there may be potential benefits for consumers in ad valorem fee structures insofar as they may prevent high income customers from being subsid ised by low income customers in cases where transaction costs do increase with transaction values however as explained above in the absence of costing information the banks consumer welfare justification for ad valorem fee structures has not been substantiated the ad valorem fee formulas especially the three and two part ad valorem formulas of the banks have tended to be complicated and are often not well understood by c onsumers and thus potentially convey misleading price signals to consumers although there has been some movement to introduce simpler fee structures this problem still remains the sheer number of transaction types that are charged on payasyoutransac t basis and the variety of formulas applicable to each of them further complicate cho ices for consumers in particular it is very difficult for consumers to calculate the total cost fo r their entire transaction basket without detailed and predictable information about their expected transaction usage and without proper understanding of the various pricing formulas as we have found ourselves this process of estimation and calculation is diff icult and time consuming it is therefore not surprising to find that south african consumers are not well informed about what they pay in bank charges it is also not surprising to fi nd that their choices are largely driven by considerations other than price40 we find that overall the existing payasyoutransact options and applicable pricing structures have not been conducive to effective competition and have tended to support the maintenance of prices at above competitive levels it has been shown in the chapte r on market power that despite benefiting from economies of scale the banks have faile d to pass these unit cost savings through to lower prices the results of international fee comparison studies like capgemini41 and the monitor report42 also reveal interesting results regarding the impact of payasyoutransact pricing structures on product level prices capgemini based its study on unbundled payasyou transact current account products and found that fees paid per annum by south african current account customers on this basis were approximately double the international average 40 see the chapter on market power for discussion of the evidence in this regard 41 capgemini world retail banking report 2007 42 monitor group competitiveness report 2006 chapter 3 costing and pricing 105 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the fee comparison study in the monitor report was also based on unbundl ed payasyou transact products like capgemini monitor found that south african banks pricing was high in relation to other countries the south african banks criticised the validity of these reports on number of grounds among other things the capgemini and monitor reports were criticised for failing t take into account the bundled or package fee options of the banks however information obtained through the submissions to the enquiry and technical team meetings wit h the banks indicate that the majority of customers at the big four banks are on payasyou transact options43 not on bundled or package fee options moreover the criticism does not adequately answer the point it appears to be acknowledged that unbundled or payasyou transact pricing structures have involved higher fees being paid on average by customers transacting on that basis in the next section we examine the package fee options of the banks and assess w hether or not the pricing structures associated with bundled options are conducive to mo re competitive and affordable transactional banking 34 pricing of bundled options for this option the bank charges fixed monthly fee for bundle of transactions for each package the bank will specify the type and number of transactions included in the bundle the customer is charged on some or other payasyoutransact basis for transactions exceeding the number allowed for those types of transactions not included in the bundle the customer will also be charged on some or other payasyoutransact basis f or some packages the standard payasyoutransact fees are applied for transactions not incl uded in the bundle whereas for other packages special charges are applied table 2 in chapter 2 shows comparison of bundled current account options w ith the pricing and the terms and conditions applicable to each of them given the value proposition of the bundles provided by the big four banks uptake of the bundles seems to b very low44 the bundled packages have the benefit of single monthly fee for basket of transactions and this simplifies to some extent the calculation required to determine t he customers total monthly cost of banking also because the transaction bundles are structured around defined profiles of customer behaviour they have the potential to be less costly f or customers whose behaviour falls within the parameters of those profiles 43 sbsa is the leader with regards to the provision of packaged op tions yet according to the data provided by sbsa june 2007 costing and pricing appendix 1 only 86 per cent of all their personal transaction accounts are packaged options we do not have information regarding what percentage of accoun ts of fnb and absa are bundled and what confidential percentage are unbundled in the case of nedbank less than 1 per c ent of all their personal transaction accounts are bundled nedbank may 2007 second submission part data re quest 44 information provided regarding the number of personal transaction accounts in the banks submissions march 2007 costing and pricing nedbank chapter 3 costing and pricing 106 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in criticising the capgemini report standard bank stated that its bundled current account customers paid 45 per cent less than the international average claimed by capgemini 45 standard bank claims it has had success with packages over 60 per cent of its existing current account customers use bundled options46 however it appears that bundled options are not available to basic saving and transmission account customers the overwhelming majority of the banks account holders only 86 per cent of the total number of personal transaction accounts at sbsa are bundled47 the result is that the customers most in need of the cheapest transaction options facilities are not provided with them we tested whether or not bundled option would be cheaper than the unbundled payasyoutransact option for particular profile we could only carry out this test on current account as this is the only account type where bundled options are provided standard bank classic current account customer s choosing the bundled option typically carry out more transactions than those choosing the unbundled option and do so for much lower aggregate fees if payasyoutransact custom er carried out all the transactions provided for in the bundle the monthly fee would be more th an r700 compared to the bundled fee of r80 per month according to sbsas 2008 pric ing brochure not surprisingly bundled customers tend to be less constrained in the n umber of transactions they perform relative to payasyoutransact clients the following

incompatible with their needs can also end up paying for items that are never used given the presence of search and switching costs consumers cannot easily switch to more appropriate packages this implies greater costs for consumers but potentially increased revenue for banks it is important that high standards are set for transparency and disclosure and that measures are introduced to improve comparability of bundled options 48 sbsa august 2007 response to outstanding issues raised by the ban king enquiry annexure 4 49 capitec october 2006 first submission p 22 chapter 3 costing and

total cost paid by the customer the banks announce their fee changes to the public on an annual basis standard bank announces their annual fee changes in january absa in april and nedbank and fnb in july the new fees will usually become effective for customers at the begin ning of the month after the fee changes have been announced chapter 3 costing and pricing 109 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information each bank usually has an executive committee which manages the price setting process and decides on the level and structure of fees these pricing commit tees consist of representatives of different business units who make inputs regarding the re levant cost revenue and strategic interests of their business units the committee is responsi ble for making sure that these interests are balanced consistent and aligned w ith the overall pricing principles and strategy of the bank50 36 valuebased pricing the online investopedia forbes media publication defines valuebased pricing as pricing strategy in which products price is actively dependent upon its demand this method of pricing allows companies to take advantage of highly demande d products by charging more good example is how refreshments generally cost more at sporting events51 stated more generally valuebased pricing occurs where the firms product is not readily substitutable by other products or by the offerings of other firms valuebased pricing is distinguished conceptually from both costbased pricing and pricing that is competitionbased it depends either on the absence of rivals or on the good or service being sufficiently differentiated from its rivals so as to enable degree of market power to be exercised in the suppliers pricing decisions in other words it is designed to exploit inelasticities of demand valuebased pricing makes conscious and syst ematic the identification of what different customers or segments of customers can be expec ted to bear in paying for the goods or services offered it is of course not remarkable that firms price to what the market will bear an em phasis on valuebased pricing suggests simply that effective competitive constraints on price ar either absent or relatively weak the question then from societys point of view is how to reduce or eliminate the factors conferring on firms the power to price

uhttpwwwinvestopediacomtermsvvaluebasedpricingasp u chapter 3 costing and pricing 110 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information pricing is well established technique often applied in service industries particularly in banking52 in its written submission nedbank described this approach as follows nedbank adopts valuebased approach to pricing taking multiple factor s into account of which cost is only one consideration additional considerations incl ude value to client perceived and actual as identified through market research mar ket level product and market maturity cost and client behaviour53 during the same hearing mr ntombela of nedbank elaborated on the valuebased approach to pricing with reference to nedbanks pricing strategy mr ntombela we get feedback from clients on their transactional needs and preferences from number of channels from interaction with them through our branc hes call centre and complaints tracker system we analyse the feedback from cl ients regarding their needs and preferences we also run specific research to get feedback from clients around their needs and preferences what we then do is go into an analysis of local and international features and functionality to fulfil those needs and we then run research usi ng client focus groups b surveys with clients to get feedback from them around which of these features and functionalities would they like in an offering that they regard as of fering them value to fulfil their needs this is not an exact science the value that people attach to services varies it varies with customers it varies with the segment the people are in it varies with the way that they interact with the banks we then specifically ask questions from clients around price what do you think what are you prepared to pay for this t hat will in your mind make this good offer to you what do you think you are currently pay ing for similar service if it exists we then do competitive analysis to get view of what the m arket is charging for similar services we will then consider what strategic objectives we are trying to achieve with this offering we then estimate how many clients are going to take this up expected volumes values etc the next step is then to consider the r evenue that this new offering is going to generate and then test this against the incremental costs that providing new service will incur in this process we do not look at the cost f specific transactions54 this approach to pricing is broadly in line with the approach adopted by all t he other banks essentially this is strategy of differentiated pricing that seeks to segment custo mers into groupings based largely on patterns of usage and according to income levels in this regard each bank will conduct market research and on the basis of their understanding of customer preferences and behaviour will implement price structures and set price levels whic h they calculate will maximise profit generated from customers transacting ac ross the different channels55 costing information obviously plays role to the extent that banks must check whether or not revenue generated is sufficient to cover overall costs across the range of products or in the case of new products is sufficient to cover the incremental cos ts in this regard as noted by mr ntombela consideration is given at all to the cost of specific transactions in addition to differentiating within and across their own product ranges each bank uses pricing to differentiate their offerings from those of their competitors again t his is based on 52 transcript 9 july 2007 p 39 53 nedbank april 2007 second submission part data request p 3 54 transcript 9 july 2007 p 88 p 90 55 sbsa june 2007 second submission

information market research which seeks to determine the sensitivity to price of different customer segments for example standard bank claims to differentiate itself from t he other banks through its product offerings associated price levels price structures and competitive strategy56 the channel strategy of the banks is an important consideration affecting the sett ing of prices absa for example has noted that price structures are implemented and price levels set in order to signal to customers to use lowercost and more effic ient channels57 for example atm transactions are generally less expensive than equiva lent branch transactions because the branch is more costly channel than atms fnb submitt ed that an important part of its strategy is to encourage customers to use more effic ient transaction channels for example to move from branch to internet banking58 the banks have submitted that they take account of competing transaction types and competing accounts both from accounts within each bank and from accounts offered by competitors for example pricing structures applicable to mzansi are such that the re is little chance of mzansi cannibalising the other mass market account products within ea ch bank ad valorem pricing is also effective in maintaining segments within banks and preventing unwanted competition or arbitrage between products within banks for example absa noted that if personal banking fee structures were changed from ad valorem to flat fees fees would have to be set at level sufficiently high to discour age business banking customers from using personal accounts in lieu of business accounts for cash deposits59 given the extent to which the product offerings of the banks are differentiated t here is little scope for direct price competition on the level of fees for transaction services on unbundled payasyoutransact options bundled fee options are also not subject to direct price competition on the fixed fee because the bundles in each banks package are differentiated to such an extent that they cannot be compared directly each bank does have reference to the pricing of its competitors but only to ensure that its own pricing is not significantly out of line with that of the other banks in this regard we find particularly for unbundled transactions which are more directly comparable across banks that fees tend to follow each other upwards on average within fairly narrow range nedbank provides good example of what happens when fees step too far out of line nedbank lost market share by focussing its pricing on high income niche which it believed 56 genesis report prepared for standard bank critique of the monit or groups report competitiveness report international price comparison and competitiveness analysis page 2 57

pricing 112 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information would absorb the higher fees it ended up losing customers and further did not have appropriately priced options to attract customers in the growing middle and mas s market60 as consequence the other banks who had positioned themselves for the mid dle and mass market were able to grow their share of the market while nedbank lost groun d insofar as nedbank has begun to reposition itself to serve the middle and mass market its pricing seems merely to have moved broadly into realignment with the pricing of t he other banks with the exception of capitec which is limited at present to particular ie lower segment of the market we found evidence in the unbundled fee data we examined of undercutting of each other by any of the banks in conclusion we find that the banks implement price structures and set price levels n the basis of strategy of differentiated pricing which seeks to extract maximum sustainable profit from segmented customer base the customer base is segmen ted according to transactional behaviour patterns which tend to be associated with different income groups with each subsequent price review the banks learn more about consumer behaviour and preferences and adjust their pricing structures accordingly with view to achieving more accurate segmentation of the market as consequence banks have been able to increase revenue and volume 37 the relationship between the costs of providing transaction services and the fees charged for those services it is clear from the above discussion that prices for transaction services are not set on cost plus margin basis rather sophisticated qualitative and quantitative tech niques are used to assess price sensitivities and other aspects of consumer behaviour in order to determine price structures and price levels in competitive markets there is tendency for forces to drive prices do wn to the level of costs in such markets firms face downward pressure on price and are thus driven to reduce cost in order to increase or maintain their margins prices and costs ther efore tend to move together as we noted in the introduction to this chapter effective competitive pressure nds to align the incentives of producers with the preferences of consumers in particular this balancing of consumer and producer interests should result in an efficient allocation of resources in which the price reflects both the value of the service to the consumer as well as the underlying costs associated with providing the service 60 see nedbank may 2007 second submission part data reque st p 5 and transcript 9 july 2007 pp 32 37 38 79 for example chapter 3 costing and pricing 113 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information it is to this end that the terms of referenc of the enquiry have included in the subject matter to be considered the relationship between the charges for retail banking services an d the costs of providing those services the enquiry technical team reque sted the four largest banks to submit detailed information regarding the costs of transactions in particular template was presented to the banks with the following request as part of the competition commission enquiry into banking services the technical team needs to gain better understanding of the costs and revenues that are attr ibutable to services that are supplied through different banking products and banking c hannels to this end we have constructed template for each of the three main entry level accounts maintained by banks61 the template was to be completed along the following lines costs per transaction should be specified in the column cost per transact ion for each transaction type in the left hand column if direct costi ng allocation per transaction is not undertaken by the bank please indicate how costs are allocated and show the cost apportionment methodology workings in the space provided where the cost all ocation keys are different to those indicated in the template please specify the location methodology that you believe more appropriate the end result is that we are seeking your calculation or best endeavour to allocate costs per transaction in the absence of known costs or allocated costs please apply the methodology outlined in the template62 in response each bank provided comprehensive descriptions of their appro ach to costing and cost allocation although there were differences in detail in the approac h to costing by each bank they were unanimous in insisting that the difficulties of allocating costs and revenues to particular transactions are such that meaningful conclusions can be drawn about the level and structure of charges from comparison of revenues and costs on particular transaction types and particular account types we summarise their main arguments below banks are multiproduct firms with substantial common and fixed costs which cannot be directly allocated to particular transaction services or even to products63 banks offer multiple products including transaction accounts personal loans mortgages credit cards and insurance products products are also offered to variet of customers including individuals small businesses and corporate customers m any of the costs incurred by banks are common or shared across the different transaction types products and customers for example branch costs branches are used for the sale and delivery of variety of products and services to variety of customers the staff building and equipment costs are shared across all these products and services64 61 part b data request costing and pricing template for basic ban king products 62 id 63 sbsa april 2007

confidential information information technology infrastructure the it infrastructure the data communication links between branches and atms and it data centres themselves incur costs which are common to the provision of multiple products and services of the bank65 head office infrastructure the infrastructure office space staffing and equipment in the head office support the full range of products and services of the bank while staff and office space may be allocated to certain product lines many of the head office functions are shared across all products and services of the bank and thus cannot be easily allocated to product lines66 there is distinction between economic costs and accounting costs the latter cost method fails to take into account measures such as brand image development costs and the position of the product or service in the stage of the life cycle of the product or service67 approximately 80 per cent of costs are fixed and will therefore not vary significantly with changes in account or transaction usage different methods of allocating such fixed costs to individual transactions would give varying results depending upon the method of allocation used standard bank says the vast majority of our costs our capital our computer systems our branches and atm networks our staff in the distribution network and our headoffice expenses are fixed68 staff costs appear to be the single largest expense item for banks in general staff costs for absa accounted for r7810 million or 45 per cent of total costs69 for fnb staff expensesconfidential absa represented 453 per cent of it s total cost base of r10 billion70 the banks therefore confidential argue that it is not clear how staff costs should be allocated and what proportion of fnb these costs should be considered fixed or variable71 number of different costing approaches can be used each will yield different results and each can be used for different purposes it has been argued that because cost allocation exercises will be carried out differently by different banks it is unlikely that cost information provided by different banks will be comparable72 nevertheless to the enquiry the relationship between costs and prices of each bank still takes precedence over comparability between banks 65 sbsa april 2007 second submission atm transaction p 12 66

this means that revenue to cover these costs must be obt ained from other sources this further complicates any attempt to allocate revenues and costs to particular transactions73 absa and standard bank were not able to complete the costing information in t he template as requested by the technical team in this regard absa stated the areas where absa has been unable to provide detailed information in response to the confidential enquirys data request relate to unit costs by type of transaction and accountlevel specific information eg account opening maintenance and closing costs and

impairment costs the estimates of detailed transaction nd accountlevel costs contained in absas management information systems do not currently reconcile to absas general ledger and are not relied upon within absa for pricing or investment deci sions inconsistencies in absas cost allocation processes were identified during review of abs as costing methodologies in 2004 following which absa commissioned an activity based costing project in 2005 this project is now in its final stages of completion and is expected to be completed in early 2008 until that date absa does not have consistent cost ing data at the transaction and account level74 in written submission standard bank repeated its stance communicated at m eeting with the technical team on 5 april 2007 as to why it was not able to populate the co st elements of the template75 in relation to part b sbsa is unable to provide average cost per transaction costing data not generated the data that sbsa is not able to provide is

competition commissioner contains confidential information we note that while costs appear similar for some transactions they differ co nsiderably in respect of many others given that this information was submitted with caveats nd given the objective difficulties of interpretation and measurement we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from comparative analysis of this data however to the extent that they are indicative it is clear that the prices charged for these transactions bear relationship to the costs of providing them 38 conclusion banks do not consider per transaction costs at all in the setting of transaction fees until recently most of them have been either unable or unwilling to find out what these co sts are there are objective difficulties of measurement and interpretation arisin g from the high fixed and common cost nature of multiproduct banking for example it would be unrealistic to expect that there should always be very close relationship between fees for transactions and the direct costs of providing them on the other hand however the fact that the banks have not had any reference to the unit costs of transactions in the setting of pric suggests that they are sheltered from effective competitive pressure under effective competition the banks would need to know what these costs are in order at the very least to determine whether internal res ources are being allocated efficiently consider for example the possible entry of nonbank atm service providers if competition from these providers threatened to unde rmine the revenue stream of the banks from atm transactions then one would expect that the banks would require detailed information regarding the costs of providing atm transaction services t his is because they would need to know how the allocation and utilisation of resource s hinders or facilitates their strategic positioning in respect of the provision of these services the same argument applies in respect of the provision of any other payment service that could potentially be substitute for any of the transaction services traditionally pr ovided by the bank to its account holder this is because these providers would themselves incur costs that would have to be covered by appropriate pricing to the ex tent that these providers could potentially impose significant competitive constraint on the banks this would bring into sharp focus the costs of providing these services for both the banks and the new providers the fact that banks in south africa have not been subj ect to vigorous price competition explains in large part why they have had little or interest in determining costs at the transaction level and why fees for transaction services do not bear any identifiable relation to the costs of providing those transaction services however with advances in technology expanding the scope for alternative and innovative payment service providers this situation may be beginning to change numb er of banks have indicated move towards adopting procedures to estimate costs more ac curately at chapter 3 costing and pricing 119 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the transaction level79 absa indicated that in 2005 it commissioned an activity based cos ting project which is to be implemented in early 2008 by which time absa wi ll have consistent costing data at the transaction and account level80 nedbank noted that it is confidential our intention in the long term to use activity based costing to determine accurate product nedbank profitability at detailed level81 fnb is already engaged in sophisticated costing and has noted that these models are continuously improved over time as new information is collected82 standard bank on the other hand appears sceptical about the benefits of detailed costing studies although it has done some limited activity ba sed costing it submitted that data and methodological problems have hampered its application at standard bank however as we have noted above competitive pressure and adv ances in technology may mean that all banks including standard bank will eventually be ab to conduct detailed costing exercises if competition for payment services is allowed to develop by improving access conditions and otherwise lowering barriers to entry then one would expect to see prices and costs for transaction services aligning more cl osely with one another this is further discussed in the chapter on access to the payment system in market characterised by direct price competition firms price their products to attract and hold their customers in such world competition tends to drive prices towards c osts and so one would expect reasonable and rational relationship between price and cost in the case of retail banking it appears that banks capture their customers to price to them such capture is consequence of the market power of the banks search switching costs and information asymmetries are all important factors in this regard and have b een dealt with in some detail in the chapter on market power this market power allows the banks to segment the market through the application of differentiated price and product option s the application of complicated fee structures the addition of new fee categories and general increases in the level of fees are all manifestatio ns of this power in this regard it is very important that high standards are set for transparency and disclosure and that measures are introduced to improve comparability of bundled options the pricing initiatives said to be aimed at reducing the feeburden on cust omers such as ad valorem pricing banded fee options and appropriate bundled packages which were highlighted by the banks during the course of the enquiry do not appear to be generally offered to lowerincome customers it is puzzling that the benefits of such initi atives do not accrue to those who most need it building on from our recommendations in the market power chapter we recommend that together with improving transpar ency standardising 79 absa may 2007 second submission part b data request p 5

subject of penalty fees we confine our analysis to the fees charged by banks to individual retail customers when the customers paym ent order is refused usually for lack of funds these fees are commonly referred to as dishonour fees the data relied on relate only to personal transaction accounts ptas nd thus exclude corporate and other business customers within the category of dishonour fees we have further concentrated on fees c harged for rejected debit orders in this area we have seen clear indications of growing proble m of abuse cheques on the other hand are in decline as means of payment and the risk s for banks which arise when cheques are written against insufficient funds are significantly different from those involved in the routine processing of debit orders penalty fees are difficult to define and banks ascribe different meanings to th term for example the higher per transaction fee that may be charged to customer who uses more than the permissible number of transactions in particular bundle may or m ay not be specified as penalty there is magic in the label we have not considered it necessary to analyse such fees separately from our general treatment of costing an d pricing in the previous chapter the same applies to fees charged for rejected atm transactions even though technically they could be included among dishonour fees number of other categories of penalty fees charged in the past by south african banks are now outlawed in terms of the national credit act these have been sum marised by fnb at our request1 honouring fee excess item

substantially different penalt fee on different types of account moreover there are huge disparities in the penalty fees char ged by different banks for the same transaction the four major banks were asked to provide unit costs for various transacti ons in ptas two banks fnb and nedbank provided the requested information although with qualifications that cost allocations can be misleading where used for different purposes we accept that the unit costs reported are only approximations nevertheless on savings accounts fnb reported transaction cost of r180 per successful debit order while nedbank repo rted cost of r142 per successful debit order compared with the cost of rejected bit order of confidential r418 and r488 respectively these values bear evident relationship to the fees

roughly twice as high for basic savings or transmission ac counts as for all ptas taken together in other words in accounts typically held by lower incom customers relatively high proportion of debit

major banks provide grounds for grave disquiet in general the vulnerability of the ordinary customer to exploitation and abuse through penalty fees is considerable p ayment by debit order is routinely required nowadays for all manner of regular services which have become an essential part of everyday life reliance on debit orders is widespread through out the mass market served by banks and it is notable that debit order facilities have recently been added to the basic mzansi account offerings true the customer undertakes when opening transaction account to have funds available in the account to meet any payment instruction which the customer issues penalty fees in the strictest sense are said to provide compensation for the bank for breach of contract by the customer while discouraging such further behaviour although the bank in rejecting the payment instruction does not pay money out it does incur costs and is said to be exposed to risk through the undisciplined and undesirable behaviour of its customer pe nalty fees are said to be necessary means of protecting banks while this argument may have validity where customers write cheques for which they have not provided sufficien t funds we are not persuaded by it as justification for the dishonour fees currently being charged by the major banks where electronicallyprocessed periodic payment orders are concerned the argument that penalty fees are necessary to deter kiteflying or crossfiring the depositing of worthless cheques and drawing against them by the customer before the funds are cleared has evident relevance to debit orders references to the cost of risk management systems needed to detect and forestall such activities w ould seem to be similarly limited in relevance14 costs incurred by bank in deciding whether or not to extend credit facility to its customer who lacks sufficient funds to meet debit order cannot legitimately be recovered by way of di shonour fee and honouring fees are now evidently prohibited by the national credit act see above the assertion that banks suf fer significant harm to their commercial reputations when their customers debit orders ar rejected as unpaid is supported neither by evidence nor in our view by the probabilities15 merchants accepting or declining to accept debit orders from particular customers surely evaluat the likelihood of the customer defaulting not the customers bank all the major banks assert that penalty fees including fees for rejected debit orders are readily avoidable by the customer by the simple expedient of keeping enough m oney in confidential absa 14 see transcript 18 june 2007 pp 8993 mr tshabalala of standard ba nk mr shuter of nedbank likewise sought to defend existing penalty fees for rejected debit orders with

take account of confidential absa social reality little like marie antoinette saying let them eat cake many ordinary bank customers are not in position to pad their bank accounts th ey face the situation where when credits such as salary payments are delayed this cause s the debit orders which they have signed in good faith to bounce for insufficient funds it is not matter of neglect or irresponsibility but of circumstances beyond their control17 yet the penalty fee is applied per debit order item so that customer may face mu ltiple penalties to add to the primary misfortune of getting paid late it is also not unusual for debit orders to allow the creditor to increase the amount of the payment claimed when the p rice of the service is increased customers on low incomes with tight credit margins can re adily find themselves lacking sufficient funds without having had any intention of defa ulting on their payments or of breaching their undertakings to the bank it seems to us quite unacceptable that bank should recover more than the c ost incurred in processing the rejections in such cases18 it is answer for banks to say that on application they might reverse the penalty fee in deserving case19 very many consumers even if they were assured of the possible indulgence would suffer in silence rat her than muster the confidence or find the time to challenge the debit when it ap pears on their account20 where particular customer repeatedly issues payment instructions for which he or she fails to provide sufficient funds the bank can protect itself by terminating the banker customer relationship and closing the customers account where serious rm is suffered by the bank through particular customers breach of contract an action for damages is available there is reason to suppose that fraudsters are deterred by the existence of penalty fees at the same time the alleged deterrent effect of penalty fees on the behaviour of ordinary customers is not reflected in the rate of dishonoured transactions on ptas which has been rising steadily see figure 4 above the assertion by mr shuter of nedbank21 that penalty fees are deterring default is

demonstrated by the fact that the number of customers who incur penalty fee more than once is much less than the number of customers who incur the first one22 we do not find that reasoning convincing and least of all where debit orders are concerned most customers signing debit orders will have intention of defaulting inter alia because they will want to retain the services for which their periodic payments are to be made it is also unclear how many poorer customers simply abandon their bank accounts when faced with penalty fee debit moreov er calculations based on frbs submission23 show that dishonoured debit orders as percentage of total debit orders decreased from 67 per cent in 2003 to 61 per cent in 2004 and to 59 per cent in 2005 but then rose again sharply to 68 per cent in 2006 the claimed link between penalty fees and improved customer behaviour is thus not persuasive in our view moreover the whole argument based on disciplining the customer by w ay of the routine charging of penalty fees rests on an objectionable premise by this lin of argument banks in effect assert right to be judges in their own cause where dealings between ordinary mortals or companies are concerned when one contracting party breaches their obligations and causes expense or loss to the other the latter has to claim compensation and enforce that claim in the courts if payment is not forthcoming wh ere contractual penalty is specially provided for the same applies bank however is in the unique position of having the customers deposit at its disposal into which it can dip its own spoon although the funds deposited become in law the banks money with th bank having an obligation to repay the balance to the customer on due demand24 in effect the bank is able by debiting penalty fee to help itself to compensation the law shou ld be taking dim view of this form of selfaward in much the same way as it frowns on other forms of extrajudicial selfhelp the fact that the bankercustomer contract may authorise the bank to make the bit does not alter the essential iniquity from social perspective where routine trans actions such as debit orders are concerned here we have pacta sunt servanda the legal principle that contractual obligations once undertaken must be observed operating in conditions of gross inequality both of bargaining power and means of enforcement the fact that major banks can also exercise market power in determining the level of the penalty only makes matters worse it was suggested in the hearings that the prevailing penalty fees should be regarded as justified because banks customers are protected by the conventional penalties act25 this confidential frb 22 transcript 9 july 2007 p 171 23 frb march 2007 second submission part data

hearing of claim for penalty it appears to the court th at such penalty is out of proportion to the prejudice suffered by the creditor by reason of t he act or omission in respect of which the penalty was stipulated the court may reduce the penalty to such extent as it may consider equitable in the circumstances provided that in determ ining the extent of such prejudice the court shall take into consideration not only the creditors proprietary interest but every other rightful interest which may be affected by the act or omission in question27 first banks are not in the habit of claiming penalty fees by suing their custom ers in court they simply debit the fees to the customers accounts in fact about 24 million t imes in one year by the big four banks alone see table 1 above second for the customer to have to challenge the debit each time by way of court action in order to have the fee red uced is patently ridiculous third even in such case it would be far from certain that the proceedings initiated by the customer would be characterised as claim for penalty to which the act would apply fourth even if the act were to be held to apply the customer would bear the onus of proving the disproportion between the penalty and the prejudice suffered by the bank28 this when banks themselves claim not to know precise ly what particular transactions cost them and when the broadest nonpropr ietary interests of the bank would also have to be quantified fifth it would be an easy matter for bank to avoid the act by so wording its bankercustomer contract that the fee would be triggered by an act or omission by the customer not technically treated as contractual breach29 in short it would take franz kafka to imagine more hopeless legal labyrinth for bank ing consumers needing way out of unfair penalties apart from their overall vulnerability to having their deposits unceremoniously eroded by their banks customers are in our view kept significantly in the dark over penalty fees ve ry often customers are not aware of the full extent of the penalty fees they can incur and wil l only become aware of these fees to their horror after substantial sums have been deduc ted from their accounts30 penalty fee categories including fees for rejected debit orders are now generally disclosed by the banks but the information remains incomplete in the case of fnb only the minimum charge per item for dishonoured paym ents is disclosed in its fee brochures the customer would not appreciate from the broc hure that the indicated minimum fee of r30 per item on savings

twelvemonth cycle and minimum fee of r95 per item on other ptas would increase to r120 per item31 in absas case the meaning of minimum fee in its 2008 pricing brochure remains obscure by taking note of this particular feature of penalty charges where fnb and absa are concerned we do not mean to exonerate other banks in our view it is not at all clear to banks customers how penalty fees are applied this is something which we have tried to uncover during the enquiry let us take as an example an ordinary debit order drawn on savings or curr ent account which provides for series of periodic payments on the first day of each month for twelve months from january to december on the third occasion that it is present ed 1st march the debit order is rejected for insufficient funds the bank charges its customer the d ebtor dishonour fee of say r100 if other debit orders falling due at the same time have also bounced which is quite likely then the dishonour fee imposed on the customer would be multiplied since the fee is charged per item suppose the creditor holding th debit order wishes to have it presented again for payment after few days expecting that the debtor may by then be in funds can the creditor do this and if rejection occurs again w ill the dishonour fee be charged again and if the payment due in march has failed can the debit order be presented again for purposes of the april instalment etc it turns out that the only general protection that the debtor has against repeated levying of penalty fees for the same debit order arises indirectly from the rules that are applied to inter bank clearing of debit orders when our hearings began these pch rules although submitted to us were covered by claim of confidentiality certainly banks customers have been altogether in the dark about their provisions during the hearings the claim of confidentiality was lifted in the rules governing the clearing of debit and credit electronic funds transfer payment instructions ie the pch clearing rules applicable int er alia to ordinary debit orders32 paragraphs 3192 to 3194 provide as follows when an item is returned unpaid the user33 must attempt to get payment outside the system if an item is returned not provided for on two consecutive mandated action dates the user must remove the payment instruction from the system unl ess the user has received new subsequent commitment from the payer to meet future payments when an item is returned account closed or payment stopped the user may not submit the item again these provisions evidently mean that the ordinary monthly debit order in our example once it had been rejected on 1st march could not be presented again for payment during march the creditor would have to attempt to get payment from the debtor for the march instalment 31 frb march 2007 second submission part data request p 11 co mpare mr jordaan transcript 9 july 2007 p 159 we have brochures which detail the fees every single fee th

the eft pch rules 33 the user means in effect the creditor holding the debit order chapter 4 penalty fees 137 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information outside the interbank payment clearing system however the debit order could still be presented again for purposes of the april instalment once that instalment fell due and so on if the debit order were to be rejected again for insufficient funds in apri l or on any two consecutive due dates then it would have to be removed from the system unless replaced by renewed commitment from the debtor to meet future payments debtor may at any time instruct hisher bank to stop payment of debit order or close the account n which it is drawn whereupon it may not be submitted again the creditors recourse against the debtor would then lie outside the system we believe that banks customers are not generally aware that they have the power t stop debit order by simple instruction to their own bank and that they do not n eed the permission of the creditor the holder of the debit order in order to get the bank to discontinue payments on their behalf customers generally should be more clearly advised of this by their banks see further below this is separate matter from any breach of contract that may result as between debtor and creditor when payment is stopped despite the existence of these rules absa acknowledged that multiple rejec ted debit order fees can arise when the merchant presents the same debit order multiple times 34 although the eft pch rules state that the mandate in respect of debit order that has been returned for lack of funds on two consecutive occasi ons is regarded as cancelled mr von zeuner explained banking systems do not currently identify those instances w here debit order is presented more than twice manual checks are however performed when concerns are r aised about this by specific user35 fnb agreed that the rule is difficult to monitor 36 it should be noted furthermore that the pch rules relate to interbank clearing they have application to debit orders processed within single bank ie where both the debtor and the creditor beneficiary are customers of the same bank37 moreover the pch rules restrict the number of times single debit order can attract dishonour fee they do not deal with the problem of multiple debit orders hitting the account of the customer with insufficient funds the banks own rules and practices regarding the number of times that penalty f ees could be charged to customer in respect of refused or rejected debit orders have remai ned far from clear 34 transcript 17 july 2007 p 5 mr von zeuner 35 id p 7 36 frb additional submission july 2007 penalty fees p 3 37 the penalty fee to the customer is the same in both cases

clearing rules nevertheless said the fee will be charged as often as the default happens38 he confirmed that every incident of default attracts penalty except in the case of mzansi accounts where the first such incident attracts fee39 mr von zeuner of absa referred to the fact that the enquiry panel had raised t he question of default charges where electronic payments are concerned when we look at the issue he said we believe that there is room for improvement in the area of rejected debit orders40 in written submission absa had acknowledged there is generally limit on the number of times that default charges are vied fee will be levied each time the default behaviour occurs returned or rejected debit order s are an exception to this from june 2007 absa will be introducing pricing cap on mass market savings accounts eg mzansi and flexi save to limit the maximum num ber of charges that can be posted to customer accounts41 absas 2008 fee brochure now indicates that on mzansi accounts the first dishonoured transaction per month attracts penalty fee while dishonoured transactions thereafter attract minimum fee of r30 in the case of flexi accounts the minimum dishonour fe is r36 with only the first four being charged per month the reference here to minimum fees is curious new feature the position for the customer therefore remains obscure in the case of fnb the first dishonoured transaction on an mzansi account attr acts penalty fee while flat fee of r30 is applie d to dishonoured transactions thereafter in the case of smart transmission accounts and other ptas however the fee for dishonoured transactions is described as minimum fee after three unpaid items in rolling 12 month cycle the fee indicated in table 2 and table 3 above is further escalated substantially42 this important detail makes appearance in the banks pricing brochures mr tshabalala of standard bank while contending that penalty fees are normal and ubiquitous and that it was the duty of the bank to charge them43 acknowledged that it was unfair to treat rejected debit orders in similar way to cheques especially where the low end of the market is concerned44 thus standard bank had now capped its

charged maximum of two rejected debit order penalty fees per month nevertheless the penalty fees remain substantially out of proportion to rele vant costs and there is cap to the number of times penalty fees can be imposed for rejected debit orders on current accounts46 in an attempt to address the concern where the same payment order is presented numerous times by creditor there have been some industry innovations mr tshabalala the industry working with the regulator has come up with two systems aedo and naedothe essence of it is that the customer is in trolthe benefit of this is that the rules are that first the salary has to go in so lender c an jump the queue and hit the account before the salary has gone in the point being that you cannot do it more than once if you do it more than once you are only charged once so you only char ge the penalty once as opposed to 5 10 15 or 20 times47 aedo and naedo are the types of early debit order edo their operation is analysed in some detail in the chapter of this report on payment cards and interchange here nly one aspect need be considered the pch rules allow for credit tracking in the edo payment streams whereby payment instructions are processed minimum of twice per da for up to 32 days this raised the concern that multiple penalty fees could potentially be ap plied by the defaulting customers bank to the same debit order item in the same month in submission dated 10 july 2007 pasa has clarified at our request how the credit tracking process works if beneficiary user of an edo stream requ ests credit tracking in respect of an early debit order then the paying bank will implement it48 the service is paid for by the beneficiary credit tracking is applied in two forms limited and full cr edit tracking in the case of limited credit tracking the paying bank ascertains twic day over the requested period whether or not funds have been credited to the customers acc ount so that the debit order can then be paid in the case of full credit tracking the posting of credit at any time of the day will cause the pending debit order to be fetched for immediate processing pasa regards credit tracking as repeated representment of the payment 46 id p 4 47 transcript 18 june 2007 pp 9394 48 transcript 17 july 2007 p 6 absa cf also sbsa august 2007 seco nd submission part data request annexure 3 p 1 frb march

the number of times that customers bank could pote ntially levy penalty fee is matter currently within its own hands this is not satisfactory when it comes to major banks charging their accountholders for unsucces sful early debit orders the pattern is currently uneven nedbank testified that it charges penalty at all for failed debit orders in the edo streams and indeed sees that as one of the objects of aedo and naedo50 absa has also not been charging its accountholder for default in these streams51 in the case of standard bank mr shunmugam testified obviously the charge to the customer is at the end of the tracking cycle so if after three days he tracks and he picks up there is funds there and it is successful there is unpaid charge but if at the end of the 32 days or whenever is stipulated there is an unpaid then we will generate an unpaid fee at the end of the tracking cycle once52 however this statement appears to have anticipated things to some degr ee in subsequent written submission standard bank clarified its position at this stage sbsa only charges the corporate for unsuccessful aedo and naedo transactions sbsas in tention is to levy an unpaid fee on the paying customer in the future in the same manner as for an ordinary debit order at the end of the tracking period this is not being done at present due to technical limitations 53 according to subsequent submission by standard bank on 20 march 2008 this seems to have taken effect fnb in response to request for additional information 17 march 2008 has stated that it charges the account holder r265 as an unsuccessful transaction fe in the naedo stream the edo stream in which it is involved54 this evidence shows the vulnerability of the customer to penalty fees being imposed in the edo streams at the discretion of individual banks as the case of standard bank shows this can be at the same exploitative level as now prevails for rejected ordinary bit orders at the same time as the case of fnb reveals with its unsuccessful transaction f ee of only r265 the earlier argument about the vital need for penalty fees to be high in order to deter customers from signing debit orders which they cannot meet is radically undermined 49 since the edo systems are not real time systems pinging can take place 50 transcript 9 july 2007 p 121 ms whateley p 122 mr mclachlan 51 transcript 17

penalty fees 141 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the panel raised the question of whether the corporate beneficiary which attempts unsuccessfully to collect on debit order for which the debtor has fund s should be charged penalty fee mrs nyasulu of the panel suggested that it is fairer to the end consumer if you levy the charge against the beneficiary because after all they wer the ones who went through credit granting process and took the responsibility to lend t that particular individual55 however standard bank argued that since breach of contract by the corporate is involved such fee would not be applicable on the other hand if customer incurs fee for returned debit order he or sh would have incentive to advise the corporate of change of bank account or salary payment date the corporate has means of monitoring these changes matter how careful it is at the time of accepting the debit order if there was fee for the customer the number of unpaid debit orders would increase aside from the adverse consequences to the bank of high levels of unpaid debit orders the corporate would incur increased costs in the form of increa sed administration increased credit exposure and related interest and would increase its charges to th customer56 fnb submitted earlier the fact that debtor will pay his bank for failing to honour commi tment to creditor provides the latter with comfort that debit orders and cheques will most likely be honoured57 unmistakable in these passages is the banks assigning to themselves the role of protectors of the collecting customer the corporate by penalising their own accountholding customers the man and woman in the street for failing to pay in contrast mr von zeuner of absa suggested that banks should actually assis t their customers in cancelling debit orders in order to reduce the incidence of rejected transactions he proposed exploring the possibility of cancelling debit order agreements at the bank this will enable banks to provide customers with the ability to cancel direct debits this is analogous with the bacs scheme rules in the uk which allow customers to cancel di rect debit at any time by phone or internet although in some instances written confirmation can be required the customer still bears the responsibility of making alternative payment arrangements58 this is something we believe should be supported and implemented by all bank s and we recommend accordingly it would not however alter the need for decisive regulatory intervention in order to protect banks customers from exploitative dishonour fees in respect of all debit orders 55 transcript 18 june 2007 p 160 56 id pp 12 57 frb march 2007 second submission part

on debit order dishonour fees the task group report falkena iii recommended that penalty fees shou ld be on cost plus basis and open to regulatory oversight59 this recommendation appears to have been ignored in our view the abuse of debit order dishonour fees analysed above needs to be addressed through the recommendation below without delay we do not thi nk that it is likely to be combated effectively enough or with the necessary clarity and certainty by way of section 8a of the competition act the data provided above shows that in 2006 the cost to banks of processing reje cted debit orders was below r5 per item see figure 3 indeed capitec charged the customer only r3 per dishonoured item and was presumably covering its cost see table 2 today capitec charges r350 the processing costs of the major banks may well be even lower than those of capitec therefore based on this data we have reason to believe that currently banks would be unable fully to recover their costs ordinarily incurred in re spect of rejected debit orders including fair return on outlays by means of fee capped at approximately r5 per dishonoured item the appropriate cap should be imposed by regulation it should apply both to savings and current accounts and to ordinary as well as early debit orders the cap should be regularly reviewed in order to take into account changes in costs banks which incur additional expenses or losses in particular cases through their customers default in respect of debit orders can terminate those customers accounts andor sue for damages th ey ought not to have the liberty to help themselves to some selfdetermined compensation ut of their customers accounts the regulatory remedy should also include provision to ensure that the representation of dishonoured items cannot itself amount to an abuse whether such price regulation should be imposed using existing regulatory powers of the sarb or by way of section 91 of the sale and service matters act 25 of 1964 as amended or by other existing or special legislation is matter on which we are not best placed to express an opinion in our view if the necessary regulatory intervention is not forthcoming within reasonable time the commissioner after consultation with national treasury and sar b should recommend to the minister of trade and industry that he consider directing the consumer

5 atms and direct charging 146 51 introduction and synopsis atm cash withdrawals are common activity for most bank customers i n 2006 around 1 billion atm transactions were made through the network generating gross revenues in excess of r4 billion for banks we have come to the conclusion that pricing arrangements between banks have served to shelter the provision of atm services from effect ive price competition and that this situation needs to be changed it seems clear to us that the market power of the banks in the provision of personal transaction accounts set out in chapter 2 extends to the provision of atm cash dispensing services this is so because the big four banks dominate the provision of atm services such services are linked to the provision of bank accounts and are not off ered separately the current interbank pricing arrangements shelter fees from price competition and the restriction of the acquiring of such transactions exclusively to registered banks inhibits competition from nonbank atm service providers together these factors reinf orce the market power of banks over customers in this chapter we are concerned with the pricing arrangements that are curre ntly in place when customer of one bank uses the atm of another bank while only 15 per cent of atm transactions are of this kind analysis shows that they have been unduly restricted nd that the pricing arrangements in respect of them have had and continue to have repercussions for all cash withdrawal transactions made at an atm we have concluded that the problem can best be addressed by shift to direct charging model which would enable price competition for atm services and contribute to the development of market for cash dispensing services that is longer the special preserve of banks so far as possible in our analysis we adhere to the terminology conventionally used by banks among the key terms are onus offus issuer and acquirer when customer uses an atm other than that of his or her own bank it is known as an off us transaction the converse is an onus transaction where the atm of the customer s own bank is used the bank which has the customers account is known as the issuer or issuing bank because it has issued to the customer the payment card necessary for the tran saction the bank providing the atm service is known as the acquirer or acquiring bank because it acquires the transaction into the network when the atm is used in an onus atm transaction the same bank is simultaneously both the issuer and the acquirer and it directly charges its customer for its services in both roles in an offus banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 147 transaction on the other hand the roles of issuer and acquirer are separated t his raises the question of how the customer is to be charged currently where the customer of bank b holding payment card issued by that ba nk uses an atm provided by bank the cash dispensing service is provided to that cust omer by bank on behalf of bank b in this situation bank does not charge the customer directly the customer remains simply the customer of bank b and is charged by the latter f or the service actually provided by bank bank c harges its fee to bank b at settlement later in the day the amount of the dispensed funds is transferred by bank b to bank together with the fee in other words in this case bank b compensates bank by sharing its own fee revenue from its customer with bank the fee that is paid by the issuing bank bank b to the service provider bank for an atm transaction is generally referred to as carriage carriage is fee agreed upon between banks ie an interbank fee in south africa carriage is uniform across the banking industry1 while carriage is uniform the fees charged by issuing banks to their cust omers for offus atm withdrawals vary significantly the consumer is typically charged substantially higher fee for offus trans actions and for an average sized cash withdrawal substantial part of this fee is retained by the issuing bank although it has not provided the cash dispensing service not only is carriage itself sheltered from competitive forces the consumer is not free to shop around for atm services but also by interbank arrangement treated as belonging to the issuing bank in all atm transactions accordingly banks own atm services to their customers are also significantly sheltered from competition if the carriage fee is abolished and the cash provider instead charges the consumer directly for the cash dispensing service ie if the direct charging model is adopted price competition can become more effective we recommend that the current interbank pricing system of carriage be replaced with model of direct charging in the atm s tream as soon as possible some argue that carriage is merely particular form of interchange term wide ly used to refer to interbank charges and that if interchange is necessary and permissibl in other payment streams there is reason it should not also be so in atm transacti ons for reasons developed in this chapter we do not accept the comparison between carriage and interchange and we do not consider that the continuation of interbank arrangements in respect of carriage is justifiable 1 for atm cash withdrawals the only exception applies to offus withdrawals by mzansi account holders here carriage is also set at uniform level but is calculated by slightly different formula banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 148 the service of cash dispensing by means of an atm transaction is not inherently different from purchase made at store where payment card is offered to pa for the merchandise or other service provided the customers card is swiped throu gh terminal allowing the merchant to recover its price by having the customers paym ent instruction presented electronically to the customers bank the issuing bank in principle the payment made by the issuing bank which finds its way to the merchant through the merchants own bank constitutes withdrawal by the customer of fu nds held on deposit or otherwise made available through credit facility at the issuing bank the fact that cash dispensing in an offus transaction ultimately involves withdr awal of funds from bank account is not reason to treat the service of cash dispensing as differen t in principle from the dispensing of value in other forms the question to be confronted in offus atm transactions is why the firm in this case bank actually providing the cash dispensing service should not directly charge the customer for doing so interbank agreements affecting prices have anticompetitive features in t he atm stream the direct charging pricing model for atm cash dispensing services will eliminate the need for interbank agreement on any aspect of the level of atm charges as each bank will set its own fee for that service and the client will not be deemed to be the customer of t he issuing bank for the cash dispensing service when provided by another bank any offus transaction involves process of authorisation and confirmation that the customer has funds available which in south africa takes place through the information technology it network which links all atms known as saswitch transactions are switc hed from the atm to the it mainframe of saswitch then to the issuing banks it infr astructure and back again hence reference is often made to switching which involves this electronic process of authorisation the cost of the electronic switching which is not substantial2 would presumably continue to be paid for on the issuing side in principle the is suing bank also should be compensated for processing the transaction and for making the necessary payment on the customers behalf to the atm service provider the use of an agreed interbank fee to compensate the atm service provid er is far less desirable than through direct and transparent pricing to the consumer as the lat ter method should increase competition in this regard also and thus tend to reduce overall tm prices to the consumer the practice evolved by the banks and currently approved within the prevailing regulatory framework of the south african reserve bank sarb and payments association of south 2 it is currently 135 cents or less per transaction where hi gh volumes are involved frb march 2007 second submission atm transactions initial questions p 9 confidential frb banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 149 africa pasa does not cater for direct charging in offus atm transactions there appears to be good reason why offus transactions in respect of domestic tm transactions should not be conducted by system involving direct charging by the service provider within continuing framework of interoperability duly regulated in order to ensure reliability and to manage risk there is precedent for the adoption of this system bot h in the uk where providers can choose between carriage or direct charging and more rece ntly in australia where the entire atm network will convert to direct charging in october 2008 the prevailing regulatory framework furthermore excludes nonbanks from providing atm services except through terminals contracted to bank hence all atm cash dispensing services are currently conducted in the name of registered bank the dispensing of ca sh to customers using payment cards has developed as commercial activity that can potentially be carried on directly by firms other than banks given sensible changes in the regulatory requirements intended to ensure reliability and intended to manage risk within the national payments system it is service that could be offered separately from bank account ie separately from the business of deposittaking which is the legal preser ve of banks in our view it is unnecessary and anticompetitive for cash dispensing services to be restricted as is the case today while not necessarily linked the direct charging pricing model opens the way for nonbank atm providers to become members of the payment system network the uk provides international precedent for this although it may be that different institutional struc ture may be necessary for this to occur here in south africa currently only banks may be members of the payments association of south africa pasa and only banks may be members of payment clearing houses pchs such as the atm pch where rules for partic ipation are established in the chapter on access to the payment system we deal fully with the need to extend participation to nonbanks within an appropriate regulatory framework 52 history and evolution of atms atms have been with us for about forty years while there appear to be number of inventors globally who developed the concept of cash dispensing machine it was luther simjian who patented an early but not so successful version of cash dispensing machine in 1939 in the us the atm we have become familiar with was developed and patented in 1968 in the us by docutel an automated baggage handling company3 the provision of atms stemmed originally from the need of banks for reliab cash dispensing machine that would relieve pressure on bank tellers the first atms were operated offline from the banks operating systems and access to these machines was restricted to those customers in good standing with the bank subsequent developments in 3 bellis 2007 atm cash machines banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 150 connectivity allowed banks to validate the account balance within the bank from w hich the money was being dispensed4 it is claimed that until 1994 in the us the atm machines were costly us 50000 t buy5 and expensive to operate as each machine had to be connected to leased telephone line it appears that innovation in the design of new and cheaper models of atm was stimulated by competition for local atm transactions between rival regional and national network s in the early 1990s and by legislative changes which challenged the network rules of fixed and standardised pricing to consumers6 as consequence of innovation atm machines are manufactured at fraction of the cost of early models and can now break even wit h few hundred transactions month7 technological developments in communication connectivity have also low ered the operating costs of atms over the years and the acquisition and processing costs declined at the same pace as it costs declined with improved communications technology tms were not restricted to being placed in banking halls but could be placed in sites such as shopping centres service stations etc atm machines operated with common technology that accepted card containin g magnetic stripe with the customers account details embedded therein and reco gnized unique pin personal identification number for each card user the developments in the usa and the uk were of interest to south african bankers who had the same desire to relieve pressure on branch tellers particularly when s alary and wage cheques were being cashed often on fridays and at month ends by the mid1980s the banks saw the need to be able to service more customers with more efficient infrastructure furthermore there was perception tha t low income earners were dominating banking halls to the detriment of high income customers at about the same time banks were encouraging industry and business to switch from conventional payroll processing to process whereby the business would supply t he bank with payroll details and the bank would credit the employees bank accounts and d ebit the businesses accounts this saved the businesses the problems of cash handling and cheque processing and allowed the banks to open and operate accounts for the employee s while these benefits were obvious to the employer and the employee there were certain drawbacks one of the main drawbacks was that employees normally needed acce ss to their 4 atm cash machines 2007 5 id 6 grimm and balto 1992 how the antitrust laws limit pric ing policies of shared

soon after payday this then compounded the problems of overcrowded banking halls by the time south african banks adopted atm technology atm machines were connected to the banks mainframe processors and had enhanced functionality these machines could dispense cash and provide bank balance detail later they were capable of accepting deposits by cheque or in cash building societies led the way and introduced atms as early as the 1970s and the commercial banks followed in the 1980s standard bank cla ims to be the first of the commercial banks to launch atms in 19818 first national bank fnb now part of the firstrand group followed in 19839 with improved communications technology atms were not restricted to being placed in banking halls but could be placed in shopping centres etc generally banks owned the atm machines and serviced them with their own resources in this manner banks were able to accommodate increased volumes of tran sactions without significantly increasing their bricks and mortar infrastructure later enh ancements enabled customers to make transfers to other accounts request cheques mak third party payments and topup their cell phones the establishment of shared atm networks by banks or bank holding companies is common in many countries where pricing and rules are set by collective agreement by di rectors of the joint venture in the us for example the biggest regional atm networks are jointly owned by banks the two national networks are owned and affiliated to m astercard and visa respectively10 in sa it has been the trend that each bank provides its own atm infrastructure in some cases with considerable outsourcing to other firms joint ventures betwee n banks in the provision of atm services are not part of the south african landscape11 it is generally agreed amongst south african bankers that atms did relieve pressure on the branch infrastructure however while atm transactions have become t he most common bank interaction for customers12

152 of atms and the cost of retaining bank account was associated with the price of cash withdrawals13 53 interoperability and the origins of carriage in south africa initially the use of atms was restricted to transactions with the customer s own bank it should be borne in mind that even as the costs of atms were declining the v olume of atm usage and the fees generated by such usage determined their profitability usa ge in turn was determined by the positioning of the machines it was therefore important th at as many transactions as possible should be processed by these machines this could be achieved not only by positioning the machines in strategic locations but also by allowing the customers of other banks to access these machines the convenience that atms offered ensured that as the technology developed the ab ility to draw cash from an atm became necessity for most bank customers it follows that one bank could afford not to provide its account holders wit h convenient access to an automated cash dispenser banks could roll out their own atm network to provide this functionality but this could be greatly enhanced if they could enter into reciprocal arrangements with other banks thereby agreeing to provide atm services to each others clients the sharing of the atm network infrastructure was achieved through interoperabi lity between banks which came about in the 1980s in south africa intero perability was achieved through two different networks multinet and saswitch the multinet network was launched in march 1985 and involved direct arrangements between banks ultimately there were four members including standard bank united building society volkskas and the post office each with direct links to each other the system worked well but the number of links required would have had to increase exponentially if new members were added to the network this made it too cumbersom for large scale expansion of the number of members the alternate system was developed more or less in parallel and involved switc hing through central hub with banks linking to each other through the hub the hub kno wn as saswitch was launched in october 1985 the saswitch infrastructure was owned by the banks and seen as cost centre to them with simple charging model per transaction originally created with imported software and hardware the system was redesigned locally during the sanctions era and became highly functional in order to serve its customers better 13 the survey was conducted by kaufman levin associates synopsis of the survey was

building society member of the multinet switch also joined the sas witch network and ultimately the other multinet members followed for period of time the two networks ran in parallel but ultimately the saswitch hub was better able to acco mmodate links between all of the 14 or 15 banks and building societies at the time and multinet ultimately fell into disuse14 entry into the saswitch network which is now incorporated into bankserv15 was restricted to banks with at least one atm and some only just met this requirement fee charged by one bank to another when the customer of one bank utilised the atm of another bank was set in place to avoid the free rider problem which banks with the larger atm networks naturally wanted to address16 an interbank charge known as carriage was introduced by agreement applicable to all banks participating in the network carriage flowed from the issuing bank whose customer was using the service of the acquiring bank to the acquiring bank in

specifications relating to formatting of electro nic messages etc have also played part from commercial perspective the pch agree ments in terms of which members agree to accept transactions initiated on competitors atm s as well as the commercial arrangements associated with the carriage fee have also served to underpin interoperability clearly interoperability has always depended on an effective means of compensat ing the atm service provider in offus transactions historically given the wa the network developed carriage has been the means of doing so but carriage is not the only means by which the provider can be effectively compensated or indeed incentivised to invest given the strong association of carriage with interoperability it is not surprising that the banks initially raised the threat to interoperability as possible consequence of direct charging22 however it is clear that carriage relates only to the pricing arrangements of the network and any changes to this need do violence to the technical arrang ements or the notion of accepting transactions acquired through the atms of competitors while it has been pointed out by the banks that carriage is feature of many jurisdictions it has become apparent through experience in the uk and elsewhere that is not necessary condition for interoperability indeed the claim that direct charging would undermine interoperability has not been sustained by the banks for example in subsequent submission one of the banks stated that one of the advantages of direct charging included incentivisation for providers to further place atms23 the matter is taken up below 531 setting of the carriage fee in its presentation to the hearing on atms on 3 april 2007 the technical tea m represented by dr hawkins indicated that to the best of its knowledge there was uniform carriage fee currently in operation between the banks namely r325 for the first r100 nd further 65c for each r100 thereafter24 the question which naturally arose was if this was correct then how did such uniform fee come to be set getting to the truth on this w as as difficult as pulling teeth fnb was the first bank to have to face the panels attempts at extraction it had stated in its first submission to the enquiry that 22 see for example absa march 2007 second submission access and int eroperability p 10 the access of other banks to the atm network is only provided because absa rece ives compensation for some of its costs through the carriage and without carriage atm operators may restr ict access to their atms by rival banks p 11 23

each additional r100 or part thereof further below banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 156 historically interchange has been set multilaterally by participants in the card pch streams after the introduction of competition legislation frb and the re st of the industry has viewed it as prudent to revert to bilateral negotiations to determine the fee25 however in its view such bilateral negotiations were not stainable26 dealing with interchange on atm transactions fnb wrote that it would recommend the considerati on of number of alternative options to the current system including moving away from bilateral to multilateral negotiations27 we had interpreted these statements by fnb as at least implying that the curr ent carriage fees had in fact been set through bilateral negotiations but then the evident unifor mity of the fee puzzled us at the hearing on 3 april 2007 fnb gave presentation exhibit dd which stated that the carriage fee for offus transactions is negotiate d bilaterally slide 4 and that it is subject to bilateral negotiations slide 5 mr jordaan repeated that the carriage fee is subject to bilateral negotiations28 ms durbach stated that since 20022003 as was indicated on our presentation any negotiations have to be conducted bilaterally the chairperson of the panel chairing the hearing asked whether the current fee was indeed the same for all four major banks29 ms durbach if i can answer that historically it was negotiated as you know multilaterally so for period of time it would have been the same and that was the fee that dr hawkins put up however since 20022003 as was indicated on our presentation any negotiations have to be conducted bilaterally so we can speak for fnb however what we cannot speak for is any other institution that may have negotiated different arrangem ents on the carriage fee between themselves which may well have happened30 chairperson right so you are not sure whether it is the same for l four major banks or not ms durbach we do not know i can tell you what it is for fnb but i cannot comment on any bilateral arrangements between any of the other banks chairperson ok adv petersen of the panel ms durbach are we to understand that the carriage fee which exists by agreement between fnb and other banks is the resu lt of the historical position or is it something that has been bilaterally negotiated currently ms durbach currently yes i just want to check one thing sorry i am h appy to answer it but that answer would fall under the confidential part of our submission we c an answer it at later point or would you like to hold it over would you like to ask the people to clear the room so we can answer that question 25 frb 2006 first submission october p 69 26 id 27 id p 72 28 transcript p 52 29 transcript 3 april 2007 p 63 in fact the carriage fee was s aid to be uniform between all the banks 30 see also frb 2007 second submission march section 2 p 1 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 157 before the room could be cleared ms durbach continued ms durbach our position was negotiated multilaterally up until 20022003 what i can say is the majority of our current interchange arrangements are sti ll pretty much at that level chairperson what do you mean by they are still at that level ms durbach i mean that they have the majority of them have not been renegotiated bilaterally so still sit at the level as was explained by dr hawkins of the r325 chairperson so they are still at that figure i thought you said that was historical figure that things have changed ms durbach sorry what i was referring to just to be sorry i obviously was not clear is that the process of negotiating it had changed the figure wa s set multilaterally until couple of years ago couple of years ago we moved to only negotiating bilaterally and not multilaterally and from an fnb perspective the fee has largely remained the same what i cannot comment on though is what other banks have chosen to do amongst themsel ves chairperson if i may ask will it be possible for us to get the figures with regards to all the other agreements as to exactly what fnb charges in each of the agreements ms durbach yes it will be possible for you to get that chairperson so that we can know exactly what is the fee in each of the agreements ms durbach yes chairperson ok adv petersen there is point then in my pursuing line of ques tioning on the assumption that it is uniform but you did hear dr hawkins report th at as far as the technical team is concerned carriage is the same in the case of all banks as far as we are aware and if that is so it would mean that to the extent that there had been bilater negotiations and you have reserved your position on that we would have the extraordinary coincidence that down to the last cent all the bilateral negotiations have arrived at the same figure would you accept logically that that is the implication of those facts p resented to us ms durbach the other thing i would just add to that is that i think what we could have also put forward in the submission is that some of the bilateral negotiati ons may not have occurred because of the difficulties in conducting third party independent study which would assist us in determining what would be an appropriate rate chairperson what prompted the need to move from multilateral negot iating position to bilateral negotiating position ms durbach what prompted it was that at that time about four years ago we were made aware that there might be regulatory difficulties in terms of th current competition commission act in terms of conducting multilateral negotiations or an indus try thirdparty study until such time as we had obtained regulatory clarity we chose not to proceed in that way mr jordaan if i may make point i think we are now at tac tical space now but it can either be extraordinary that the interchange levels are the same one can be completely logical depending on ones point of departure in other words if one wer to subscribe to the view that interchange should be set at the average cost of the industry which is an approach taken in many countries in the world and for many interchange stream s as determined for example by third party one would arrive at one set of interchange because it is based on the average cost for the industry or one could say it has got to be based on the cost of each individual provider separately which would be different prices and therefore different interchange so it all depends on how one frames the question how interchange should be set this speaks to the difficulties around interchange and carriage fees and negoti ations and multilaterals and bilaterals which is very difficult whic h is exactly why we put forward that if interchange has to be determined our proposal would be that we give it to an independent objective third party with some set of criteria of that str ucture of the average cost of the banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 158 industry or the cost of each individual bank however it should be or and that is why the other two models or the direct charging model is so intuitively attractive we can completely dispense with all of that by going to direct charging model and you know dispense with banks having to agree or that third party having to get involved and i am purel subjected to the competitive forces of the market chairperson i just wanted to say the questions were dealing with the issue of the carriage fee which in my understanding represents compensation from the issuing bank to the acquiring bank for use of that infrastructure that is my underst anding so if they end up being exactly the same there is an issue about compensation as to how we arrive at the figure that is all that we are sort of highlighting but you have indicated that you will be letting us have the various amounts so we will appreciate that ms durbach even though what i can say is that as i have indicat ed before that the majority of them would be at the same level i just cannot comm ent on the detail but that level that dr hawkins put up would be the broad level that would be applicable mr jordaan the position in which we find ourselves is one of uncert ainty whether bilateral multilateral what is the correct approach if one has to live with the existing model that we have we desperately need guidance from yourselves as to which one we should do what we can tell you though is that bilateral negotiations have proven to be incredibly problematic in areas where we attempted them we have examples where we are now performing transaction types without such agreement actually being in place and it is the practical difficulties of going from multilateral to bilateral where we do not even know whether what the position should be hence again r eason why we are putting up these other models that completely dispenses with eit her bilateral or multilateral models of the interchange setting fnb subsequently acknowledged in writing to the technical team that in fact it had bilateral agreements in place regarding atms31 in our view the probability is that this was known to fnb at the time of its earlier submission presentation and test imony at the hearing as appeared also from other evidence and questioning dr hawkins was right spite talk of bilaterals the truth is simply that ca rriage for offus atm transactions has all along been uniform between the banks since 1 march 1999 it has been r325 for the first r100 and further 65c for each r100 thereafter32 capitec bank was next up appearing at the hearing on 4 april 2007 mr stassen stated frankly that the current basis on which atm interchange ie carriage was t was far preferable to bilateral agreements which could well lead to capitec as smaller player being priced out of the market33 smaller players have very little if any negotiating ability34 however he also said that currently we negotiate the interchange with the other 31 email dated 28 may 2007 the message indicated that there ar bilaterals in place for miniatms but provided detail cf also frb 2007 second submission march section 2 p 4 32 the only difference is with mzansi withdrawals where flat c arriage fee of r325 uniformly applies see transcript 11 april 2007 p 65 33 transcript 4 april 2007 p 3 34 id p 30 nedbank mr shuter expressed similar opinion saying th at in bilateral negotiations it would be at disadvantage relative to the bigger banks see transcript 4 april 2007 p 60 standard bank also recognised that banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 159 saswitch participants or with the other banks35 but he did not pretend that the current level of carriage may vary as between different banks when questioned by mr bo dibe of the panel he simply stated that the agreed interchange between ourselves and the issuing bank was currently r325 plus 65c per r100 exceeding the first r100 in all cases36 in an answer to adv petersen he clarified this further by stating that it had not been bilaterally negotiated but was the multilateral agreed fee37 asked by the chairperson when it had been agreed he said that it had been in existence when capitec joined the pch and has not been renegotiated at any time after that38 he rightly dismissed as very unlikely the notion that carriage that was uniform down to the last cent could have been arrived at by bilateral negotiations 39 nedbank in its written submission in october 2006 had stated atm saswitch interchange has historically been set on multilate ral basis for the principles ie how and for which transaction interchange will apply but on bilateral bas is for the level ie the actual price the current interchange rate is r32 5 65c perr10040 as we now know the statement that the actual price had been set on bilateral bas is was untrue when nedbank appeared at the hearing on 4 april 2007 the question of car riage fees was addressed as follows mr shuter are they the same and how were they set if i can sa from nedbanks perspective through variety of factors the boe acquisition i ntegration of peoples bank management changes we have not been able to establish the manner in which the current fee was set we understand from the absa submission that it was last reviewed in 1999 so we need to find people who were involved in that process eight years ago and genera lly those people longer work for us we are continuing to track them down but i cannot say at the moment whether that fee was agreed multilaterally or bilaterally cer tainly our perspective is that it is the same fee in our capacity as an acquiring bank we obviously have relationship with all the issuing banks and in our capacity as issuing bank we have r elationships with all the acquiring banks and the same carriage fee is being used r325 plus 65c per hundred and we understand that to be common across the industry and certain ly it is common for all the arrangements that nedbank has both in its capacity as issuer and acqui rer chairperson so as far as you are concerned that is common amongst the entire industry mr shuter yes chairperson there has not been any change bilateral arrangements would be seen to promote unfair competit ion and create barriers to entry sbsa 2006 first submission pp 6061 likewise absa see first submission oc tober 2006 annex 3 p 67 transcript 11 april 2007 pp 213 35 id p 6 36

players our perspective is that it is identical across the industry chairperson this was fixed on multilateral negotiation mr shuter our understanding from the absa submission is th at it was last reviewed in 1999 chairperson i do understand from the absa submission i am t alking about your understanding about whether this was bilaterally or multilaterally mr shuter sir i think just to be absolutely clear on it we have not been able to track down people who were working at nedbank at that point in time it is eight years ago so the honest answer is i do not know but i think if you have exactly the same fee across all players across the industry it must strongly suggest that it was agreed multilaterally i do not see how one gets to different conclusion41 when referred to the statement in nedbanks submission of october 2006 that the actual level of interchange had been set on bilateral basis mr shuter said that at the time we submitted this particular submission our inves tigations had indicated to us that what is recorded here was how the fee had been set in our subsequent invest igations we were not able to confirm this so you would have to take our current posit ion as change from this position we have not been able to establish if these fees w ere bilaterally set42 we do not consider either the original statement or this explanation satisfactory standard bank stated from the outset that multilateral implementation of the interbank interchangecarriage fee is the only workable approach43 interbank carriage fee is the incumbent system whereby ban ks charge each other per transaction interbank fee for the use of their atm network by th other banks customers44 for both interchange and interbank carriage and all other relevant payment streams attempting to negotiate and implement interbank interchangecarriage fees on bilateral basis would fundamentally compromise the comprehensive interoperabil ity of the south african payment network it is highly likely that given the co mplexity of bilateral negotiations many pairs of banks would not reach agreement on interbank interchangecarriage for each others customers consumer would potentially find themselves unable to use other banks payment infrastructure eg atm or pos network leading to s ignificant losses in utility and convenience for the consumer45 41 transcript 4 april 2007 pp 5759 42 id

with the atm carriage fee was set at relatively low level46 however as consequence of actions initiated by standard bank the fee was increased industrywide in 1997 and again in 199947 the expression multilateral implementation used by standard bank in its firs t submission quoted above should not be thought to mean multilateral negotiations this emerged on the last day of the atm hearings when standard bank revealed that on the 16th january 1997 standard bank unilaterally increased its carriage f ee to other banks and did this again on 18th december 1998 standard bank once again unilaterally increased its carriage fee to other banks48 what in fact happened was that on 16 january 1997 letter was sent by standard bank to the ceo of the south african bankers service co ltd now commonly known as bankserv indicating that with effect from 1 march 1997 standard bank would impo increased charges for transactions on our machines by customers of other banks processed through saswitch49 virtually identical letter was sent by standard bank on 18 december 1998 advising of further such increase from 1 march 199950 the fee to be applied from that date was r325 for the first r100 or less plus 65 cents for each additio nal r100 or part thereof51 the letter of 18 december 1998 did contain the sentence we understand that the price increase could be superseded through bilateral interbank negotiations but in the event that the negotiations are delayed or protracted feel it necessary to implement an increase from march 1999 evidence was given to suggest that such negotiations were initiated in bot h 1997 and 1999 the other saswitch participants simply adopted the same pricing and evidently with effect from the same date so that uniform carriage fee was applied among them regardless of the issuing bank according to standard bank in 1997 the other banks accepted these increases and each independently increased their charges to the sam level 46 belamont recalls that it was 50c in the 1980s the frb submi ssion of march 2007 p 14 states that it was r100 50cr100 prior to 1997 and that there were interim increases after 1997 this appears to be challenged by exhibit gg2 presented at the hearings on 11 april 2007 which stated that the increase in march 1997 was the first since inception 47 see table 1 above 48 transcript 11 april 2007 p 62 mr schlebusch

162 shortly after sbsas announcement52 in 1999 again the other banks implemented the same increase53 remarkably in the light of all this evidence absa still sought at the hearing on 11 april 2007 to convey that the current interchange fees came about through bilateral arrange ment it had stated in its first submission that interchange fees for the atm payment mech anism are determined on bilateral basis54 at the hearing the absa representatives were asked by the chairperson whether absa had been involved with any of the other banks in negotiating bilaterally or multilaterally55 mr volker chairman yes we have i think historically going back to the lat nineties we had been i think the current basis of the interchange rate on atms i think is result of bilateral arrangement so that goes to the nineties i thi nk that is where it is at the moment subsequent to that there have been number of attempts to engage on this on bilateral basis but they have not resulted in any change to the current interchang rate as we understand it today chairperson so there are bilateral agreements are there any bilaterals on the atm mr volker on the atm the historic i think the last agre ement that was that set the current arrangement was set in 1998 and the current prevailing rate is sti ll consequence of that so i think that was the last arrangement which was on bila teral basis as i mentioned subsequent to that we have had engagement with various banks on reviewing this on bilateral basis but they have not resulted in any changes to the r ate that was set in 1998 chairperson you must have been here when standard bank was presenting mr volker i was not chairperson you were not well some of the absa people here were p resent there was point made about letter which went off and then subsequent to that suggesting the increase in the carriage fees and then subsequent to that everybod else increased the carriage fees you are aware of that mr volker i am aware of that i think i was responsible for tms at absa at that stage this was as i said i think the last increase was in 1998 and as far as i can remember the letter we received from standard bank was towards the end of 1998 we recei ved letter announcing their increase and obviously at that stage we had the choice of also doing the same to them so we sent subsequent letter to standard bank as well as t the other banks to announce our increase which was of the same quantum chairperson and also there was some evidence about subsequent negotia tions between standard bank and yourselves which did not bear any fruit mr volker that is correct chairperson you are aware of those negotiations mr volker absolutely yes i think it was few years late r we engaged on it was not just confined to atms it was broad based discussion on reviewing the setting of interchange rates for all payment systems based on hopefully mutually accepted principles but i think it was probably over period of year that we engaged with st andard bank on 52 sbsa april 2007 second submission atm transactions p 5 53 id p 6 54 absa october 2006 first submission annex 3 p 67 55 transcript 11 april 2007 p 164 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 163 those discussions the end result was that it did not change any f the rates mr zeuner and we had similar sort of engagement also with fnb in 2005 and adv petersen mr volker if i can just clarify this with you and i am particularly concerned to do so so that when we read the record later and the tr anscript of this we do not draw unfair conclusions as i understand it carriage is uniform between all the participants mr volker yes that is correct adv petersen r325 for the first r100 and 65c per hundred aft er that mr volker that is correct that is my understanding adv petersen must i conclude from what you said before that thos that down to the last cent that was in every case arrived at through bilateral negotiations between the different indistinct mr volker yes i mean that is reality i think the way that it actually took place what triggered it off was letter from standard bank who were really the leaders in the industry at that stage fair to say the letter arrived on my desk and i i ndistinct that this was the increase i had one of two options obviously i could have declined the letter and said look i am not interested in doing this or i could have negotiated with them but at that stage it seemed like you know an acceptable level of fees to ask and so the result was that i sent letter back answering it and announcing exactly the same fee to st andard bank and at the same time i sent letter to all the other banks that would be usin g my atms making the same announcement so it was something that that is just the way it happened adv petersen and that is what you meant when you spoke of bilatera l arrangements mr volker yes that was how it transpired at the time so t here were not discussions around the table or actually negotiating and bargaining process you coul d maybe say it was unilaterally sent out but obviously when the other party accepts it there is effectively bilateral agreement56 we certainly do not see the matter that way in our view it is evident that the tw letters from standard bank while on the face of them unilateral were calculated to bring ab out and in each case did bring about coordinated pricing response in respect of carriage from all the banks participating in the atm network the same would apply to consequential lett ers in response of the kind written by absa as mr volker described them57 it has been clearly established that the carriage fee implemented in march 1999 had not been revised subsequently the implementation of the competition act and lega l advice that multilateral interbank agreement on carriage would be found to be in contravention of section 41 b of the act appears to have played key part in this inertia according to the banks the advice received by them has been that bilaterally agreed carriage would be permissible however negotiations would be timeconsuming and repetitive moreover the banks interest in changing the carriage fe by bilateral negotiations does not appear to be intense the only attempts at renegotiating the fee that have come to the enquirys attention are an effort by standard bank to enter into negotiati ons with absa 56 transcript 11 april 2007 pp 165169 57 in response to questions from mr bodibe mr von zeuner said if t he panel so wishes i mean we can make available correspondence and information in that regard which will sort of put on record our position and that is the best that we can disclose and i am prepared to do that mr bodibe said thank you see transcript 11 april 2007 pp 171172 the correspondence and information has not been forthcoming in this reg ard banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 164 and fnb respectively in 2000 and 2001 and by absa with fnb in 200558 according to sbsa its attempts failed59 and party has succeeded in renegotiating the 1999 rates absa confirmed this at the same hearing60 thus bilateral agreement has superseded the fees which came into effect in march 1999 and all banks participating in the atm pch have continued the practice of charging each other the uniform carriage fee in its presentation of 11 april 2007 standard bank indicated that its reasons for requiring increased carriage were increased costs associated with handling cash servicing and mainta ining machines and soaring vandalism banks with small atm footprint freeriding on standard banks extensive atm infrastructure the value to other banks had increased as result of standard banks increased atm footprint61 the behaviour of following the price set by standard bank has been justified by way of suggesting that bankserv could only accommodate one interchange rate per stream at the time62 we do not accept that explanation the current management of bankserv is of the view that multiple carriage fees could have been accommodated then as is the ca now but believes that one thought to ask63 it is more likely that one bank that is was interested in asking the incentive at that time was rather to follow uniform ly the upward pricing signal given by standard bank it is difficult to predict where the carriage fee would be set today if it were to be multilaterally agreed or otherwise uniformly arrived at while there has been inflation the cos t of technology has decreased and economies of scale through the saswitch network have improved64 however it would not be unreasonable to conclude that the existing arrangements around the carriage fee and pricing to customers which typically includes both cash withdrawal fee and socalled saswitch fee continue to be comfortabl and beneficial for the participants

commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 165 whether the conduct of the banks in arriving at the uniform carriage fees adopted in march 1997 and again in march 1999 was lawful or not is moot point section 4 of the competition act 89 of 1998 only came into force on 1 september 1999 however th effects of the earlier conduct the practices followed by the banks as result of the contact between them over the level of atm carriage fees have continued to the present day65 in our view the continuing effects of the earlier conduct are best addressed in the interests of competition and the consumer by going to the root of the problem the very fact of interbank carriage as the method of compensating atm service providers in offus transactions when it has ceased to be necessary to effect such compensat ion in that way for reasons further developed below carriage would remain objectionable even if lev els of carriage were to be bilaterally agreed indeed if carriage were to be regarded as legitimate means of compensating atm service providers in offus transactions then uniform carriage applicable to all participants would seem preferable to levels bilate rally agreed this is not only because in complex network multilateral or other uniform tting of terms and conditions is usually simpler cheaper and more efficient in interba nk arrangements bilateral agreements tend if anything to favour the bigger players over the smaller potentially enabling the former to raise the barriers to entry and expansion by other participants and so enhance their own market power consumers are not protected in this way in our view the essential problem with present atm pricing arrangements does not lie in the fact that carriage is uniform or in the level at which carriage has been set it lies in the very fact of carriage arrangements which have the effect of allocating customers between banks when it comes to atm services and of sheltering such services generally to significant degree from price and other aspects of competition between service providers which could otherwise quite feasibly operate if the recommendations which we make in this chapter regarding change to direct charging model for atm transactions are not adopted by the banks within reasonable time see further below then it would be appropriate in our view for the competition commissioner to begin formal investigation into whether or not the continuin g practices of the banks regarding interbank carriage fees contravene section 4 of the competition act 65 section 671 of the competition act provides that complaint in r espect of prohibited practice may not be initiated more than three years after the practice has ceased in this case the effect of the practice has not ceased and so is accordingly open to different interpretation banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 166 532 carriage and indirect charging to the customer it is not clear whether prior to the carriage fee increases of 1997 and 1999 banks saw the carriage fee as reason to charge their customers more for offus atm trans actions than for onus atm transactions indeed in the early days of the network it appears that some consumers at least were not charged additionally for offus transactions standard bank for example states sbsa initially absorbed these charges carriage fees but in 1989 found tha t it was paying away what it considered to be excessive carriage fees to other institut ions in the light of its own infrastructure it therefore took decision that with effect from 1 june 1989 it would levy charge on customers at flat rate of r075 in respect of mult inet withdrawals and r115 in respect of saswitch withdrawals66 the levying of the offus fee did not necessarily make offus atm wit hdrawals more expensive than onus withdrawals for example individual bank statements dating back to 1997 indicate that while onus transactions of r200 were priced to the customer at r169 offus transactions of r200 and r300 were both priced to the customer at r1 50 the offus transactions are listed on the statement as saswitch cash withdrawal at absa boland etc and other fee for the transaction is charged67 however there may be an explanation for this that is peculiar to the account type concerned absa states that there has never been time in south africa when customers could access another banks atm without paying higher fee 2007 atm submission p 10 bu t we have not been able substantiate this with the information available initially banks would have had little reason to differentiate in the pricing of nus and offus atm transactions having regard to the initially low level of the carriage charge the cost saving made by the bank paying the charge by reason of its customer having used t he other banks atm facility rather than its own and the overall commercial benefit of being ab to offer its customers the use of more extensive atm network than it had been able or had chosen itself to provide it is clear that following the increases in the carriage fee in 1997 and 1999 ba nks have levied substantial additional charge on their customers for choosing to use anoth er banks atm the increase in the fee to the customer for offus transactions appe ars to have been driven primarily by the desire to curtail the extent to which clients were using the atms of other banks this has been expressed as situation where volumes were b eing lost on banks own atm networks and substantial fees were being paid to rivals so that their 66 sbsa april 2007 second submission atm transactions p 5 note that i n later part of the submission p 39 this fee is described as

contains confidential informationchapter 5 atms and direct charging 167 customers could use the infrastructure of other banks68 standard bank for example points out that before it instituted its incentive pricing 42 per cent of the total shared offus transactions in the country emanated from standard bank customers69 for the year ending october 2007 this proportion had fallen to 26 per cent70 the additional levy on offus transactions appears to have been accom panied by substantial increase in onus fees as well for example in september 1999 withdrawal of r1000 was priced to the customer at r850 per transaction with in the ca of an offus transaction an additional saswitch fee of r40071 it is notable that the basic cash withdrawal fee of r850 had represented substantial increase compared with previous years and that it was identical whether transactions were made at the banks own atm or that of another bank in the latter case the socalled saswitch fee is added however neither of these fee categories bears any identifiable relationship to ca rriage or any other specific cost the charge to the customer for offus transactions wa s and is commonly referred to as saswitch fee this term has always been misnomer considering that the processing charge by saswitch to the banks has been small fraction of the banks additional charges to their customers it seems fair to conclude that the increases in the carriage fee in 1997 and 1999 resulted in offus withdrawals being priced substantially higher than onus withdrawals the restriction of offus withdrawals by this higher pricing

reflect all the offus vol umes for cash and balance enquiries appear to indicate the number of offus atm transactions had been increasing steadily from 1 990 as consumer trust in atms increased and the network became more robust in march 1997 the number of offus transactions peaked at 146 million thereafter apart from the annual december peak the volumes progressively decreased as consumers initiated fewer offus t ransactions part of the gradual decline in volumes probably had something to do with the higher pricing not only for offus cash withdrawals but also the introduction of fees for balance enquiries and rejected t ransactions the probability is that the interbank arrangements regarding carriage in of fus transactions served to raise price and restrict output throughout the atm network it is probably fair to say that every offus transaction avoided may not necessarily result in an onus transaction instead the discouragement of offus atm transactions may result in

information in general most banks charge an ad valorem fee for atm cash withdrawals the main reasons given for the ad valorem fee is that the costs and risks for the bank increase with the value drawn from the atm because of cash handling the risk of stocking t he device and insurance90 in addition one bank has argued that ad valorem pricing allows them to charge lower rates to customers withdrawing small amounts91 by contrast noncash atm transactions tend to be charged as flat fee as the costs and risk of the transactio ns do not vary by value92 there are few exceptions in the case of the mzansi account for example wh ich has neither ad valorem carriage nor pricing for cash withdrawals93 the flat fee pricing structure is consequence of the banks attempting to meet their commitments under the financial sector charter to service lowincome clientele94 for fnb however the banded fee structure which is an ad valorem fee structure of sorts for onus and offus atm transactions is instituted to allow greater simplicity95 capitec charges the simplest fee structure of all r2 for onus and r650 for offus transactions in all cases customer will be charged the stated cash withdrawal fee unless bundled option is chosen for each onus transaction in addition there is premium fee cha rged for an offus atm transaction see the other banks atm row in table 5 in the case of standard and nedbank offus transactions attract cash withdrawal f ee plus premium absa and fnb employ higher fee structure for offus transactions there are different arguments for charging consumers the premium which are explored in the next section at least one of the major banks associates the premium with funding the carriage fee96 conceptually at least this implies that the cash withdrawal fee is charged reg ardless of whether the customer uses his or her own banks atm or not 545 revenue and atms in table 6 the revenue earned by banks per offus transaction the carriage to be

use that of another fee which in cludes the recovery of the cost of having its own atm infrastructure available this ability derives to significant extent from the banks market power and from the arrangements whereby the customer is treate d as belonging to the issuer for all atm transactions and the issuing banks own atm service provision is accordingly sheltered from direct competition figure 4 shows the net revenues accruing to the issuing bank as the value of the transaction increases in each case except for capitec which has flat f ee regardless of the size of the transaction revenue increases with the value of the transaction figure 4 net offus revenue as the value of the transaction increases source fee brochures and bankserv capitecs pricing method is clearly very different from the big four capitec s targeted particular cohort of customers given that their business has its origins in microlendin g where up until the recent past loans were exempt from usury cap once capitec g ained banking licence it gradually started opening deposit accounts for its clientele who are typically lowmiddle income earners in the public and private sector104 for this reason while it appears from the figure above that capitec would be heavily subsidising the ir clients for larger offus transactions it may be that there are few such instances and that the average size of withdrawal is somewhat smaller than for customers of other banks as has been noted above consumers have responded to the big banks higher pricing for offus transactions by avoiding such transactions in the data request ed from the big four 104 they have consistently pursued this customer niche and have number of features which reinforce this such as higher interest rates for deposits up to r10

been particularly effective in reducing the number of offus transactions both as consequence of the high number of atms bearing their respective brands and because of what are referred to as the relative price incentives associ ated with using ones own banks atms105 once bank has invested in atm infrastructure it makes sense to provide price incentives to customers to use the banks own atms since the infrastructure becomes more viable or more profitable as more tran sactions are acquired through it typically each atm transaction will attract fee it is perhaps worth point ing out that the price incentives to customers are sometime perverse custom ers will travel some way to avoid paying offus fees discounting their travel costs in doing so nedbanks relatively small atm infrastructure was bound to lead to higher proportio n of offus transactions which now make up around 27 per cent of the atm transactions init iated by nedbank clients in our view the expression price incentives in this context is selfserving and misleading what is really happening is that price disincentives are applied to offus transactions enabling the onus price itself to be raised to supracompetitive level106 at least 75 per cent of the offus transactio ns are initiated at the atms of the big four banks ie more than threequarters of all offus transactions go through their term inals this would

competition commissioner contains confidential information 55 the argument for direct charging the current saswitch atm network appears to have developed naturally as res ult of each banks desire to provide its account holders with convenient and easily accessible cash dispensing service in terms of cost and risk sharing and enhancing ones competitive offering each of the banks has an incentive to share infrastructure and participate in network arrangement that allows them to offer atm functionality however the continued carriage arrangements and the indirect pricing to co nsumers raise number of competitive concerns these include the fact that it prevents competition between banks for the provision of atm services to each others cardholders precludes the development of cash dispensing market for nonbank providers entrenches each banks hold over its own customers in respect of its own atm services thus providing shelter for uncompetitive onus atm pricing as well this section sets out the key arguments for direct charging to begin the justification of carriage on the basis of twosided market theory is challenged the theory of twosided markets is discussed more fully in the next chapter on payment cards and interchange the argument for separating carriage fee arrangements from other int erbank arrangements like the interchange fee on card transactions is set out thereafter the competitive concerns associated with carriage are discussed the possibility of twosided market emerging should direct charging b adopted and access for nonbank atm providers be opened up is then explored and finally some of the competition considerations associated with direct charging are examined 551 inapplicability of twosi ded market theory to atms the ability to draw cash from atm facilities is usually provided as part of bund of services linked to an account at the bank the bundle of services attached to th account generally includes the following transaction services receiving deposits to the credit of the customer whether by cash cheque or electronic transfer enabling withdrawals by the customer whether directly or as result of payments made by the bank on the customers behalf in terms of the arrangement between the account holder and the bank payment car d is issued which allows the customer to perform various transactions electronically on his or her chapter 5 atms and direct charging 183 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information account112 this could be through the facility of an atm for purposes of cash withdrawal or through point of sale device for purposes of debit or credit card purcha or the internet in terms of transactional function there is intrinsic difference between the m erchant in the payment card purchase and the owner of the atm cash dispenser in both cas the cardholder has purchased good or service the issuing bank having transferred value to the merchant or the atm provider from the customers account so while the bank allows the transfer of value there is distinct transaction in both the atm and the payment card example where the bank is not necessarily party to the underlying transaction itself in the atm case it is the cash dispensing service and in the payment card case it is the sale of the item if the costs of providing the service at the point of sale are included this will not change the fact that the cardholder must participate in two distinct economic transa ctions in this regard the atm cash dispenser could add by way of charge or deduct from the cash amount dispensed an amount sufficient to cover the cost of dispensing the cash to t he card holder similarly the merchant recovers the cost of its service at the pointofsale by rais ing the price of the item purchased or conceivably by levying separate charge this is altogether separate from the service performed by the issuing bank in processing the payment necessitated by the purchase for that service the issuing bank charges its account holder customer currently in offus transactions as result of the interbank arrangements and certain regulatory provisions which sustain them the atm service provider functio ns always as agent or at least as mandatory113 of the issuing bank this applies both where the atm owner is bank and where the atm owner is nonbank whose terminals are contracted to bank or banks114 where only the issuing bank charges customer for the atm withdrawal irrespecti ve of whether the owner of the atm is bank or nonbank the situation for offus tra nsactions is that legally and commercially the atm owner supplies the issuing bank and the issuing bank supplies the customer the issuing bank is thus involved as purchaser of the service in the one transaction and seller of the service in the other this kind of matching of s upply with demand occurs in any outsourcing arrangement and is not indicative of twosided market 112 even consumer who only transacts through the internet will typi cally be issued with card as the card number provides access to the internet banking facility 113 contract of mandate is consensual contract between one part the mandator and another the mandatory in terms of which the mandatory undertakes to perform mandate or c ommission for the mandator the law of south africa first reissue vol 17 2 sv mandate and negotior um gestio by dj joubert and dh van zyl in our law agency implies in addition an authority given by the princi pal to represent him or her in concluding juristic act 114 for example atm solutions or bytes technology group chapter 5 atms and direct charging 184 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information twosided market involves two independent suppliers each transacting directly with customer in respect of its own supply to that customer in circumstances wh ere the two separate supplies and the two demands need to coincide for either transaction to occur the carriage fee paid by the issuing bank to the atm service provider is thus t in truth species of interchange it is simply payment to that provider for the service whic h it provides to the issuing bank all it has in common with interchange is that it is paid interbank interchange in contrast is not payment for service provided it is balancing payment which serves to overcome unavoidable imbalances between the costs and revenu on the two sides of twosided market where but for the redistribution so effect ed there would inevitably be mismatch of supply or demand the current arrangement between the banks in respect of offus atm transactio ns is structured so as to eliminate all elements of twosidedness in the market the arrangement is one of reciprocal agency or mandate this reciprocity is allencompassing the customer always belongs to the issuing bank it is as customer of the issuing bank and not as customer of the atm service provider that the customer receives and pays for the offus service 552 competition concerns relating to carriage competition concerns related to carriage include several interrelated aspects that are discussed below these are that carriage involves customer allocation preventing competition between banks for the provision of atm services to each others cardholders precludes the development of cash dispensing market for nonbank providers entrenches each banks hold over its own customers in respect of its own atm services thus providing shelter for uncompetitive onus atm pricing as well we have shown above that cash dispensing is capable of being carried on as service comparable to other services which are or can be performed by merchants in respect of which payment cards are routinely used to effect settlement of the price between the customer and the merchant furthermore there is necessary connection betwe the cash dispensing service and deposittaking there is need for the provid er of the service to be bank why has the independent provision of atm services to the consumer not been dev eloped as distinct market standing on its own feet and to that extent independent of the mark et in which banks provide deposittaking and related payment services including payme nt card facilities to consumers chapter 5 atms and direct charging 185 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information obviously in this country banks as deposittakers were the first to appreciate the n eed for and advantages in automating the dispensing of cash which otherwise had to be dispensed to their accountholders by bank tellers they were thus naturally placed to pioneer the development of the network recounted in section 52 and 53 above however this initial development itself brought into being the potential for further development of different kind the separation of cash dispensing as commercial activity from deposittaking so that distinct competitive market in for example atm cash dispensing services became feasible in our view that potentiality has existed for some time but has been prevented from bearing fruit by the historically established arrangements between the banks together with certain regulatory provisions crafted by banks and their representatives in order to sustain and validate such arrangements we refer here not simply to the terms of the pch agreement and clearing rules as such but also to the accompanying industry practice and agreed technical protocols whic h do not allow for the alternative there is provision either in the pch agreement or in the corresponding clearing rules which expressly bars the collecting participant the atm service provider from charging directly for transactions and from recovering that charge from the paying participant the issuer by way of the customers payment instructions howev er it is clear that both documents are premised on the carriage model in which the atm service provider in offus transactions provides that service to the cardholder on behalf of th issuing bank thus schedule 5 par 1 of the pch agreement states it is recognised that the parties will in the normal course of business conducted in terms of this agreement be obliged to process transactions on behalf of the other party and as such are entitled to mutually agreed upon compensation in respect of such services rendered115 the clearing rules document specifically supports the pch agreement and states that should it happen that these rules differ from the agreement the agreement takes precedence 116 the interbank arrangements which do not enable the offus atm rvice provider to charge the cardholder directly for the use of its machine have come to constitute in our opinion form of customer allocation which restricts competition contrary to the bjects of our competition law117 whether they also contravene the letter of the law is matter discussed below 115 116 117 pasa april 2007 payments

information an agreement to divide markets is classic method of cartelization writes the american appellate judge and antitrust author posner118 in our competition act section 41bii prohibits parties in horizontal relationship ie competitors from agreein g or engaging in concerted practice to divide market and so restrict competition by allocating customers suppliers territories or specific types of goods or services it is enough that the firms be potential competitors as was held in nedschroef johannesburg pty ltd v teamcor ltd and others 2006 1 cplr 98 ct market division does not require that both firms be competitors prior to the act of division if they are potential competitors this will suffice frequently firms will divide market before they become facto competitors precisely to avoid that outcome anticom petitive outcomes are less serious as result119 usually when markets are divided this is done by allocating territories to different suppliers120 who would otherwise be competing with each other121 but other forms of allocation may be just as effective in avoiding competition potentially competing suppliers may divide between themselves the products that each may manufacture122 in horizontal customer division scheme firms divide the market by classifications of c ustomers eg one chemical manufacturer will sell only to hospitals another only to schools and anothe r only to factories etc123 this is only one example of dividing market by customer allocation any agreement between or concerted practice by firms in horizontal relationship which by its nature treats particular class of customers as belonging to particular firm or group of the firms for the purposes of particular kind of supply so that the other fir ms in that relationship being potential competitors for that supply to the same customer or customers are prevented from doing so amounts in our view to division of the ma rket by means of customer allocation the particular agreement or practice must be characterised as restrictive of competition before it can be held to fall within the prohibition provided by section 41 b in american natural soda ash corporation and another v

edition p 97 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 187 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information of the prohibited conduct and this process necessarily embodies two elements one is the scope of the prohibition matter of statutory construction the other is the nature of the conduct complained of this is factual enquiry in ordinary language this can be termed characterising the conduct 124 while the judgment which concerned alleged prohibited pricefixing contrary to section 41bi left the question of the proper construction of section 41 b open it suggested that conduct which is not designed to avoid competition but which merely has that incidental effect may not fall within the prohibition125 as sullivan and grimes point out market division is more than just choice about what markets to serve the concept im plies an effort to stifle or at least reduce competition in order to reduce output and increase price126 how should the current interbank arrangements in south africa for offus atm t ransactions and in particular the arrangements concerning carriage be characterised an arrangement whereby payment cards can only be used for atm cash dispensing if the cash is dispensed by or on behalf of the issuing bank is an arrangement that effectively prevents the service provider from having direct commercial relationship wi th the customer in respect of that transaction where payment card issued by another bank is used the arrangement thus prevents the offus provider from competing directly with the iss uing bank for that piece of business with that customer the allencompassing arrangement whereby the acquiring bank or the non bank provider always acts on behalf of the issuing bank in offus atm transactions and the concomitant absence of any arrangement to enable interoperability between the banks on the basis of direct charging for atm services amounts in our view to an agreement or at least concerted practice whereby the customer is effectively allocated for purposes of offus transactions to the bank which issued the card the customer is treated as belonging to the issuing bank127 if to illustrate the point banks were to decide to take in laundry and wer then to arrange among themselves that payment cards issued by them could only be used to pay f or laundry services supplied by the issuer or by firm contracted to or acting on behalf of the issuer 124 125 126 127 47 see eg 49 the law of antitrust an integrated handbook 2nd edition p 255 in our law and in other comparable jurisdictions t here are of course legitimate restraints of trade which involve temporary market division thus in the united states one that sells business can agree not to compete with the purchaser w ithin territory and for time reasonably necessary to protect the capital value of the assets sold from und ue erosion the rule enables sellers to cash out the reasonable value of the good will in business and protects buyers from the risk of paying for something that soon disappears sullivan and grimes op cit p 231 our law is similar for our current common law approach to reasonable restraints of trade see

sbsa at the enquiry hearing in cape town on 13 november 2006 transcript 13 november p 117 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 188 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information would anybody doubt that this constituted unacceptable customer allocation quite apart from other possible categories of restrictive conduct because the consumer is not free to shop around directly for the che apest and most convenient atm services but is treated as belonging to the issuing bank in all atm transactions banks own atm services to their customers are also significantly sheltered from competition the customer is obliged to receive her or his atm service as service tied together with the issue of the payment card and the related bank account holding in this wa banks customers are subjected to an unnecessary degree of captivity to change atm service provider to enter into direct transactional relationship with another tm service provider the consumer is obliged to change her or his bank this is clearly inimical to competition in conditions where the potential for an independent market in atm cash dispensing services exists128 currently in the atm network each bank is service provider to each other ban k in the arrangement it may be thought that as suppliers to each other the banks are simply in vertical relationship where offus atm transactions are concerned how ever that approach fails to recognise that parties stand in horizontal relationship to each other not only where they are actual competitors in respect of the same supply but where they are potential competitors as well in other words could and would these firms compete with each other for the same ultimate customers in respect of the service supplied but for the exist ence of arrangements between them to the contrary in our view the answer to this quest ion is yes in respect of those banks engaged in supplying atm services interoperably under the present pch arrangements 129 the arrangement between them whereby they are suppliers of atm services to each ot her is at the same time an arrangement to the effect that that they will not supply each others cardholders with atm services independently when the card is used as potentially 128 129 this does not imply that atm services necessarily constitute d istinct market for purposes of measuring market power atm services are nevertheless distinct service and section 4 1b does not require that the whole market including that for substitute products or services has to be divided by th competitors before the section is contravened even where only two competitors among many allocate their own cus tomers between themselves there may be contravention if their conduct is properly to be characterised as such there is further distinct aspect to the question whether t he banks are in horizontal relationship in regard to offus atm transactions as we have seen under current arrangements when bank provides its atm service in an offus transaction it provides that service commercially to bank b albeit that the actual use of the atm is by bank bs customer there is supply arrangement between bank and bank b and bank charges its fee to bank b for that supply in each particular atm transaction therefore the t wo banks involved are in vertical relationship the one supplying the other but that does not mean that the two banks are not also in horizontal relationship with each other in the market for the supply of such services by bank to ot her banks inasmuch as each bank in number of transactions will find itself in the position of bank all of t hem are potential competitors at least in the sense that the supplier could agree with the purchaser of the supply to make the supply at different price or not make it at all the fact that they have agreed common price means that the question properl arises as to whether there is an agreement between them or concerted practice by them which ou ght to be characterised as prohibited pricefixing in contravention of section 41 b of the competition act similarly the question arises as to w hether the effect of their agreement or concerted practice brings it into conflict with section 4 1a chapter 5 atms and direct charging 189 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information competing suppliers to the end consumer in offus atm transactions all agree to make their supply only to each other and at the same price it could be argued that this ntails price fixing by firms in horizontal relationship130 at the very least they fix trading condition131 both in this respect and in respect of customer allocation to the extent that it cannot be shown to be necessary it objectively serves restrictive purpose either in actual contravention of or at least at odds with the policy underlying section 41 b of the competition act in its earlier development the arrangements entered into betw een banks and other financial institutions whereby the atms of the one were made available to the custom ers of the other could not properly be characterised as the kind of conduct prohibited by section 41b it may well have been necessary to develop the network that way at least initia lly it is unlikely that its purpose was conceived as anticompetitive nor is it likely that the arrangement would in the sense now contemplated by section 41 have initially had anticompetitive effects outweighing the procompetitive gains inherent in the establishment and extension of the network but highly developed atm network now exists and the anti competitive implications of the allencompassing arrangements between the banks in this regard are now apparent as is dealt with more fully in our discussion of the feasibility of directcharging mo for atm services interoperability can longer be said to depend on carriage practical necessity now exists to justify the continuation of the present offus atm charging arrangements between banks nevertheless there is view that the banks could currently have defence to complaint brought against them for having contravened ction 4 of the competition act by virtue of these arrangements this is not because we accept the argum ent advanced during the hearings that concurrent jurisdiction as contemplated by the competition act justifies the arrangements notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 4 in an appendix to t his report we consider the general principles likely to apply to defence of concurrent jurisdiction principles comparable to those which apply to the defence of state action in the united 130 131 see footnote above cf also brennan et v concord efs inc et 369 fsupp2d 1127 nd cal discussed below we note the interpretation given by the competition tribunal to tr ading condition in the context of section 41 bii of the competition act in competition commission v patensie sitrus beherend bpk case 37crjun01 decided on 8 april 2002 there the tribunal concluded that the rules of produc er cooperative which required each producer member to deliver his crop to the coop was not tradi ng condition the fixing of which is prohibited under section 41b in reasoning its way to this conclusion per d lewis f fourie and d maponya concurring the tribunal maintained the view that all that is required to sustain c omplaint under section 41 bi is proof that parties in horizontal relationship have agreed to fix price or any other tr ading condition however without the benefit of the subsequent judgment of the supreme court of appeal in american natural soda ash supra it approached the matter as if characterisation of the conduct as restrictive of competition was called for but it realised that this approach would make the prohibition too wide so it cut down the meaning of any other trading condition so as to refer only to trading conditions which are part of the pricequantity quality nexus of the concerned transactionstrade 35 this aspect was not addressed in the appeal to the competition appe court in our view even on the tribunals version setting uniform carriage would involve the setting of iform trading condition intimately related to the price and output of atm transactions with end customers chapter 5 atms and direct charging 190 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information states and state compulsion in europe if the banks defence to compla int say of market division by way of customer allocation in relation to offus atm transactions wer to rest solely on the current pch arrangements having been approved by pasa an d ultimately the sarb we would not be deterred from recommending the initiation an d investigation of the complaint leaving the defence to be tested in referral proceedings in due course the legal point we have in mind is different one for reasons set out in sec tion 566 of this chapter we have concluded that the regulations in force under the financial intelligence centre act 38 of 2001 fica could present challenge to the necessary change to direct charging model for atm transactions without small technical amendm ent attainable by way of exemption notwithstanding the above mentioned view there is anot her opinion submitted by the national treasury132 which concludes that fica does not create such an obstacle the point to be made here is that the current situation is one which needs to be changed this chapter proceeds on the assumption that the slight difficulty which may be presented by fica regulations can be and will be ironed out we are firmly of the view that only change to direct charging model for atm transactions would overcome the serio us competition concerns that we have identified above the fact that direct charging model is acc epted to be feasible technically and commercially shows that any necessity for the present arrangement if we assume necessity once existed has now fallen away assuming that the necessary exemption is given or the slight complication is otherwise cleared away if the banks then fail to make all reasonable efforts to replace the current carriage model for offus atm transactions with direct charging model it would be difficult to avoid the conclusion that their arrangements have the purpose of restrictin g competition in contravention of section 41 b it could also in our view be shown that the anticompet itive effect of the arrangements is substantial thus justifying complaint in the alter native in terms of section 41a we therefore recommend that the competition commissioner should initiate and investigate such complaints in the event that change to direct charging for offus atm serv ices has not been made within one year of this possible regulatory complication having ceased to exist 553 twosided markets and direct charging we have indicated above that carriage fees are not justified by twosided market theory 132 the national treasury submitted this opinion by adv md kuper sc titled legal nature of interbank charging relationships section 21 of the financial intelligence centre act 38 of 2001 on 30 november 2007 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 191 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information should change to direct charging be made then atm cash dispensing would more clearly reveal the characteristics it has in common with the provision by merchants of other goods and services directly in exchange for payment by means of payment cards the question then arises whether in this altered context of direct charging twosided market theory would apply if customer b who banks with bank b uses the atm of bank payment card is being used to effect the transaction and its acceptance is necessary to complet the transaction so long as the cardholder is dealing simply here with two banks as the other transacting parties it is difficult to see that the market can properly be characterised as twosided this is because while two independent suppliers exist two independent demands which hav to be reconciled do not exist when however nonbank providers are able to enter the market for cas h dispensing services independent of an atm agency relationship with bank there would be further party whose willingness to accept the payment card has to be taken into consideration in principle if the costs and the demand elasticities on the issuing side were to be out of balance with the costs and the demand elasticities on the acquiring side in regard t such use of payment cards there could in principle be redistribution by way of interchange to enable the twosided market to function but as in the case of other merchand ise and service provision that would be confined to addressing any imbalance in the costs and revenues the cost of the actual service of cash dispens ing is different matter irrespective of whose atm is used the same customer will end up bearing this cost there is thus two sidedness needing to be or capable of being balanced by interchange in relation to this aspect of the transaction one can readily envisage situation where the cardholding customer making the offus transaction is charged fee to compensate the atm provider for the cash dispensing service and fee to compensate the issuing bank for its service in processin g the payment for the cardholder so far noone has suggested that interchange would in fact be necessary to enable market for atm service provision to function effectively on the basis of the direct charging model as we explain in the chapter on payment cards and interchange where interchange is not necessary to the viability of payment stream it should not be allowed further reasons why interchange would be inappropriate in the atm context are addressed below chapter 5 atms and direct charging 192 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 554 competition considerations of the direct charging model for the shift to direct charging to be sustainable and beneficial c hange for the consumer number of issues need to be considered these include acceptable reciprocal arrangements between issuers or atm providers discriminatory pricing to customers of different issuers or atm providers the compensation of the issuing bank acceptable reciprocal arrangements between issuers or atm providers it is not suggested that an atm service provider including bank should be precluded from offering its services to customers by way of or with the assistance of outsourcing arrangements or joint venture with another actual or potential provider the assess ment of each such arrangement from competition standpoint would depend upon its own facts quite different in principle however woul d be reciprocal arrangement of agency or mandate whereby an issuing bank agrees with another issuing bank that each will service the others cardholders on the basis that the customer remains for purpos of the transaction simply the customer of the issuer for reasons previously explained this might well be considered as amounting to prohibited agreement between actual or potential competitors not to compete in respect of each others cardholders for cashdispensing business ie for example as customer allocation prohibited in terms of ction 41 b of the competition act discriminatory pricing to customers of different issuers the possibility for price discrimination between different issuers or providers has b een raised as concern both by smaller banks that are part of the existing atm network and by non bank providers which have existing arrangements with registered bank they envisage the possibility of say two large banks agreeing with each other low er direct charge for dispensing cash to each others cardholders than the fee charged to the cardholders of other issuers this would have the potential to seriously distort and retard the development of an independent market for atm services such an agreement if not ruled out by the terms upon which interoperability is established for purposes of the direct charging model would have to be evaluated on its particular facts in the ligh t of the competition act it might warrant investigation in connection with possible anticompet itive effects section 41 or indeed as constituting pricefixing section 41 b it might serve chapter 5 atms and direct charging 193 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information to create or enhance the degree of market power133 on the part of one or more of the participants over its own customers or in the market more generally and might on that basis give rise to finding of exclusionary conduct amounting to an abuse of dominance section 8 of the competition act it might likewise constitute prohibited price discrimination if it is likely to have substantial anticompetitive effects section 9 the advantages of incumbency are so great and the development of an independent market for atm service provision is so important that we are persuaded of the need to remove uncertainties by addressing the above problem on regulatory basis before it rears its head our recommendation is that the change to direct charging model should be accompanied by regulatory prohibition whether by way of pch clearing rules or otherwise against any atm service provider discriminating in price between customers using cards issued by other firms on the other hand unilateral discrimination in price between banks own cardholders and other customers in the provision of its atm services should not we think be prohibited from competition perspective it appears to make sense to allow issuing banks to incentivise their clients thereby offering the clients lower fees to use their infrastructu re if an abuse of market power arises in such cases this can be addressed in terms of section 9 and possibly also section 8 of the competition act134 the compensation of the issuing bank while the bulk of the costs for cash withdrawal fall on the acquiring side an d include the installation of the machine the cost of cash distribution maintenance of the atm etc there is clearly basis for the issuing bank to charge fee of its own apart from the dir ect charge that flows to the acquiring institution the issuing bank processes the transac tion and performs other functions related to the transaction such as making th necessary payment on the customers behalf to the atm service provider moreover the current conv ention is that it is the issuing bank that pays bankserv for the processing of the instructions from the atm of another bank to the issuing bank and back again and it is also the issuing bank that deals with customer queries135 in principle the issuing bank should be compensated for the work it does in ensuring completed atm transaction 133 134 135 our competition act does not recognise collective dominance the position of each firm has to be assessed individually however arrangements between firms while they might not affect the market share of each participant might enable one or more to behave to an appreciable extent i ndependently of its customers and thus provide basis for finding of market power see competition act sect ion 7 read with the appendix of this report although the direct charging model has the potential for discrimination in that it allows bank to offer discount to its own customers in terms of onus atm transactions this may occur in any atm model currently for example absa charges its customers more when they use the atms of atm solu tions which are branded and sponsored by absa itself although both of these conventions could presumably be changed chapter 5 atms and direct charging 194 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information there are two obvious possibilities in terms of facilitating this compensation direct charge by the atm service provider with separate issuer fee by the issuer direct charge with an interchange fee flowing from acquirer to issuer the direct charge with separate issuer fee allows for both the acquirin g institution or other firm that provides the cash dispensing and the issuer that processes the transaction to charge an explicit fee to the consumer the key advantages of this model are that it potentially allows for price competition on both the acquiring and issuing sides and avoids an interbank fee of any sort being set in addition there is transparency regarding the distribution of the relative fees so the consumer knows what the atm serv ice provider charges relative to the issuer of the card this appears to be the approach proposed by the australian banking industry which aims to have this model in operation by october 2008 the key disadvantage is that the consumer may be only partially informed about the full charge at the time of the transaction the direct charge by the atm service pro vider will be known but the issuing bank may charge fee that is only appreciated by the customer later as it appears on statement however if customers are adequately advised generally in advance by their banks of applicable atm transaction charges and given ongoing consumer education this disadvantage can be minimised direct charge with an interchange fee would entail the atm service provide r collecting and transferring to the issuer the latters compensation for processing the transaction the atm service provider would charge an aggregate fee sufficient to cover not only its own costs plus profit but also those of the issuer the atm service provider would then pay the agreed amount of interchange to the issuer for its share of the work136 the direct charge displayed on the atm screen would be allinclusive the interchange in question would presumably need to be set on multilateral basis based on study inter alia of relevant issuing costs and the extent to which these could not reasonably be recovered from issuers direct revenues see the approach to interchange discussed and recommended in the chapter on payment cards and interchange submission of absa lists the possible basis for the calculation of the atm interchange to include transaction processing costs general overheads fraud losses disputes and system errors137 136 in practice of course the issuer would deduct and retain th is portion as the payment due to it when remitting to the acquirer the amounts appropriately debited from the cardholders acc ount 137 wwb for absa september 2007 direct charging models for atms p 10 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 195 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the key advantage of this alternative for the consumer appears to lie primarily in the nature of the allencompassing charge for the atm transaction from the consumers point of view this allows for simple what you see is what you pay system however there are number of concerns with this proposed model which m ake it inappropriate in our opinion first as matter of principle in competition policy if agreement between parties in horizontal relationship ie between actual or potential competitors goes beyond what is reasonably necessary for the proper functioning of payment network it ought not to be entertained this must apply fortiori to agreements involving price uniformity instead of competitive pricing as has already been explained we find reason to conclude that any element of interchange would be necessary to enable direct charging atm ne twork to operate effectively there is reason to allow the elimination of price competition on the issuing side second there is significant danger that the use of atm interchange in the context of direct charging model would tilt the competitive playing field against nonbanks and indeed also to lesser extent against smaller banks in the provision of atm services directly to the public this is for combination of reasons the atm provider would have to charge an aggregate fee high enough to include the interchange component to compensate the issuer as well as its own remuner ation as acquirer the impression may well be created among consumers that the offus provide r is the cause and beneficiary of the entire charge that would tend to chill off us transactions even where interchange is legitimate the difficulties in arriving at an appropriat level of interchange are acknowledged to be considerable in this case where banks are themselves atm service providers and may have continuing interest in discouraging offus transactions there could well be heightened incentive to inflate interchang given that interchange is not necessary in the atm context this serves as an additional re ason to avoid it for these reasons in our view interchange as means of compensating issuers fo r their processing and related functions in offus atm transactions should not be permitted our recommendation accordingly is that the necessary compensation to the issuer for the work that it does in connection with an offus atm transaction be obtained thro ugh the issuer levying its own charge directly on its customer whether as separate charge or in any other manner chapter 5 atms and direct charging 196 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 56 implications of the direct charging model 561 flow of funds in direct charging model for the direct charging model the carriage fee would be replaced by direct cha rge set by the atm service provider instead of recovering costs from the issuing bank through carriage fee the atm service provider would be recovering costs directly fro m the customer who uses the payment card the basic obligation to pay the atm service provider would shift from the issuing bank to the customer and so carriage would altogeth er fall away in this instance ie an offus transaction any existing basis for cash withdra wal fee charged by the issuing bank would also fall away it would remain simply for th issuing bank if it wishes to charge fee in respect of its own processing and related service to its customer for using the payment card description of the model is set out below figure 5 proposed direct charging model in the figure above cardholder b uses the atm of bank and agrees explicitly by using the atm key pad to the direct charge the request for funds will be process ed through bankserv saswitch and if funds are available authorisation will be given and the cash dispensed the direct charge is recovered together with the value of the ca sh dispensed at settlement and the customers account will reflect both of these deductions t be more specific cardholder b instructs bank b to pay the direct charge plus the value of t he cash dispensed over to bank on her or his behalf in this model the issuing bank remains responsible for the small switching fee to bankserv over and above this the issuing bank may charge the customer for the work it has done chapter 5 atms and direct charging 197 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information and so the customer may be liable for processing fee all fees must be transparently recorded on the cardholders statement while this model does not necessarily reduce the number of charges the consumer ought to face lower charges as atm providers are able to compete on the direct charge the fees charged by the issuing bank will also become more transparent 138 whether in fact atm charges do come down will depend upon whether the ba nks engage in effective price competition whether there is entry by new atm providers and whether consumers are responsive to the new opportunities to shop around direct charging undermines fundamental source of power for the banks t hat of control over customers in terms of the provision of payment services in the case of offus transactions this has allowed banks to charge their customers for the services provided by others this practice has served to obscure what each participant receives this lack of transparency together with the industrywide setting of carriage has ensur ed that the provision of atm services has largely been sheltered from competition direct charging eliminates the need for any price setting or industry agreement relating to c arriage as the customer will be charged directly by the cash dispenser the elimination of the need to agree on the level of carriage fee has be mentioned as an advantage of the direct charging model by most of the banks during the course of the enquiry this has much to do with the apparently widely held view that onl bilateral negotiations of interbank fees would be deemed acceptable by the competition authorities in both the first and second round of hearings banks also pointed to the logistical burd of having to conduct such negotiations on bilateral basis for each of the paym ent streams there are number of possible areas of concern associated with the implementat ion of the direct charging model among them is the possibility of discriminatory pricing with regard to areas different times of day and the clients of different banks we have given consideration to some aspects of this issue above and will explore it further below 562 direct charging and interoperability direct charging has number of potentially positive outcomes from the pers pective of competition but for it to be recommended in place of the existing carriage based mode l we have needed to be sure that it would do harm to the interoperability of the system banks rightly regard interoperability as basic requirement of functional payment system 138 the reserve bank of australia expects that the move to direc t charging in australia will ultimately lead to substantial reductions in the issuers offus processing fee and even to the abolition thereof media release 13 august 2007 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 198 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the atm network is not like normal consumer market where eg retai ler is under obligation to stock the branded goods of retailer b or if price can not be agreed upon they do not have to accept the goods in the payments industry banks are obliged to provide service to the customers of other banks in the name of interoperability139 the interoperability of the system relates to the ability of consumers from any issuing bank to use any atm technically this has been achieved in large part by the centra l switching hub saswitch but also through the technical specifications of atms including the standards implicit in the use of mastercard and visa140 historically the pch agreements in terms of which members agree to accept the transactions initiated on competitors atms and the commercial arrangements associated with the carriage fee have served to underpin interoperability while the direct charging model proposed here would entail change only in regard to carriage some banks initial responses appeared to associate the model with the unravelling of all the existing arrangements we believe the use of the central switching hub the existing standards and the atm pch agreement need to be retained since the pch agreement has certain restrictive clauses it would presumably have to be amended there was some suggestion that the carriage fee is required to cover unavoida ble costs and provide an incentive to invest in atm infrastructure however in our view it is clear from the submissions as whole that direct charging provides an alternative model by which these unavoidable costs would be covered with interoperability being maintaine d and with incentives to invest being if anything strengthened from the outset fnb acknowledged that there are number of ways that atm char ges and fees can be charged and this is reflected in number of different regimes across the world141 it went on to propose that among alternatives to the current system consideration should be given to the move to model of elimination of interchange142 with atm owners charging customers directly this would involve dropping interchange altogether on atm withdrawal s and so would be significant change for the industry requiring ca reful investigation and consideration143 fnb later stated specifically in answer to the enquirys question whether the carriag fees associated with atm transactions are essential for interoperability in the system 139 140 141 142 143 sbsa october 2006 first submission p 56 see for example the rules stated in the visa international op erating regulations ch 2 4 and 8 frb october 2006 first submission p 72 the expression interchange is being used here as in other qu otations to refer to carriage that is also way in which it was referred to in eg the enquirys questionnaire to t he banks on atm transactions we have subsequently clarified our thinking on the correct and incorrect use of the expres sion interchange id p 73 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 199 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information although cost recovery is essential to support interoperability this does not necessarily need to occur via interchange fees144 nedbank agreed it is nedbanks view that the current carriage fee is not essential for interoperability in the provision of shared atm network as an alternative surcharge model could be adopted with an equal ability to support interoperability145 and further it is nedbanks view that the surcharge model is equally capabl of addressing the critical success factors for offering atm cash withdrawal services146 the term surcharging is sometimes used by the banks to refer to direct chargi ng but we prefer to avoid it it can lead to confusion with the us model where there is surc harging over and above carriage for this reason direct charging is preferred throughout this report although standard bank did not directly answer the question whether carriage wa s essential to interoperability it implied that carriage is not in fact essential when it acknowledged for atms surcharging is an alternative system of recoveri ng network costs whereby the bank that owns the atm acquirer surcharges the other banks the issuing bank customer directly on the use of the atm with interbank fees paid147 absa too did not directly answer the question about interoperability it concentrated on expounding the historical role that carriage fees have played in the development of the atm network and in its own investment in an extensive atm infrastructure it has be the existence of carriage that has made absa willing to allow other banks the use of its atms this access is only provided because absa receives compensation for s ome of their costs through the carriage fee148 while the ability of direct charging model to ensure interoperability and the reco very of adequate compensation was not specifically addressed it was implicitly conceded by absa when it said that without carriage fees one of the choices facing atm operators w ould be recovering the costs of network access by rivals customers through rcharges at the atm149 144 145 146 147 148 149 frb march 2007 second submission access and interoperabilit p 10 nedbank march 2007 second submission access and interoper ability p 63 nedbank march 2007 second submission atm transactions p 3 sbsa october 2006 first submission p 58 absa march 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 10 id p 11 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 200 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information it went on to develop arguments concerning negative consequences t hat could arise if the current system of interbank fees was altered in any material respect which we address further below150 and concluded that absa believes that carriage fees are essential for consumer welfare benefits relating to atm networks151 in similar way standard bank initially argued against direct charging mode l calling it surcharging on the following lines we do not believe that surcharging model would have any procompetiti ve effect and would in fact have negative social impact on the market for atm rvices in south africa152 the implication was that the carriage model is essential to avoid these negative social consequences however by march 2007 standard bank was prepared to concede that sbsa believes that the atm infrastructure in south africa may be sufficiently developed to eliminate the carriage fee and replace it with model of direct charging153 subsequently absa having performed some additional analysis in anticipation of the possibility that change to direct charging model might be recommen ded provided the enquiry with constructive views on various ways in which such cha nge could in fact be implemented154 this was in september 2007 after fnb in may 2007 and standard bank in august 2007 had themselves undertaken preliminary studies and independently confirmed to the enquirys technical team the feasibility of the envisaged change the responses considered together lead us to conclude that the elimination of carriage and replacement with direct charging will not undermine interoperability tak ing fully into account the continued need for high standards of technical reliability at the same time certain rules will be required to ensure accessibility and affordability155 such rules are explored below 563 direct charging accessibility and affordability as indicated some banks have raised concerns regarding the extent to wh ich consumers may be placed at disadvantage by shift to direct charging some of these arguments appear to link shift to direct charging with other chan ges such as the demise of the pch agreement for example standard bank pointed to the complexity

view that balance enquiries could also be charged for direc tly as well as the service of cash deposits at atms although the latter would require some kind of agency arr angement with the issuing bank chapter 5 atms and direct charging 201 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information and large number of required negotiations that would pose significant barrier to t he entry of small banks156 in similar vein absa talked of how smaller banks would need to invest in their own atm network as they would be unable to access the existing atms of other banks157 as has been stated before the proposed change has to do with pricing not with disrupting the other technical and commercial arrangements the key arguments raised against shifting to direct charging model relat to the extent to which consumers will be assured an accessible and affordable atm servic from the network and the possible confusion arising from such change these are disc ussed below accessib ility number of the banks including fnb nedbank and standard bank acknowledged that direct charging would provide incentives to acquiring banks to deploy atms this suggests that investment in the atm infrastructure will not be adversely affected and that the accessibility of the atm network for consumers will not be negatively affected should such change be made in our view the model creates incentives for banks to compete for atm transactions and opens the possibility of nonbanks to independently deploy atms hence we would anticipate more rather than less atms in the direct charging environment we are not persuaded by the contrary argument advanced initially by absa158 in particular we reject the contention that in the absence of carriage fees banks will make decisions about the investment in atms on the basis of only their own customer base and such investment would not be justified in rural areas where banks may have insufficient customers of their own to justify investing in an atm because transaction volumes will be too low the assumption of the direct charging model is that atm service providers whether banks or nonbanks will serve all cardholding customers within continuing interoperable network the pricing flexibility that will accompany direct c harging is we believe more likely to encourage atm service provision in areas currently under served and where poor people often have to incur enormous additiona l costs and difficulties including having to take taxis to other villages or towns in order to get access to cash 156 157 158 sbsa october 2006 first submission p 59 absa march 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 12 bank which refused to make its atms available on direct charging basis to the cardholding cust omers of smaller banks while making them available to the bigger ones would likely face investigation for exclusionary c onduct quite apart from having to explain to its shareholders why it was foregoing the extra revenue id pp 1012 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 202 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information affordability of atm transactions the banks hold different views regarding the effect shift to direct chargi ng would have on affordability in its march 2007 submission absa pointed out that t here was certainty that consumer prices would be lower159 and reiterated this at the hearings160 fnb associated direct charging with price competition among acquirers which would encourage entry competition and innovation161 fnb also noted that acquirers would have to offer transactions at marketaccepted levels162 standard bank were nedbank are concerned that shift to direct charging may lead to less affordability for those in remote areas nedbank stated that in areas with lower population density the impact of the increas in pricing to the card holder outweighs the benefit of access to more atms163 we are not persuaded that the banks weighing of the relative costs and be nefits will correspond with that of consumers who are currently seriously deprived of cash dispensing services the possibility that an atm provider could exploit its dominant position as sole provider of atm services by charging significantly more for the remote service than in an urban area price gouging was raised by both standard bank164 and nedbank165 higher charge may well be justified in remote area given the associated cost s as the banks themselves have pointed out should particular atm provider make super profits in remote location it is likely that other service providers will enter and introduce competition this is all the more to be expected if access to the market is opened up under appropriate regulation to nonbanks nedbank indicates that market forces may be undermined ho wever as the viability of maintaining an atm is highly dependent on the number of transactions initiated and two atms may not be viable in such areas note that research 159 absa march 2007 second submission access and interoperabili ty p 12 160 transcript 11 april 2007 p 7 161 frb march 2007 second submission atm transactions

questions p 5 163 nedbank march 2007 second submission atm transactions p 21 nedb ank appears to be taking this view directly from the us literature on surcharging which may not be strictl comparable with direct charging in south africa 164 sbsa october 2006 first submission standard bank voluntary sub mission to the competition commission enquiry into competition in banking p 58 165 nedbank march 2007 second submission access and interopera bility p 64 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 203 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information suggests that few hundred transactions month can still ensure viability166 but of course such calculations depend on the actual price of such infrastructure information which was not made available to the enquiry it appears that nedb ank is discounting the likelihood that the costs will not be standard across all acquirers which may well work in the favour of consumers price competition in remo areas may well be more vigorous should nonbank atm providers be permitted to operate independently of sponsoring bank with regard to the compensation banks would receive from direct charging w do not see any reason why they would be unable to fulfil their atm commitments in terms of the financial sector charter167 uncertainty for customers resulting from differentiated pricing the banks have pointed out that currently within particular market segm ent their customer prices are standardised regardless of when or where t ransaction is initiated at an atm they have accordingly raised the possibility that under direct charging arrangements cash providers may charge differentially depending on the location time of day and issuer168 the last can perhaps be most easily dealt with it appears to be commonplace that where direct charging as opposed to surcharging is adopted elsewhere in the world rule of nondiscrimination on the basis of issuer holds such rule would prohibit price discrimination on the basis of the issuing institution in offus transactions something that has been raised as concern by smaller banks169 should this rule be instituted as we have recommended above then the other possible variations of differentiating in price for peak hours or remote areas remains such differentiation would not necessarily be anticompetitive and could indeed serve to increase output and ultimately lower price at the same time it is w orth noting that differentiated atm pricing for time and place is unprecedented in south africa although clearly possible under the current arrangements and banks would have to consider the possible consumer backlash should they make such move the only differentiated pricing that currently may have geographical implications is absas higher pricing structure for atm solutions atms which are sponsored and branded 166 see for instance data from the us which suggests that technology has advanced so that mere 300 transactions per month make an atm viable atm cash machines 2007 and data on cash machines in the uk which suggest that nonbank owned atms typically attract 550 withdrawals month huwwwapacsorguk uhu 167 these commitments are listed for example by absa october 2006 first submission p 19 168 sbsa october 2006 first submission p 58 absa march 2007 second s ubmission atm transactions p 9 169 see eg capitec march 2007 second submission supplementar submission to the banking enquiry p 2 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 204 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information by absa170 these atms look distinct from absa atms although they carry the absa brand and are more likely to be located in remote areas hence customers in remote areas that currently bank with absa are probably paying more for their atm transactions than absas citydwelling customer base171 while bank customers may have feel for the pricing of their own banks atms and even the pricing structure for offus transactions the ability to state these precisely is highly unusual172 direct charging would have the advantage that at the time of the transaction the consumer would be told the amount of the direct charge173 if the bank charges processing fee over and above this the consumer would probably only know the value later w hile this falls short of full disclosure it is at least much more information than is currently pres ented to the consumer at the time of making the cash withdrawal in spite of this banks hav made much of the customer uncertainty that will result with direct charging capitec for example raised the following the introduction of surcharge in south africa will create uncertaint among users of atms it is not concept we are used to and it may take long time befor it is fully understood one concern is that there may be factors that are used in setting surchar ge fees that may discriminate against smaller banks individuals or service areas it is therefore possible that every atm may charge different fee some atms may be free at others it may vary from town to town or even suburbs unsophisticated and illiterate users of atms may not be aware of the cost implications when using the atm illiterate pe rsons may not comprehend the effect of the surcharge with the transactions paying more than they expected174 the uncertainty that consumers will have to deal with is of course associated wit h the extent to which banks themselves institute price differentiation for time and place hence while they make much of this it will be entirely in the hands of the banks individually how much price uncertainty is generated as they currently have exclusive right to acquire atm transactions from consumers and hence levy fees it is perhaps worth noting that the curr ent fee structures are not necessarily comprehensible to even sophisticated customers of course it is possible that should independent nonbank atm providers be permitted to acquire atm transactions they could have highly differentiated pricing based on time and location the extent to which this would generate consumer resistanc would have to be weighed up by the service provider against the possible benefits of such an approach 170 premium of r280 is charged for each atm transaction from an tm solutions machine absa october 2006 first submission p 8 171 this was confirmed by atm solutions in the hearing on 11 april 200 7 in which mr kark confirmed that significant proportion of the machines provided and serviced by atm solut ions are in rural and otherwise underserved areas p 27 172 kaufman levin associates july 2007 research presentation 173 and we recommend that the consumer must have the option to canc the transaction free of charge should the disclosed price be unacceptably high 174 capitec march 2007 second submission supplementary submission t the banking enquiry p 2 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 205 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 564 direct charging and the smaller banks possible negative outcome of the model is that smaller banks might be less able to attract new customers as their smaller atm infrastructure will militate against their offering meaningful discount to their customers for onus transactions nedbank for exam ple has stated that direct charging will lead to customers being attracted to banks with bigger atm market shares175 there are two parts to this argument first while it is impossible to predict the extent to which banks will offer th eir customers on us discounts it is feature of the current model that customers of smaller banks already experience the disadvantage of smaller atm infrastructure since they would b paying the disincentive fee over and above the standard cash withdrawal fee in more instances such customers must thus have reasons for signing up with smaller banks that outweigh the disadvantage of small onus atm infrastructure second while direct charging will create new dynamic the assumption that appears to be implicit here is that banks will use the offus revenue of the direct charge as well as other customer account fees to discount or apparently discount onus atm transactions this will attract those customers who typically rely on many cash withdrawals if t his amounts to an abuse of dominance it will need to be tackled as such however if lower prices on the part of bigger banks are simply the result of competitive efficiency brought about by economies of scale this should be seen as positive competitive outcome for consumers although the adoption of direct charging model will remove the shelter from relative inefficiencies this is not an adequate basis to resist the change as in other markets when competitive forces prevail smaller players have to rely on advantages such as flexibility innovation and entrepreneurial drive in ord er to out compete larger incumbents some banks impress upon consumers the benefits of other electronic transactio ns which avoid the need for multiple cash withdrawals hence one cannot assume t hat all customers will switch merely for the benefit of cheaper onus transactions at the same time each banks price for the direct charge for offus transactions w hich we assume will be standard for all card holders176 will have to be pitched so as to maximise the usage of their atm infrastructure whether by their own or other banks cardholders hence there is good prospect that competitive forces will bring atm prices down 175 nedbank march 2007 second submission atm transactions p 21 176 if rule of nondiscrimination on the basis of issuing institution is put in place as we recommend chapter 5 atms and direct charging 206 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 565 conditions for success of the model there are two possible phases associated with switch to direct charging the first relates to the adoption of the direct charging pricing model and the second relates to allowing non bank providers into the network as noted before the latter is not foregone conclusion but is possibility that may arise and in our view ought to be allowed when the direct charging model is introduced the following appear to be necessary requirements should the direct charging mo be adopted industrywide education the shift to direct charging will require consumer education the cost burden of which would fall to the banks177 fnb has pointed out that changes to transaction processing are high risk in terms of customer knowledge and understanding etc178 since this would amount to substantial change there would be need for education through different media and the process may require personal interaction in less sophisticated client cohorts179 disclosure standards disclosure standards should include requirements for disclosure on atm screens and the option for consumers to opt out free of charge once the direct charge has been shown it would also need to be designed to minimise confusion for consumers resulting from changes to their previous atm experience lessons from the uk indicate that these standards need to be agreed upon prior to implementation agreed clearing and settlement procedures such procedures should allow the acquiring bank or nonbank provider whether directly or through clearing bank to recoup its direct charge at settlement along with the value of the cash dispensed from the customers ie the issuing bank software and possible hardware upgrades both banks and saswitch bankserv would need to make some changes for example banks would have to allow for direct charging disclosure screens on atms saswitch would have to be able to facilitate two claims for each offus tr ansaction the amount of the cash dispensed and the amount of the direct charge moreover 177 178 179 see for example grim and balto 1992 frb march 2007 second submission atm transactions initi questions p 5 however it should be pointed out that the banks do change their atm interface from time to t ime but do not necessarily reeducate consumers in this regard hence they may be overstating the case absa september 2007 direct charging models for atms pp 2122 for xample sets out number of media and formats in which this education could take place chapter 5 atms and direct charging 207 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the calculation of carriage would have to be eliminated the facility to be able to track transactions would also be necessary the establishment of dispute resolution mechanisms these mechanisms would form part of the arrangements associated with the pch agreements between network providers they would deal with matters such as which institution would be the first port of call for the consumer should there be false transaction or insufficient funds dispensed up until now the consumer had commercial relationship with the offus cash dispenser and would hav automatically consulted his or her issuing bank should such queries have arisen if direct charging comes into force it is possible that the issuing bank may feel it has incentive to sort out queries on behalf of the customer experience elsewhere suggests this is unlikely the establishment of network rules this would include rules identified here as necessary for the succes s of the model such as discrimination between issuers in offus transactions arrangements to accommodate mzansi cardholders who are currently not charged an extra fee for offus transactions arrangements for holders of payment cards issued abroad should the adoption of the direct charging model be followed with move to all ow direct participation by nonbank providers additional measures and concerns would have to be addressed this would include changes to the atm pch agreement and the clearing rules this matter is dealt with at length in the chapter on access to the payment syste m and only few brief points are raised here participation by nonbanks could take the form taken in the uk through the establishment of separate scheme such as link to manage such an arrangement t his route would require change to the pasa constitution to allow for combined bank and nonbank scheme to be established under its auspices and hence change to the nps ac t the establishment of an atm scheme would require criteria for entry that would be objectively applied by the executives of such scheme this is further discussed in the chapter on access to the payments system as discussed in the chapter on access to the payments system we consider that duly qualified nonbanks should be able to become full participants in the clearing nd settlement process of appropriate payments streams while not necessarily becoming settlement participants nonbanks could alternatively acquire transactions and present the m to the switching operator saswitch while still having banker that would settl on its behalf should such route be followed provisions of the nps act would have to be clarified as chapter 5 atms and direct charging 208 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information would certain clauses in the pch agreement which relate to restrictions on the natu re of the relationship between banks and nonbanks in the atm pch 566 direct charging and fica implications it has been pointed out that the financial intelligence centre act 38 of 2001 fica may pose challenge to change to direct charging for atm services180 however there is also view to the contrary181 in our view any possible challenge is more than technical anomaly which serves policy objective and can be overcome by simple regulatory intervention on the part of the minister of finance in mr groblers of the banking association opinion the challenge can be cured by special exemption from the national treasury in our view it would be simple mat ter for such an exemption to be promulgated182 so as to exempt accountable institutions from compliance with the provisions of fica in respect of category of transactions183 namely single transactions184 in which the accountable institution provides an atm service to client using for the purpose of the transaction card not issued by or on behalf of that accountable institution itself185 180 181 182 183 184 185 memorandum by stuart grobler of the banking association dated 23 april 2007 file ref 35265 furnished to the enquiry on 11 may 2007 he explained that all accountable in stitutions which includes banks are under statutory obligation to identify and knowtheclient whether they are in an ongoing business relationship together or whether t he institution performs single transaction that is not part of such an ongoing relationshipwith the proposed direct charge model the atm owning or acquiring bank will be charging the client of the other issuing bank direct fee presumably recovered from hisher bank account via the switch netw ork in this case the acquiring bank is longer the agent of the issuing bank but there is direct bankerclient r elationship between the acquiring bank and the atm using client for the single transaction there is therefore n obligation under fica pp 12 the view that there may well be an obligation under fica and reasons for such view are considered in the appendix to this report on fica and direct charging opinion by adv md kuper sc in which he writes the pur pose of fica is to combat money laundering activities and terrorist activities by establishing financial intelligence centre which can identify the proceeds of unlawful activities and make information available to the relevant authorities an effective method of advancing these objectives is to require banks to verify the identity of their clients or those who act for their clients this doubt facilitates investigations into money laundering and the financing of terror ist activities however purpose can be served by requiring another bank which does not do banking business with the person concerned to undertake like verification exercise the financial intelligence centre by definition ready has the necessary information or access to the necessary information from the verifying bank which does have ba nking relationship with the relevant individual how can this purpose be further served by requiring duplicate or tripli cate information from other banking institutions which are not involved in any banking business with that person submitted by the national treasury november 2007 legal nature of interbank charging relationships section 21 of the financial intelligence centre act 38 of 2001 p 12 having regard to this context mr kuper concludes that the customer in an offus atm transaction is not client of the bank providing the atm service in the sense contemplated by fica and that fica therefore would not apply to the transaction so far as that bank is concerned as is pointed out in paragraph 3 of the financial intelligence c entres guidance note issued by way of government notice 715 in government gazette 27803 of 18 july 2005 fica and the regulations require that banks i dentify all clients with whom they do business unless an exemption applies in given circumstance see section 741 b of fica single transaction is defined in section 1 of fica as meaning transaction other than transaction concluded in the course of business relationship qualification as to the maximum value of such exempted tra nsactions would we think serve useful purpose having regard to the fact that the issuing institution would or cou ld in any case impose its own limits on atm transaction values and would in each instance authorise or decline to aut horise electronically the amount of cash to be dispensed or other payment undertaken through the atm chapter 5 atms and direct charging 209 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information it should be noted that the opinion submitted to the enquiry on be half of the national treasury dated 30 november 2007 concludes that an exemption would not be necessary absa also appears to share this opinion when it states we are of the view that there w ill not be any fica implications as result of the introduction of direct charging atm model186 should the national treasury issue statement to this effect on which banks co uld firmly rely the need for special exemption may be avoided187 either way certainty needs to be created for the industry in this regard an exemption or statement of clarity by the national treasury would not undermi ne the antimoney laundering objects of fica inasmuch as whenever an atm is used to effect withdrawal transfer or addition of funds held on deposit to the credit of cardholder the accountable institution which issued the card and which keeps the cus tomers account would have been obliged in terms of fica and would remain obliged to establish and verify inter alia the clients identity and to maintain the prescribed records of the transaction188 each atm transaction even when carried out offus involves at the same time transaction between the issuer and the cardholder as its accountholder in connection with the use of the card an exemption for offus atm transactions of the kind suggested would thus not reduce the intended effectiveness of fica in bringing about the proper detect ion and reporting of suspicious transactions 57 direct charging miniatms and cashback while we do not believe that the case for direct charging stands or falls on its ability to also deal with miniatm cash withdrawals and cashback at point of sale they are frequently touted as alternatives to atm cash withdrawals accordingly the existence of carriage needs to be examined here as well 571 direct pricing and miniatms miniatm is cashless device that is initiated as if it is selfservice activity but requires the assistance of the merchant to fulfil the transaction it is supported by the cash float s of merchants as in the case of atms the miniatm carriage that flows from the issuer who issues the card and charges the customer to the acquirer who provides the service and negotiates the 186 187 188 absa september 2007 direct charging models for atms p 19 it should also be noted that the financial intelligence centre amen dment bill b18 of 2008 has recently been published if enacted it would make provision under new sect ion 43a of the principal act for the financial intelligence centre or supervisory body after consultation with the centre where category of accountable institutions is concerned to issue by notice in the gazette directives regarding the application of the act this may itself provide basis for resolving any uncertainty in terms of sch edule 2 of fica the sarb would appear to be the relevant supervisory body in this case unless exempted for example in terms of the abovementioned par agraph 17 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 210 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information placement of the miniatm in the merchants store appears to be compensation f rom the issuing bank to the acquiring bank for the use of infrastructure by the issuing banks customer189 once again this is not balancing payment between two sides of market in other words it is not form of interchange but merely the payment for an outsourced facility that happens to have been agreed upon within the interbank space for these reasons the direct charging approach appears applicable to miniatm transactions as well nevertheless we do not consider it advisable to recom mend such change for miniatms at this stage the submissions of the banks have raised aspects regarding miniatms th at need to be considered these include the fact that miniatms are in their infancy and the existing model of carriage provides appropriate incentives for the rollout of these machines while taking into account the risk associated therein190 merchants are not regulated and hence cannot be trusted in imposing direct charge191 the implications are not fully understood192 various submissions confirmed the view that miniatms are in their infancy w hile bank appeared to accept the notion that atm themse lves now represent mature market it is fair to say that the miniatm cash dispensing mode is new however there is some contention as to whether or not the existing model of carriage provides appropriate in centives for the rollout of these machines and whether or not it takes into account the risk associated therein standard banks view on miniatms was ambiguous193 and involved pointing out how the clearing rules in the atm pch are not adequate to deal with the possible additional risks introduced by merchants moreover mastercard and visa have not certified miniatm devices in addition standard maintains that some central banks have banned miniatms however standard is itself experimenting with automoney devices which ar miniatms hence while it appears that standard does not believe the current arrangements deal with the possible risks it appears to be arguing for the status quo with sl ight tweak for instance confidential absa 189 190 191 192 193 there is of course reason why suitably qualified nonbanks c ouldnt directly offer miniatm services just as they could offer atm services sbsa april 2007 second submission atm transactions p 37 id absa september 2007 direct charging models for atms p 23 contained in sbsa april 2007

miniatms in separate pch or with that of debit cards194 it also maintains that due to technical limitations participants in the atm pch can distinguish between mini atm and atm transactions195 and so while cheaper carriage fees have been negotiated with miniatm providers customers are charged the same as for the full at m service196 fnb on the other hand having rolled out more than 1300 miniatms is emp hatic as to t heir positive benefits it sees this as substitute channel for full atms in area s where remoteness and low density population cannot support the more expensive infrastructure miniatms have played an important role in ensuring that fnb is able to meet its fsc obligations197 fnb also claims that the current arrangements have not led to the appropriate carriage being set confidential frb frbs competitors have been reluctant to pay what frb sees as fair carriage fee covering at least the costs of service provision due to fsc commitments and its aim to provide access to lowincome customers frb made the strategic decision to c ontinue to provide offus withdrawals rather than risk the service not being available to lar ge numbers of consumers who would benefit from these facilities the level of carriage fee nego tiated is not sufficient to allow the miniatm network to fully cover its costs although ffus transactions do make positive contribution198 the irony is that the miniatm carriage fee that fnb has negotiated wit h its larger competitors in one case as high as r250 is substantially greater than the d efault fee of 25 cents that smaller bank would receive should it rollout miniatm devices indeed one of the nonbank providers smart atm is in such position where the smaller bank through which it operates by way of an outsourcing relationship has been unable to neg otiate carriage fee above the default for non atm devices nads the nad default carriage fee of r025 was imposed sometime after smart atm had been operating under the auspic of the atm pch through its sponsoring bank at the time smart atm had negotiated n 80 per cent share of the atm carriage fee which was subsequently massively reduced to the default nad fee after miniatms were reclassified as such by pasa199 if it is true that most banks in the atm pch cannot distinguish between atm and miniatm transactions then while carriage of r025 is paid away to the acquirer the issuing bank char ges the customer the full fee for an offus transaction on average in excess of r11 while this bears out the concerns that are discussed more fully elsewhere bout the problems of leaving interbank fees to be negotiated on bilateral basis it also raises the question as to why such fee needs to be determined within the interbank space at all 194 195 196 197 198 199 sbsa april

it would be difficult to monitor detect and act against instances of customer abuse by literally thousands of merchants200 in the case of banks or registered atm providers so the argument goes ensuring good conduct is far simpler while this may be true it is frequent theme of the banks to presume that they alone have some kind of commitment to protecting consumers while all other purveyors are to be considered suspect however the evidence does not support such view the potential dangers of merchant in an outlying area abusing his or her dominance in the provision of miniatm cash dispensing is probably not very different from s uch abuse in the provision of any other good or service there may be some abuse but co nsumers are themselves reasonably savvy and abuse of cash dispensing services may lead to t he loss of considerably more business than the merchant had bargained for it is also unc lear precisely what is meant by this abuse higher pricing by sole trader in an outlying area m ay well occur but is this necessarily abuse of the customer the banks themselves have argued that they will feel at liberty to charge different prices for atm services in more remote areas the point regarding the possibility of fundamental changes with financial consequenc for number of players is well made the implications of having direct charging for miniatms have not been fully considered by this study and there may be other issues which require further consideration if carriage is to be retained in relation to minia tms then the appropriate carriage fee should be determined through an independent proc ess comparable with that which is proposed for the setting of interchange this is outlined in the chapter on payment cards and interchange however the miniatm payment channel remains an example of how poorly the existing interbank and accompanying regulatory arrangements operate arrangements that is with regard to rulesetting in the pch process management dealing with banks and nonbank operators and both interbank and customer pricing while banks say that miniat ms can improve the cash dispensing services to many of those currently underserved by branch and atm facilities they do not generally appear to have played as constructive role as possible in ensuring this 572 direct charging and cashback at pos one of the anomalies of the south african retail payments system which is highly sophisticated and interoperable is the apparent delay in the facilitation of cashback at point ofsale in less sophisticated payments environments this feature became available more orless in line with atm rollout as an attempt to provide consumers with alternative cash dispensing services 200 sbsa april 2007 second submission atm transactions p 38 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 213 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in the uk for example this was widely used feature from the mid 1990s in south africa this functionality is still in its infancy and hardly marketed at all indeed only two large retailers pick n pay and shoprite checkers have instituted the facility and it applies only to debit card transactions there are various reasons for this including resistance to rollingout s ubstitute for the atm network which might undermine its profitability another must have to do w ith the uncertain application of the mastercard and visa rules prohibiting pure cashback transactions those not accompanied by purchase the visa and mastercard rules in this respect and the extent to which they are observed in south africa are discu ssed in the chapter on payment cards and interchange as appears to be the case with miniatms there is little to support the vie w that those involved have done all that they might have done to support the development of this service however adoption of direct pricing for cashback at pos is complicate d by number of realities as the banks are quick to point out the pos device exists for different reas on primarily to allow the processing of debit and credit card transactions which clea rly affects the economics and viability thereof hence while dispensing of cash at till m ay be highly effective ultimately such cash dispensing would need for the most part to be accompanied by purchase for it to make sense for the retailer the carriage for cashback takes into account the following considerations the retailer has cash at its premises hence cash does not have to be supplied from elsewhere the retailer adds to its revenue and reduces its overall cash handling c osts by dispensing cashback to customers as service the investments in pos devices have already been made typically by the retailer and so new investment is required these considerations have led to far lower carriage fee in the case of cas hback at pos than in the case of typical atm withdrawal see table 5 given the infancy of cashback at pos and the dearth of information available to us in this regard we are not in position to draw conclusions as to whether carriage could effectively be replaced by direct charging model in these contexts we therefore recom mend that the competition commission revisit this question once adequate experience s been obtained of direct charging in atm services and consider at that stage the case for and against extending the direct charging model chapter 5 atms and direct charging 214 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in the meanwhile we recommend that the independent process of carriage set ting referred to in connection with miniatms above be adopted for cashback at pos 58 international precedent and learning two countries the uk and australia provide recent international preced ent for the adoption of the direct charging model 581 atm pricing models in the uk in the uk direct charging was implemented as dual alternate system in 1999 atm providers have choice of charging carriage through interbank arrangements or imposing direct charge on the customer the key reason given for the dual approach has to do with the historical adoption of the socalled free banking model where customers are typically not charged by their banks for payment services if they have positive balances in their accounts on which or low interest is earned201 there has been considerable consumer resistance to any moves away from this model the implementation of direct charging in the uk was associated with nonbank atm providers gaining access to the network this also dates back to 1999 scheme to allow for nonbank membership known as link was set up to manage arrangements link has allowed for two pricing alternatives one where carriage is retained used by almost all of the banks in the network and another where direct charge is imposed on the consumer used by nonbanks where carriage is retained the consumer experiences the cash dispensing service as freetouse this makes the at m service provided by nonbanks for which direct charge is levied seem more expensive even if it isnt situation far from ideal for competition the carriage fee model is dominant of some 60000 atms in the uk 35000 ar freeto use and 25000 charge direct fee not surprisingly 96 per cent of all atm trans actions are carried out through the freetouse atms while only 4 per cent of the transa ctions are facilitated through the charging atms the 25000 each atm operator has ch oice as to which of these two models it wants to apply most banks have only freetouse atm s while the independent operators use the direct charging model one of the banks does have pay touse atms but these atms are deployed under another brand202 in most cases there would be charge to the consumer if they used bankbranded atm wheth er it was an 201 this was confirmed by the office of fair trading in tel econference with the enquirys technical team on 17 may 2007 the description of the current situation given in t his section is our understanding of the situation at the tim the information was received 202 paystrat 2007 notes on the conference call held with basa and link 6 june 2007 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 215 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information onus or offus transaction however if the consumer used the atm of nonbank he or she would be charged fee as shown on the atm screen prior to the transaction nonbanks employ the direct charging model as they find carriage levels too low double charging is prohibited so choice needs to be made between direct charging and carriage nonbank typically sets its direct charge at around gbp150 to gbp175 per transaction this is flat fee and ad valorem rates are uncommon the nonbank atms tend to be deployed in convenience areas within pubs and stores rather than in the high street while only 4 per cent of all atm transactions are made through these direct charging nonbank machines the nonbanks still find the business profitable almost all of the banks atms are freetouse for customers of other banks203 however the issuing bank will be obliged to pay the acquiring bank the applicable inter change ie carriage fee one bank currently employs the direct charging method for othe r banks customers but this is unusual this particular pricing structure has led to most banks expanding their atm network so that they can avoid having to pay the carriage t here may accordingly be overextension of atms in some areas while in other areas the lack of viability of the freetouse model has meant that there are relatively few bank atms commercially banks have found the entry of nonbanks to be acceptable when customer uses nonbank atm the interchange is saved and the customer is charged directly link there are currently 49 members of the link scheme new members are required t meet certain criteria such as an evaluation of the business the ability to ensure data protection and viable business plan which is discussed only with the director of the scheme existing incumbents are not consulted on the applications of new entrants the decisio n rests with the

report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the carriage fees are set to recover acquiring costs and the costing metho d employed includes items such as the cost of cash rental space it costs maintenance t elecoms and hardware costs the data for both banks and nonbanks are included in the annu costing study and four carriage levels are set branch and nonbranch cash withdrawals and branch and nonbranch balance enquiries and reject fees the carriage for branch atm cash withdrawals is currently set at around 20 pence and that for nonbranch cash withdrawals at 31 pence balance enquiries or rejectio n fees at branch atm are around 10 pence and balance enquiries or rejection fees at nonbranch atm are just under 20 pence206 kpmg is currently the consultant commissioned by link to undertake the costing study in teleconference with the office of fair trading oft and the enquirys technical team the oft pointed out that the carriage fee approach was allowed to be retained on ly because of the socalled freebanking model in the uk and consumer resistance to change in this regard the tradeoff imposed on the industry for maintaining the carriage fee was t hat it would be set on the basis of an independent study as described above it was also pointed out that since the costing studies have been conducted the carriage fee has be set at progressively lower levels we are advised that lessons relating to the adoption of the direct charging model in the uk include207 with better handling and enforcement in the early stages of the expansion of the link membership the reputational risk brought about by few nonbanks could have been avoided the risk resulted from failure to disclose the direct charging approach adequately while charging the client this has now been addressed by setting requirements for disclosure to clients such as minimu m font size on the screen and an optout choice for the consumer should he or she not acc ept the direct charge and so on in retrospect the criteria for nonbank entry should perhaps have included safeguards on the probity of the business while nonbank has failed since membership has been extended to them capital requirements would give the executive of the link scheme greater comfort the following is an extract from the banking association of south africa basa submission to this enquiry relating to the implementation of the direct charging model in the course of 206 207 these data have been confirmed by mr edwin latter of link and mr paul smee of apacs in interview on 11 june 2007 as raised by mr edwin latter of link in interview on 11 june 2007 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 217 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information its own investigation basa posed certain questions to link and received answers as follows208 how easy difficult was it for the banks to change agreemen ts rules to incorporate carriage fees and direct charging issuing banks have been fairly relaxed regarding the implementation of surc harging direct charging as it saved them the carriage that they would pay in the alternative was the establishment of set of minimum criteria with regard to dir ect charging not viewed as anticompetitive the establishment of minimum criteria was not problem who set the criteria the scheme facilitated sessions between the banks and independent opera tors who jointly agreed the rules why has the oft prohibited double charging was it ever allowed or wa s it uncommon double charging was initially allowed however as result of the pol itical pressure relating to this practice it was later discontinued how were the association rules visa mastercard prohibiting atm surcharging addressed the association rules were ignored as the transactions are facilit ated via link and not through the associations are there any agreements between the issuers and the acquirers as to the level of direct charging that the acquirers may apply can the acquirer apply different direct charges in terms of different issuers eg having preferential agreements with large iss uers versus small issuers if so what was the impact of this on the smaller issuers scheme rules do not allow for differentiation between issuers different times of the day eg charging higher surcharge during peak periods there is restriction to such differentiation it is howev er not something that is done different locations eg having higher surcharge in rural areas which ve low transaction volumes 208 in their telecom of 6 june 2007 note that the terms carriage and direct charging have replaced the terms interchange and surcharging for consistency chapter 5 atms and direct charging 218 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information direct charging does differ per location as mentioned earlier in excl usive locations the fee may be higher however in low income areas freetouse atm s are being deployed due to political pressure in contrast to south africa where each existing pch member has to provide written permission for new entrant to operate in the payment stream in the uk the link executive applies the criteria for entry into the scheme objectively the decision to permi t entry is not referred to existing members 582 direct charging in australia from 1 october 2008 the direct charging model will be adopted in the aust ralian atm networks this is consequence of an industry agreement reached in august 2007209 the stimulus for change arose from the concerns expressed in 2000 review an d reiterated in 2005 by the reserve bank of australia and the australian competition and consumer commission regarding the bilaterally negotiated carriage fees at the time in particular substantial markup on offus fees was seen to persist owing to lack of competitive pressure in the setting of the fee210 the length of time that the australian industry took to conside r the move to the direct charging model led some to suggest that they must be having doubts about such move for instance both nedbank and absa cast doubt during the hearings in april that t he direct charging model would ever be adopted across the australian industry211 within few months they were contradicted the changes agreed to by the australian industry include liberalising access to t he atm network the key elements of the proposed system are the development of objective and transparent entry requirements and the obligation of incumbents in dealing with new entrants the clear disclosure of any charges levied by the atm owner before customer proceeds with transaction 209 210 211 rba 2007 reform of the atm system in australia media release 31 august cra 2007 implementation of direct

from that proposal and the current proposal as i understand it that is on the table in australia is the retention of bilaterally negotiated interchange fees but with oversight by the res erve bank in australia to ensure that those fees are at the appropria level that seems to us to be the position in australia after sort of lengthy and careful consideration of the very similar issues that you are looking at today and it might be helpful for the panel maybe to have regard to the australi an experience because it may have some bearing on your deliberations chapter 5 atms and direct charging 219 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the abolition of bilateral interchange read carriage fees paid by banks and other financial institutions to atm owners for the provision of such services the carriage fee in australia is typically around aus1 and as elsewhere is seen to be objectionable as the fees are neither transparent to customers nor subject to the normal forces of com petition with these fees abolished atm owners are free to charge customers who use their at ms but must disclose the fee increasing the overall transparency of pricing212 at the time of writing the selfregulatory code for the new model had yet to be finalised by apca the australian payments clearing association it is expected that the c ode will forbid discrimination by issuer apca currently has 80 members including the reserve bank of australia building societies credit unions and banks in addition it is expected that issuers will be able to charge fee to their customers f or the processing work they have done currently issuing banks pass on the carriage fee to customers when they make use of another institutions atm with fee that is typically between aus 125 to aus 2 this is considerably higher than the onus fees imposed on customers ranging from 20 aus cents to 50 aus cents213 the lessons from the australian case are that other jurisdictions are uncomfortable as we are with interbank fees that are sheltered from competition moreover competition does not appear to be advanced by the bilateral negotiation of such fees the direct charging model clearly appears to be entirely feasible access to the network by nondeposittaking institutions is both conceivabl and supported by the shift to direct charging 583 surcharging in the united states the discussion above has excluded any examples from the us where system combining surcharging and carriage exists214 in our view this is not particularly functional model nor 212 213

it have any particular redeeming features it is set out here merely to bring ut the differences between it and the direct charging model proposed atms were introduced into the us in the 1960s initially customers were only able to withdraw cash from their own branded atms but banks soon realised that unit transaction costs declined with an increase in volume the us unlike sa has many networks and this led to the formation of shared atm networks which could link machines from regio nal and national networks to one another and thereby increase the volume of transactions by increasing the access to the customer through offus transactions in the mid1980s banks introduced service fee for offus transactions for at m withdrawals interchange carriage fees were established to compensate atm owners for the c osts of handling network transactions that were not their own uniform fixed interchang fee was set collectively by network operators and rules against surcharging by atm service providers were initially adopted this restriction did not survive legal attack the atm service provider became free to charge surcharge over and above the carriage applicable w ithin the network in the surcharging model carriage fee is still payable by the cardholders bank to the atm owner direct surcharge may also be levied on the cardholder by the atm ow ner in this case the atm owner receives the proceeds of the carriage the direct surcharge and the cash dispensed at settlement the carriage is an interbank fee which is set by the network participants and would not be subject to competition the surcharge on the other hand is set by the atm owner and is an additional charge to the normal carriage fee to the extent that the surcharge fee is disclosed before the transaction is initiated this fee wo uld then be transparent surcharging provides atm owners with the opportunity of generating direct fee reve nue and may even act as strategic tool for potentially attracting account holders who wi sh to avoid surcharging by making onus transactions the probability of surcharging increases with banks market share of atms the average level of surcharging in the us has reached an alltime high in 2007 to its current level of usd164 in direct charging model in contrast carriage is not charged direct charge is simply levied by the atm owner or acquirer to customers using cards issued by othe r banks this carriage was necessary or whether the network could viably rely on surcharging ie direct charging alone was question of fact which could only be determined by trial the lates t information which we have been able to obtain at the time of writing indicates that the case is proceeding to tr ial while one of the authorities relied on in the analysis was dagher v saudi refining inc 369 f3d 1108 9th cir2004 subsequently reversed in texaco inc v dagher 547 us 1 126 sct 1276 164 led2d 1 2006 it should be ted that the reversal turned on the fact that the supreme court in co ntrast with the view of the court quo considered the price in question in that case to be simply an integrated joint ve ntures own price to its customers and that accordingly pricefixing between competitors had taken place in brennan the chief judge noted incidentally that interchange ie carriage in the atm context is structurally different from interchange in the context of payment card schemes chapter 5 atms and direct charging 221 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information charge is recouped together with the cash dispensed at settlement in addition processing fee covering the switching fee for routing transactions through the ne twork and other processing costs may be charged by the issuing bank fees in the direct charging model are set unilaterally in each case by the institution offering the serv ice these fees can promote transparency to the customer competition is enhanced as offus pricing will be done on competitive basis between banks 59 other pricing models in this section two models other than direct charging are briefly review ed the lesson to be learnt from them is that each one is likely to provide different competitive dynamic with different winners and losers the two models are elimination of saswitch premium or convenience fee to the customer setting of carriage by an independent third party 591 elimination of the saswit ch premium or convenience fee fnb proposed an elimination of the socalled saswitch premium fee also known as the convenience fee the interbank fee and the disloyalty fee215 as result customers would have the benefit of experiencing the same price for atm withdrawals whether they are made at their own banks atm or that of another service provider or bank however the carriage fee the amount which is paid over by the issuing bank to the acquiring bank remains intact hence while reducing the price to the consumer the banks within the network continue to pay the carriage fee over to each other if their consumers use another banks atm terminal fnb argued that this proposal has the benefit that from day one there will be reduced direct cost to customers of at least r500 million216 the proposal grabbed media attention but closer scrutiny shows that the proposal in this onesided form is far from adequate and would in any event tend to distort competition and thus not ultimately benefit the consumer as we have shown earlier in this chapter217 the aggregate amount of carriage that bank b in its role as cardissuer pays away to bank and other banks in their role as atm service providers to bank bs cardholders depends on factors such as the rel ative extent and 215 216 217 sonamed for example by capitec march 2007 second sub mission supplementary submission to the banking enquiry p 1 transcripts of 9 november 2006 p 33 and 3 april 2007 p 55 see section 545 above and especially table 7 and table 8 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 222 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information convenience of bank bs own atm infrastructure made available to its customers conversely the amount of revenue that bank b will receive by way of carriage from other banks will depend on its provision of atm infrastructure relative to theirs and to their ability themselves to meet their cardholders atm needs the relationship between the size of banks cardissuing base and the size of its atm infrastructure will clearly play an important part in whether it is net payer or net receiver of carriage the fact is that some banks are net payers of carriage and others net receivers the simple abolition of fee category which serves whether in whole or in part or in excess t recover carriage paid away can only disadvantage the net payers of carriage relative to th ose which are net receivers in other words it is not neutral in the competition stakes between banks that are simultaneously issuers of cards and providers of atm services since the customer would have incentive to seek out her or his own banks atm s given that there is longer pricing differential it is likely that bank with small acquiring but relatively large issuing base would find that disproportionate number of withdra wals are off us resulting in considerable value in the form of carriage being paid aw ay to competitors only bank with relatively large acquiring base reinforced by confidence in the locat ion of its atms would be likely to find the proposal sustainable and attractive table 10

the ability to generate large number of offus transactions from customers of other banks this is likely to result in high er carriage fee payments to other acquiring banks based on the data submitted it appears that fnb would lose the least and be most likely to benefit ultimately from its proposed change as was revealed in the hearings the key constraint to the implementation of s uch change

5 atms and direct charging 223 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information savings to the consumer would not be guaranteed and it is unlikely that this woul d be sustainable in the words of fnb its proponent in the process we would lose lot of volume from our own devic that would go to competitive devices rendering our devices far less economical and what would simply happen is that we would shoulder the load on our own and our devices would become less efficient it would be extremely naive from commercial perspective if we were to do something like that218 in addition the possibility of us attracting enough customers by dropping that fe the saswitch premium to cover the very significant loss we would take in our assessment is probably unlikely219 part of the reason for this is that the saswitch fee sasw itch premium is ultimately different to other prices in the sense that if you drop it you do not get additi onal business you lose carriage220 the hearings revealed that none of the banks apart from fnb was in favour of the proposal of dropping the saswitch premium while carriage remained nedbank said bluntly we do not believe we should spend lot of time on the frb proposal by t heir own admission they would be mad to do it221 in fact fnb admitted only that they would be mad not their expression to do it alone if it were implemented across the board they would stand eventually to gain however we do not believe that the proposal even if so implemented has merit as this chapter has explained the source of the problem lies in the system of carriage as the means of compensating the offus atm service provider this system has complex anticompet itive effects including the sheltering of issuing banks prices for both offus and onus transactions from effective competition nominally eliminating one fee category would not prevent one or more other fee categories from creeping up to recover the lost rev enue the present problem would thus not be tackled at root but merely be obscured in way calculated to impress and lull the paying public while disadvantaging other banks relative to the bank that has made the proposal in our opinion it is not an acceptable alternative to the change to direct charging model which we recommend 218 219 220 221 transcript 3 april 2007 pp 108 and 109 id p 110 id p 120 transcript 4 april 2007 p 94 chapter 5 atms and direct charging 224 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 592 independent third part to set carriage fee the notion of an independent third party to set the carriage fee may be influe nced not only by the uk example but also by the approach emerging in various jurisdictions as far as the interchange for card payments is concerned the justification for this approach is that where there is twosided market and fourparty model it may be necessary to balance the revenue generated in way that is commensurate with the costs in order to ensure participation on both sides of the market while this would be departure from the process by which carriage has been t the argument is that if this approach can provide assistance in the case where debit nd credit cards are used in other transactions then why not in the case of atm transactions essentially acquiring banks would provide details of their costs to third party t he third party would then using an agreed methodology arrive at the uniform level of the carriage fee payable by the issuing bank to the acquiring bank in the uk the link atm network has dual system in which both banks nd nonbanks are involved in providing cash dispensing services both carriage fee sy stem and direct charging model are employed although never together where the carriage fee applies typically between banks that do not charge their consumers an explicit atm withdrawal fee it is calculated by an independent third party in this case kpmg n the basis of the costs of both issuers and acquirers including those that do both hence the use of an independent third party has precedent it is our view however that there is justification in south africa for carriage t continue to exist in regard to atm transactions the submissions made to the enquiry do n ot point to the need for carriage to continue in fact all of the banks which engaged in the rgument have admitted that carriage is not essential to interoperability while the banks raise social concerns that might arise should carriage be abolished and direct charging model be introduced none of their concerns appears insurmountable if sensible rules are implemented the benefits of pricing structure that is transparent and subject to forces of competition outweighs any appeals to the

through local monetary exchanges and paper systems to the global division of labour and the electronic transfers and sett lements of the present day security reliability and efficiency in the means of payment or payment instruments like credit and debit cards have been fundamental re quirements for development in the virtuous circle electronic payments and economic growth 1 it is observed that the development of money has depended on the actions of the people using it ultimately consumers determine what form of money is most desi rable people simply substitute cheaper and more convenient forms of money for expensive and inconvenient forms it is ultimately through this substitution in use that new money forms embed themselves in the marketplace2 nonetheless in the development of means of payment from the earliest standard coinage the state or public power has always played necessary role history demonstrates compelling need to standardise payment forms to enhance their utility examples are as ancient as the qin dynasty in china 221 207 bc when the emperor unified three or four forms of currency into one coin and as co ntemporary as the creation of the euro in the 21st century3 also crucial to the development of means of payment and payment systems has been the role of banks and the arrangements which they make with each other in this regar d in order that such forms of money or payment instruments are mutually acceptable regulatory authorities around the world have been paying increased attention to interbank arrangements central among these arrangements is interchange this obscure but important subject has long exercised and co ntinues to exercise competition authorities in many countries in the united states in the 1980s it became focus of antitrust scrut iny by the courts the european commission has been concerned with interchange si nce at least 1992 and continues to wrestle with the issue it has led to successive rounds of litigation in britain involving the office of fair trading it has become matter of conte ntion in competition enforcement in spain portugal austria poland and elsewhere in australia it has led to an extensive

contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 229 this enquiry 612 what is interchange although interchange in some contexts may involve institutions other t han banks it is best understood initially as particular transfer of value between banks in cont rast with payments in cash where the payer pays the payee the beneficiary directly every other mode of payment in south africa currently requires in the ordinary course the ass istance of one or more banks for this service charge is made it is when two banks are involved each needing to levy charge for its service to its customer that interchange comes or may come into play interchange as we know it locally is transfer made by interbank arrangement whereby in the context of payment made by the customer of one bank to the customer of another bank one of the two banks contributes part of its revenue to the other bank at present interchange is to be found in some form in the great majority of instances where ne person makes payment to another person other than in cash and where the paye has his or her bank account at bank other than that of the payer classically the need for interchange has arisen in connection with the development of payments by card4 typically such payments are made by cardholder buying goods or services from retailer or merchant it is in the context of payment by card that we shall first analyse interchange and then consider its applicability to other mod of payment payment streams issuing and acquiring the cardholder making payment to the merchant will have obtained the pa yment card from an issuer and the merchant accepting the card will have contracted with an acquirer in order to accept the cards of the relevant card scheme in some cases the issuer and the acquirer will be the same institution but in other cases the two institutions will be different where issuer and acquirer are the same institution the transaction is referred to as onus where they are different institutions the transaction is referred to as offus the ec interim report of april 2006 dealing with payment cards defines interchange fee as the fee paid by an acquiring institution to an issuing institution for each pay ment card transaction at the point of sale of merchant5 this definition assumes of course that the 4 it could conceivably have arisen much earlier with the develop ment of payments by cheque but evidently the need for it then was not such as to bring it into existence 5 european commission competition dg sector inquiry under rticle 17 regulation 12003 on retail banking interim report i payment cards 12 april 2006 glossary under th rules of the mastercard scheme financial institutions which are regulated as such and supervised by government authoritie s may issue cards and acquire card transactions such institutions are not necessarily limited to banks in the case of visa the institutions must ordinarily be authorised to take deposits in south africa only banks are currently ab to issue cards and acquire card transactions within t he banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 230 transaction is offus an acquiring institution is defined as credit institution or other undertaking and member of card scheme that has contractual relation with merchant6 an issuing institution is credit institution and member of card scheme that has contractual relation with card holder for the provision and use of card of th at card scheme in closed system the card issuer is the scheme owner while i n open systems several credit institutions act as card issuers7 the distinction between closed and open card systems has relevance t our understanding of the dynamics of interchange we now turn to this 613 threeparty closed and fourparty open card schemes in closed system8 the card scheme owner examples are american express and diners club9 is not only the issuer of the card but also the acquirer of the merchants transaction it may licence banks or other financial institutions or utilise franchisees to is sue its cards to customers or to contract its acquiring services to merchants but they do so on its behalf10 to analyse such scheme we must therefore look through the licensee to the principal the scheme owner we can identify in essence three parties to each payment transaction using the card of such scheme i the cardholder ii the merchant and iii the scheme owner11 hence such scheme is conventionally referred to as threeparty scheme here there is possibility of transfer of revenue from acquirer to issuer or vice versa since issuer and acquirer are one and the same all transactions are onus i nterchange thus does not arise as such in threeparty scheme at most there may be an internal transfer of revenue in notional or accounting sense an intrachange to coin an expressi on from the acquiring side to the issuing side of the scheme owners

parties in closed or threeparty card scheme the matter is different with the card schemes which dominate the payment card s cene in south africa mastercard and visa are open systems13 conventionally referred to as four party schemes14 the fourparty model evolved from the threeparty model it was natu ral progression for banks which had acted as mere licensees for the issuing of scheme owners cards to become direct issuers to customers in their own right albeit within the governing framework and under the logo of the particular card scheme likewise on the acquiring side banks could contract directly with merchants recruitment of tens of thousands of banks and other financial institutions around the world as issuers and acquirers has greatly expanded the reach of these card schemes with this change the triangle of relationships i n payment transaction under the threeparty model becomes replaced by rectangle15 13 also referred to as open loop systems see eg visa june 2007 second submission document b third part p 5 and pp 1315 14 transcript 17 april 2007 p 15 15 see transcript 17 april 2007 p 16 it has been pointed out that stri ctlyspeaking the fourparty scheme involves five parties including the scheme owner however since in such scheme the scheme owner does not participate directly in each payment transaction the fourparty label seems quit appropriate for basic analytical purposes banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 232 figure 2 the parties in an open or fourparty card scheme standard bank has correctly defined card interchange as the fee paid by acquirers to issuers in card purchase transaction within fourparty payment system16 however as is discussed further below interchange should not be seen as fee for service however it should be noted that where the payer the cardholder and the payee the merchant for example are served by the same bank or financial institution as is suer and acquirer in other words where the payment transaction is onus only three part ies are involved in the payment transaction notwithstanding that the scheme itse lf is an open one triangular diagram comparable to the depiction of the threeparty schemes ab ove and not rectangular or fourparty diagram would thus illustrate the relationship in that transaction nevertheless the whole point of the open scheme is that it greatly expands the sco pe and flexibility of cardissuing acquiring and use precisely by allowing for offus transactions in which it is unnecessary for either the user or the acceptor of the card to be concer ned with the institution that has provided the necessary services to the other party it is thus appropriate to describe and analyse open schemes essentially in terms of an offus four party model 614 necessity of interchange in principle whenever payment card is used to buy goods or services or otherwise to eff ect payment two independent demands have to be matched this applies to both threeparty and fourparty schemes just as wedding requires two people to say i do payment by payment card requires one person the payer to choose to use the card as the means of payment and another person the payee usually merchant voluntarily to accept it if the 16 sbsa october 2006 first submission p 53 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 233 cost to the one or to the other the charge levied for the use or acceptance of the card respectively is such as to deter either of them then the card will not come to be used to effect payment17 in the case of closed or threeparty scheme the scheme owner itself must be able to match to bring into effective correspondence the two independent demands by way of its own pricing of its issuing service18 to cardholders on the one hand and of its acquiring service19 to merchants on the other hand the scheme owners issuing and acquiring costs are aggregated in its own hands and so are its issuing and acquiring revenues within the constraints set by its aggregate actual and potential costs and by its aggregate ac tual and potential revenues it can maximise output and profit in terms of card usage by effectively crosssubsidising the one side of the business with the help of the other i t can for example price below cost on the issuing side ie in its price to cardholders to the ex tent that it can recover the shortfall by pricing above cost on the acquiring side ie in its pr ice to merchants the different price elasticities of demand20 relative to cost on the different sides of the market for its card payment services can thus be reconciled by way of balancing exercise performed by the single supplier matching two supplies in way that bri ngs into effective correspondence the two independent demands while the market in this case may be characterised as twosided insofar as two separate demands are met by two different supplies the fact that there is only one supplier to these two demands in respect of any particular payment transaction means that special balancing mechanism is needed where an open or fourparty scheme is concerned however spec ial balancing mechanism has been shown to be necessary in principle here in offus transactions there are two separate suppliers to the two independent demands costs and rev enues in respect of issuing and acquiring are thus longer aggregated in the hands of single s upplier the balancing exercise to the extent needed to match the two demands with ea ch other and the two supplies with them can now only be performed effectively by transf er of revenue between the two suppliers in our view interchange is at least in principle reasonably necessary and thus legitimate means of bringing this balance about in arriving at this conclusion we have had to consider in some detail the nature of the joint 17 whether particular purchaseandsale transaction will also fall way will depend of course on whether there is substitute means of payment cash for example that is adequate an d acceptable to both parties the theory of two sided markets is discussed in the section of this chapter dea ling with the necessity of interchange in principle 18 we use this simplified terminology to include cardissuing t ransaction processing and related services on the issuing side 19 likewise here we use simplified expression for something with complex elements 20 price elasticity of demand refers to the responsiveness of cons umers through quantity demanded to changes in price for example cardholders may be very responsive to cha nges in price meaning that demand on the issuing side would be more price elastic on the other hand merchant s may be far less responsive to changes in price meaning that demand on the acquiring side would be price ine lastic banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 234 venture in open card schemes and various arguments advanced concerning their need for interchange we have given attention to the true nature of interchange as means of revenue allocation between financial institutions participating in card schem rather than as price for service by one such participant to another we have addressed the question whether the necessity of interchange in principle is refuted by the success achieved by card schemes in some countries without interchange or refuted by evidence that paym ent card issuing may be profitable even when interchange is left out of account our theoretical analysis is preceded by compilation and analysis of the data on card issuing merchant acquiring revenues and profitability which the participants in the enquiry furnished voluntarily and is based further on questions and answers aired at the hearings on this subject 615 danger of abuse and how best to prevent it in our view the necessity of interchange in principle as balancing mechanism an d thus its legitimacy in principle also does not serve to justify the methodologies currently employed by the card schemes and by their participating banks in arriving at the actu levels of interchange which are applicable to the various types of payment card transactions unsatisfactory aspects and implications of these methodologies are considered in detail in the course of this chapter here the broadest outline must suffice interchange enters invisibly into the merchant service charges levied by acquirers as common component in acquirers costs it sets floor for their merc hant service charges which cannot be competed away in turn it enters invisibly into consumer prices if interchange is necessary it has nonetheless the nature of necessary evil and should be kept as low as reasonably possible in fact as our investigation shows the art in interchange setting has been for the schemes or their participants to assess the m aximum share of issuing costs which merchants are likely at any time to be willing to bear by way of merchant service charges and to keep interchange at this level or just little below it as subsidy from the acquiring to the issuing side interchange obviously facilitate s card issuing competition between schemes for issuers has the paradoxical tendency to drive interchange upwards rather than downwards where as in south africa the major issuers are also the major acquirers the interests in maximising interchange are generally far more powerful than any that might tend to bring it down where interchange has come dow n the likelihood is that issuing costs have come down even faster or some immediate purpose of overcoming merchant resistance to card acceptance has been the aim21 the true constraint on interchange and on merchant service charges is ultimately the competit ion of increasingly archaic substitute means of payment little comfort can be taken from this 21 the bargaining power of larger merchants allows them to negotiate more favourable merchant service charges this can however not be seen as an effective constraint on the level of interchange fees set between participating banks banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 235 even monopolist in the payment card business would not be able to price bey ond the level at which the merchant would rather refuse cards and elect to accept only cash or cheques interchange revenue more broadly the interchange component concealed in the merchant service charge can be applied by issuers so as to increase cardholder deman d which then by way of network effects increases the degree of economic captivity of merchants the more cardholders there are wanting to use cards to make purchases the less can merchants really afford to refuse them thus the elasticity of merchant demand for acquiring services can be reduced and their willingness to endure abovecompetitive prices for the benefits that go with acceptance of payment cards can be increased interchange setting can therefore serve as means of market manipulation by the schemes themselv or collectively by their participating banks moreover by including in credit card interchange contr ibution by the merchant to the issuers costs of extending credit the current interchange methodologies of the schemes and their participating banks serve to privilege this line of business over competing fo rms of credit extension higher rates of interchange for credit cards compared with debit cards have helped mak the former cheaper for the cardholder to use while the potential for debit cards to replace cash and cheques has probably been retarded at the same time to the extent that t he level of credit card interchange causes merchant service charges for such transactions to exceed debit card service charges and the merchants costs of cash any resulting addition to consumer prices would imply that poorer consumers are to this extent being obliged to subsidise the rich all these aspects are explored in this chapter in short it does not follow from the necessity of interchange that the actual setting of inte rchange is free from the danger of abuse such abuse can improperly enhance the power producers have over consumers make poorer consumers pay for the privileges of richer ones and put the suppliers of one means of payment or credit in privileged position thus distorting competition and harmi ng both producer and consumer welfare in general as payments by card along with other methods involving interbank transacti ons through the national and international payments system become ever more common in consumer purchases and in the settlement of retail debts so the subject of interchange will rise in importance as public issue the advanta ges for society of replacing cash to an ever increasing extent with noncash methods of payment are we believe consid erable the increased use of payment cards and the development of payment card schemes have an important progressive role to play interchange is complex mechanis m once the necessity for such mechanism is accepted the focus must shift to the best means of ensuring that it is not abused in our view while our present framework of competition law banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 236 provides an ultimate backstop to protect the public it is too blunt an instrument in volving too many casespecific uncertainties to be fully adequate means of addressing the interchange problem at the same time in proposing any regulatory intervention in this are great care has to be taken to ensure that proconsumer competitive dynamics in the market for payment services are not stifled and that innovation is not obstructed 616 transparent and objecti ve interchange methodology transparency and objectivity and resulting confidence on the part of both suppliers and consumers are crucial to the setting of appropriate levels of interchange in the different payment streams in which it is shown to be necessary we do not consider that multiplicity of interchange levels bilaterally negotiat ed between the various participants in each relevant payment stream would offer satisfac tory way forward indeed bilateral interbank arrangements in this sphere are more likely to result in enhancement and abuse of market power than would uniform level of interchange applicable to all issuing and acquiring participants in the particular payment stream it became evident from submissions made by banks which participated in the enquiry taken together with subsequent exploratory consultations with them that all would fa vour or accept change from the present methods of setting domestic levels of interchange to process under compulsory regulation based on transparent methodology with objective criteria being established for each relevant payment stream through participatory process and justified in public with the resulting appropriate levels of interchange where applicable being independently assessed on the basis of audited data with the integrity of the process being verified under regulatory oversight with the levels of interchange so determined being thereafter enforced we recommend that the necessary regulatory scheme be drawn up and implement ed so as to enable this change to be effected and enforced as soon as practicable d etails of the proposal are set out in the section of this chapter dealing with appropriate regula tion of interchange we note here that the need for such change and the wisdom of it was not support ed by card schemes and we shall address their particular arguments and reservations in some detail in this chapter among retailers consulted while there was unanimous support for banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 237 safeguards against excessive interchange there were different views as t the best means of achieving that outcome 617 interchange and other payment streams in this chapter we also consider interchange arrangements in the electronic funds transfer eft and early debit order edo payment streams our recommendations in this regard are that interchange fees in these payment streams be brought within the transpa rent and objective regulatory scheme proposed where the necessity and level of inte rchange can be determined 618 card scheme rules in this chapter other issues raised in connection with the card schemes in part icular the honour all cards rule and the honour all products rule are also addressed we have concluded that the former is legitimate while the latter is not we consider whether the schemes should be obliged to permit merchants to surcharge customers who use cards to pay for purchases in the context of our proposal for regulatory solution to the interchange problem we advise against interfer ence with the schemes rules against surcharging22 we also deal with scheme rules which have restricted merchants in providing cas hback at the point of sale pos and make recommendations aimed at lifting them we briefly consider and make recommendations concerning current restrictions which limit the acquiring of card transactions to banks and indeed to those banks whic h are also substantial issuers of cards the regulatory issues involved are addressed in the chapter of this report dealing with acess to the payment system 62 payment cards in south africa 621 types of cards and card transactions payment cards are ordinarily classified as credit and charge cards on the one hand and debit cards on the other american express explains the distinctions between these different types of cards charge cards require the balance to be paid in full every month credit cards allow the cardholder to delay payment of all or portion of the balance under rev olving credit line which can be tailored to the financial situation of the cardholde r both are distinguishable from 22 see section 610 below banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 238 debit cards which debit the cardholders bank23 account for the amount of charge immediately upon conclusion of the charge transaction24 usually charge cards are included when the expression credit cards is used prac tice we adopt in this report unless otherwise indicated simple classification by type of card tends however to obscure the f act that technological developments may allow the same card to be used as credit card or debit card depending on the cardholders choice on each occasion at the point of sale the more crucial classification is thus according to the type of card transaction which is involved when the card is used debit card transaction25 or credit card transaction26 in south africa unique card named cheque card27 which functions like debit card but only requires signature for

mr jordaan of fnb said however evidently referring to credit cards that the market for payment cards had begun with barclays in 196842 absa for its part told us that credit cards were first introduced by barclays in the 1980s43 writing in the south african journal of economic history 44 stuart jones provides this more detailed account the acquisition of wesbank in 1975 not only provided barclays nati onal bank with the countrys biggest car finance company it also brought with it the wesbank car d schlesingers wesbank had introduced the credit card to the south african public in t he early 1970s it was characterised by two features revolving credit and high inte rest rates the wesbank card began the revolution in the way of making payments that has transformed retail transactions in the last quarter of the twentieth century today it seems hard to believe that in the early 1970s bank managers were advising customers against the use of such cards on the grounds that they would encourage them to get into high interest debt less than thirty years ago ordinary bank managers st ill reflected the conventional wisdom of an earlier era and in 1970 certainly did not foresee the way in which credit cards would mus hroom in the decade that followed modern banking had emerged to provide means of making and receiving payments at the time of the industrial revolution and the

productivity generally inherent in this utility and the potential for enhanced competition and lower prices inherent in the spread of payment card networks seem beyond serious dispute in the opinion of mr carl munson associate general counsel of mastercard who cam from new york to participate in the hearing on 18 april 2007 the technological development of south africa and the development of the pay ment systems here is in some respects even ahead of many developed countries in the world this year the banks and the schemes in south africa will introduce c hip pin the most advanced form of electronic payment that has only recently come to europe there are many countries in europe that are farther ahead than south africa and i can tell you as an american to my disappointment that there are plans in the u nited states to introduce chip pin so from technological standpoint the south afri can payment system and the card systems in general in south africa is favourable62 but the relative sophistication of the south african financial and payments sy stem is not automatically and not readily translated into benefits for the broad majority of the south african people the huge inequalities in property income education infrastruct ure and facilities which characterise our society reveal themselves in among other things the continued predominance of cash in retail transactions 624 continued predominance of cash figures provided by absa during the hearings indicate that cash is the means of payment used in 49 per cent of transactions in which that bank is involved63 fnb found that cash made up about 60 per cent by transaction volume when payments by cheque cas h credit cards and debit cards are compared64 in the case of major food retailers cash is still used by customers in 87 per cent of transactions65 in other words payment cards would account for only some 13 per cent of such transactions in this countr whereas in the uk 63 per cent of retail sales are done using payment cards66 about twothirds of the worlds population is unbanked in visas submission payment card products draw the unbanked into the banking system thus suggesting that their payment instrument promotes financial inclusion67 while there may be truth in this point at general level we have not been provided with evidence to show this effect in south africa the

as consequence their actual utilisation of those cards has initially been very low it does appear that debit card transaction volumes are growing much faster than credit card volumes68 but this growth is off an extremely low base69 as mr fergus of standard bank acknowledged the number of debit cards has grown exponentially but the problem has been to get them used70 we have been unable to reconcile the euromonitor figures for debit and credit card numbers and usage provided by nedbank71 with the figures provided by bankserv72 the differences cannot be accounted for simply by the fact that bankservs figures relate mainly to offus transactions processed through it nevertheless it seems clear that average debit card usage is in general much lower than average credit card usage figures for 2006 suggest that the average usage of debit card was higher than 4 to 5 transactions during the entire year whereas the average annual number of transactions per credit c ard may be as high as 40 whatever the case in this regard debit card usage presents far from satisfactory picture nationwide the low usage of debit cards appears in part to be consequence of lag in merchants acceptance of cards in both rural and impoverished urban areas during the hearing on 18 april 2007 mr bodibe of the panel observed i live in kempton park if i cross the road to tembisa it is cash economy usage of cards so why is that situation like that and why are we not s eeing proportionate increase of terminals in those type of situations73 mr grobler of mastercard answered as follows you know i think it

competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 247 last two years in the last two years the point of sales infrast ructure grew by about 30 per cent in south africa there are about 655000 point of sale devices in th market at this stage not merchants devices and i would like to make the assumption that the markets you are referring to are starting to be addressed so that is the one point the other point is that communication is obviously very important for the merchant to establish the transaction and this is where i believe that technology can play role capite c bank actually launched chip card technology where it is not necessary for every transaction to go online to get authorisation for the transaction so it is transaction that is not dependent on telecommunications infrastructure i would like to make the assumption that that technology will facilitate the development of point of sale infrastr ucture into the areas that you are referring to so just to summarise i think there is wonderful growth of t he point of sale infrastructure i think those markets are in the process of being addressed but i think technology will actually support that going forward as well 74 in subsequent hearing addressing the question of limited merchant acceptance of payment cards mr gericke of nedbank said to see greater acceptance there have to be few factors in play fi rst of all merchants need to have point of sale presence secondly and this is really the c rux for cardholders need to demonstrate that they want to purchase rather than draw cash on t heir debit cards and then thirdly we need to be able as acquirers to provide technology that is appropriate for that market generally we see that debit card holders have used their cards in the main to draw cash they just go the atm and draw the cash what we have seen in recent tim is that there is strong multiplier when those card holders who used it purely for cash s tart purchasing with the card so there is strong growth in the market and we see as that connection is made there will be more demand at the merchant to present the card f or payment for purchases the point i want to raise around the appropriate technology is that point of sale device as we have seen in many of the stores we go to is not necessarily the most appropriate for the spaza shop in tembisa and what we as nedbank have done is to create telephony solutions over cellphone where the merchant can acquire that transaction over the c ellphone or phone into call centre and acquire that transaction on that basis and so it is function of really the three things the need of those m erchants to say i want to start accepting card that is in part driven by customers who present their card for payment and then thirdly enabling technology beyond just the point of sale device75 caution related to unfamiliarity and relatively low financial literacy of many merchants and cardholders may contribute to the low level of acceptance and usage of cards the tendency of debitcard holders to use them only to draw cash and th to use cash for their purchases rather than insist on using the card to effect transactions is likely to be connected with the per transaction charge which debit card users currently have to p ay their issuing bank matter to which we return below76 in turn as mr

those without forma l bank account80 77 op cit 78 we dont accept the accuracy of the expression obtain credit at the point of sale but if the point is to emphasise the flexibility of this form of

costs in way that cash transactions cannot match the cashbased system is physical system driven by variable costs so that transaction costs decline only slightly as volume increases the payment card system however is more of an information system whose cost structure is driven prim arily by the fixed costs of setting up its interconnected components the greater the volume of transacti ons carried over an electronic network the lower the average cost per transaction81 the relatively low use of the payment card system in belgium results in cost per transaction of us060 higher than the cash cost of us052 because low volume does not allow for maximum exploitation of the fixed costs82 the advantages where noncash forms of payment take over from the use of ca sh are further described and elaborated from the visa and global insight point of view as follows the stock of currency held outside of the banking system constitutes pot ential source of unproductive economic resources because these cash stores are not available for credit expansion83 expanded use of electronic payments in the system reduces friction and increases the velocity of transactions84 electronic payments expand the available options for the secure recei pt of wages and income as well as for spending85 electronic payments empower the consumer in several fundamental ways th at cash and cheques cannot one of the clearest ways is the security that di spute resolution provides offering consumers form of insurance against purchases of faulty goods or services that are not delivered or lower in quality than expected insurance against lost stol or otherwise unauthorised use allows consumers to quickly shield themselves from liability at zero cost in some markets unlike lost cash or cheques86 electronic payments also provide the ability to control payment for goods and services over time by allowing buyers to pay now pay later or prepay credit cards provide liquidity through preapproved credit availability something that transactionspecific loans c annot do87 this works favorably for consumers merchants and banks because the process facilitates current period sales while minimising the cost

debits on their cards despite the promises of the card schemes the ombudsman for banking services indicated that his office d oes not receive great deal of credit card complaints our impression is that all the major banks have clear process in place to deal with disputed debits the process is however not communicated to customers or merchants very well our impression is that most customers and

252 be able to engage in credit extension themselves are able to com pete on more equal footing with larger merchants the increased spending resulting from credit cards enables merchants to benefit through higher turnover and increased economies of scale and scope in fact these latter benefits are not nowadays exclusive to credit cards they are intrinsic to any flexible credit facility which can be accessed with payment card whe re debit card is linked to bank account with credit facility the issuing bank takes the risk that the cardholder may fail to repay the risk in this respect is ultimately the same with credit card debt100 relative cost of cash according to visa101 in fact when everything is taken into account there is convin cing evidence that it costs retailers less to accept cards than it does for them to handle cash because cash handling costs are significant they include for example the costs of sortin g administering securely transporting and banking cash in addition when merchants accept cash they inevitably suffer from shrinkage in addition the fact that so many retailers offer cash back to cardpaying customers suggests that they prefer not to deal with large amounts of it cards are far more efficient they provide fast flexible service to customers they tend to lead to higher sales and when accepting cards merchants benefit from valuable payment guarantee m illions of merchants worldwide accept visa suggesting that the benefits of the system fa r outweigh the costs these obviously selfserving paragraphs blend together number of valid points with others that do not withstand critical examination we do not accept that there is convincing evidence that accepting cards is cheaper for merchants than accepting and handling cash we believe it has the potential to be significantly cheaper and this is one of the reasons why the methodology and the levels of interchange which feed downstream into merchants costs and prices nee d to be scrutinised adequate data is available to us from which we could draw firm conclusions regar ding the relative cost to merchants in south africa of accepting payment by card as compared with payment in cash however shoprite checkers provided some figures ggesting that its 100 101 in the case of credit cards however as we shall show further in this chapter the schemes and their participating banks have contrived via interchange to shift significant part of the cost of extending credit to their privileged customers onto the shoulders of merchants and through them onto consumer prices visa june 2007 second submission document s p 12 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 253 costs of cash are lower than its costs incurred in card acceptance102 we have not probed these figures further and we lack comprehensive comparative data for south africa which might make them meaningful mr munson of mastercard argued that studies of the costs to merchants of accepting cash are likely to understate them there are number of costs of accepting cash that typically are not mentioned when people consider cash costs people will generally consider for example the cash handling costs they will measure the fees that the bank charges the merchant for handling th cash at the end of the day there are also cash handling costs that are often t accounted for in other words you have to have employees who are spending time counting the ca sh balancing the cash register and doing things like that another cost that is often not taken into account is what is sometimes euphemistically called slippage or shrinkage which means that the clerks are taking money out of the cash register so that the merchan t is not getting the full amount of cash that was expended by consumers so the actual cost of the cash to the merchant will vary and there are hard studies to do to measure this we did study in australia number of years ago and i would say one of the difficulties of doing these studies is the merchants are very reticent to provide these numbers not surprisingly because if they tell the credit card companies what their cash costs are it could affect the negotiations so they tend to hide these facts but we did study with merchants in australia number of years ago the only way we could get any informati on at all was to agree not to publish the data itself and so you shall have to take my word for it but what it showed was that the fully measured out of pocket cost to merchants for handling cash varied quite considerably depending upon the nature of the merchant for very large retailers supermarkets in particular cash handling costs wer relatively low and they were lower than the cost of accepting credit card but for small merchants single proprietary stores cash handling costs were several times the cost of accep ting credit card so once again these are questions that cannot be answered in the ab stract if you really want to know what is the cost of accepting cash you would have to go out and collect the information you have to collect the data and then you would hav to look at what is the cost to this type of merchant or to that type of merchant and it would pr obably vary country to country and merchant category to merchant category 103 despite these observations international comparative data which was submitted t the enquiry on mastercards behalf at the hearing on 18 april 2007 does suggest that shoprite checkers position as last disclosed to us would not be at all unusual slide 10 of exhibit mm1 presented by dr koboldt for mastercard showed that in th united states for typical grocery transaction the cost to retailer of accepting cash is in fact 102 103 in letter to the commission from shoprite through its attorney s dated 20 july 2006 it estimated total annual turnover of r32 billion in 2005 for its retail operations p 1 of this 688 r22016 billion was attributable to c ash and 2919 r934 billion to debit and credit cards p 2 on p 12 the t otal amount of merchant service fees charged to shoprite by absa was said to amount to about r34 million per annum or about half of shoprites annual total merchants fee expense r68 million would be about 073 of the to tal debit and credit card turnover however shoprite also made the contradictory statement on p 2 that its costs arising from the payment of merchants fees amounted to approximately r100 million year which would equ 107 of the debit and credit card turnover on p 16 shoprite stated that its cash handling fees amounted to ab out r213 million per annum 097 of the cash turnover including the processing of cash the transit charges insurance and instore theft that would make cash more expensive than card acceptance if the more conservative figur given for merchant service fees is correct in subsequent spreadsheet submitted however shoprite lowered its total figure for the costs of cash to roughly r111 million per annum making cash at 05 cheaper than card acceptance transcript 18 april 2007 pp 103105 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 254 lower than for every other means of payment however when the full cost to society is also factored in cash turns out to be roughly as costly as credit cards and costlier than both signaturebased and pinbased debit cards dr koboldt explained by social costs i mean the entire cost incurred by the economy wit hin the economy as result of using cash for that particular transaction rather than another bank104 garciaswartz et al105 say with reference to the united states merchants face relatively high net private costs for electr onic payment methods as compared to paper payments consumers on the other hand face far higher net private costs for cash and cheques as compared to cards in fact consumers receive net benefits f rom using credit to pay for larger transactions consumer private costs are almost entirely timebased for all instruments including such items as the time cost of obtaining cash t an atm and the time cost of processing payment at the point of sale both of which favor elect ronic payment methods consumer private benefits are driven by cash back for cheques at the groce ry store which enables consumers to avoid going to an atm for smaller cash purchases for credit cards rewards are by far the largest item although the option value of cr edit is nontrivial for larger purchases106 merchant studies have found that paper methods are the cheapest for merc hants this is confirmed in our study of the distribution of private costs and benefits but what is cheap for merchants is relatively expensive for other parties to transaction certain parties especially consumers receive considerable benefits from payment cards which tip th eir net private costs in favor of that method of payment107 making an analysis of grocery store transactions in the united states these authors conclude cash the cheapest instrument for merchants is not the cheapes t instrument for the economy as whole at either the smaller or the larger transaction size coun ting all parties pin debit transactions are cheapest followed closely by signature debit f or the smaller transaction cash is third and credit is fourth but for the rger transaction paper instruments especially cash and nonverified cheques emerge as more costly forms of payment thus adding other parties to the transaction has changed the relative cost situat ion considerably108 they find that the implicit cost of cash increases dramatically wi th transaction size109 included here is also the increased risk of loss through theft where small purchases are concerned the transactional costs of cash may well be lower than the cost s of cards for merchants 110 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 id p 97 op cit id pp 194195 id p 196 id pp 187188 id p 185 on the consumer side however per transaction charges associated w ith withdrawing cash for purchases are consistently higher compared to the charges associated with po s debit card transaction on basic savings accounts offered by the big four banks the per transaction charges for an av erage transaction value of r27942 range between r280 and r200 for debit card pos purchase whereas for an onus atm transaction the charges range between banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 255 the social costs of cash relative to payment cards and other electronic means of payment would obviously include the costs to consumers associated with robbery and theft and the inconveniences involved in minimising such risks111 the banks costs incurred in cash handling relative to electronic payment processing must be counted as social cost nd the central bank incurs production costs for cash society thus subsidises the individual user dr koboldt made the valid observation that private payment systems such as the mastercard payment system sisting of the scheme issuers and acquirers must be selffinancing they must recover the ir costs exclusively from fees charged to users of the payment system by contrast cash is subsidised payment system the users of cash are not bearing the full cost i ncurred in providing the payment system the cost of printing and distributing notes the cost f collecting notes that are to be taken out of services and actually destroyed they are not borne by the merchant deciding to accept cash for the transaction nor are they born by the ca sh user they are borne by society as whole because cash being legal tender is publi cly subsidised payment system and it is just important bearing in mind when you then look at the welfare impact112 moreover merely comparing the net costs of card usage with the net cost s of cash whether the private costs or the social costs is surely too narrow framework for judgment the utility to the user of each means of payment is quite different not only f or the individual user but also in the aggregate valueinuse cannot ultimately be re duced to monetary equivalents if the aggregate social benefit utility of card usa ge is so great in comparison with that of cash as to warrant greater social expenditure in providing them then so be it the point remains however that the comparative benefits of payment cards however great they may be when compared with cash would not entitle the ca rd schemes or their participating institutions to appropriate to themselves supracompetitive pr ofit by virtue of providing payment card services if such services could be provided more ch eaply and yet the benchmark for the remuneration of the providers is set against the private cost of cash then it implies power in the market to price up to the cost or near the cost of that unsatisfactory and increasingly archaic substitute if the benchmark is the so cial cost of cash then the implication is even more serious that the schemes andor their participants have the power to appropriate to themselves by their private decisions an elem ent of social subsidy which in the case of cash is provided by the public power under ultimate democratic control accordingly what must be sought in the case of payment card services and ot her innovative means of payment is the full utilisation of their progressive potential at the lowest ie most 111 112 r500 and r460 cf mr munsons example concerning the dangers of making atm cash withdrawals to pay for purchases in some areas transcript 18 april 2007 pp 102103 later he added that for cash the difference between the co st to the merchant and the cost to society is very very large which basically shows that cash is heavily subsidised payment system id p 67 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 256 competitive prices to consumers and cost to society for reasons which we shall explain shortly there are serious grounds for concern that the aggregate prices of payment card services may be kept artificially high by the actions of the schemes and the combination of their participating institutions in interchange arrangements 625 global strength of visa and mastercard in understanding the current competitive landscape for payment cards in south af rica it is important to take account of the extent to which the fourparty schemes vis and mastercard have established their position internationally according to mastercard it provides services in more than 210 countries and rritories113 it has network of more than 24 million merchant acceptance locations around the world114 more than 1 billion cards have been issued worldwide under the mastercard bran d and its related brands115 maestro cirrus and mastercard paypass116 financial institutions issuing cards under these brands numbered almost 25000 world wide by 2005117 in that year cardholders across the world used mastercardbranded cards excluding maestro and cirrus for more than 191 billion transactions generating gross domestic volume of 17 trillion 118 and net revenue for mastercard of 29 billion119 according to visa it has 15 billion cards globally issued by some 22000 banks and other licensed institutions the total annual expenditure by cardholders using these cards in about 50 billion transactions with 24 million merchants is us45 trillion120 both visa and mastercard are able to switch and settle transactions internationally domestic transactions may also be switched offshore via processing centres loca ted in the usa europe and elsewhere currently for example domestic transactions in volving cards issued by investec bank are switched through visas international network121 switching transaction in this way takes fraction of second and both the mastercard and visa networks have vastly greater technical capacity than is currently used 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 company fact sheet on huwwwmastercardcom uh id id people may of course hold more than one card company fact

network advantages of fourparty schemes global cooperative associations combine the competition and innovation of the private sector with economies of scale shared technology and infrastructure and interoperability122 it is claimed that the fourparty or open loop system allows and encou rages competition among issuers for cardholders and among acquirers for merchants123 and that the benefit that arises from competition amongst issuers and from competition among acquirers that is seen within fourparty scheme is not found124 in the threeparty or closed loop system this section explores the evidence presented to the enquiry in this regard with roughly 5050 split of the south african market between visa and mastercard scheme cards 125 the tendency on the part of the major banks is towards issuing both126 in this situation once some major banks issue both scheme cards others that did not follow could well find the amount of their interchange receipts falling and the amount of interchange they pay away rising relative to those that did this process must tend to c onsolidate the dominance of the fourparty schemes in the payment card market127 efficiencies and network effects evidently drive the market towards convergence and towards fourparty schemes according to mr volker of absa although the big four banks might each be able to operate its own threeparty scheme in the longer term the duplication of infrastructure would make the system generally less efficient and smaller banks would simply not be able to afford to enter the acquiring market128 mr fergus of standard bank said in this regard if you have three party scheme the cardholders in that scheme all hav to be with one issuing organisation so if standard bank had threeparty mass market product it could 122

banks do have some ability to play one scheme off against anot her having regard to the fact that there are different choices of cards available including white cards nedbank tr anscript 19 april 2007 pp 6465 transcript 17 april pp 160161 the duplication of infrastructu re should not be exaggerated where acquiring infrastructure is concerned there can be and is significant shar ing between schemes thus the same merchant terminals can usually be used for visa and mastercard as well as diners club american express and other white label card transactions nevertheless each threeparty scheme t least has to have separate acquiring contract with each merchant this points to the relative efficiency of sc hemes which link all the participants without their having to conclude multiple direct contractual arrangements moreover the ability of threeparty scheme like american express to operate its merchant acquiring via an existing communications networ k with merchants has depended on that network being established in the first place to meet the needs of four party scheme transactions banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 258 only issue it to its customers it could not issue it to anyone else and the card would only be accepted at retailers who had signed up for that scheme so you would not have one scheme you would have in south africa twelve schemes all po tentially with different systemic risk different financial risk different standards d ifferent operating rules different dispute resolution criteria you know and you have then got to have the manage ment and the supervision of all those schemes the open scheme says that the four banks sic can issue cards to their cardholders and those cards can be used at merchants acquired by all of those four bank s and that is the difference the costs of numerous competing threeparty sc hemes would be absolutely enormous to the merchants and the cardholders the greatest advantage that mastercard or visa have is thirty years of financial settlement ex perience and thirty years of experience in the rules and regulations that we all comply with especially in dealing with disputes dispute resolution between the cardholder and the merchan ts so they are not favouring one or the other those rules have evolved over thirty ears and they are fantastically balanced set of documents to start that from scratc h has an enormous cost the costs in payment cards is in the disputes129 mr von zeuner of absa explained that change to multiplicity of threeparty schemes would be step backwards the card of any individual bank would never enjoy the same level of merchan t acceptance as visa and mastercard and can i illustrate our point by our own experience over whit label cards when we in the late 90s had bank teller card equivalent to white label card that just never took off other than being mechanism that we used in our atms130 mastercards representatives beginning with mr munson were questioned by memb ers of the panel about the need to retain the fourparty model mrs nyasulu you asked the question is interchange necessar can i turn that on its head and say rather and lets just assume for one minute that i am not going to fight with you on whether interchange is necessary or not but rather say is four party payment system necessary mr munson fourparty payment systems as compared wit h the other models i would call it twoparty system or private legal system where the merchant actually offers the credit card that is the original model in fourparty systems as com pared to threeparty systems like the american express system and there is even another variation which you might have seen slide in my remarks 3½party model where you have issuers but only single acquirer i call that 3½party model so to answer the question i think you have to say in comparison to what and then you can conclude few things first of all given the history of the business the business star ted with the twoparty systems and then there was the introduction of the threeparty systems and then t he introduction of the 3½ and the fourparty systems so if you look at the evolution of the business the business evolved from the twoparty model where if you wanted to use your credit card at store you had to get credit card from that store so if you shopped at lot of stores well then you had to have lot of credit cards now that evolved to threeparty system the advantage of threeparty system is that the entity that ru ns the system can sign up multiple merchants different merchants to accept its cards and then can go to the cardholder and say you only need one card and you can shop at many different locations and i think it is pretty obvious that it provides benefit to the cardholder at the s ame time it provides 129 130 transcript 19 april 2007 pp 107108 transcript 17 april 2007 p 72 standard bank april 2007 second s ubmission issuing part i p 10 defines white label card as piece of plastic that is issued by bank or nonbank and is interoperable in certain respects but is not association branded banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 259 benefit to the merchant first of all the merchant does not have to go to the expense and run t he risk of running its own business especially smaller merchants who probably could not afford their own credit card business and they now have greater number of customers to draw from one knows if i go into shop in south africa they do not know if i have good credit or bad credit but if i have mastercard they are pretty comfortable that i f they sell something they are going to get paid i should say american express because we are talking about the threeparty model if i would have pulled out the american expres s card they would be pretty comfortable that they will be getting paid that is three party but there is further improvement we can have fourparty system in fourparty system instead of having just one company offering cards and just one company signing up merchants we can allow different companies typically bank s to issue these cards and we can allow different companies to compete fo r the business of the merchants now from both the cardholders and the merchants poi nt of view i would contend that is an advantage there is now new form of competition i n the market so that cardholders and merchants will have additional choices if you want m astercard card as consumer in south africa you are not limited to dealing wi th one entity you can go out and from what i heard yesterday have as many as eleven choices to choose from and if you are merchant and you want to accept mastercard cards from wh at i heard yesterday you have choice not just of one entity to go to one acquirer you have c hoice of four there is another benefit which i think in the long run may even be more si gnificant and that is because these issuers and acquirers within the system are still compe ting with each other they are constantly innovating and because mastercard has to worry ab out the desirability of its service it is also competing and this tends to drive innovation i f you look at the major innovations in the payments market over the last 20 or 30 years for exam ple the introduction of electronic payments because in the old days credit card transactions were not electronic they were paperbased you know you zipzapped the card and you fil led out receipt and that was physically transported somewhere and then someone keyed in th eir numbers and one of the greatest innovations which took place in the 1970s was the in troduction of the electronic terminal that introduction was driven by the fourparty systems more recent example of sort of the same thing is the introduction of chip cards where you replace the magstripe with much more secure and much more versatile computer chip in the card and that innovation is driven by fourparty system mrs nyasulu okay i am going to stop you there for while if ou do not mind because you have answered the first part of my question what i now want to probe with you is you are obviously assuming that the only way that we can introduce comp etition is to follow the fourparty model whereas i am saying there is nothing that stops us introduc ing competition within threeparty model and having many american expresses in other words compete that way hence my question about why the fourparty scheme is being t outed as the only one because the threeparty model also gives merchants access to system that they want it gives consumers or cardholders access to system that they want so it does everything that the fourparty model does it just does not charge interchange mr munson two points i would make first of all i perhaps i did t express it well but in fact the threeparty model does not do everything that the four part model does there is intrabrand or intrasystem competition if you want an am erican express card you have one choice you go to american express mrs nyasulu is that bad thing mr munson it is for you folks to decide whether more comp etition is better than less competition but it is fact that there is an additional form of competition within fourparty system it is fact that if you look at merchant fees around the world you compare merchant fees mscs between three party systems and four party systems generall the merchant fees of fourparty systems are lower banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 6 payment cards and interchange 260 chairperson but there is interchange mr munson so let address that there is interchange fee why is that well because once again interchange fee is this term that we use to apply t the to use mr bodibes example before of reallocating the costs within th system and i say yes that is the purpose of interchange but do not misunderstand the mere fact that th reeparty system does not formally need an interchange because it does not have to move money between different banks does not mean it is not moving money between the acquiring and the issuing sides in fact there is some good indication to believe that in most c ases they are actually moving more money from the merchants side to the cardholders sid in other words there is even more subsidisation of cardholder fees going on in three par ty systems so yes four party systems need interchange but both systems need to balance the demand as dr koboldt explained and therefore you do not avoid the need to balance the system just because you have threeparty model mr grobler can i just possibly explain in the context of south frica the point about the development of the acceptance infrastructure throu gh the fourparty model it is developed through the four we actually have got five acquiring banks in south africa i want to include capitec as an acquiring bank as well so the col lective result is much wider than the threeparty context but i think if you look at the amount of products that has been issued in the fourparty model in comparison to the amount of products that has been issued in the threepart model currently in south africa there are about 24 million debit cards th at can be used at point of sales in the four party model that have been issued part of th at is the mzansi card and really for us to address the market that we really need to address i would make the assumption that in the context of the threeparty model it may be much more expensive to penetrate the market as deep as we can do potentially through the fourpar ty system i do not want to argue it is an either or i think its both factor mrs nyasulu i would support it on the basis that i said i would support theories you and i can only put theories on the table we have not tested it but i f i am willing to explore theories i am quite happy for you to explore the same and it is quite po ssible that it would be expensive mr munson and we are not against threeparty models mrs nyasulu and i am not against fourparty i am looking for different way to do things and whether mr munson my own personal view is that consumers and merchants are most benefited when they have as many choices as possible personally i do not think it is bad thing that american express exists i mean certainly they prompt us to pay even mor attention to our business because we know they are very effective competitor and they run very fine company so to though it should not be choice between thre and fourparty it should be both and threeparties do bring certain advantages to the market and fourparty systems bring other advantages and i think consumers and merchants are benefited if they have both choices dr koboldt can i just add one observation that is more theoret ical observation the benefit of intrascheme competition i think extends further than j ust being able to say well i can get my mastercard from nedbank absa or whoever the benefits extend to fostering competition amongst banks for whole range of services to t he extent that there is tendency for customers to want to have relationships or single relat ionship with the bank for range of services if you had only threeparty systems competi ng with each other centrally if i wanted credit card i could only go to one of those few bank s who are sufficiently large to be able to run threeparty system we heard yesterday from absa tha t it is not even guaranteed that they could launch threeparty system on their own s that would severely limit the number of threeparty systems that could be sustained in the market so if i banking enquiry report to the

highly decentralised entity visa permits great degree of autonomy to member institutions in product development product management pricing and promoti on the unique characteristics of this governance structure132 enable the central organisation to ensure cooperative efforts in the management of common assets while fostering competitive market model at the retail institutional level while the c ommon benefits of system sharing are conferred on all members greater product innovation quality and dive rsity are achieved at lower prices locally133 there are considerable benefits in maximising joint assets and ensurin g interoperability in the payment system huge investments in physical and knowledge capital are required to establish and maintain the infrastructure that drives the flow of interna tional transactions including instantaneous authorisation ongoing risk management processes and daily clearing and settlement the nature of the systems cost s tructure with high fixed costs relative to low marginal costs requires substantial vol ume of transactions to warrant the infrastructure investment but it is through the interoperability of the system that common benefits are produced with larger volumes this results in efficient shar ing of common resources fully utilising the fixed assets of the business and exploiting economies of scale and scope134 nedbank confirmed that the fourparty model has promoted interoperabilit between banks which in the south african context has been great success story135 visa noted that interoperability between banks drives electronic payments which are more efficient than cash bring people into the banking system increase spending and re duce the grey economy and increase tax revenue136 fnb expressed the advantages of the fourparty model in this way ms beer essentially the fourparty model has many contributors it is global interoperable system as we know it in south africa today so th ere are many contributors that contribute to the cost of that model there are many contributors to maintaining that infrastructure maintaining the integrity of that infrastruc ture so the four party model has succeeded in gathering critical mass threeparty model has not through the fourparty model one is able to gain efficiencies economies of scale etc in the threeparty model as we know it today the threeparty model in fact feeds off the infrastructure that fourparty model eventually provided to the market and that is the point that we are trying to illustrate that the fourparty model has already achieved critical mass which makes it nec essarily more 131 132 133 134 135 136 transcript 18 april 2007 pp 121 131 in fact the structure of mastercard is essentially similar op cit p 16 id 16 nedbank transcript 19 april

report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information efficient in that sense137 in the rollout of debit cards by absa it was found to be important to get brand more universal than the banks own brand hence the involvement of the card associations 138 on top of the brand they also offered world class body of rul operating regulations security standards that we could access at marginal cost compared to if we had to that ourselves plus it would also open up the ability to have other banks terminals acquiring our systems and i mr volker think that whole system enabled greater economi of scale benefits to our consumers and ultimately also to the merchants139 however most south africans have immediate need of card that can be used overseas this raises the question regarding the scope for developing white labe l or locally branded cards as cheaper alternatives to the brands of the major card schemes especially for consumers who do not enter into global internet transactions or use cards beyond the border of south africa or beyond sadc indeed south africa does have several successful albeit small white label cards in circulation expansion of such cards on national basis has intuitive appeal especially given the successful national white label schemes developed in the past in countries such as norway however it is important to point out that the successful national white label schemes were generally developed together with the banking industry and before global standards of interoperability became widespread even in the scandinavian countries as we discuss below the movement now is in the direction of linkups with globally branded fourparty schemes in south africa interoperability in the payment card arena was developed in conjunction with these fourparty schemes establishing or developing an entirely new proprietary or interoperable network on national scale is inherently complex and expensive mr gericke so chair as i understand the question its around extending effectively white label cards to look and feel and operate like visa and mastercard but not through the visa or master schemes chairperson yes that is exactly the question mr gericke there would be real difficulty in that because for int eroperability you will have to create payments platform of sorts with its own rul what works in these twosided models or the private label card businesses is that that there are very specific retailers and only their stores that can be shopped at by clients as soon as one wants to ta ke private label white label card across multiple domains you need payment s platform of sorts to 137 138 139 transcript 19 april 2007 pp 191192 transcript 17 april 2007 p 100 visa advanced much the same arg ument fourparty scheme not only

ages and make sure the technology can talk to one another chairperson well i am setting up this particular scenario with payment system of some sort in mind you can in cooperation with the others set up payment system of some sort mr shuter yes chair that is possible if one looks at many european countries and how they started their debit card schemes they were local within country and they were proprietary systems that the banks created or the regulator crea ted that facilitated that card payment within that region so that is possible but it still requi res payments platform to be created and to be synthesized with all the rules of acceptance but i t is possible140 mrs nyasulu observed that both closed systems american express and diners club are aimed at high net worth individuals141 mr fergus offered the explanation that this is on account of the intrinsic cost of the closed scheme which required higher than normal transaction values for merchants on the one hand and higher than normal benefit s to cardholders on the other hand in order to generate the necessary revenue there are relatively few people in any market who are prepared to pay the premium for all those services142 although he was not prepared to say that threeparty schemes are suitable only for high net worth individuals he did not know of any threeparty scheme that is suitable for the lower end of the market143 in the light of the information presented to the enquiry it appears that the ac tual and potential benefits arising from the fourparty networks are considerable and that an attempt to prohibit and replace them domestically with only threeparty schemes would be misconceived to the extent that remedies are required to address abuses or the d angers of abuse brought about by the growth and power of these schemes those remedies mu st be so constructed as not to isolate south africa from the mainstreams of global development or throw the baby out with the bathwater 63 merchant acquiring and merchant service charges 631 merchant acquiring in the th reeparty and fourparty schemes as we have seen an essential characteristic of fourparty card schemes s uch as visa and

concerned both mastercard an d visa have recently restructured their global operations so that participating issuers and acquirers are longer technically members but simply licensees in terms of the schemes145 in south africa at the time of making its first submission to the enquiry mastercard had nine principal member banks and one affiliate member bank146 visa at the time of making its submissions had ten principal members147 and two associate members148 in south africa however at the time of the initial submissions while all these participating b anks were allowed to issue visa

submission document g id chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 265 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information times day153 the process typically involved when participating bank acquires merchant for card scheme and the schemes concern with the risks involved were described by mastercards representatives as follows154 mr grobler i think typically when an acquiring bank will approach merchant part of the process will be to look at the viability of the business case of th merchant and the second point that will be addressed is the merchant category code that is the business segment in which the merchant operates typically that will play very impor tant role in terms of the risk inherent in the business the acquiring bank will also then do an ass essment in terms of the business practice and the integrity of the merchant and at that stage the acquiring bank will typically engage in discussions with the merchant on the merchant service fee after they have reached agreement on that there will be typically merchant acqu iring agreement which the merchant will engage in and the acquiring bank then has got the res ponsibility to do training with the merchant in terms of risk and security t hat is more or less on very high level the process it is also expected from the acquiring bank to visit the merchant or to do site visits on an annual basis that is normal conventional merchan t i have not referred to the typical mail order or the telephone order environment i have referred to typical smaller merchant you know where the acquiring bank will typically install point of sale device with the merchant so that is normal ly not an integrated system in the scenario of larger retailers obviously the point of sale equipment is integrated with their infrastructure and that may be more complex process but i think on high level what is important is assessment is the training of the merchant and then the m erchant agreement mr munson essentially mastercard has two concerns that it re lies upon the acquirer to address one is to make sure that we do not bring into the system fraudulent merchant or merchant that is operating business in way that will increase the risk to the business and secondly to make sure that the merchant is abiding by the r ules terms and conditions of the system accepting cards etc the acquirer provides tw essential services and the first is the acquirer actually assumes the risk financial risk to the syst em if the merchant does something wrong and secondly the acquirer assures us that the merchant is following whatever rules are applicable to the merchants business as it part icipates in the system mr grobler we also expect the acquiring banks to monitor the incidence of charge backs now charge back is technical term that we use for transactions that have been disputed by cardholders with merchants and if it exceeds certain ratio then we expect the acquiring bank to take some action with that merchant you know normally it is corrective action it is training and some kind of intervention with them mr bodibe now that the merchant is now compliant and the agreem ent has been signed what financial outlays should the merchant invest to participate in the syste m so basically how much do they pay for the terminals and also for ensuring inte gration of their communication systems with the banks system 155 mr grobler you know it is obvious that there is bus iness agreement between the acquiring bank and the merchant but what will typically happen in south africa and gain i am referring to the smaller merchant i am not referring to the bigger retailers is that the smaller merchant will typically rent the point of sale device from the acquiring bank the acquiring bank will provide the merchant with stationery and the necessar supporting material there is move away from fixed line telecommuni cation to gprs 153 154 155 id transcript 18 april 2007 pp 7381 mr munson intervened to point out that the question could be answered by mastercard only at general level and that the details of such arrangements with merchants would best be btained from the acquirers id p 76 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 266 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information communication so normally that will be set up for the merchant and i would say that is more or less the capital outlay for the smaller merchant for the bigger rchants it is obviously bit more complex in terms of integration with their systems mr munson if you look at the way the acquiring business is st ructured around the world you find different models but ultimately what it boils down to is to connect merchant to the mastercard system it does require investment in equipment in communications in training and in ongoing monitoring and the model can vary from country to country and from merchant to merchant essentially the negotiating process is to decide i s the acquirer going to put up the capital and then charge monthly fee or service fee or mak it part of the merchant service charge or is the merchant going to provide that equip ment on its own and thereby reduce the amount of money it pays the acquirer and assum the cost itself and there are many many variations that can be made to accomplish those purposes156 mr bodibe asked mastercard about the factors usually built into the service charge paid by the merchant to the acquirer mr grobler as i have indicated and i am typically referring to the single acquiring model what will typically be reflected in the merchants service fee will be the risk profile of the merchant it will be the turnover of the merchant it will be the product set of the merchant the kind of products internal risk involved in that whether the mer chant is well established or not and the cost of service to merchant in the single acquiring s cenario where we made the assumption that the acquirer provides the terminal and the stationery there is obviously cost involved in that as well maintenance cost so i would s ay those are more or less the variables that will play role in the merchants service fee obviously there is some business strategy behind it as well some of the acquirers may tr to focus on smaller merchants some may focus on bigger merchants or retailers typically if it is product that has got inherent risk to it let think about mail order telephone order and there may be higher level of risk in ter ms of the delivery of the product on that then that may play role in the setting of the merchants s ervice fee mr munson risk can be huge factor i recall earlier in my ca reer at mastercard in the 1990s you may recall there were wave of airline failures p an american ran out of business twa went out of business continental went through chapter 11 and if you think about it if you were an acquirer of an airline where huge amounts of tic kets are bought in advance and then the card holders come back to the bank and say i bought this t icket and the airline is out of business give my money back and then under the charge back process that eddie mentioned the issuer then charges that back to th acquirer and says give my money back and now the acquirer is sitting there with liabilit and its customer the merchant is out of business it is just an example that the risk that the acquirer takes can be very large on the other hand if the acquirer is dealing with mainline retailer or large department store that has long track record you know the risk ma be relatively small so risk plays huge part in the setup and management of the payment system for the issuer for the acquirer and for the scheme because we actually guarantee t he payment of the issuer to the acquirer and if the acquirer cannot meet the charge backs we guaran tee that so we are very concerned about who are our issuers and who are our acquirers how well ar they running their businesses are they taking excessive risks so risk becomes one of the most important factors in just about every aspect of the business the main scheme rules relating to the allocation and management of risk are outlined below visa explains that third party processors have arisen to take on some or all of the processing 156 in answer to mr bodibe mr munson confirmed that merchants would ordinar ily have choice whether to invest in their own equipment or rent it from the acquiring bank id p 78 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 267 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information responsibilities on behalf of their clients whether these clients be retailers or acquiring banks number of these third party processors connect directly to visa and mastercard on behalf of their customers visa allows outsourcing by its members licensees of certain card payment services albeit under careful scheme rules157 the acquiring bank must nominate the processor and remains responsible to the scheme for adherence to standards and good business practice158 as has been explained above threeparty schemes like american express and diners club do their own card issuing and merchant acquiring however to extend its operations threeparty scheme may give acquiring and issuing licenses to institutions to carry out these functions on its behalf in the case of american express this is described as its global network services gns business model159 in south africa this model prevails with nedbank functioning as the sole licensee for american express160 essentially nedbank is licensed by american express to issue and acq uire amex cards in the south african market we are the only entity that is licensed so we commonly call that closed loop system we are the single issuer you wont fi nd an american express card which does not say nedbank on the back and we are the single acquirer s for merchant to accept american express cards they have to sign merchant ag reement with nedbank161 acceptance of american express cards by merchant is simple matter where nedbank is also the acquirer for the merchants acceptance of mastercard and visa cards the same nedbank infrastructure is readily available where an american express card is u sed at merchant whose acquiring service for accepting mastercard andor visa cards is from another bank that other bank plays courier role by routing the american express transaction to nedbank162 that other bank is allowing its infrastructure to be used for the acceptance of american express cards such an arrangement depends on bilateral agreement between nedbank and the other bank before merchant relying on that other banks infrastructure can accept american express cards however the actual acquiring relationship where the merchant accepts american express cards is not with that other bank but with american express t hrough its sole licensee nedbank thus it remains closed system in this situation as well163 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 visa june 2007 second submission document id document g american express october 2006 comments in

operating under franchise from diners club international164 diners club south africa is the issuer and acquirer of diners club cards in south africa negotiates merchant service charges with merchants and decides on the level and incidence of fees on diners club cards165 diners club transactions are acquired using for service fee the merchant acquiring infrastructure of banks acquiring under the fourparty schemes166 632 scheme rules and practices in th allocation and management of risk the fourparty card schemes allocate liability for the costs of fraud and othe r risks in the system by means of various rules and practices visa states how the liability is distributed between the cardholder and merchant by the issuer and the acquirer is matter of local law custom and practice and the c ommercial bargaining position of the merchant and cardholder and set out in the cardholder agreement and the merchant contract167 however in general the liability loss lies where it falls168 once the card transaction has been approved the cardholder receives the goods and the merchant receives payment guarantee from the acquiring bank169 in providing such guarantee the acquiring bank is supported by promis of the issuing bank to honour payments made by the acquiring bank170 visa and mastercard both underwrite these guarantees and take initia l responsibility to cover any losses that member institution may incur because of another member institutions default171 in most instances the issuing banks are liable for fraudulent transactions in the system172 the promise of the issuing bank to pay the acquiring bank includes fraudulent transactions 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 sbsa april 2007 second submission acquiring p 4 issuing part i p 3 sbsa bought controlling interest in

information and transactions for which the cardholder ultimately defaults the payment guarantee in most instances enters into the cost calculations of the interchange fee that is paid over from the acquiring bank to the issuing bank however the merchant and likewise the merchants acquiring bank will be vuln erable to chargebacks chargeback as defined by visa is the ability of the issuing bank to charge back transaction to the acquirer unpaid 173 the acquirer will usually then have recourse against the merchant issuing banks are only entitled to make charge backs to acquirers and acquirers to merchants for valid reasons which are described in the operating rules and regulations of the schemes174 mr herzfeld of the south african retailers payments issues forum sarpif while supporting the right of cardholders to dispute transactions during the chargeback period pointed out that this leaves the payment guarantee to the merchant far less than unconditional in his experience where chargeback is made the merchant is ultimately left to resolve the dispute with the cardholder175 absa explains that176 for point of sale transactions made by either credit cards or debit cards the c ustomer is liable for lost and stolen cards up to the point of reporting card l ost or stolen 177 after the customer reported the card lost or stolen the liability passes on to the issuing bank this card is then loaded onto the hot card file which updates to each of the point of sale terminals this takes two days to be effective and the card r emains on the hot card file for 60 days the verification of the hot card file then happens automatical ly by the terminal the merchant will then have message that the card is lost or stol and what the appropriate protocol to follow at this stage is if the merchant follows the appropriate procedure then the liability remains with the issuing bank if the merchant does not f ollow the procedure then the merchant bears the risk of potential loss for point of sale purchases made by credit cards suspected fraudulent trans actions are first charged back to the merchant who then has to prove that the transaction is authe ntic by submitting the point of sale slip signed by the customer178 the merchant may then submit the transaction for settlement whereupon the liability will mo ve to the issuer if fraud has occurred then the issuer is liable for this if it has not occ urred eg where the cardholder forgot about the transaction then the transaction would be paid by the cardholder where it 173 174 175 176 177 178 visa june 2007 second submission annexure h p 1 chargebacks ar an integral part of the system provided for in the schemes operating regulations there is range of possible reasons for chargebacks but typical instances are where the cardholder asserts that he or she did not authorise or par ticipate in the transaction or where processing error has occurred also as visa puts it the cardholder by using their visa card is offered protection where merchant fails to deliver goods and services in accordance with the cardholders specification or contract if the cardholder used cash the cardholder would have to sue the mer chant directly instead they raise concern with the issuer who deals with the acquirer who looks to resolve this situation with the merchant where there is dispute between the issuer and acquirer the

cards chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 270 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information can be shown that the merchant was negligent for example if the si gnature is vastly different to that on the card then the acquiring bank would be liable and would pass the charge through to the merchant in the mail order telephone order and internet environments where the card is not physically presented to the merchant if the customer signs an affidavit stating t hat he or she did not make the transaction it will be charged back to the acquiring bank w hich in turn will charge it back to the merchant however if special security requirements of master card and visa in respect of such transactions have been met179 the issuing bank would be held liable and so would have to recover the payment from the cardholder in counte rfeit fraud such as card skimming and application fraud identity theft unless negligence n the cardholders behalf can be proven the issuing bank is also responsible in res pect of all types of cards180 with the introduction of the emv card181 liability shift has occurred this means that the acquiring side becomes liable

cardholders account the scheme withhol ds or deducts the merchant service charge when remitting the price of the cardholders purch ase to the merchant because the issuing and acquiring functions are performed by the same institution ie the scheme owner although it may perform these functions with the assistance of licensees there is explicit interchange fee as in the fourparty schemes as explained above there is nevertheless an implicit or notional flow of interchange or intrachange within the scheme owner in the sense that revenue raised on the acquiring side w ould be applied by the scheme owner to support the issuing side of its business such notional flow being purely internal does not appear in the diagram below figure 3 flow of payments in threeparty system in the open or

is r equired the card is swiped through point of sale terminal or in the case of chip card its chip is read the data in the magnetic stripe or the chip instructs the terminal the authorisation request is directed to the issuer via the d esignated switch in south africa this is usually banks erv but could be one of the global switching centres of the card schem the issuer either responds directly or

the switch and wi ll charge small fee of around 10 cents per transaction where large volumes are invo lved the interchange fee is typically set on multilateral basis for all the members participati ng in the card scheme185 whilst the merchant service charge gets set by each individual acquiring bank in bilateral negotiation between the acquiring bank and each of its merchants even though the level of the merchant service charge differs significantly between mercha nts and acquiring banks the flow of payments discussed above applies to both credit card and debit card transactions the only major difference between debit card and cred it card transactions is that the per transaction fee f currently only applies when debit card is us ed in the case of credit card the cardholder pays an annual fee but per transaction fee 184 185 the merchant service charge is sometimes referred to as commissi on or as merchant discount for reasons discussed later in this chapter we consider discounting to

fee level and those pricing ranges would typically be the volume of transactions per number the value of those transactions the average transaction value very importantly the merchant category merchant category has direct bearing on costs like fraud for insta nce we are also aware of what our competitors are doing in this market it is very aggress ive market and as nedbank we win and lose business daily so we do take close heed of what our competitors are doing we then also evaluate the depth of the overall banking relationship wi th nedbank where we have clients who are multiple users of other products and services we br ing that to bear on the price we look at the complexity of integrating that merch ant into our system some of them have multiple lanes in their stores they need multiple devices or in fact they have their own infrastructure which we need to then electronically plumb into our backing systems and then also very importantly we look at the value added serv ices having done needs analysis what i mean by that is we offer things like cashback t our retailers ie the ability of retailers to provide customers with cash back at the point of sale we offer airtime topups and depending on the needs analysis and going through these factors at high vel we then determine range and we would then negotiate the final fee with th merchant within that range generally mr bodibe so the application of this principle means that you will charge differently depending on the size of the merchant and so forth mr gericke that is correct195 nedbank would not as general rule price the rental for terminal into the merchants service charge it would be distinct and separate196 this is evidently the norm197 fnb say that the biggest ten of its merchants account for 88 per cent of the merchant confidential service charge revenue that the bank receives these merchants pay fnbs lowestfrb merchant service charge which averages 189 per cent for this category198 interchange sets floor for merchant service charges it has been pointed out that despite the uniformity of interchange merchant service charges vary considerably under pressure of competition between acquirers and could theoretically be below the level of interchange199 taken in isolation however it would not be possible for an acquirers merchant service charge to be less than the cost to it of paying interchange to issuers because then the acquirer would be out of pocket as mr volker of absa acknowledged200 mr munson of mastercard put the same point this way banks have shareholders banks are

is one of the acquirers costs and it will ve to recover that cost from its customer which is the merchant if the acquirer wishes to run its business profitably it will have to recover all of its costs202 as mr shuter of nedbank stated it is indisputable that interchange is significant input cost in the merchant service charge in the fourparty model203 according to the acquiring figures provided to the enquiry by absa standard bank nedbank confidential frb and fnb 62 per cent of the total merchant service charge goes towards the interchange fee paid away visa says referring to the situation internationally acquirers use wide range of methodologies to ensure their total m dr merchant discount rate ie merchant service charge revenues sufficiently c over interchange fees and other costs to build positive business case in certain circumstances acquirers have used socalled interchange plus contracts which involves pricing to the merchant based on visa interchange rates pl us additional processing fees as appropriate some acquirers may bundle their visa payment card acceptance business with other banking services for their merchant customers and offer pricing options ref lecting the suite of services offered204 as mr volker also argued the merchant is not just customer of the bank in terms of the acquiring relationship but in terms of broader banking relationship which inclu des cash handling foreign exchange dealings capital ma rket lending etc so it could be that in terms of the broader relationship there is some kind of special deal that is made that could affect the acquiring business so as to make the merchants service charge lower than the rate of interchange on card transactions205 the potential for this might also be greater in the case of banks whose issuing bas is large enough relative to their acquiring base to ensure that minimal net interc hange is actually paid away or that are net receivers of interchange206 however the evidence showed that it would be highly exceptional if indeed it ever occurs for merchant service char ge in south africa to be lower than the rate of interchange applicable to the type of transaction concerned207

4 above the lowest rates of merchant service charge reported are in all instances higher than the chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 277 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information realistically therefore the interchange fee generally sets floor for the merchant service charge208 being fixed fee charged to acquirers the interchange component in the merchant service charge is sheltered from competition on the acquiring side209 it is answer to this to say that the acquiring market is fiercely competitive see below because that competition whether mild or fierce is going on ultimately above the interchange floor210 fundamentally if the interchange charge were not passed through or substantially passed through to the merchant it could not be effective in its declared purpose of achieving balance between merchant demand and cardholder demand as visa expressed it211 interchange is coordination mechanism it seeks to achieve indirectly by influencing behaviour what is achieved directly in threeparty system by its proprietor212 this vital function of interchange in fourparty systems is discussed further in this chapter in the section on the necessity of interchange section 66 635 interchange enters into consumer prices by means of the merchant service charge interchange further passes through in to the prices which merchants charge to consumers mr bishop appearing as part of fnbs team tried to persuade us to the contrary213 but we found his argument difficult to follow varying market conditions and varying competitive circumstances of merchants will obviously affect the extent to which the cos ts incurred by this one or that can be recovered through the prices individually charged to consu mers but 208 209 210 211

enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information costs unavoidably incurred by all on sustained basis higher up in supply chain must ultimately pass on down the fourparty schemes and their participating institutions rely in general notwithstanding price competition between acquirers on interchange passing through to merchants as component of merchant service charges this serves as mechanism capable of regulating merchant demand for cards and it would seem entirely arbitrary to deny in g eneral similar passthrough further down from merchants to customers indeed it was accepted during the hearings when the costs to the merchant of accepting various cards were compared with the costs to the merchant of accepting an d handling cash that both costs would find their way in general into consumer prices214 this was the premise of the debate on whether cash customers might be subsidising card users or debit card users subsidising those using credit cards215 inasmuch as the intrachange of the threeparty schemes is reflected in their merchant service charges consumer prices are likewise ultimately affected to the extent that relationship emerges between the level of the merchant services charges applied by the fourparty schemes and the somewhat higher merchant service charges applied as premium by the threeparty schemes if there is an effective floor set to merchant service charges by fourparty interchange then that serves as support also for the higher three party charges 636 competition among acquirers in the fourparty schemes number of those giving evidence to the enquiry were at pains to emphasise that competition between the acquiring banks for contracts with merchants is very intense nedbanks affirmation of this has been quoted above mr jordaan of fnb argued first of all it is very competitive market out there it is not t hat there is one party that has exclusivity over merchant if we go to any of our customers and they feel tha t what we are charging is too high they are very quick to go to our competitors216 ms beer spoke of acquirers every day trying to eat other acquirers breakfast217 214 215 216 217 as mr cope of pick n pay explained with reference to the merchant service charge it is part of our normal cost structure so to the extent that we have payroll operations occupancy and administrative costs it is part of that cost the fact that we do at the end of each year make profit imp lies that it is recovered in prices transcript 13 november 2006 p 8 as to this issue see further below transcript 19 april 2007 p 124 id p 130 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 279 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information absa likewise maintained that the acquiring market is hugely competitive with massive competition between the banks to get the best deals with merchants who are highly aware of the bargains they can variously extract from the banks and with deals renegotiated annually218 when dealing with the ability of merchants to switch acquirer ms beer of fnb said in cases where the equipment is not owned by the retailer ob viously the retailer would need to take commercial decision as to whether he wants to fund it of f his own balance sheet or whether he wishes to rent those services and the equipment through the services of another acquirer so switching could be very simple for smaller merchan ts it is simply matter of signing up with another acquirer and for that acquirer to install another po int of sale device at that customers outlet219 also contracts with merchants tend to be of shortterm nature normally twelve months but typically with 30day notice period in few cases there would be longer notice period220 it is evidently possible for merchants to switch their acquirer without having to swit ch their main banking relationship at the same time in the case of fnb about 20 per cent of theconfidential merchant acquiring customers have their main banking relationship with another bank221 we have referred above to the level of interchange as floor for the price competition between acquiring banks for merchant contracts it was stated in evidence by absa that when interchange was lowered in 2003 this was reflected in fall in merchan ts service charges even though merchants were not necessarily aware of what interchange is or of the level of it222 frb ms beer of fnb said that when interchange came down in 2003 the full benefit was passed on to the majority of the customers ie merchants that contribut ed to the volume223 according to mr jordaan the extent of competition on the acquiring side compelled this224 fnb submitted substantive information in this regard in june 2007225 itconfidential stated

further reducing to 205 per cent in march 2007 due to continued pressure on prices nedbank also provided simil ar evidence in august 2007226 before attributing the reduction in the merchant service charges simply to competition one must bear in mind that the banks themselves had just agreed to bring interchange down so that merchant service charges could be deliberately lowered and especially deb it card usage generally increased the 2003 reductions are therefore not proof per that when acquirers costs come down in south africa the benefit is passed through downstream 637 eligibility for participation as acquirers in the fourparty schemes on paper any institution that complies with the mastercard and visa rules and requirements will qualify to be member according to their acceptance criteria and can subsequently obtain access to this open payment scheme as an issuer andor acquirer mastercards eligibility criteria as set out in its first submission227 indicate that any f inancial institution that is authorized to engage in financial transactions under the laws andor confidential government regulations of the country or any subdivision thereof in which it is or ganised or mastercard principally engaged in business would be allowed membership228 any such financial institution also must be regulated and supervised by one or more governmental authorit ies andor agencies authorized and empowered to establish andor enforce rules regarding fi nancial transactions and the financial condition activities and practices of entities engaging in such financial transactions with respect to any financial institution that does not t ake deposits it shall be further requirement that financial transactions constitute substantiall all of the business conducted by such institution229 in the event that these eligibility criteria would violate the laws or regulati ons of any country then the mastercard board may modify them accordingly consistent with the p urposes of confidential mastercard230 the stated purposes include mastercard 1 to facilitate the interchange of card privileges on an internatio nal basis 2 to facilitate the entry into the card business by members and prospective members without regard to size and at minimum risk and cost 3 to promote the development of sound practices in the operation of the c ard programs 226 227 228 229 230 nedbank

must meet visa internationals eligibility cr iteria as set out in its bylaws232 section 201 of the bylaws requires essentially that participant be organized under the commercial banking laws or their equivalent of any countr or subdivision thereof and authorized to accept demand deposits233 however an organisation whose eligibility is required to prevent the corporation any of its members from being in violation of applicable law will also be eligible234 according to visa one of the main reasons for limiting membership to financia l institutions in fact we would add authorised deposittakers is that members have considerable financial ex posure to each other and benefit from the fact that every member is financial institu tion under the laws of its own country and subject to continuing scrutiny of the local banking regulator visa guarantees interbank payments between members visa takes initial responsibil ity to cover any losses which may be incurred by banks to ensure and guarantee th reliability and security of the system to merchants and cardholders235 the national and international regulatory framework applicable to bank s including applicable measures against moneylaundering mitigates risk within the fourparty sys tem thus banks are logical and relatively safe business partners for visa236 the licensing structure for participating institutions differs as between visa and mastercard visa issues separate licenses for issuing and acquiring but includes both credit and debit cards in the same licence mastercard has separate licences for credit ca rd and debit card participation but combines issuing and acquiring in respect of that card type into one licence in each case237 in south africa although all registered banks clearly qualify as eligible for membersh ip under the rules of both the visa and mastercard schemes smaller banks have been unab to enter or have faced considerable difficulty entering the acquiring market as sta ted above there have until

banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information big four banks two smaller banks capitec238 and mercantile239 have joined only recently thus it is primarily the big four banks that have been able to benefit from the gro wth in the acquiring market which mr jordaan of fnb describes as incredibly rapid240 and which along with the growth in issuing has been concomitant of south africas economic growth despite the indications of competitiveness in the acquiring market for the fourparty schemes the competition remains oligopolistic and it is thus open to doubt to what extent the unit cost savings which come with higher transaction volumes are bein g or will be passed down to merchants in the form of generally lower merchant service charges and ultimately to consumers in the form of lower retail prices241 to significant extent the barrier to entry by smaller firms is of struc tural character and will not readily be resolved by remedial measures mr munson of mastercard po inted this out the nature of the acquiring business is such that it is business that is based upon scale efficiency it is much more of scale business than an issuing busines s and therefore what you will find in every country with strong electronic payments is that the number of issuers in fourparty systems exceeds by several times the number of acquirers this is true in the united kingdom this is true in the united states this is true anywhere242 in the uk there are only four large acquirers in mexico for example there are only two and there are countries in europe with debit systems in particu lar where there is only one acquirer243 while giving due weight to this analysis244 we do consider that additional and unnecessary barriers exist which further add to the difficulties of entry by new players one of these barriers is caused by deficiencies in the current regulatory framework applicable to the payments system in south africa this aspect is addressed fully in the chapter of this report dealing with access to the payment system and so wi ll only be referred to briefly in the present chapter other barriers however are caused by what we consider to be unjustifiable restrictions in the rules applied by the visa and mastercard 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 capitec joined mastercard in the acquiring ranks in march 20 07 and visa in february 2007 mercantile became an acquirer for mastercard in november 2007 and according to the latest information provided to the enquiry is still awaiting acceptance of its application to visa transcript 19 april 2007 p 112 it was persuasively presented as one of the benefits of payment ca rds over cash that because most costs are fixed costs and relatively few are variable costs in the case of card systems greater transaction volumes must translate into lower average costs per transaction significantly lower aver age transaction costs should result in significantly lower merchant

are clearly distinct the current restriction of acquiring to banks at the hearing on 19 april 2007 when asked about the qualifications and requirements to become an acquirer for each of the fourparty schemes and card transacti on types mr jordaan said it was fnbs understanding that the acquirers must be regi stered as banks245 it had been thought until the questioning of mastercard on the previous day that this restriction derived from card scheme rules it had now been clarified that in terms of mastercard scheme rules the requirement was that an acquirer had to be financial institution subject to regulatory supervision246 in south africa regulatory supervision has not been developed as it has in other countries so as to enable nonbank inst itutions to enter this market hence acquiring is currently restricted to banks during the hearing on 18 april 2007 mastercard had confirmed that it does not restrict issuing or acquiring to banks the chairperson addressed the following questions to mr munson and received the following answers chairperson whilst we are talking about these acquiring models you in your presentation made reference to the fact that you do not prevent any banks from acquiring can you just expand on that you do not have any conditions for banks who qua lify to acquire mr munson well first of all take away the term banks we do not li mit our business to banks chairperson that was going to be my next question but carry on mr munson let step back and answer your question little more broadly if anybody any institution be it financial institution bank an insurance com pany any kind of institution if they want to participate as an issuer or as an acquire r in the mastercard system they have to qualify for membership for participation okay and generally speaking the requirements for participation are the following they must be engaged in the business the payments business and number tw they must be regulated and supervised institution by that we mean there must be some government regulator like banking regulator that is monitoring their business and enforcing sound fiscal practices now why is that well the answer is because mastercard gu arantees the settlement of its issuers and acquirers to each other so in other words if one of our participants one of our customers goes out of business and there is huge mount of money owed to other participants in the system we are on the hook for th at that is our responsibility so we want to make sure that whoever participates in our business is not causing excessive additional risk to our system and to us so the general requirement is that there would be regulation and supervision it is general requirement exc eptions can be made we have group within mastercard that actually will go out if there is request to join the system and measure the specific risk of particular trant and sometimes permission is granted to participate in the system even though you are not supervised though very often in that case the participant will be required to essentially post guarantee or get letter of 245 246 transcript 19 april 2007 p 158 id pp 171172 this is the case with the mastercard rules at least chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 284 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information guarantee from someone else so the focus here is to make sure that whoever participa tes in the system is not unduly increasing the risk or if they are increasing the risk that th at risk is covered somehow so that the system is not left holding the bag you know having lot of transactions that cannot be paid off because the party that brought the transactions into the syste m has gone out of business so we are not limited to banks we are looking at limiting typica lly to regulated and supervised financial institutions i give you an example of how that can change over time you may have heard that when the reserve bank of australia regulated inter change fees at the same time they made some changes in who could participate in the fourparty systems the truth of the matter is they did not change that from the standpoint aff ecting our rules what they did was based upon conversations that they had with us and i presume wi th others is they created new system of regulation and supervision so that entities which previ ously had not been regulated and supervised if they wish to get into the business would be regulated and supervised and that then would allow them to participate in our system because that would meet our requirements so that was the way that australia could at l east in theory improve their participation in the fourparty systems the final point is if you want to participate in the system you have to get licence the licence allows you to use the trademarks the licence allows you to submit transactions into the system and you are governed by the rules etc our licen ces are not specific to issuing or acquiring we grant you licence it is then up to the licensee to decide does it wish to engage in both the issuing and acquiring businesses does it only wish to engage in the issuing business or does it only wish to engage in the acquiring business and that third choice may be restricted depending on the location you are talking about in some places i think including south africa we have generall frowned upon someone who is only an acquirer and is not also issuing in other places that is permitted but t he licence itself does not prevent someone from going into the acquiring business or into the issuing business both are permitted and certainly if someone is issuing and has good issuing portfolio they are never prohibited from going into the acquiring busi ness with single exception the one exception is that if we perceived that bank part icipant in system which had not previously been involved in acquiring who is going into the acquiring business in risky way for example they are going to bring in merchants that were high risk merchants you might frown at that you might look very closel at that and in some circumstances we might not even permit it because once again it would i ncrease risk to the system the acquiring business is special bus iness it requires experience it requires the right kind of knowledge and expertise and so we do reserve the right t make sure that the acquirers are running their businesses properly chairperson i just want to sum up what you have said so that i am sure that i understand exactly what your submission is you must be regulated fi nancial institution that is what you have said mr munson you must be regulated and supervised chairperson financial institution those were the words you used mr munson financial institution generally is someone who is regulated and supervised but do you have to be financial institution but you have to be regulated and supervised chairperson well i am quoting you sir you can clarify it but that is what you said you said he must be regulated financial institution and in addition if they are in south africa you cannot only be an acquirer but you must also be an issuer chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 285 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mr munson that is my understanding chairperson so if i sum all of this up it means only banks can be involved with your business if i look at all these requirements you have set out whatev er way you want to put it it means only banks can be involved in your business mr munson let may i ask you question what do you mean by the word bank chairperson deposit taking institution in terms of the south af rican law mr munson and what i am telling you is that the term f inancial institution is not synonymous with the word bank we have financial institutions which are not banks which participate in our system i give you chairperson i am talking about south africa mr munson the rules are the same in that regard let give you an example chairperson i know you are going to tell about what is happening l over the world i am just interested in what is happening in south africa that is why in particular i also made reference to the other additional statement you made to say in addition if you are in south africa you will frown upon giving somebody licence if he is not an issuer as well so i am more interested in what is happening in south africa l et us talk about south africa because that is my jurisdiction i do not want to go outside my j urisdiction so it means if i sum up all of this it means only banks can be involved in your business mr munson wrong chairperson okay only financial institutions can be involved i n your business mr munson if you properly understand the term financial i nstitution chairperson you are still going to tell what you mean by financial institution mr munson financial institution is an institution engaged in t he business of payments that is regulated and supervised chairperson regulated and supervised mr munson yes chairperson okay mr munson can i give you an example chairperson i understand i fully understand i do not need an example247 in visas case only appropriate supervised credit institutions may be acquir ers248 it is accepted in the uk and the eu says visa249 that only appropriate supervised credit institutions should have direct access to

in the visa submission the implication is that acquiring is not essentially limited to banks yet the visa eligibility rules as submitted to us and quoted above do specify authority to take depos its as basic criterion nor does visa state as mastercard does that its rules applicable to south africa would currently permit nonbanks to acquire its card transac tions if the entities concerned were subject to local regulation we accept that caution is warranted in the open schemes over their eligibility criteri for acquiring by signing merchant says visa an acquirer is agreeing to under write that merchants bankcard transactions251 the risk here pertains essentially to chargebacks of disputed transactions the longest period during which an issuing member may charge back disputed transaction to the acquirer is four months252 an acquirer is responsible to visa for the proper performance of its merchants processors and agents and is liable to visa for any breaches of regulations and for any disputed transactions visa puts premium both on the creditworthiness of the acquirer and on its knowledge of and expertise in the card business253 visa is not in favour of allowing merchants to function as their own acquirers merchants benefit from the sophisticated and costly steps that visa ac quirers put in place to manage risk merchants do not have the accountability or the expertis to manage the risks of the system to the benefit of all stakeholders254 visa has different tiers of membership as noted above direct settlement risk res ts on principal members who guarantee those they sponsor in lesser categories of membership255 there are global visa standards applicable to the members responsibilities in such cases and penalties where the rules are not followed256 the potential risk introduced into the payment system by the spread of thir d party processors is of serious concern to the schemes257 this potential risk increases as outsourced network providers develop providing pos devices or other terminals and signing up merchant s for acquiring banks the danger is of pin data being captured enabling the counterfeiti ng of cards and causing the public to lose

the past two months at least 17 computers containing personal data on million or more individuals were lost or stolen according to the privacy rights cl earinghouse these episodes received little attention because they have become so common tha t they are longer news as visa points out penetration of the tjx259 computer network in the united states that handles credit card debit card cheque and merchandise return transactions for customers reportedly compromised more than 31 million accounts in that country and more th an million others worldwide260 however the customer records were those of the retailers whose systems would seem to be vulnerable to penetration and theft by hac kers quite independently of any direct access to the card payment system itself if an acquirer or issuer is not compliant with visas international operating re gulations then it may be fined or have its membership revoked the acquirer is obliged to m andate the standards set out in these regulations when contracting with merchants commercial arrangements between acquirers and merchants on the one hand and issuers and cardholders on the other are left to the acquirers and issuers subject to local law acquirers are obliged systematically and on daily basis to monitor report and investigate changes in merchant deposit patterns according to number of specific parameters 261 they must likewise monitor report and investigate significant and unusual changes in merchant authorisation request patterns they have to employ staff resources and implement security controls in order to fulfil these responsibilities and have their compliance certified by auditors262 before contracting with merchants they must determine that the merchant is financially responsible and that there is significant derogatory background information about any of its principals263 additional requirements are laid down where risky types of business are involved such as online gambling for example inte rnet transactions generally where the card is not present entail higher risk of disputed transactions 259 260 261 262 263 tjx companies inc is described as the leading offprice ret ailer of apparel

unrealistic to expect the schemes and it would be unwise to seek to compel them to relax their standards beyond requiring acquirers and issuers to be regulated and supervised financial institutions in the sense outlined by mastercard howeve r there is definitely need to extend the regulatory framework of the payments system in sa s that banks are not the sole institutions regulated and supervised for this purpose this matter is taken up again in the chapter on access and regulation so long as the fra mework restricts access to banks only there would be sound basis to proceed against either of the four party schemes under the competition act for restricting their acquiring in this country to banks regarding nonbank acquiring fnb indicated that it saw reason for them not to compete in the card payment area provided that they are properly regulated with view to risk management264 the acquirer does not have to hold the customers main bank account or indeed any account of the customer involving deposit265 visas general international requirement that acquirers be authorised to ta ke deposits is in our view too restrictive in the south african context and indeed is likely increasingly to be challenged around the world however if proper regulatory and supervisory framework for nonbank acqui rers were established here schemes could in terms of their own rules requiring compliance wi th local laws be brought into line where necessary to ensure this the regulatory and supervisory framework would have to oblige the relevant card schemes to accept as eligible without discrimination those banks and nonbanks meeting the domestic requirements 266 acquiring restricted to issuers where the fourparty schemes are clearly at fault in our opinion is in their rules or practice of restricting acquiring to institutions which issue their cards and indeed whic h issue them on significant scale testifying on 19 april 2007 mr jordaan of fnb at first suggested poss ible justification for 264 265 266 transcript 19 april 2007 p 169 the appropriate entry c riteria should really only relate to whether the institut ion is fit and proper and can manage the risks

ystem act 78 of 1998 as amended but tailored for the purpose is what we have in mind nonbank acquiring is dealt with fully in the chapter of this report on access to the payment system chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 289 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the prevailing position by saying that it would depend on the level of maturity of the market as to whether one could effectively have acquirers who are not issuers in pres enting this argument he set up the hypothetical case of scheme being unable to develop if it on ly has issuers it also needed acquiring but then why restrict acquiring especially when the acquiring market is considered difficult to enter the converse the development of the acquiring side of the market without corresponding development of issuing is manifestly unlikely mr jordaan acknowledged that it would merit investigation whether in south africa we could have issuers completely independent from acquirers fnb would not be opposed to competing against somebody who is not an issuer267 ms beer of fnb said that it was requirement of both schemes that one should hav an issuance programme qualifying one to obtain an acquiring licence fro m the schemes268 she added269 there are association rules that almost penalise the acquirers if t hey do not have an issuance programme that meets certain threshold the schemes have since reviewed some of those regulations and some of them are currently under review but there is rule in the scheme that provides for form of penalty if your issuance programme is inc onsistent with your acquiring volumes270 asked if this was true of both major fourparty schemes she said evidently referring to the requirement of an issuance programme it is true in the one instance it is not rule that has ever been enforced in the other instance the rule has been enforced but has since been temporarily suspended sinc we believe it is under review mr munson of mastercard assured us that every issuer in south africa that is admit ted into the mastercard system is permitted to acquire as well271 however this soothing statement should not be taken to imply that participant is allowed to acquire without issui ng we shall return to this aspect below visa stated in the introductory document of its second submission that sinc march 2007 it has not been necessary to be an issuer before being an acquirer in the visa scheme in south africa272 on close inspection of the full submission this statement turns 267 268 269 270 271 272 id p 160 id p 159

region rule restricting eligibility for acquiring licences to members holding share of 15 per cent or more of the number of cards issued in the market concerned or account for 15 per cent of the rsv274 generated in that market275 also required was business plan proving commitment to extending the acceptance base and plan inter alia for future growth in issuance276 such rule was not necessarily applied in other regions and visa europe has such rule visa also states that the cemea rule has not been applied to south africa stand ard bank have been acquiring for many years although they have until recently been mainly mastercard international issuer and did not meet the visa cemea issuance criteria277 at management committee meeting of the cemea on 21 march 2007 it was decided that visa cemea will not apply minimum issuance requirement before granting an acquiring licence however there will still be requirement that member must show an issuance portfolio and history of issuance278 apart from providing an indication that double standards have been in operation this means that misleading impression was conveyed in the introductory document 279 the visa and mastercard requirements have had perverse combined effe ct in raising the barriers against participation by smaller players including smaller banks this is illustrated by the experience of mercantile bank mbl in south africa at the time of making its submissions mbl had only visa issuing licence280 it had mastercard licence it wished to become an acquirer but realistically could not enter this business in south afric on viable scale unless it could acquire merchants transactions involving both mastercard and visa cards281 it was initially confronted by visas rule requiring 15 per cent minimum share of issuing in the market concerned in order for principal member to be licensed to acquire while visa showed willingness to relax this rule somewhat as noted above mb l was obliged to withdraw its application to visa for an acquiring licence bec ause it could not secure licence from mastercard at the same time282 mastercard refused to allow the 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 central

its issuing business284 mbl obviously did not wish to incur the costs of more than one licence to issue cards in any event its issuing volum under any one scheme would necessarily be reduced if divided between two of them mbl reported that mastercard would only support an application for licence if persuaded t hat mbl was committed to strong issuance program285 mr bloem of mbl confirmed that it was very difficult for relatively sma ll bank in south africa to make business decisions in the light of the power of visa and mastercard to grant or refuse access based not on technical considerations but on business volumes286 in our view this approach of the schemes and the rules on which it is based are clearly restrictive of competition on the acquiring side it challenges one of the claimed virtues of the fourparty system that it promotes competition in both issuing and acquiring in our view such restrictions on acquiring have legitimate basis acquiring should not be lim ited to issuers or be prohibitively priced if the schemes do not voluntarily both formally and in practice abandon th restrictions forthwith then the matter should be addressed either by the initiation of formal complaints and investigations by the competition commission or by regulatory intervention or by both 638 restrictions on cashback at the point of sale standard bank stated287 the proactive proliferation of pure cashback transactions at retail er stores benefits all participants banks retailers associations and customers within the broa der market in the following way it enables access to cash and general banking especially in deeper rural areas where mechanisms such as atms do not make economic sense retailers especially deeper rural merchants are incentivised to prov ide the capability through their pos devices thereby attracting customers into their stores recycling their cash holdings and inherently reducing security risks and bank costs and customers have frequent access to mechanisms that provide cash and over can start migrating their transaction behaviour from cash to suitable electronic mechanisms such as debit card purchases elaborating on cash back at the point of sale mr gericke of nedbank said we have enabled all our devices for cash back at the point of sale it is not necessarily that all merchants want to offer it it is service that we believe is very necessary but it is very much 283 284 285 286 287 id p 4 id p 6 id p 12 see also transcript 28 may 2007 pp 172174 transcript 28 may 2007 p 174 sbsa october 2006 first submission p 57 chapter 6

pretty low to date but we are currently in the market piloting with number of small m erchants and its distinctive strategy that we have to promote cash back at point of sale where nedbank provi des an acquiring service to merchant it offers cash back as value added service288 mr shuter added that nedbank had joint venture with pick n pay regarding c ash back at the point of sale more broadly enabling its merchant base in this regard was relativ ely new strategy there was resistance among some merchants because of the secu rity issues around cash the service while intellectually appealing is still in its infancy and involves more complexities than may appear to be the case289 mr gericke stated that nedbank has restriction to the effect that cash b ack at the point of sale may only be provided in conjunction with purchase290 however in nedbanks submission of march 2007 both mastercard and visa rules are cited which restrict cashback at pos in this way291 according to standard bank among the reasons why the adoption and proliferation of cashback at pos has been slow in south africa are the generally slow adoptio n rate of debit card transactions by customers and the current prohibition of the card associations international operating rules to enabling pure cashback only transactions although this view has changed since inception given the uniqueness of south africa in enabling access to cash and banking in deep rural areas in accordance with financial sector charter requirements292 now either there is prohibition or there isnt one in society in which peopl are entitled to know their rights and freedoms and to act upon them it is not enough that view changes on the part of those with power what is the true governing state of affairs mastercard internationals bylaw and rules published april 2005 provide cash disbursements may be provided only by members meaning in sout h africa participating banks at their facilities and through their authorized agent s for purposes of this rule an authorized agent is financial institution authorized to prov ide cash disbursement services on behalf of member pursuant to written agreement with member293 on the face of it this would prohibit entirely not only cashback at pos but also the provision of atm services other than by banks or other financial institutions on their behalf however 288 289 290 291 292 293 transcript 19 april 2007 p 36 id pp 3637 id p 39 the amount will be limited by the issuer to the amount au thorised for atm withdrawals but the merchant may set lower limit where customer makes purchase and asks for cash back the two transactions will be charged for separately the purchase attracts price transaction fee as i t would for normal point of sale purchase transaction and the cash

purchase295 visas regulations have been amended for the cemea region but evidently without altering this basic restriction296 the regional amendments seem if anything more restrictive for example an issuer or acquirer wishing to provide cashback service must obtain prior visa cem ea approval absa has told the enquiry both mastercard and visa implement operating rules relating to cashback at point of sale there are number of qualifications and requirements that need to be met these cover aspects such as security risk and business best practice of cash back point of sale transactions the details of these are specified in manuals from the di fferent card schemes in addition visa and mastercard require that the point of sale infrastructure is certified to ensure it meets the necessary standards for risk reasons issuer currently allows cashback at point of s ale in south africa on credit cards or embossed debit cheque cards ie cards which ar not pinbased297 our concern of course is not with rules reasonably designed to maintain the s ecurity and integrity of the payment streams absa further stated that visa default rules preve nt pure cash back transactions at point of sale the mastercard and maestro rules quote d above involve similar restriction however says absa this prohibition is overridden by pasa rules which permit pure cashbac k transactions at confidential point of sale and pure cashback transactions are offered in r espect of debit cards298 the restriction of cashback at pos to transactions also involving merchandise purchase has evident justification in the public interest prima facie it is unduly restrictive of competition and of the free use of an important innovation that could promote consumer and producer welfare there is confusion in the industry as to the applicability of the scheme rules standa rd bank refers to them as applicable but records its understanding that pick n pay and shoprite checkers offer pure cashback notwithstanding the card

allowed transaction types it would seem to be something of leap to say that by virtue of this inclusion restrictions imposed by card schemes on their participants are overridden as absa expresses it in our opinion the card schemes should be requested by the commission for mally and forthwith to withdraw their prohibitions on pure cashback at pos at least to th extent that such transactions are permitted under domestic law failing satisfactory responses in that regard we would recommend regulatory measures to correct the situation decis ively if such measures are not forthcoming then the commissioner should give consideration to initiating complaint and investigating the relevant scheme rules for possible contravention of the competition act as prohibited restrictive practices 64 the setting of payment card interchange 641 history and level of card interchange in sa according to absa300 bilateral agreement between barclays bank and standard bank initially set the interchange rate between them for credit card transactions at 1 99 per cent of the transaction value bank was able to provide details regarding date or the circumstances of the agreement this rate appears to have been univer sally adopted by the south african banks involved in offus credit card transactions before changes wer made by mutual agreement of the banks in 2003301 again according to absa302 bilateral agreement between absa and standard bank initially set debit card interchange between them at 075 per cent of the transaction value we have been given further details prior to the interchange rate changes in 2003 all south african banks involved in offus debit card transactions were evidently applying that rate303 we do not know the rationale behind the particular levels of interchange which originally applied ms louw of the enquirys technical team outlined the various approaches to the setting of interchange which have been utilised by the fourparty schemes and their participating 300

report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information institutions304 the setting of the interchange fees by members of scheme or c ountry is one method which the card schemes use and another is the setting of the inte rchange fee by the card scheme itself that will apply as default to the participating members in country if bilateral negotiations fail in both these cases there are two important elements involved the first one is the calculation of the costs and the second is the balancing of interests third party like edgar dunn can be used to assist in the collection and the calculation of the costs associated with the provision of the service these cost studies are then used by scheme owner s as an input and the setting of the interchange fee the cost calculations by ed gar dunn would in essence then only be proxy for the imbalance in the system that would then be used as an input in the calculation of an interchange fee that would be set in country although debit and credit cards differ the cost studies applied to these also differ but are both done by the same institution the setting of the interchange f ee as balance can either be performed on its own right without the consideration of these cos t studies 305 or in conjunction with the cost study that provides proxy for the imbalance pre sent in the system in neither case however do the elasticities of demand on the two sides of th market appear to be actively tested306 642 the edgar dunn process and the decision of the banks in 2003 in south africa in 2002 the member banks of mastercard and visa decided to use cost study methodology in reviewing and revising the uniform levels of interchange fees applying between them through their association of bank card issuers and merchant acquirers abci they engaged edgar dunn company 307 edc to assist them in determining the level of the interchange fees for credit cards pinbased ie online debit cards and signaturebased cheque cards or embossed

the 20022003 interchangesetting process moreover visa has stated that while it accepted the result as adop ted by its member banks the methodology used was not the one which it prefers visa did not participate in the cost study for number of reasons edgar dunn is firm used we believe by mci mastercard international members and mci to carry out cost studies they have we understand done this in

mastercards samea321 regional board had the power to set intracountry interchange fees when the members concerned could not agree or whe re local law prohibited them from doing so following the restructuring the master card president and ceo or his designee has authority to set domestic rates for any country as well as interregional and intraregional rates where this is done the relevant participating institutions are bound by the rate322 however as all participating banks agreed to the domestic interchange rates for south africa in 2003 following the edc study mastercard had need to invoke these powers based on the most recent information supplied the average credit card transa ction value involving the big four banks in south africa is in the region of r510 the average cheque card hybrid card transaction value is r380 and the average pinbased debit card transaction value is r225323 on an average credit card transaction of the value indicated the issuing bank would receive

kk slide 4 transcript 17 april 2007 pp 2526 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 298 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the banks decision to reduce the debit card interchange rate further the edc report had concluded from the cost study that debit card interchange rat could appropriately be reduced from 073 per cent to 0715 per cent the banks after considering this decided to reduce the rate even further to 055 per cent it has been explained to us that debit card interchange was deliberately set at lower rate than the one indicated by edc in order to encourage merchant acceptance of card which was being routinely issued to bank account holders but for which they had as yet fo und little use325 forecasts based on expected future volume growth of debit card usage over two year period were seen to warrant lower rate326 mr fergus of standard bank explained the purpose and likely effect of the decision as follows my belief would be that the lower interchange encouraged more merchants to accept debit cards earlier you normally have chicken and egg problem and i t is always moot point whether it is the merchant acceptance which drives the use of the car ds or the cards that drives the merchants to acceptance i think going into lower interchange and hence lower merchant service charge resulted in more merchants being prepared to accept the card which resulted in more cardholders being prepared to use it the biggest challenge in debit cards we are just going through the hump now is getting the first transaction away from the atm nedbanks evidence this m orning showed an average of four transactions per year per debit card in 2006327 it is actually the vast majority of the cardholders only using the cards for cash and an increasing use by smaller percentage to make more transactions at the point of sale the challenge is actually getting that switch in and i think the lower interchange encourages more merchant s to accept debit cards sooner and hence it has accelerated the use of the card328 in our opinion from the point of view of public interest key challenge of the perio d ahead is to enable and encourage the use of the debit card as convenient substitute for cash without the cardholder having to pay significant per transaction charge 643 the visa exemption in 2001 visa international service association

payment cards and interchange 299 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information established in south africa to be owned and controlled by visas local member bank s331 it was said that these members would agree on prices and set other trading ditions in manner prohibited by section 41 b of the competition act and that accordingly an exemption from the prohibition was required332 evidently on the basis that the intended practices would relate to the exercis of intellectual property the commission granted the exemption sought until 30 april 2013 we make comment either on the original validity of the exemption or on the wisdom of having granted it it is not clear moreover whether the exemption granted is affecte d by the recent global restructuring of visa involving new entities which were not in existe nce at the time333 assuming that the exemption could apply it seems to us irrelevant to this enquiry and its outcome for two reasons first we have come to the conclusion that multilateral agreement on inte rchange is in principle reasonably necessary to the viability of fourparty card payment schemes and so should not in and of itself be characterised as having the purpose of restricting competition in contravention of section 41b334 secondly and in any event we propose in this chapter that the problem of interchange and the danger of its abuse be addressed by way of new statutory arrangement which would ensure the setting of interchange by transparent and objective process involving the participation of all stakeholders the outcome would be binding on all issuers and acquirers to which the regulatory arrangement applies including those participating in the visa scheme 644 the mastercard advisory opinion

competition commissioner contains confidential information the south african competition commission has endorsed by way of an advi sory opinion in confidential 2005 mastercards plan to set default interchange rates unilaterally335 mastercard the background to mastercards request for an advisory opinion was its intention of confidential commissioning edc to conduct in south africa new interchange analysis simila r to thatmastercard which had been conducted in 20022003 this time however in place of multilateral agreement between the participating banks mastercard itself would set the default rate issuers and acquirers of mastercard transactions would be required to cooper ate in the process but could then reach bilateral agreements on different rates if they so chose336 mastercard argued in its request that the proposed method would comply with the confidential competition act inter alia because the participating banks would not be setting the mastercard interchange themselves and so there would be horizontal coordination of conduct337 in its initial response the commission noted that the act may nevertheless be contravened where an umbrella body sets price to be applied by members in horizontal relationship 338 nor would it make difference that the price set was only default price from wh ich the issuers and acquirers could depart bilaterally if they so chose339 following this mastercard met with representatives of the commissi on and then set out confidential further arguments on the issues in writing340 the independence of mastercard from its mastercard participating institutions in the proposed process for setting interchange was emphasised 341 default interchange it was pointed out should not be characterised as restrictive of competition per as is contemplated by section 41 b of the competition act it was not intended to eliminate competition but was necessary for the survival of fourparty scheme and moreover facilitated the entry of new issuers and acquirers 342 in letter dated 4 october 2005343 the competition commission stated that it now appeared confidential that the proposed multilateral interchange fee would not contravene any per prohibition in mastercard the act whether it might have anticompetitive effects in market had not been evaluated and accordingly opinion on that was expressed we note that advisory opinions are nonbinding on the competition commission we are at liberty to consider and express our own views on the same issues for reasons expounded 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343

used may be suc h as to set interchange for illegitimate anticompetitive purposes an aspect of the problem which was not raised in the advisory opinion but which debate during the enquiry s helped bring into relief we deal fully with that aspect below344 645 the current mastercard edgar dunn process following the advisory opinion mastercard has embarked upon the new interchangese tting confidential process which it envisaged and has engaged edc to carry out the requisite cost studies wit h mastercard the cooperation of participating banks fnb declined to take part in the proc ess partly on account of unhappiness with the methodology345 but in view of the banks own subsequent submissions to the enquiry regarding appropriate interchange methodology it seemed uncertain whether this standpoint would be maintained346 it appears likely that as in the past visa will await the outcome of the process and allow its participating banks to agree on multilateral interchange fees corresponding to t hose applied in the mastercard scheme we have been asked in various meetings with interested parties to give ou r blessing to the new process and thereby give comfort to the participants that they would not ther eby be regarded as contravening the competition act we have declined to do so our remit extends only to making recommendations to the commissioner in this chapter and in m aking our recommendations on interchange we draw attention to unsatisfactory features in t he current methodology and propose regulatory scheme which would eliminate those features while

between 2005 and 2006 the gross msc received for debit and cheque card transactions grew considerably faster in the same period by rat of 6325 per cent this may be as result of the increased volume in

approach of competition policy internationally towards joint ventures is to recognise the productive efficiencies and consumer welfare that can result when resources are combined by firms which could not achieve similar results independen tly but to recognise at the same time the dangers of anticompetitive harm which asso ciations of actual or potential competitors entail american antitrust scholars sullivan and grimes say359 the joint venture concept is of interest to antitrust because whenever two or more firms cooperate in business activity there may be competitive harm and bec ause whenever there is integration of these firms activities one of the hallmarks of venture efficiencies may result it must be stressed at the outset that arrangements called joint ventures do not avoid but are strictly subject to conventional antitrust analysis the joint ven ture label is antitrust shield all such activities whether or not meeting any scholars defini tional norm may involve or facilitate collusion may reduce discipline or inhibit actual or pot ential competition or may foreclose rivals from inputs or outputs any activity that has such tendencies should be scrutinized in the conventional way hovenkamp rejecting the argument that joint ventures should be subjected to higher scrutiny than single firms says that the economic arguments for closer scru tiny of joint venture activity are overwhelming360 among these arguments is the fact that the participants in joint ventures are private actors seeking private gains the gains from joint ventures come from two sources efficiency gains whi ch result from reduced costs or 359 360 the law of antitrust an integrated handbook 2nd edition p 687 federal antitrust policy the law of competition and its practice 3rd edition p 197 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 308 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information improved products and market power gains which result from the fa ct that the venture has sufficient power to cause market wide output reductions and price increases one important reason for looking more closely at joint activity is that agreeme nts creating significant market power can be formed very quickly all it takes is firms who coll ectively dominate market and agree to do something jointly361 payment systems as we have seen are an example of network indu stry the establishment of common standards for interoperability contributes to efficiency and is one of the recognised benefits of joint ventures in network industries362 such ventures may also facilitate innovation enable the entry of additional new players pr omote scale economies and reduce transaction and management costs363 at the same time the interaction of competitors in joint venture provides the opportunity for them to widen the venture in ways that may intensify their interaction homogenize their conceptions about market conditions and provide new channels and incentives for explicit collusion oligopolistic interdependence or soft liveandlet live pseudorivalry364 writing in the novemberdecember 1995 review of the federal reserve bank of st louis carlton and frankel said joint ventures particularly those involving networks that contain many i ndustry participants present some of the most interesting and difficult antitrust issues modern payment and electronic funds transfer networks are technologies that have greatly benefit ed consumers and the economy by reducing transaction costs and allowing consumers to economize on their holdings of noninterest bearing forms of money payment networks however may also be able to engage in collective actions that allow their members to exer cise market power if members of payment network exercise market power the effects can be equivalent to privately imposed sales tax on all network transactions in our view for reasons given above the progressive proconsumer cos treducing and outputenhancing potential of the network effects of fourparty payment card schemes should be acknowledged it does not follow however that we would accept that the manner in which these schemes are operating simply fulfils that potential and avoids anticompet itive harm among the critical issues is whether the setting of interchange within these schemes as well as the methodology used and the levels of interchange applied can meet the tests of legitimacy which competition law and policy prescribe 662 origins of interchange in card payment schemes the origins of interchange are expounded in the 1984

from the risk of default366 describing the typical credit card transaction when it was still paperbased367 the court said once potential consumer has opened bank credit card account with partic ular issuing bank he or she may use that bank credit card in lieu of cash to purchase goods and services from any merchant participating in that particular bank credit card system the merchant after sale then transmits the consumercardholders draft evidencing this transaction referred to in the parlance of the industry as paper to its merchant bank this sum being immediately credited to the merchants account minus small charge agreed upon ear lier by contract called the merchant discount if the merchant bank happens to be the same ba nk which issued the card the consumercardholders account in the bank will be processed inhouse in what has been described as an onus transaction when the issuer bank diff ers from the merchant bank the process becomes more complicated first the merchant bank sends the transactional paper to the issuer bank the issuer bank then will either send the merchant bank the requisite sums due and owing from its cardholder or will dire ctly credit the merchant banks account at the issuer bank if the merchant bank has such an acc ount in either case the issuer bank is ultimately responsible for the sums due and owing from its cardholders and thus absent breach of agreed procedure by the merchant or merchant ba nk the issuing bank bears the risk of default by the cardholder the process by which transactional paper is moved from the merchant bank to the issuer bank involves certain costs in the system at issue here the issuer bank withhol ds small amount called the interchange fee from the monies due and owing the mer chant bank to cover the costs of this processing even more simply stated the merchant bank if not the issuer of the card used in sale must process the paper generated by th sale to realize both the small profit hopefully provided in the merchants discount charge to the retailer and reimbursement for the sale amount credited to the account of th retail merchant the paper then goes to the issuer bank which reimburses the merchant bank but only aft er the deduction of the interchange fee368 the plaintiff nabanco was not deposittaking institution eligible for visa memb ership it performed processing activities similar to those

contains confidential information in pursuit of its claim of pricefixing nabanco argued that interchange was essentially price fixed for the discounting factoring of transactional paper within the schem on that basis the acquirer would be seen as giving discount to the issuer when onselling to th latter the claim for payment against the cardholder based upon the paper which it had purchased from the merchant the court did not adopt that analysis in our view correctly the term merchant discount although widely used is itself liable to confuse370 the merchant when accepting credit card and signed slip from the cardholder in lieu of paym ent does not itself extend credit to that customer371 it acts rather from the outset entirely in reliance indirectly on the payment guarantee from the issuer to the acquirer and directly f rom the acquirer to itself the merchant provided by the rules of the scheme and underwritten by the latter372 interest is charged solely by the issuer the merchant may not add interest to the retail price and then discount the interestbearing paper to its acquirer inde ed scheme rules prevent any surcharge to the cardholder rule which we discuss below at stage in the integrated combination of transactions within the scheme does the acquir er appear to obtain claim for payment which it could choose to assert directly against the cardholder but which it elects to onsell to the cardissuer instead the artificiality of the discounting analysis is thus apparent there is sequence of truly independent discounting transactions which the scheme merely coordinates 663 interchange is not price for service just as the nature of interchange is not well an alysed by treating it as an issuers discount on its purchase of payment claim from the acquirer so too interchange is not pr operly to be regarded as the issuers price to the acquirer for service supplied to the latter373 the european commission noted in its 2002 decision concerning visa374 visa does not consider its mif multilateral interchange fee as price for specified services provided by issuers to acquirers or merchants rather it considers the f as transfer between undertakings that are cooperating in order to provide joint service in network characterised by externalities and joint demand the mif is accord ing to visa necessary as financial adjustment to the imbalance between the costs ass ociated with issuing and acquiring and the revenues received from cardholders and merchants 370 371 372 373 374 even if it were accurate to see the process as one of discounti ng which it is not the expression merchant discount would be misleading the more appropriate expression would be ac quirers discount in our view the correct expression is rather merchant service charge as explained above this is the charge paid by the merchant for the acquirers service supplied under the auspices of the card scheme fortiori this must apply in the case of debit card transactions see eg mastercard

performed if the basic payment service is to be offered the services within the scheme flow in both directions each participa nt depends upon the cooperation of the others as dr koboldt put it presenting for mastercard at the hearing on 18 april 2007 the notion of payment for services provided to acquirers by is suers is meaningless and misses the point that the demand for the services of payment scheme is determined by both customers as cardholders and merchants and that the role of interchange i s balancing that demand376 664 the nature of the joint vent ure in open fourparty schemes the true nature of interchange follows from the nature of the joint venture whic h fourparty card scheme entails we accept the submissions to the effect that fourpa rty payment scheme is essentially cooperation enabling joint venture377 by virtue of the scheme issuers and acquirers together with the scheme owner jointly provide interdependent services to cardholders on the one hand and to merchants on the other nevertheless the idea that there is joint supply and joint demand should not be exaggerated intrinsic to the operation of the fourparty schemes is that there is within and in conjunction with the cooperation enabling arrangement competition of independent suppliers and in each interconnected set of transactions once embarked upon ther are distinct supplies the district court in nabanco explained378 profits and losses are not specifically shared among th various visa members nor is there any commingling of management functions furthermore to the extent possible each member engages as an independent unit in economic competition with other visa members with respect to various aspects of their common venture the fact that visa members have integrated to the extent of agreei ng on the terms of interchange but have not fully integrated and still compete for card holders and merchants is typical of procompetitive joint ventures and serves to maximize visas

way to view the relationship between the issuer and the acquirer is as cooperating members of joint venture since they both need to coordinate the input from th other to provide credit card payment services to their customers on this basis the issuer and the acquirer are j ointly providing service to their customers namely enabling payment from the cardholder to the merchant and as in the threeparty example there is both joint production and joint demand p 4 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 312 379 596 fsupp 1231 1254 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner

and that v isa merchants want unplanned and rapid access to each cardholder who enters their shop regardles s of whether the merchants bank signed the cardholder then some beforethefact agreements must be made the principal purpose of these agreements with member banks does not appear to be to improperly fix prices as nabanco asserts but rather to provide service which each member bank could not alone provide namely universal payments servi ce which ensures that visa card will be honored by any merchant regardless of which bank issued it so long as that merchant displays the visa logo on its door although interchange is sometimes referred to as mechanism needed in order to address market failure that might give rise to misunderstanding the market cannot by the independent action of the different players bring about the cooperation fo r which four party card scheme exists interchange is necessary to such joint ve nture only indirectly therefore can it be said to be connected with market failure 665 rules to enable cooperation mr munson of mastercard sought to explain the necessity of interchange by considering what new fourparty scheme without any preexisting interchange would have to determine in order to bring together separate issuers and acquirers in off us transactions between cardholders and merchants the first question wouldbe issuer or acquirer would ask so he argued is what amount it would have to pay when settling t ransaction in respect of say r500 purchase the scheme would have to determine the amou nt payable by the issuer to the acquirer the settlement amount this could be equal to less than or more than the base amount of the transaction what is this differential between the settlement amount and the mount of the transaction which by the very nature of the business we easily see must be set well frankly you can consider it just to be another definition of interchange interchange is difference between the base amount of the transaction and how much the issuer pays the acqui rer if the issuer pays the acquirer the base amount r500 that is the equivalent of zero interc hange fee if the issuers pays the acquirer r495 that is the equivalent of receiving 1 per cent interchange fee and if he pays r450 that is the equivalent of 10 per cent interchange fee if he pays r505 that is the equivalent of negative 1 per cent interchange fee and if he pays r550 that is the equivalent of negative 10 per cent interchange fee so even without intending to set interchange fees given that th issuer and the acquirer have to know what is their financial responsibility to the other side of the business or what is the benefit there are going to receive from the other side of the business we have to set this differential and frankly by definition this differential is nothing more or less than the interchange fee there is escaping this it must be set and if you say to issuers and acquirers nobody is going to set your interchange fee they would not participate in your business after having understood it and decided that you are going to set this settlement diff erential you have to ask yourself what am i going to set it at am i going to set it at r495 r450 r505 r550 where do i set it chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 313 380 transcript 18 april 2007 pp 1620 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in order to set that fee first of all you are going to have to know some thing about the nature of the business you are going to have to know things like are you going to have payment guarantee for merchants how soon are merchants going to get paid is it going to be immediate settlement with the merchants or is it going to be delayed settlement what are the benefits to the cardholder what benefits is the cardholde r going to get will the cardholder get an interestfree period these things have to be tablished and have to be understood because they in fact are going to impact the initial allocation of costs as between the issuer and the acquirer how much money it is going to cost th acquirer to participate in the system is going to depend on some things like who s the risk for credit losses and fraud losses is there an interestfree period and myriad of other things so the first thing you have to take into account is the initi allocation of the cost of the system on both the issuing and acquiring side moreover you have to also ask yourself having set that fee at r495 or r450 or r505 or r550 is that proposition for the issuer viable proposition will the issuer be able to offe r these products and services at prices that cardholders will be willing to pay and will the acquirer be able to offer its services to merchants at prices that the merchant will be willing to pay perhaps if you set the settlement differential at r550 as opposed to r500 perhaps it will be too expensive and cardholders would not want to use those cards and perhaps if you set it at r450 on the other side merchants will not want to use the card s so in setting this fee you are going to have to take into account the demand conditions that the issuer faces on its side of the business and that the acquirer faces on its side of the business so even though it was not your initial intention to balance demand you are i n fact going to have to look at exactly the same kind of facts and circumstances t the end of the day you are going to engage in the very same decisionmaking process as i f you started up intending to balance demand so where does that leave us i would propose that even if you do not want to call this thing int erchange you still need to make determination as to what is the obligation of the issuer to the acquirer and in effect you will have to set something that makes it very much li ke an interchange fee and i would suggest further that even though it is not your intention to balance demand if you are going to set this differential at level that gives you viable business and of course for your shareholders you will want to grow this business as large as possible you do not need to believe that an interchange fee is necessary because in fact it is absolutely incontrovertible if there needs to be some decision taken as to the relative obligations and benefits of the issuer and acquirer and whatever you call it it is comparable to interchange and even if you do not believe that we are about balancing mand when you see what we do you will realize that we have to engage in the very s ame process that some of you claim to be balancing demand would have to engage in380 the trouble with presenting the argument in this way is that it obscures key analytical component which ought to be kept distinct and so begs question fourparty scheme in order to function would indeed have to impose rules upon its issuing and acquiring participants regarding their respective rights and obligations in many respects notable examples being the incidence of liability where fraud occurs and the time for settlement with obligations and risks come costs therefore rules determining the inc idence of particular obligations and risks within the scheme also determine the inc idence of costs it does not necessarily follow from this however that the scheme needs to be able to determine settlement amount that is greater or less than the cardho lders payment obligation to the merchant the basic transaction amount chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 314 383 absa march 2007 second submission access and interoperability pp 1314 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the assertion of the need to do so turns out to rest upon the unspoken ass umption of an imbalance in the incidence of costs which the issuing and acquiring participant s cannot be expected to recover simply by their own direct charges to cardholder and merchant respectively this is the key element that has to be demonstrated in any analys is if there were need to achieve balance by redistribution of revenue or reallocation of costs between acquirer and issuer there would be need in fact either for interchange or for variable settlement amount381 the case for interchange in fourparty schemes in order to be analytically rigorous has to be based directly on the inherent need for balancing payment between acquire rs and issuers in circumstances where without this payment one or the other would in th ordinary course prove unable to meet its costs from its own direct revenues and make normal profit 666 revenue allocation in twosided market the case for the necessity of interchange rests essentially on analysing t he fourparty card payment model as an instance of twosided market382 number of participants in the enquiry submitted helpful explanations of twosided market theory absa for example stated383 twosided markets are those markets in which businesses need to attract two distinct groups of customers in order for either set of customers to be willing to participate in the market there are number of different examples of such markets of which two are shopping malls retailers and shoppers yellow pages or newspapers readers and advertisers what is important to recognise about each of these markets is that t he demand by one side of the market will be affected by the number of customers on the other si of the market that is the markets are characterised by indirect network effects net work effects arise where the value of being part of the network varies depending on the size of t he network typically they arise where the value of being part of the network increases as the size of the network increases the indirect label indicates that value of being part of the network increases as the size of the other side of the market increases for example shoppers prefer shopping mall with more retail outlets and retailers prefer 381 382 mr munsons identification of settlement amount with inte rchange is nevertheless instructive so that if interc hange is to be subject to regulation see below it will be necessary to ensure that scheme cannot render regulatory determination nugatory by altering the settlement amount or inde ed by any substantial reallocation in the incidence of costs between the issuing and acquiring sides of the scheme wit hout the approved interchange being adjusted correspondingly furthermore his analysis implicitly acknowledg that all the costs in the system are relevant to rational determination of interchange we shall return to this aspect when discussing appropriate interchange methodology below twosided or more generally multisided markets are roughly defined as markets in which one or several platforms enable interactions between endusers and try to get the two or multiple sides on board by appropriately charging each side that is platforms court each side while attempting to make or at least not lose money overall rochet and tirole 2004 defining twosided markets p 1 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 315 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information shopping mall with more customers both readers and advertisers prefer newspaper with higher circulatio n readers because then they can discuss the editorials with colleagues dir ect network effects and advertisers because then their advertisements are seen by more readers if prices on one side of the market are set only with reference to the customers on that side and not with reference to the customers on the other side f the market the overall market will be inefficiently small because the benefits from the first side that accrue to the second side are not taken into account prices need to be set according to the overall market rather than to the tw individual sides in isolation the consequence of this is that prices are not necessarily symm etric and that the prices on one side of the market are not necessarily related to the costs incurred on that side of the market again series of examples from other markets makes this clear shopping mall owners might charge retailers for the cost of park ing facilities through their rent rather than charging customers for parking so as to encourage lots of customers to come to the mall yellow pages or free newspapers are offered to readers at zero price while those who advertise in them have to pay those who advertise are willing to pay to do so because they gain access to the readers and there are more readers when the price that readers face is zero in each of these cases it is clear that the prices faced on one si of the market will not simply be determined by the cost incurred on that side of the market but rather the price will be determined taking into account the effects on both sides of the market in many of these cases there is one provider who serves both sides of t he market for example the newspaper owner can assess the relative values to readers and adv ertisers and decide upon the price to charge each side including whether there should be subsidy or transfer from one market to another payment cards as twosided market in the case of payment cards the two sides of the market are repr esented by cardholders and merchants the more merchants which accept particular type of payment card the more valuable it is to cardholders and the more cardholders that use particular type of payment card the more merchants will want to accept it the availability of debit and credit cards benefits consumers and merc hants alike if credit cards involve an interestfree period credit cards provide car dholders with more flexibility to structure their repayments and thus enable them to make larger purchases f rom accepting merchants than would otherwise have been the case merchants also gain substantial benefits from the payment guarantee in respect of cardholders who take advantage of extended credit they can sell goods to consumers who may not have funds in t heir current accounts hence would be unable to pay with their debit cards but wit hout taking on the risk that these consumers would be unable to pay this risk is taken by the credit card issuing bank merchants rank the payment guarantee as one of the most beneficial aspects of accepting credit cards as in any twosided market there is problem of alloc ating the costs of card system across the two sides of the market cardholders and merchants to get the b alance right in order to maximise the combined value to both sides this is problem faced by the threeparty or proprietary schemes such as american express and diners international but these schemes are free to decide how to set prices on either side of the market in fourparty card system the interchange fee is the tool that allows costs to be shifted from one side to the other in order to get the right balance to maximise the combined va lue of the system to both sides chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 316 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information interchange fees of this type result in lower cardholder fees andor gr eater cardholder benefits on the issuing side lowering cardholder fees andor increasing cardholder benefits will increase the number of cardholders and the use of payment ca rds the benefits to merchants from these effects can outweigh the effects of higher merchant service charges although this explanation refers to the shifting of costs from one side to the other what is in fact shifted by means of interchange is revenue384 the costs stay where they arise or are allocated by specific rules of the scheme having regard to the revenues which participants on each side are able to raise by pricing to their own customers the transfer of revenue from one side to the other by way of uniform interchange produces in effect an adjustment of average net costs or rather of average net profit between them385 crucially interchange has the purpose of affecting prices charged to end users on the acquiring and the issuing sides of the twosided market and thus to bring into balanc the two separate supplies and the two separate demands in this way optimal outpu t of the joint product of the scheme is sought to be attained386 there is strict complementarity of demand in card scheme ie two demand s always have to be matched387 it follows that the lower of the two demands always determines the maximum output of the scheme thus if for example customers in aggregate wish to us schemes cards for purchases amounting to r200m in value while merchants are willi ng to accept that payment method for only r100m worth the actual usage of the cards is restricted to the latter quantum if on the other hand merchants aggregate deman d is higher than that of cardholders it is again the lower demand which will govern usa ge and scheme output because of the disparity in the demand of the end users interchange in order to be effective will have to operate so as to place more of the burden on the less astic side of the market388 it appears that the bulk of the costs of card scheme fall on the issuing 384 385 386 387 388 interchange transfers revenues so that both issuing and acquiring are competitive businesses with incentive to attract more cardholders and merchants visa june 2007

contribution to the covering of total costs than the cardhol der interchange serves indirectly but nonetheless effectively to regulate the distribution of the tot price burden of the scheme between the two this is one of the reasons why the schemes introduced their surcharge rules in order to prevent merchants in the scheme from reallocating their allotted part of the price burden over to the card user dr koboldt drawing on seminal 1983 analysis by baxter390 provided the diagram which is reproduced below it illustrates at an abstract theoretical level how the max imum number of transactions in card scheme is achieved by adjusting the prices charged to merchants and cardholders respectively according to their respective demand elasticiti within overall parameters determined by the point at which aggregate scheme costs intersect aggregate demand interchange in fourparty scheme by transferring revenue fr om the suppliers on the one side to the suppliers on the other is intended to place each in position to price its supply to the end user at level which achieves the optimum balance and thus maximises total scheme output391 389 390 391 price structure in the system is determined by the transfer paym ent required between the suppliers in order to sustain the provision and demand for the service the price structure thu s refers to the division or distribution of the total cost s and total revenues in the market see roson 2005 twosided markets tentative survey review of network economics vol4 issue 2 in the nabanco case the district court after trial of more

distribution in south africa or an ywhere else and we do not accept that all the costs which are conventionally treated as issuing costs are truly integr or necessary to the functioning of card scheme as payment system see further below nevertheless the point seems controversial at general level wherever interchange operates in the card payment environment it flo ws from acquirers to issuers wf baxter bank exchange of transactional paper 1983 journal of law and economics 26 from the point of view of the fourparty system there is n optimal level of charges which follows from an optimum level of interchange fee which is business volume maximising von weizsäcker op cit p 2 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 318 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information figure 5 baxters model for maximising scheme output in the next part of this chapter we examine some limitations of the anal ysis presented in this model for the moment suffice it to say that it does demonstrate the interconnect ed nature of the supplies and demands that come together in card payment schemes and that the pricing on the two sides needs in principle to be capable of being adjusted so that both the supplies and the demands are effectively matched we accept that this matching cannot reliably be achieved by market forces operating independently on the two sides so as to render interchange unnece ssary the argument for leaving it to market forces alone would be t hat if acquirers were simply left to recover their costs from merchants and issuers their costs from cardholders any resulting imb alance as between demand for card usage on the one hand and card acceptance on the other hand could be overcome by merchants either giving discount or charging premium to customers using cards however as dr koboldt observed this requires that the merchant can differentiate those prices wit hout great problems now in practice we observe that merchants do not differentiate prices they do not surcharge widely even where they are allowed to they do not offer cash discounts even though they are allowed to and that is to do with the fact that given the di fference in the cost and benefits of accepting different forms of payment it is simply not wor th their while to do that in other words it would require considerable difference in the advantage or disadvantage to merchants in accepting payment by card in order to trigger the mo oted balancing chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 319 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mechanism via the market the dependence on such considerable difference mean s that the needed balancing would not effectively be attained at all this point is reinforced we would add392 when assuming the absence of interchange and therefore the full cost burden of card issuing being passed directly to the cardholde r it is taken into account that cost differentials as between cards and cash ma be relatively small for the merchant and relatively large for the cardholder393 thus the merchant might well be indifferent to the customers choice of payment medium and so be unwilling to differentiate in price while the cardholder might need to be offered substantially lowe r price by the merchant in order to be willing to bear the added cost of using the card instead of cash therefore the market mechanism operating purely on the outer ends of the twosided market would not in principle suffice to achieve the balance necessary for the vi ability of the scheme absa testified our economists tell us that it would be pure coincidence if the b est allocation of cost for the system as whole was one in which acquirers covered their cost s only through merchants service charges and issuers covered the full amount of their costs through cardholders fees394 dr koboldt put the matter this way it would be pure coincidence it would be fluke if the initial allocation of issuer costs and acquirer costs would exactly correspond to the optimal structure of p rices and if it does not you have problem395 in threeparty scheme as we have seen the scheme owner being both issuer and acquirer can simply adjust the pricing on the two sides itself in the case of an op or fourparty scheme however the existence of mechanism for revenue transfer ie interchange is in principle necessary in order to achieve the pricing adjustments396 in nabanco in the usa the court concluded that agreement on visas interchange fee referred to as the issuers

if they had to be fully recovered directly from cardholders this w ould make cards much more expensive for cardholders to use see transcript 18 april 2007 pp 9092 transcript 17 april 2007 pp 6970

interchange is essential as balancing mechanism to ensure interoperability in the fourparty payment card market generally399 standard bank was of the same view400 according to the latter not only would the elimination of interchange dramatically reduce cardholder demand and card usage in general and threaten the existence of the more desirable open schemes401 the cost would become prohibitive

satisfactory alternative chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 321 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information standard bank defended interchange as the most effective method of dealing with the complex relationships involved in fourparty card systems407 this is in all probability correct it also seems clear that in principle at least the need for an interchange mechan ism in the fourparty payment card environment is not ended when the market becomes matu re when in other words just about everybody has cards and just about every merchant accepts cards the widespread issuing of cards does not guarantee that cardholders will continue to use them likewise the widespread acceptance of cards would not automatically be sustained the market remains twosided there remains need for reve nue to be reallocated or at least the possibility for it to be reallocated so as to overcome disproportions in the incidence of costs relative to the demand elasticit ies and pricing on the two sides only in this way could the necessary matching of the two supplies nd the two demands be reliably continued408 667 default multilateral and bilateral setting of interchange we accept that at least in the absence of regulated compulsory rates it would not be possible to sustain fourparty payment scheme on viable scale without being able to provide default rates of interchange for the settlement of transactions between ac quirers and issuers within the system that would apply where there is agreement409 mastercard confidential explained that default terms are needed in order for fourparty scheme to operat and mastercard default interchange fee is an important element of these t erms410 this is the only way in which new participants could join without having to negotiat separate agreements with every other participant of which there are today tens of thous ands and existing participants continue without renegotiations with all the others f rom time to time it hardly needs stating that this would be utterly impractical and absurd where interchange is set by agreement the agreements are usually multilate ral applying uniform rate to domestic card transactions of the same type with default rates applying in international including intra or interregional card transactions often bila teral agreements between participants are permitted in place of the multilateral or default rates 407 408 409 410 although scheme rules allocate certain costs to the issuing or acquiri ng sides respectively most costs of issuing and acquiring are intrinsic to the issuing and acquiring activities thus the ability of fourparty scheme to allocate th incidence of costs is itself inadequate as balancing mechani sm moreover if costs may legitimately be allocated by the schemes it would seem arbitrary to deny similar legitimacy to an allocation of revenues sbsa october 2006 first submission p 55 see transcript 18 april 2007 pp 204210

uniform interchange rate between the banks is anticompet itive banks that are more efficient should be able to offer lower rates to rchants and customers412 plausible as it may seem this approach to the setting of interchange levels between banks does not adequately comprehend the competitive dynamics that are involved indeed in our view it rests ultimately not upon the public interest but upon the self interest of large merchants who would expect to gain an extra trading advantage over the small by having more scope to assert their countervailing power when negotiating merchant service charges with the big banks we consider that the power of the banks in rela tion to interchange needs to be addressed in different way in order truly to protect the consumer in march 2006 feasibility reported to the competition commission that in g eneral both the large banks and the smaller banks already in the system argued that interchange fees should be set on multilateral basis413 this has been amply confirmed during the enquiry absa argued cogently that multilateral process for setting interchange fees has number of definite advantages over bilateral agreements 414 reduction in transaction costs arrangements need to be in place between all acquirers and issuers the number of arrangements that need to be agreed together with associated costs would increase exponentially as the number of issuers and acquirer s increases for example the experience in relation to the recent negotiation of the aedo naedo agreements demonstrated the inefficiencies associated with bilateral greements as these negotiations necessitated the individual negotiation of in excess of 72 indi vidual agreements reduction in barriers to entry because of these transaction costs system of bilateral arrangements would be likely to be barrier to entry to new small pl ayers indeed the feasibility report notes that the burden of such negotiations would be par ticularly great on small players as they typically only have one payment syst em official rather than fully staffed department multilaterally determined interchange fee r emoves the need for these additional transactions costs to be incurred reduction in difficulties for small players with lower bargaining power setting interchange fees on multilateral basis means that all players face the same cond itions irrespective of their market strength or bargaining power setting interchange fees on the b asis of bilateral agreements will inevitably mean that those firms that have bargaining power will negotiate better deals than firms that do not have bargaining power reduction in time to market for new entrants where interchange fees are set on bilateral basis and small firms do not have bargaining power the negotiation proces s of agreeing the interchange fees may prevent new entry this would not be deliberate decision but an inevitable consequence of the time and resource constraints imposed by the need to make hundreds of

with other smaller firms that have less impact on absas business promotes efficiency depending on the methodology used to calculate the multilateral interbank fee for example costs only captured from the most efficient banks415 it may promote less efficient banks to become more efficient standard bank argued on similar lines that where interchange is bilaterally negotiated this allows greater scope for the undue negotiating power of the large volum players on the other hand multilateral approach is small volume and new bank friendly model in that an av erage industry price is set which incentivises players with economies of scale without excessivel penalising small volume banks thereby maintaining interoperability and promoting compet ition416 in the case of card interchange bilaterally determined inter change level runs the risk of discouraging new entrants andor small players for at least two reasons firstl there is the likelihood that the differences in volumes will result in sm all banks having to pay higher interchange than the larger banks and discourage new issuers from enterin g the market417 secondly the complexity and large number of negotiations required would pose significant barrier to entry into the card market in single interchange model small players effectively enjoy the benefits of the negotiating power of the larger players and new entr ants can enter the market without having to engage in wide range of costly and time consuming bilateral negotiations418 standard bank also submitted that multilateral implementation of interchange is the only workable approach419 bilateral arrangements are very complicated and ineffective way of reaching agreements says absas mr volker420 in nedbanks view bilateral feesetting process in which every

confidential information mastercard agreed bilateral interchange fee setting has onerous time and cost considerations it is from practical perspective virtually impossible for each bank in south afri ca to enter into bilateral negotiations and reach agreement with every other bank in the country in order to set the applicable interchange fee423 the flexibility of the fourparty model and its ability to develop across national boundaries depends precisely on participating issuers and acquirers not having to negotiate and agree terms directly with each other and if only bilateral agreements on interchange were to be permissible then what would justify the myriad other terms and conditions essentia l to the viability of these schemes being set on uniform basis standard bank observed given technological advances and scale efficiencies that have accrued s ince 2002 we would expect that revised calculation would recommend further downwards revision of card interchange banks however face the dilemma that the coordinated eff ort required to conduct revised study may be viewed as contravention of the competiti on act and so the industry has been reluctant to do the study on joint basis even though it may lead t reduction in card interchange424 however that view was evidently based on an interpretation of section 41 b of the competition act that was not endorsed by the supreme court of appeal in american natural soda ash corporation and another v competition commission and others 2005 6 sa 158 decided in may 2005 in light of that judgm ent if the multilateral setting of interchange within fourparty scheme is reasonably necessary for the viability of the joint venture the n in our view it should be regarded as legitimate we have concluded that interchange is indeed necessary and legitimate at least in principle likewise necessary and legitimate in principle would be multilateral process desi gned to arrive rationally at the levels of interchange reasonably necessary for effective functioni ng of the scheme425 but is our conclusion regarding the necessity of interchange in principle sustai nable in view of the fact that payment card systems evidently operate successfully i n some countries without interchange and the fact that banks have been making profits on c ard issuing in south africa even without taking into account interchange receipts 668 the absence of interchange in some countries the eu interim report on payment cards stated that pos interchange fee arrangements between banks in open payment card systems are not an intrinsic feature of these 423 424 425 mastercard october 2006 first submission p 8 see also pp 101102 sbsa october 2006 first submission p 60 we deal in due course with the question of appropriate methodology for such

not to have any interchange fees for debit card pos transactions the netherlands denmark finlan d and luxembourg the european commission in its december 2007 decision concerning mastercar d427 also mentions norway in this regard arguing that today the highest card usage per capita exists precisely in those eea member states where card schemes operated without f for decades norway finland and denmark428 the contention therefore is that interchange is not in fact necessary for the successful operation of open or fourparty payment card schemes if this were true as general statement429 then it would refute the conclusion reached in the nabanco decision in the united states and would warrant full formal investigation by the south african competition commission into whether existing default or other multilateral interchange arrangements between issuing and acquiring banks contravene section 41 b or alternatively section 41a of the competition act on closer examination however it appears that the absence of interchange fees in the european domestic debit card schemes referred to can be explained by unique acquiring arrangements set up historically in each country whereby revenues raised on the acquiring side are nevertheless able to be applied to support card issuing while it is beyo nd the scope and resources of the present enquiry to delve fully into the facts concerning the operation of card schemes in those countries the information made available to us or gleaned from public sources does indicate that the general case for the necessity of interchange and thus its legitimacy in principle in open card schemes is robust enough to survive the examples given430 in finland the pankkikortti debit card scheme provides card that is uniquely cobranded with an international credit card logo such as visa or mastercard431 this allows cardholders to choose whether to use the pankkikortti debit card function or th branded credit card 426 427 428 429 430 431 eu

information function when making purchase issuing banks are required by law to operate as acquirers for the pankkikortti debit card scheme so far as the credit card aspect is concerned there is only one acquirer in finland namely louttokunta which pays commission to the issuing bank for every cobranded card issued thus the issuing banks receive share of acquiring revenue and at the same time the issuing of pankkikortti cards is subsidised thus the pankkikortti example does not provide persuasive support for the argument that truly open fourparty schemes can develop commercially without interchange or an effective equivalent 432 in denmark the dankort debit card system was developed by the banks in joint venture433 the majority of dankort cards are cobranded with visa enabling them to be used outside denmark434 historically dankort has been based on single acquiring institution namely payments business services pbs which was set up by the danish banks via pbs subsequently converted into pbs holding as the banks own dankort in addition to being the sole acquirer for the dankort system pbs is the main acquirer fo r the international card brands the fact that the issuing banks own pbs and dankort would enable acquiring revenue to flow by way of profits to the issuing side435 however according to mastercard dankort operates at loss because regulation has unduly lim ited the amount of the merchants annual subscription there being transactionba sed merchants service charge436 in the view of mastercard the dankort scheme is not sustainable commercially and survives as national debit card scheme by virtue of regulatory pressure on the banks while we are not in position to comment on th is evaluation it does seem clear that it would be unsound to rely on the danish case as disproving the need for an interchange mechanism in commercially viable open ie fourparty schemes norway is world leader in the use of payment cards in 2006 more than 200 transactions

to increase coordination441 in 1990 the banking associations established single domestic debit card scheme der the name bankaxept according to norges bank bankaxept is the norwegian debit card

linked to an international card system visa part and bankaxept part of card may be regarded as two functions therefor the number of functions will be higher than the physical number of debit cards443

online to the issuer there is explicit interchange the system being based on direct pricing to c over costs on the issuing and acquiring sides446 card users in norway have evidently been prepared to

confidential information expansion of the range of services to include cash withdrawal have pave d the way for economies of scale and network economies in the card payment system norges bank regards this coordination as the deciding factor behind the high use of cards in norway447 nevertheless in order to encourage the use of services in twosided market banks may choose to charge one side of the market less than its share of actual costs would imp ly this may be used strategically and the pricing may be varied over time in order to achieve growth in the side of the market that is most important for the further growth of the net work the appropriate price structure in the years ahead will therefore depend on the price sens itivity of the various services offered by banks and what is regarded as most important for fu rther growth in the use of cards448 it thus appears that the norwegian success was not brought about simply or even essentially by market forces but that market realities may nevertheless in future lead to revenue transfers within the system in order to cater for cost and demand im balances on the two sides of the market the norwegian example instructive though it is would therefore not seem to refute the case in principle for the existence of an interchange chanism in truly open fourparty scheme in the netherlands the debit card system named pin together with electronic purses named chipknip and credit cards are the electronic payment instruments mos t generally used consumers are as general rule not charged for pos transactions and direct charging is limited to annual contributions for the possession of debit card merchants however charge small fee surcharge for small debit card transactions the only national payments facility interpay owned by the eight major banks that are both shareholders and customers offers virtually all payment processing services interpays primary function is processing customer transfer orders and computing the resulting interbank positions clearing it also switches authorizes and process all debit card transactions449 the ceo of interpay has explained that while interchange fees for interpay s debit card transactions were set at zero the shareholder banks were paid yearly dividends from interpay based on the number of debit card transactions undertaken by them annually to reimburse them for their authorization costs ie as if interchange fees were paid to them as issuers interpay in turn charged merchants for the acquiring services taking into account the costs incurred by issuers450 447 448

enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information thus once again the example of the netherlands would not seem to support the vi ew that interchange would be unnecessary for the commercial development and functioning of an open fourparty scheme in luxembourg the local debit card scheme bancomat has single acquirer cetrel which is wholly owned and controlled by the banks in that country451 according to mastercard cetrel performs all of the acquiring processing issuing processing and switching services on behalf of the banks under such an integrated structure the role played by in terchange fees in an open fourparty payment system is performed by th revenues distributed by cetrel to its shareholders which are the issuing banks consequently the revenues distributed to shareholders constitute facto interchange fees and are in fact similar to the dividends distributed under the interpay scheme of the netherlands therefore her too although ostensibly operating without interchange fees the same financial res ult is achieved albeit on far less transparent basis and at the expense of banks which are not owners of cetrel452 furthermore as mastercard explains the costs borne by banks are allocated w ithin the bancomat scheme in such way that twothirds are borne by acquiring banks and onethird by issuing banks453 this allocation evidently redistributes costs from the issuing to the acquiring side in place of the reallocation of revenues from the acquiring to the issu ing side which would be achieved by interchange 669 the profitability of issuing without interchange earlier in this chapter figures were presented showing that at least in the case of major banks providing data and at least in recent years issuing would have remained profitable even without interchange revenue454 on the face of it this might seem to refute the conclusion that interchange is necessary for the viability of fourparty card schemes there are at least two reasons why such view would not be sound fi rst the data is insufficient to enable any clear conclusion to be drawn regarding the longerterm probabilities for rates of return on investment in this regard in which the position of smaller issuers would also have to be considered therefore it cannot be concluded that in the absence of interchange arrangements the banks concerned or other banks would have engaged in issuing or acquiring under the fourparty schemes either to the ex tent that they have done so or at all or that they would continue to do so in future 451 452 453

payment cards and interchange 330 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information secondly and more fundamentally the profit figures for issuing would not in themselves weaken the general case explained above for balancing mechanism within n open or fourparty system they might go to show that prices on the issuing side have in fact been sustained by the banks at an excessive level despite the claims that competition between issuers coupled with demand elasticity holds these prices down the figures might also show that the level of interchange has been excessive given the revenues which issuers have been able to extract independently of interchange and the underlying merchan t service charge nevertheless in our opinion the cogenc of twosided market theory is such that it justifies permanent mechanism for the determination of interchange notwithsta nding that the particular determination at particular time could result in zero or theoret ically even negative interchange rate 6610 conclusion on the necessity of interchange based on everything put before us and in the absence of any other evidence we are willing to accept the necessity of interchange in principle in fourparty schemes while interchange has been shown to be necessary and mechanism for interchange accordingly gitimate it does not follow that every methodology for determining interchange and every level of interchange consequently arrived at and implemented would be justified also it is important to ensure that the theoretical case for the necessity of interchange does not rve as smokescreen for an impermissible exercise of market power whether by the scheme s or by their participating institutions fnb in arguing the need for interchange stated455 economic theory teaches that where externalities or spillover effects oc cur these should be compensated for by subsidy or tax in order to internalise the externality for example inoculation against contagious disease benefits not just the individual but so society which is spillover benefit if some individuals cannot afford the inoc ulation then they should be subsidised to take account of the spillover benefit s imilarly in the case of card payment networks the main spillover benefit is that merchants benefit from i ncreased numbers of cardholders and accordingly would be prepared to pay portion of the issuing costs in order to internalise these benefits that is exactly what the interchange fee accomplishes thereby improving net welfare within payment systems subsidies and taxes are not the legitimate domain of the market they belong in the domain of public power the argument so formulated does not show the necessity of interchange and thus its legitimacy what it advances is the alleged legitimacy of fourparty schemes these mighty combinations of financial institutions issuing acquiring and profit ing for themselves as best they can using their power to the full to determine the tax which should be imposed on merchants for receiving the benefits of the scheme and the subsidy which should consequently flow to issuers to support their issuing businesses456 it is an 455 456 frb march 2007 second submission position paper intercha nge p 4 this would be the privately imposed sales tax against which carlt on and frankel supra warned chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 331 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information argument for pricing the acquiring services to merchants up to the maximum whic h the degree of market power exercisable by these schemes and their participating institutions can sustain we cannot endorse such an approach457 while accepting the necessity of interchange in principle we nevertheless c onsider the setting of interchange to be open to the danger of abuse which may harm competition and the consumer it is rightly focus of p ublic concern and of scrutiny by public authorities 67 the potential for abuse of interchange and the need for regulation in this chapter we do not analyse card pricing to consumers cards are in many instances bundled with other banking products if there is market power in relation to the pricing of the bundles then that power extends to the included cards indeed the network effects generated by payment card systems may serve to enhance the degree of banks market power in respect of the bundles in which the cards are included 671 the nonneutrality of interchange neutrality would imply that changes in interchange fees have real effect on social welfare in particular if interchange fees were neutral then it would not be p ossible for card associations to increase their profits on an uncompetitive basis by collecti vely increasing interchange fees there would then be reason either for competition authorities to be concerned or for any other regulatory intervention to occur von weizsäcker in paper submitted by mastercard argues that the level of interchange applied in fourparty scheme cannot influence the level of the total service c harge the acquirers merchant service charge plus the issuers cardholder service charge because of the competition between the members of the scheme on the acquiring and issuin g sides458 accordingly interchange would be neutral in its ultimate effect on prices however this is contrary to the view of other experts on the subject and is contradicted by the evidenc of dr koboldt who testified for mastercard at the hearing on 18 april 2007 as well as by common sense rochet and tirole say459

interchange 332 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the acquirer to the cardholders bank the issuer is irrelevant i f the following conditions are jointly satisfied first issuers and acquirers pass th rough the corresponding charge or benefit to the cardholder and the merchant second the merchant can charge two different prices for goods or services depending on whether the consumer pays by cas h or by card in other words the payment system does not impose nosurchargerule as condition for the merchant to be affiliated with the system third the rchant and the consumer incur transaction cost associated with system of double prices for each item in south african conditions none of these conditions is satisfied460 first of all the competition between acquirers is oligopolistic and so is the competition between issuers461 accordingly we can have confidence that benefits are or would be fully pas sed through to all consumers of the card payment services on each side462 second the schemes do operate surcharge rule to prevent merchants from charging cardholde rs more than the ordinary advertised price or more than the price charged to customers using other payment methods463 third even in the absence of such rule the added costs to merchant s of having to differentiate in price would deter them from doing so with the result that there would in any event be scope for interchange and hence merchant service charges t be raised above the level warranted in notionally competitive market464 to support the case for the necessity of interchange dr koboldt argued that m erchants do not adjust prices for customers using different means of payment even when they are f ree to do so international experience has confirmed this merchants typically do not pas s through differences in costs and benefits of accepting different forms of payment in the form of different retail prices465 the coherence of merchant prices as between different means of payment rests primarily on the added cost of administering price differentiation466 in our view it must also involve to significant extent the fear of the merchant of alienating and losing customers by such differentiation with possible consequences going far beyond t he loss or gain of the immediate sale467 the same arguments in this regard that support the necessity 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 rochet and tirole 2004 defining twosided markets p 10 see also the earlier study by gans and king 2003 the neutrality of interchange fees in payment

cards within multiproduct banking university of granada feg working papers series 107 2007 to the extent that some consumers notably the betteroff ar more assiduously courted by the banks in their competition for customers the likelihood is that the benefits flowi ng to the issuing side as result of interchange to the extent that such benefits are passed on would be disproportionately pass ed on to those consumers thus leaving the effect on aggregate consumer prices resulting from interchange to be borne disproportionately by the poor we consider separately below whether such rule is legitimat and we conclude that it is gans and king have argued that the mere removal of restric tions such as the surcharge rule would be sufficient condition to avoid any regulatory concerns about the setting of interchange fees for there to be such concerns regulators must also believe that there are restrictions bi nding cash and credit prices together there is social ga in to having specific price regulation of the interchange fee if constraints that bind cash and credit prices are eliminated op cit p 12 this argument seems naïve it fails to appreciate that the coherence of cash debit card and credit card prices would be sustained by factors independent of card scheme restriction s exhibit mm1 slide 7 id slide 8 in australia where the rule against surcharging was abolis hed in 2003 only 12 of very large merchants and only chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 333 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information of interchange go to show the potential for its abuse 672 do market forces limit card interchange so it cannot be abused in figure 5 above the baxter model showed that maximum card s cheme output would occur at point where the aggregate costs of the scheme coincide with the aggregate demand of cardholders and merchants for scheme card transactions and t hat this outcome can only be achieved by adjusting prices to cardholders on the one side and prices to merchants on the other so that their respective demands are indeed matched at this optimum point however the graphic illustration is static and it merely assumes the slope and positio n of the various demand curves dr koboldt acknowledged that there is not single static point of balance at which scheme output is maximised through interchange in order to allocate net costs within the scheme in correspondence with the demand elasticiti on the two sides network effects are dynamic effects and the result is that the demand curves on th two sides would change468 thus for example as more cards are issued and cardholders seek to use them at merchants the merchant demand curve would change in respo nse it must follow in our view that there is scope for manipulating interchange albeit within limits so as to bring about sustained increase in the price burden which merchants are willing to bear and thus maximise revenue to scheme participants who are both issuers and acquir ers as well as to the scheme itself it has been shown above that interchange effectively sets floor for price competiti on in the acquiring market at the same time thanks to price coherence thanks to the non neutrality of interchange in other words competition from other means of paym ent such as cash would not adequately prevent the abuse of interchange by fourpar ty schemes and their participants the question therefore turns to whether divergent interests of issuers and acquirers within the schemes or b competition between the scheme s themselves would have this preventive effect because interchange provides stream of revenue to issuers issuers have an obvious interest in maximising interchange there is of course constraint on this namely that interchange by affecting the service charge payable by merchants to their acquirers must not so curb merchants willingness to accept payment by card that the overall negative impact on issuers revenue would be greater than the per transaction gain469 468 469 around 2 of small merchants applied surcharging for card over ca sh transactions according to report of the rba in 2006 see payment system board annual

transcript 17 april p 138 there can well be the case where you hit the spot whe re the interchange fee is too high because you give up what you lose on the merchants side id p 140 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 334 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information merchants willingness to accept payment by card can be increased the elasticity of their demand can be lowered by network effects these network effects follow upon an increase in the relative number of cardholders an increase in the number and v alue of transactions in which cardholders wish to pay by card and an increase in the number of c ustomers that might otherwise shop elsewhere or forego the purchase should their wish to pay by card fail to be facilitated the pressure upon merchants generally to accept cards can thus be increased by the manipulation of factors which incentivise the takeup and use of payment cards by cardholders factors which incentivise the customers of issuers in other words the card schemes including the threeparty and the fourparty schemes have an obvious interest in maximising the issuing and use of cards as well as conco mitant card acceptance470 in the case of the fourparty schemes this interest is natural ly shared by issuers and may extend to acquirers as well where an acquirer is not also an issuer the acquirers interest would simply be in maximising transaction volumes and v alues while keeping to minimum the burden in costs falling on the acquiring side and having to be passed through ultimately to merchants by way of the merchant service charge the four party schemes have taken care to avoid conflict of interests between acquirers nd issuers within their schemes by ensuring that only substantial issuers are permitted to ac quire in south africa the main issuers are also the main acquirers the big four banks471 in the development of the card schemes it seems to have been recognised that generally and strategically relatively more would be gained by an emphasis on incentivising cardholding and usage by cardholders than on incentivising merchant acceptanc e472 the potential leverage throughout the network is greater where the incentives are applied on the cardholder side given merchandise price that is ordinarily the same for card and cash transactions the advantage of the card to the cardholder is essentially that of convenience and security until other benefits for the cardholder are added the conven ience and security may itself be provided free of charge or apparently so by making the transaction costless to the cardholder other benefits such as loyalty points or rew ards for spending may readily be added the linking of these to the seemingly painless extension and takeup of credit through the issuing and use of credit cards and significant interestfree period adds greatly to the attraction by incentivising the takeup and use of cards by cardholders the card schemes and their issuing and acquiring participants are able to enhance the network effect which renders merchant demand less elastic and increases the priceburden 470 471 472 card scheme owners revenue is to large extent related to transa ction volumes through the scheme transcript 18 april 2007 pp 146147 even where there is divergence of interests between acquiring and issuing international experience suggests that established levels of interchange would not be lowered as r esult datamonitor says in theory issuers and acquirers in europe can agree bilateral interchange fees this seldom happens though because there is little incentive for an issuer to set fee lower than the mif multilateral interchange f ee or for an acquirer to agree fee higher than this level visa june 2007 second submission document t p 49 there are occasional exceptions to this as in the case of the south afr ican banks decision over debit card interchange in 2003 see above when the main barrier to card usage was identified as reluctance of smaller merchants to accept cards chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 335 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information which merchants are willing to bear these are further reasons why we cannot accept that interchange simply settles and must settle at level reflecting spontane ous competitive forces in the issuing and acquiring markets respectively473 in their competition to attract issuing institutions and expand their cardhold er base the four party schemes have their own interest in seeing interchange at the highest sustainable levels there is reason to think that competition between schemes will tend to push interchange levels down474 if anything the incentive would be to compete them upwards or at least hold them at established levels even as transaction volumes and values rise and unit costs fall this conclusion is supported by the view of frankel and sha mpine in the economic effects of interchange fees 73 antitrust law journal 32006 627673 dealing with the effects of intersystem competition on the level of interchange t hey observe at 651 652 competition between card brands is ineffective at constraining i nterchange fees because network with lower fees gets fewer sales if one network were to set its in terchange exactly at theoretically efficient level while its rival offered sli ghtly higher interchange fee issuers would prefer the network with the higher fee unless the fee was so much higher that merchants refused that brand consumers would have incentive at t he point of sale to avoid the more expensive brand if price coherence prevailed and the is suer would have an incentive to market more heavily or enhance rebates for consumers using th more expensive brand ultimately there is little to prevent each network from increasi ng the interchange fee to the same level that monopoly association would choose if consumers are loyal to particular cards475 it is significant that mr munson of mast ercard bringing all of that schemes international experience to bear was unable to maintain consistent argument to the co ntrary having at first emphasised that issuers themselves would not want interchange to be too high because they know that by so doing they would shrink the size of the system476 he went on to admit that there is short term pressure in the competition between sche mes for issuers business for them to give issuers higher interchange477 indeed he added i can tell you in personal experience that when issuers tell us what they think interchange 473 474 475 476 477 cf eg von weizsäcker op cit p 20 it is sometimes argued that blending of interchange fees might w eaken internetwork competition which may also lead to higher acquiring fees however this argument fails to appreci ate that interscheme competition over interchange paradoxically tends to raise rather than reduce the interc hange fee as dr koboldt correctly pointed out transcript 18 april 2007 pp 149150 one would not know how much above the theoretically efficient level the interchange level could be set be fore it reached the level at which even notional monopoly association would lose more than it gained nevertheless that caveat only serves to confirm the general statement frankel and shampine note that network may have to increase its fee only in modest increments so it does not get too far out in front of other brands and risk losing merc hants p 652 in this way competition between networks would tend gradually to raise interchange to the poi nt at which further increases became unprofitable we do not accept the assertion of dr koboldt that there are equally inc entives downwards transcript 18 april 2007 p 152 however he is surely right in observing that competing threepar ty systems would have the very same incentive to set merchants charges too high and reduce cardholder charges transcr ipt 18 april 2007 p 171 we would not expect three party schemes to price significantly lower to the mer chants and if they do not they price higher despite not having an interchange fee id p 172 this seems to us all the more reason to be concerned about the potential pricing effects of interchange setting within fourparty schemes transcript 18 april 2007 p 22 id p 25 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 336 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information should be in those circumstances in which we set interchange fees they rarely say please reduce my interchange and they frequently say i need more interchange to have more competitive products to lower prices to card holders to help you grow your business so yes there is shortterm pressure and an intense pressure to raise inte rchange fees478 he then sought to counterbalance this by emphasising again the issuers need to be able to offer their cardholders card which enjoys merchant acceptance this is so especially when new cards are issued thus mastercard and the argument would apply likewise to other schemes has an interest in not giving in to the pressure from issuers to raise interchange too high479 nevertheless mr munson acknowledged that mastercard had gained an advantage in australia where regulatory intervention by the reserve bank initially produced result which permitted slightly higher rate of interchange for the mastercard sche than for visa480 quite frankly we were thrilled with this it was about t wo basis point 002 per cent differential but i can tell you that two basis point interc hange differential over sustained amount of time is competitive advantage it helps you win business and so in the first couple of years of this process mastercard had slight but s ignificant competitive advantage based on the way that the reserve bank had set up this system despite all this says mastercard the fact is that interchange levels have nded to come down internationally481 this may be true of absolute levels we do not have adequate data to confirm it 482 but the real question is whether interchange has come down relative to reductions in issuing costs 483 without positive answer to this question the fact that some 478 479 480 481 482 483 id id pp 2527 id p 32 see also id p 147 this important admission radically undermines mr mu nsons earlier protestation id p 28 to the effect that if mastercard were to set higher interc hange level than visas it would simply lose merchants and so also cardholders to visa this was asserted for example by dr koboldt transcript 18 april 2007 p 151 mr fergus of standard bank went so far as to state in the last 20 years that i have been involved in interchange it has only gone in one direction downwards transcript 19 april 2007 p 77 we have some evidence to the contrary visa internationals main default interchange rates 16 electronic and 2 paper have not changed for number of years from being set in t he early 1990s visa second submission june 2007 document k as mr fergus put it if you have greater volume going through th scheme you would expect that the scheme would become more efficient and over time the costs would reduce transcript 19 april 2007 p 78 greatly oversimplified hypothetical example should suffice to illustrate in an element ary way the consequent effect that should be expected on the absolute level of interchange if in an average transaction total costs of 100 are incurred in the proportions 2080 on the acquiring and issuing sides respectively before interchang an interchange fee designed say to balance those costs evenly would amount to 30 leaving each side with net cost s of 50 to recover from its own customer if say through automation and increases in transaction volumes total costs of an average transaction were halved to 50 and the proportion between acquiring and issuing costs remained the sa then interchange having the same simple purpose would fall to 15 leaving each side with net costs of 25 if we assume instead that given different demand elasticities the level of interchange is designed to load t he cost burden disproportionately onto say the acquiring si and if that disproportion were to remain unchanged while avera ge transaction costs came down interchange would still come down correspondingly the mere fact that interchange has come down would tell us nothing about the presence or absence of disproportion in the net cost allocation itself or the extent of it it would not assure us that there is distortion in the market produced by the manipulation of intercha nge furthermore if interchange were to fall at lower rate than the rate of fall in average transaction costs interch ange in relative terms would be rising not falling thus the mere fact that interchange rates may have come down would in way refute the analytical argument which suggests tendency for interchange to rise to its sustainable maximum chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 337 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information interchange levels may have come down would not refute the argument that interscheme competition will tend to hold interchange to the maximum levels which monopoly association could theoretically sustain 673 the nature of the potential abuse dr koboldt argued that increasing interchange can either reduce or increase total demand for the services of payment system for example as the interchange fee increases total system output increases if previously cardholder demand was less than merchant demand and therefore there was merchant demand that eventually went unsatisfied so in that case the transaction volumes increase if you increase interchange fee you get to th point where you have got it right that is where the demand is balanced if you increase int erchange fees further total system output would fall 484 at general theoretical level this is unexceptionable but it says nothing about the potential to manipulate upward the point at which the balance of cardholder demand with merchant demand is achieved at the expense of the latter more telling is dr koboldts further explanation that it is wrong to look at interc hange fees in the same way as you would look at price increasing the price normally unless we have really perverse mand conditions reduces demand increasing interchange fees may increase demand depending on what the original starting point is if you have situation where there is i nsufficient cardholder demand increasing interchange fees will lead to an increase in total system output485 it must follow that provided the limits of merchants endurance are not exce eded it would pay schemes to maximise interchange and utilise the extra revenues to expand cardholder demand because of the scope for manipulation of interchange and for raising the floor for merchant service charges in this way we have to be very wary of the idea th at optimal ie maximum card scheme output is the same as the output which would be opti mal for society or indeed that which notionally competitive market would allow capitec submitted interchange should ideally be at level which is sufficient t cover the processing cost it should not be the main driver behind the acceptance of new product as it should be as price neutral as possible not be the main area of income and not be treat ed as profit centre in its own right486 mr stassen confirmed this position during the hearings in his opinion interchange on credit card transactions in south africa is relatively high and is being treated as profit centre ie as main area of income by other providers487 in our view if interchange functions in this 484 485 486 487 transcript 18 april 2007 p 57 id p 58 capitec bank october 2006 first submission p 11 see transcript 4 april 2007 pp 4245 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 338 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information way it will constitute an abuse of the power that is facilitated by the fourparty joint venture that should not be allowed the schemes and several banks participating in the enquiry naturally placed emphasis on the positive benefits for all participants in payment card network cle arly if the benefits to merchant of accepting payments by card were to be eclipsed by the cost incu rred in doing so then the merchants acceptance of cards would cease but to price the benefit to the merchant up to that point is to price at level which even monopolist could not breach within limits set by the inequalities of property in market system the po int of competition is to enable resources to be allocated through price mechanism which matches production and distribution to wants the value proposition utility of payment cards to the merchant provides justification for pricing the acceptance of cards above an optimally competitive level488 even if it is so that merchant service charges in south africa are comparable to those p aid in other countries489 this would not dispose of the question whether either here or in other countries interchange arrangements are nevertheless serving or may in futu re serve to keep these charges above their potential competitive minima it was suggested by mr jordaan of fnb that the public as consumers would have more interest in interrogating the level of interchange than in interrogating the level of say the rental costs incurred by pick n pay490 if consumers did not like the prices they were being charged for example for soap powder they could always switch to buying it from checkers competition in the retail market thus adequately protected consumers and it was unnecessary for them to concern themselves with the costs incurred by the supplier in making the supply however this is not an apt comparison as was observed at the time adv petersen of the panel i have problem with the comparison between the consumers interest or lack of interest in the rental paid by pic k n pay or the costs that have gone into producing packet of soap powder and the issue of interchange in this network let accept for arguments sake that interchange is necessary and that all that we are concerned about is how it is arrived at and perhaps by whom now the theory behind it is the balancing of demand in twosided market where independent market f orces on those two sides will not produce proper harmony the first point of distinction with pick n pays rental or the soap powder is that this is going on within massive very important network an unusual joint venture which is not fully integrated joint venture but one which allows competitors independe ntly providing part of the combined product to be linked up where all of us and it is at an immature stage so it is going to be more the case in future are affected by this network sev eral times day the interchange that has been set is entering as uniform cost into acquirers c osts and would logically find its way down into merchants costs and ultimate ly into consumer prices so something that is agreed by many enterprises or set in common for many enterprises is 488 489 490 cf in this regard the argument advanced by fnb frb march 2007 second submission position paper interchange pp 89 transcript 18 april 2007 p 9 mr munson see transcript 19 april 2007 p 133 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 339 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information finding its way into the price paid by the consumer at the same time you have the theoretical possibility which we have explored over the past days that it could be manipulated one of the parties presentin g was unhappy with my use of the word manipulate so let say it could be delicately adjusted so as to make it painless for example for credit card holder to take up and use credit card painless initially not painless later when the interest has to be paid on the credit debt but painless to take it up and use it so much so that you can boost demand on the issuer side the cardholder side and then exploit the network effects making it more and more diff icult for merchants to refuse in other words increase the inelasticity or captivity of merchants on the acquiring side and thereby jack up the aggregate revenue to the optimal point for the scheme491 effective answer to these points has been provided indeed there was signif icant support for the view that interchange can be manipulated by or within scheme in order to maximise the aggregate revenue of its participants and that this should not be left to happe n in this regard the following was said during the hearing of absa492 mr volker i think that the principle sounds right i think th at is why we in our presentations did say that we would support an independent methodology in structure to determine that i think if the system is left to its own devices it could open itself to abuse and misuse493 mr stillman if i may just add to that i mean i think i t is well recognised in the economic literature that the use of the interchange fee can have very strong procompetitive beneficial effects it is also noted in the literature and i think it was picked up by the european commission in its review that in some circumstances interc hange fees could be used also as means of shifting revenues from one side to the other to enhance the profitability of the banks so there are different possible effects of interchange fees and i c an appreciate your desire to try to figure out how to sort through them and see what t he drivers are i do not want to anticipate questions but i think if one does think about that issue of shifting costs from one side to the other it is very important to take on boar d differences in levels of competition in acquiring and issuing in which direction those differences in levels competition might point to in terms of the implications of interchange fees and i indistinct that it is probably the opposite of the implication that the technical team s uggested in its earlier presentation494 ie under circumstances in south africa if anything i would thin k that the competition considerations the differences in degrees of competition might argue in favour of lower interchange fees mr norton what has been called into question is the level of interchange and i think the absa proposal is one which says we are very happy for the level of interchange to be interrogated thoroughly and for an independent third party to do thorough and detailed analysis of the levels of interchange and if post that analysis t he nett result is that interchange levels should come down as was the case in 2003 when interchange leve ls were reduced post the edgar dunn study then absa is more than happy to accept that positio n and i think we are very much in favour of an objective independent assessment t address your concern which is as i understand it that interchange is effectively mechanism for concerted practice by banks to ramp up revenue we are very happy for an independent t hird party to have very cold hard look at that issue and make sure that that concern i s not one which 491 492 493 494 id p 136139 transcript 17 april 2007 pp 133136 see also id pp 173174 mr volker i think if we can agree on an obje ctive set of criteria that address the fundamental requirement for balancing the two sides of the market and have mechanism as well to ensure the effective and objective and transparent implementation of that methodology we should hopefully minimise misuse or manipulation to large extent it is not clear precisely what mr stillman was referring to he re chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 340 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information comes into question the concerns that were expressed in australia were the lack of regular review of interchange levels and the lack of full methodology and i think absol utely from an absa perspective we are in favour of both of those in relation to interchange standard bank also acknowledged that the setting of interchange could potentially be abused although with some qualification mr bodibe i am asking you to what extent can the scheme abuse the inelastic demand from the side of the of the merchant mr fergus i think that is why you actually do need an independent expert who is controlling the process and you need some regulation from within the country to ensure that this does not happen if you had issuing and acquiring balance between the bank s the risk would be there if you have got big differentials in issuing vo lumes and acquiring volumes there is logical economical argument that i can think of why that would happen and i really do not think nedcor are going to agree blindly to give standard bank significant sums of money because they think it is good for standard bank which is what they would be doing in agreeing to high interchange495 an important element in the potential for abuse of interchange lies in the fact that in south africa large issuers also dominate the acquiring market496 the effect of disproportions between banks issuing and acquiring businesses is an aspect which deserves exploring to understand the dynamics involved it is best to begin with notional firm whose issuing business is small relative to its acquiring business497 the larger firms acquiring business relative to its issuing business the greater will be the proportion of its own cardholders transactions that are likely to be onus onus transactions are comparable to transactions in threeparty scheme interchange is payable to any other firm498 since in these transactions the firm qua acquirer receives the interchange component contained in the merchant service charge and retains it qua issuer it will have interest in lower interchange so far as these transactions are concerned however its relatively large acquiring base will also mean that it is engaging as acquirer in relatively large proportion of transactions involving other issuers cardholders and in doing so will be obliged to pay away interchange to those issuers its relatively small issuing base means that its interchange receipts from offus transactions by its own cardholders will be relatively few an d so it will probably be net payer of interchange499 this could well give it on balance an interest in keeping interchange down the alternative of enlarging its relative cardholder base by 495 496 497 498 499 transcript 19 april 2007 pp 7879 cf the 2000 report by the reserve bank of australia rba and the aus tralian competition and consumer commission accc debit and credit card schemes in australia study of interchange fees and

example of such firm transcript 1 9 april 2007 pp 67 hence the mention of it by mr fergus in the passage quoted above transcript 17 april 2007 p 34 pp 5152 cf transcript 19 april 2007 p 7 p 32 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 341 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information aggressively competitive issuing would be retarded by the relativ lack of interchange revenue with which to sustain such drive its competitive position is disadvantaged when compared with large issuers having relatively smaller acquiring businesses in the case of large issuers with smaller acquiring businesses the dynamics of advantage are the converse relatively greater proportion of their cardholders will be entering in to off us transactions and thus generating net interchange revenue for the issuer meanwhil the issuers onus transactions generate internal interchange revenue as well500 if interchange is source of profit to the issuer ie not merely necessary means of cost redistribution and recovery the result would tend to chill competition in the supply of acquir ing services and raise merchant service charges above notionally competitive level501 moreover the profit component in interchange would tend to reinforce bigplayer advantag also on the issuing side if as we think probable there is any significant degree of market power over mer chants in the supply of acquiring services generated in particular by network effects then higher than necessary level of interchange could readily be sustained to the advanta ge of the big issuers because the profit component in such level of interchange would flow to the big issuers in onus as well as offus transactions and because of the disincentives to gr owing large acquiring base without corresponding issuing base there would be tend ency for big issuers to increase their hold also on the acquiring market and narrow the scope for profitable acquiring by independents thus interchange in particular when taken together with scheme rules weighted against nonissuers or smaller issuers acquiring has considerable potential to restrict and distort the market for acquiring services the nontransparency of interchange is itself crucial reason convincing us that interchange cannot safely be left to market forces or to setting by private interests alone the applicable level of interchange in respect of any particular card payment is only partially known to merchants it is experienced only indirectly th rough the merchant service charge in that form it is passed on into consumer prices it is unknown to the cardhold er yet enters into consumer prices which the cardholder also pays502 the supposedly free service to the 500 501 502 transcript 17 april 2007 p 34 pp 5152 the argument that margins are tight in the market for acquirin g services has previously been addressed by showing how interchange operates as floor for price competition an yway the argument based on tight margins is further weakened when it is observed that that market is dominated by firms which are also major issuers for them in onus transactions as is the case with threeparty schemes there i s ultimately separate margin on the acquiring side in offus transactions they are the recipients as issuers of the interchange component of the acquirers merchant service charge in onus transactions they are the recipients of the interchange component of their own merchants service charge any element of profit in this component is profit which they extract and retain in their dual capacity as acquirer and issuer transcript 17 april 2007 p 47 pp 109112 i think the perception from credit cardholder is such that he perceives transaction to be free where most consumers are not aware that t here is charge to the retailer absa mr volker id p 112 since lot of the effect of interchange is concealed it does not advance the case of the card schemes to refer to contented consumers chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 342 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information cardholder is subsidised by the merchant 503 but ultimately at the consumers expense504 by way of interchange arrangements nontransparent element of profit is bein g extracted by the issuing bank from the customer or from the particular customer along wit h all other customers

court in 1984 found that visas credit card interchange fee was reasonably costrelated and approved the methodology used as being careful consistent and within the bounds of sound business judgment506 there appears to have been consideration however of the appropriateness or otherwise of the cost elements included in the setting of interchange from competition policy point of view or of the precise role of the business judgment concerned visa and mastercard have each developed their own methodology fo r the setting of interchange and generally describe their processes in different ways both employ costing studies but differ as to the identification of relevant costs and the use made of them in arriving at interchange levels it must be borne in mind that interchange has to reco ncile not only imbalances in cost on the two sides of the market but also imbalances in the elasticity of merchant and cardholder demand ie in the different ability or willingness of the end customers on the two sides to bear the costs of the cooperation enabling service which the joint venture provides in the case of credit cards mastercards costing study is really proxy f or measuring merchant demand507 this proxy is created by selecting certain costs on the issuing side visa evidently uses more comprehensive costing methodology508 mastercards debit card 503 504 505 506 507 508 as mr volker acknowledged in answer to mr bodibe interchan ge is mechanism to subsidise cardholders id pp 81 82 one may add that it is not only the cardholding customer that is subsidised by interchange but also the business of the bank issuing cards moreover the subsidy to cardholder ten ds to go to those least needing it the creditcard holders whose spending is supported by component of the merchants service charge paid for ultimately by all consumers i think irrespective of which payment instrument is used the consumer does ultimately pay so i think our view is that there is variety of payment instruments that can be select ed by the consumer and whether it is cash or cheques or credit or debit card there is cost associated with that instrume nt to the merchant and to the cardholder so none of those options are free in themselves absa mr volker transcr ipt 17 april 2007 p 82 there is an inherent nontransparency in interchange in addi tion there may be actual secrecy in its decision on

interchange on bas is which applied costing methodology essentially chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 343 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information costing methodology is also more comprehensive both schemes however ult imately apply business judgment to the setting of the resulting interchange levels in visas case merchant demand is evidently assessed solely by way of this business judgment 509 mastercard on the other hand explains t hat confidential attempting to quantify merchant demand for credit cards is extrem ely difficult and mastercard mastercards lengthy experience is that the best means to arrive at an approximation is to utilise as point of departure proxy which references costs510 remarkable thing however is that the proxy methodology takes into account only certain of the issuers costs while ignoring the acquirers costs altogether thus where cre dit card interchange is concerned attempt is made to actually assess the imbalance of costs on the two sides of the market nor is the elasticity of cardholder demand ever established511 it seems clear that the object of the exercise is simply to estimate the maximum share of total scheme costs which merchants can be expected to bear and subject to the cautionary judgment which comes from business experience to arrive at maximum interchange rate which as nearly as possible will exploit this limit without breachi ng it in its very origins credit card interchange was based upon information re garding the merchant service charge which acquiring banks were able to levy in the nabanco case the us court of appeals noted that when in 1966 bank of america expanded its threeparty system nationwide by licensing local banks and thus becoming fourpa rty system variable interchange fee system was created each merchantsigning bank was required to inform the cardissuing bank of either the actual or average merchant discount it charged the fee was based on this information after the original bankamericard network expanded the variable interchange fee system did not work effectively forprofit nonstockmembership corporation n bi was therefore formed in 1970

transcript 18 april 2007 p 27 mastercard chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 344 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information nbi became visa in 1977512 visa has evidently been refining its business judgment on this matter ever since the theoretical rationale provided for the mastercard proxy is th at if it were not for the confidential scheme merchants would have to bear the cost of extending credit themselves to their mastercard customers through an inhouse card scheme513 the idea is that they should accordingly be willing to bear the comparable costs within the scheme thus the proxy in broad terms includes three main components the issuers processing costs the iss uers payment guarantee against cardholder default or fraud514 and the interestfree or free funding period granted by the issuer to the cardholder 515 we shall consider these elements further below mastercards debit card cost study is fundamentally different from th at of credit cards and confidential uses more comprehensive approach 516 to calculate the costs involved in the provision of mastercard debit card services to the two sides of the market it is said that this approach is more closely aligned with the theory justifying interchange but requires considerable amou nt of expense time and commitment of resources to carry out517 because the debit card is integrally related to the provision of banking services more costs and functi ons need to be taken into consideration credit cards are typically viewed as product in their own right whereas debit cards are seen as generally used device to obtain access to the customers bank account518 these points are not without merit yet presented simply in this way they nd to give the subject of interchange setting an exaggerated appearance of objectivity ultima tely the key reason for the more comprehensive cost study adopted for debit card interchange seems to be that there was accumulated business experience regarding the extent of the price burden that merchants would be prepared to bear in the debit card stream and as 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 779 f2d592 595 see eg von weizsäcker op cit p 19 visa says that the merchant receives payment guarantee fro m the acquiring bank visa second submission june 2007 document s p 6 however the issuer guarantees payment to the ac quirer thus when the

costs are excluded from the costing studyconfidential marketing and account acquisition and setup costs loyalty r etention programmes cardholder billing and payment processing customer relations and

essentially the approach used in south africa by edc in 20022003 and which is evidently being used again now this is called full cost or baxter approach or an end to end cost study mastercard second submission march 2007 p 23 transcript 18 april 2007 p166 mastercard march 2007 second submission p 23 mastercard october 2006 first submission p 106 thus the cost to the customer of other means of accessing the account also have to be considered chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 345 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mastercard put it proxy for merchant demand is not easily identifiable519 accordingly business judgment as to sustainable interchange has required more extensive cost study as an input into decisionmaking the fact that the credit card proxy is designed to identify an upper bound for merchant service charges was explicitly acknowledged by dr koboldt520 in practice directly measuring merchant demand is very very diff icult and proxies can be used and suitable proxy for an upper bound of what merchants should be expected reasonably be expected to be prepared to pay for cards is essentially what it would cost the merchant to selfprovide similar payment system noting of co urse that only the very largest merchants would be able to do that so its the cost of selfproviding card payment system that t he merchant would have to incur which is what the cost study is measuring it is measuring iss uer cost but by doing that it is not measuring costs of services provided by issuers to acquirers it is rather trying to figure out what it would cost merchants if they were to provide sim ilar card payment system to their customers so if merchants became issuers what costs would th ey have to incur they would have to incur funding the interestfree period they would have to incur some processing costs they would have to write off fraud losses they would hav to write off credit losses and so forth and those are the cost components issuer cost components which essentially proxy the willingness to pay of merchants the amount that mer chants can reasonably be expected to be willing to pay for the services provided by the card payment system although mr munson denied that the goal of mastercard in setting interchange was to find the maximum point at which merchants will continue to take the card521 he was obliged to concede as fair point that the methodology used was to establish an upper bound on what merchants would bear522 this was plainly stated in dr koboldts exhibit mm1 slide 11523 not surprisingly therefore mastercard would usually set interchange at or below this upper bound524 it was suggested to mr munson that by setting interchange at or near th yellow line of what merchants would bear the schemes were not promoting cards as replacements for cash as vigorously as they might525 in his answer he indicated that while cash and debit cards could be considered true substitutes cash should not be seen as g ood comparison with the credit card one of the important differences between credit cards nd other forms of payment especially cash and debit is the availability of long term revolving credit line and 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 mastercard march 2007 second submission p 76 transcript 18 april 2007 pp 6970 id p 157 id pp 157158 mr munson said he would not necessarily

chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 346 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in some cases the availability of the short term or the interestfree period526 dr koboldt pointed out that anyway the proposition involved rather onesided vie w of twosided problem in that drive to replace cash by increasing card usage would st ill require balancing the price to cardholders and to merchants and not simply applyin g all the incentives on the merchant side527 this latter answer seems correct nevertheless the use of proxy in the cost calculations of credit card interc hange fees raises several concerns whatever may have been its justification at the outset of c redit card issuing the idea that merchants would instead have to provide their own inho use store card and credit system is now surely quite artificial dr koboldt himself stated that t his would be realistic only for very largest merchants528 yet merchants of all sizes are being induced via interchange and the resulting merchant service charges to bear such burden nor is the benefit to merchants of an increased turnover thanks to credit cards really pertine nt to their willingness to pay as pick n pay submitted529 virtually all merchants nowadays accept plastic generally because to refuse to do so would lead to loss of turnover from the merchants perspective the debit card now functions in large measure indistinguishably from the credit card fnb submitted the correct methodology for calculating interchange is that both demand and supply cost factors should be taken into account as this appears to be correct according to economic theory the use of the mastercard proxy approach does however yield comparable results as it implicitly accounts for demandside factors530 we are unable to accept that view it is stated in theory531 that interchange fees can be positive negative or zero the proxy specified in the mastercard edc cost studies is predefined and identifies s everal issuing costs upfront not allowing for negative or zero outcomes to occur the develo pment of comprehensive costing methodology for debit cards shows that it is feasible to measur all relevant issuing and acquiring costs in our view the specification of proxy whet her as representation of the imbalance of costs or of the imbalance in demand elastici ties in

its users client fees coul d possibly start reflecting the true cost of transacting and risk which could see an increase in credit c ard fees individuals may lose the marketing benefits on their credit card purchases i f that cannot be funded from interchange532 put differently the question to be addressed is why credit card interchange should not be limited essentially to what is needed to enable it to function as means of payment like the debit card leaving the costs of credit extension to be charged directly and competitively to the borrower the vast majority of south africans holding credit cards some 80 per cent do pay interest on their transactions533 the remaining minority make use of the interestfree period and discharge their debt to the issuing bank befo re that period expires where the debt is not discharged in time there is interestfree period the cardholder is treated as hav ing drawn on the revolving credit facility from the outset and interest is charged from th date of the transaction534 in the vast majority of cases therefore the issuing bank receives revenue through high rate of interest as well as receiving interchange535 at the same time the interestfree period for the remainder the transactors is being funded by merchants willingly or unwillingly via interchange like mirage the interestfree per iod also serves as an attraction to those credit card users who prove unable to repay timeou sly the revolvers and who are thereby more easily drawn into highinterest bearing debt merchants derive increased turnover from all forms of credit extended to retail customers not merely from credit on credit cards adequate justification has been advan ced for imposing on merchants this cost of credit extension by banks or for permitting this particular form of credit extension to be privileged in the marketplace in this way536 absa observed that the removal of interchange would inter alia reduce the availability ie the issuance of credit cards particularly for higher risk consumers537 this is because the lenders costs would have to be recovered directly from the borrowers the mselves by logical extension the same must apply if the level of interchange were to fall relative to the cost of extending the credit the implication is clear under the present arrangements merchants are being required to pay by way of interchange towards the cost of extending credit to bank customers in various categories of risk without having any part in assessin g and deciding whether they would themselves wish to assume that risk the artificialit

the cost of debtors defaults 538 in determining the level of credit card interchange is in our view manifest moreover since credit card interchange like all interchange enters ultimately into consumer prices it must follow that cash and debit card customers are being compelled to shoulder part of the banks costs of lending to the betteroff and so subsidising the latter539 according to visa its interchange fees internationally address only the payment service540 distinction is specifically drawn between the payment service and the financing service541 this would suggest that the interchange fees do not address the costs of credit extension but on closer examination that appears not to be so visa says that revolving loans and cash advances are excluded from the scope of interchange542 it goes on to say however when dealing with the interchange exemption granted to it by the european commission in 2002 that the permitted benchmark costs which have formed ceiling for its average interchange have included not only processing and the payment gua rantee but also the free funding period543 under visas own methodology the study of issuing costs identifies the cos ts of processing of the payment guarantee and of funds544 visa says that finance charge revenues as well as the underlying cost to fund revolving cardholder receivables clearly go with the financing service545 but it seems arbitrary to limit in this way the allocation of costs to the 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 concerning the payment guarantee the ec noted in 2002 oj l 318 p 20 22112002 in the present decision concerning visa this term is used to describe the promise of the issuing bank to honour payments to the acquiring bank even those which turn out to be inter alia fraudulent or for which the cardholder ultimately defaults on condition that the merchant undertakes all the security checks necessary t enable the issuing bank to promise payment as concerns default losses only losses occurring during the

however it appears to be recognised that relevant acquirers costs will include communications and terminal processing merchant customer service an d merchant affiliation549 as description of methodology all this is far from clear we do not doubt that interchange in order to balance cardholder and mercha nt demand might legitimately both in the debit and credit card streams factor in som part not only of issuers processing costs where these exceed what cardholders may be expected t bear but also of the savings to merchants through certainty of payment and protection against cardholder

assessing merchant sensitivity to the cost of accepting cards visa re cognises an increasingly complex segmentation between for example groceries f uel airlines other travel and entertainment and card

internationally this degree of sophisticat ion in interchange setting has not yet come to south africa but could be expected to do so as the payment card market matures the degree of market power over

the enquiry consisted of an eloquent defence of interchange within the fourparty schemes and warning against interferi ng with it552 this seemed somewhat curious considering that american express like diners clu b is threeparty scheme in which interchange plays direct part nevertheless the threeparty schemes do have distinct interest in the level of the merchant service charges th at are levied in the fourparty schemes and thus indirectly an interest in the lev of fourparty interchange too their interest would be in their rivals merchant service ch arges being high rather than low in the first place the fourparty schemes merchant service charges provide benchmark in relation to which the threeparty schemes own competing merchant service charge s can be set thus where premium card is offered the merchant can more readily be pers uaded to pay premium service charge as compared with the fourparty norm secondly to the extent that high interchange fuels fourparty card issuing ther is general expansion of the market within which the threeparty schemes can promote their cards as second card for the convenience of the betteroff it follows that if interchange in the fourparty schemes is set at higher than necessa ry levels then the illegitimate benefits would flow indirectly to the threepart schemes as well553 676 the need for regulation in our view interchange has the character of necessary evil where its necessity is shown to exist it still needs to be kept as low as is reasonably possible the difficulty is to find the means of securing that outcome in the public interest in way that does not comp romise the effective functioning and further development of card and other noncash and paperless payment systems interchange arrangements as we have seen are themselves substitute for market mechanism as dr hawkins expressed it during the hearings554 if you are replacing mechanism or perhaps substituting m echanism that the market 552 553 554 american express october

and is it appropriate t hat it is actually left to those who benefit from the scheme to do that setting for the reasons set out above interchange should clearly not be left to be set privately by those actually or potentially benefitting from it mr munson of mastercard while opposing any regulatory intervention acknowledged that generally speaking there are three possible ways of setting interchange the banks can set the fee themselves the scheme operator master card in our case can set the fee or some third party either appointed or approved by regulatory agenc or the regulatory agency itself could set the interchange555 in the next part of this chapter we consider the problem of appropriate r egulation of interchange subject on which great deal of constructive input was made by number of participants in the enquiry here we would merely note that competition law is obviously not designed for such purposes specific statutory framework to enable and enforce the envisage d regulatory process will be required that is matter for the competition commissioner to t ake up with other appropriate authorities in the light of this report however competition law is not left impotent in the face of the challenge posed by interchange accepting the necessity of interchange in principle does not mean that any particular methodology of arriving at interchange is justified if the methodology actually employed can be shown to have an illegitimate purpose then in our view there would probably be the setting of restrictive trading condition in contraventio n of section 41 b of the competition act it might also be possible to demonstrate anticompe titive effects and consequent contravention in the alternative of section 41 although the issues are complex an investigation with view to such enforcement should be considered if the regulatory remedies which we propose are not adopted or are inordinately delayed 68 interchange in other payment streams 681 introduction in south africa we have 16 payment streams governed by the applicable pch agreements of these six payment streams necessitated attention during the enquiry with respec t to the interbank arrangements that are in place prime among them has been inte rchange in the payment card environment the one to which the preceding sections of this chapter have been devoted although many other payment streams may also utilise interbank fees556 555 556 transcript 18 april 2007 p 20 according to standard bank certain payment streams in south africa g eft exhibit interbank chapter 6 payment cards and

streams which warrant attention in this chapter557 682 electronic funds transfer eft in the realm of interbank eft interchange makes its appearance under the nam of homing fee the justification for homing fee in an eft transaction is said t be based on the twosided nature of the market for such transfers which in principle ma require balancing payment in offus transactions the direction in which interchange flows in eft transactions differs according to th type of eft transaction initiated there are two types of eft transactions eft credit transactions558 and eft debit transactions559 in the case of an eft credit transaction interchange flows from the paying side to the receiving side in the case of an eft debit transaction it flo ws in the opposite direction stakeholder banks in both cases argue that interchange is v ital for the viability of the payment stream in both instances the market appears be truly twosided so that balancing payment could in principle be necessary to reallocate revenue between the two sides ho wever the need for nonzero rate of interchange the need for an actua l flow of interchange in one direction or the other must still depend on an inability of the service providers on one side or the other to collect sufficient revenue by independent pricing to end users who have demand for the service if total revenues collected on either side were not sufficient at least to cover total costs associated with providing such service together with normal profit the rvice would obviously not be provided this then would necessitate transfer of reven ue from the side with strong or inelastic demand and subsequent surplus of revenue to the side with an inability to cover costs due to very elastic demand if however the costs are sufficiently 557 558

with effect from 1 july 2006 resulted in uniform interchange fee applicable between the relevant banks of r028 on ef t debit transactions and r038 on eft credit t ransactions it is clear that there has been consistent increase in the interchange fees paid n eft transactions over time yet it is far from clear that as transaction volumes have increased average transaction costs would have warranted the fee increases as with payment card interchange agreed charges which enter into the cost structure of service provision ultimately find their way into consumer prices any unnecessary sheltering of cost 560 absa october 2007 banking enquiry response to data and in formation request p 8 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 354 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information components from effective competition needs to be eliminated we now move on to discuss eft credit and debits transactions in turn eft credit transactions an eft credit transaction is an electronic transfer of funds initiated by the paying customer instructing the paying bank to transfer funds from the account of the payer to the account of beneficiary at the beneficiary bank these transactions are mainly salary payments in an eft credit transaction the beneficiary of the transfer is ordinarily unwilling to p ay fee to his or her bank the beneficiary bank for the receipt of payment or at least to agree in advance to be debited fee for such receipts there is said to exist ve ry elastic demand for the service561 indicating that an increase or an introduction of fee might drastically decrease the quantity of the service demanded in this instance the inability of the beneficiary bank to charge its client necessitates the extraction of revenue from the client initiating the transaction ie the paying client and consequent transfer from the paying bank to the beneficiary bank in order to cover the costs associated with the beneficiary side we accept that there would be customer resistance and probably rightly so t the levying of fee on the beneficiary side we doubt however that the problem is essenti ally one of elastic demand since increasingly employees are required by their employers to have bank accounts into which their wages and salaries may be electronically paid562 once they have bank account and especially if they are required to have one there will be significant degree of customer captivity563 it might well be inappropriate on those grounds too for the beneficiary bank to charge the customer for such receipts we would accept that in these circumstances an interbank payment of interchange homing fee from the paying bank to the beneficiary bank is legitimate however as with all interchange in our opinion the process and methodology fo r the setting of this fee warrants incorporation into the transparent and objective regulatory schem which we propose figure 6 and figure 7 illustrate the flows involved in an eft credit tran saction and eft debit transaction respectively 561 562 563 standard bank march 2007 access and regulation p 41 transcript 3 november 2006 p 102 financial sector campaig n coalition mr kholisile the general basis for this conclusion is analysed in the chapter of our report dealing with market power in retail banking chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 355 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information figure 6 eft credit transaction in an eft credit transaction see figure 6 funds are pushed by the payer with the help of the paying bank to the beneficiary with the help of the beneficiary bank typical example of an eft credit transaction is where an employer pays salaries into the accounts of its employees here the paying client the employer pays per transaction fee plus the value of the transaction to its bank bank and the value of the transaction plus the interchange fee is paid to bank b the full value of the transaction is reflected in th account of the receiving client the employee eft debit transactions in the case of an eft debit transaction the beneficiary pulls or draws the funds by prearrangement with the payer again on each side assisted by the relevant b ank an example would be debit order obtained by corporation from its customer for pa yment of services such as cell phone contract in this case the paying client agrees that the value of the debit order will be pulled from his or her account periodically each month say the value of the debit order and the transaction fee will be dra wn from the customers account at bank b in turn bank b pays over the value of the debit order t bank where the cell phone company has its account bank ensures the value is paid i nto the cell phone companys account and would typically charge transaction fee for doing so bank b the paying bank receives an interchange fee while also charging its own customer for its trouble see figure 7 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 356 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information figure 7 eft debit transaction an eft debit transaction takes place when the beneficiary bank technically ca lled the collecting participant issues an electronic instruction to the paying bank the paying participant to transfer funds to it for the credit of the beneficiarys account and for t he debit of the payers account in doing this the collecting bank acts upon an instruction from its accountholder the beneficiary relying on an authorisation which the payer has prov ided to the beneficiary to serve as an order to the paying bank typical examples of this would be the debit orders obtained by corporations f rom their customers for payment of services such cellphone contracts life insurance and medical scheme contributions in many instances these corporations require their cus tomers to have bank account and to sign debit order on the account as the obligator method of payment accordingly once again we have reinforcement of the general basis f or significant degree of captivity of the ordinary individual customer in the ret ail banking relationship564 it is argued that the paying customer and bank are usually far more resistant to the use of this payment method ie the debit order than the beneficiary customer and bank 565 that may well be so but it does not follow in the circumstances that customer demand is elastic given the degree to which customers of big corporations have choice but to sign debit orders or forego crucial services there has been an increased uptake of eft transactions evidently fuelled by the requirements of the corporate clients initiating the transactions according to data submitted by bankserv the volumes of eft debit transactio ns from 2003 564 565 see footnote 563 above sbsa april 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 4 3 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 357 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information to 2006 increased as follows table 16 volume growth of eft transactions 2003 2004 2005 2006 757 634 994 1043 source bankserv submission 27 november 2006 the interbank homing fee interchange is said to be necessary to balance t he interests in the services provided to the different end users and transfer revenue in order to c over the associated costs we do not consider this contention to have been proved in contrast to an eft credit transaction the banks on both sides of the transaction can and do charge their customers for the service which they provide higher transaction volum should have caused average processing costs to fall yet charges levied on those payin g by debit order have risen the graph below illustrates the increase in the debit order fees applied by the big four banks to entry level savings accounts ie to the customers on the paying side figure 8 debit order fees on big four banks entry level savings accounts source infochoice data why then have an additional flow of revenue across from the collectin g to the paying side why at least has this flow not diminished in fact as we have seen the interch ange or homing fee paid from the beneficiary bank to the paying bank has increased steadily by 100 per cent per transaction over nine years566 clearly we would have to be concerned that the elimination of the homing fee interchange 566 see table 15 above chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 358 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information on eft debit transactions might translate simply into lower ba nk charges for the corporations requiring payment by debit order and correspondingly higher charges being levied on customers on the paying side as banks continue to utilise their market power over the latter however the latter charges may well be kept at or near the bearable maximum anyway and it cannot be assumed that banks would be able simply to raise t heir processing charges for paying debit orders without limit or resistance an investigation in any vent into excessive pricing or failing that regulatory intervention might then be warranted it would be naïve to suppose that customers on the paying side are currently bei ng helpfully subsidised by fees charged by banks to the corporations in whose favour these customers sign debit orders those corporations are generally able to recover their costs by th eir own charges to their customers thus if the corporations bank charges are inflated the ultimate customer ends up paying anyway the key difference is that it is nontransparen t if the paying banks are able by agreements on interchange to extract additional rev enue from the collecting side it is very doubtful that this is or would be used to am eliorate the position of the paying customers the paying banks and the collecting banks ar the same institutions they have mutual interest in creating common costfloor fo r their charges to corporate customers on the collecting side which cannot readily be competed away in the face of those corporations countervailing power and which transforms itself into revenue in their own hands as paying banks by means of this interchange partial shelter against price competition is created we have analysed this dynamic earlier in this chap ter when dealing with merchant service charges the same logic applies here having this uniform and common cost component on the collecting side has the related effect of privileging the collecting banks in competition with bureaux for the provision of debit order processing services to corporate clients in this way they further distort t he market the banks are already at an advantage in being able to bundle their processing services w ith the actual paymentcollecting service that is unique to them as banks in accepting debit orders via bureaux for collection the banks are able to charge fee including the interch ange or homing fee component in offering their own processing services dire ctly to the collecting customers the corporations the banks which are also paying banks and t hus retain the homing fees in all onus transactions have revenue stream denied to burea ux and which they can use to discount their processing charges to the corporations if interchange and thus the homing fee is to be seen as providing subsidy then in all probability it is the banks which are being subsidised in the eft debit stream thus in our view even though eft debit transactions meet the basic criterion of twosided market the actual necessity of interchange in this payment stream has not been demonstrated we are not in position to say conclusively on the basis of the information voluntarily submitted to us that it has been proved not to be necessary consideration should therefore be given by the competition commissioner to initiating c omplaint with reference to section 41 b and alternatively section 41 of the competition act in order chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 359 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information formally to investigate possible contravention or contraventions arising from t he past and current interbank arrangements in respect of interchange in this stream as regards to the future if interchange is to be levied in r elation to eft debit transactions then it ought to be included within the regulated process which we recomme nd for interchange generally and so be subject to the participatory procedures involved in arriving at and implementing an appropriate level of interchange the first step in this process would be to establish whether interchange in this stream is necessariy at all 683 early debit orders edo the introduction of the early debit order edo system in 2006 has created two new payment streams authenticated early debit orders aedo567 and nonauthenticated early debit orders naedo568 these are governed by two separate pch agreements aedo and naedo transactions function like eft debit transactions but get processed early in the morning on the designated date or dates as fnb explains the edo system services niche of debit order payers and beneficiaries who require debit order which runs immediately after the salary or income credit is received into the account569 the aedo system was designed for micro financiers and requires the authentication of the debt or and the debit order through the use of card and pin the naedo system in compariso n was designed for banks own payment collections and for those of large corporations including insurance companies and requires authentication because of the mand ate obtained in the agreement with the borrower570 however for number of reason enumerated below it appears that the naedo stream is favoured by most users the south african reserve banks national payment system department stat ed in its directive 1 of 2006571 133 in the recent past banks have allowed for collection purpo ses practices whereby certain persons payment instructions have been granted preferential treat ment over others these preferential practices have taken place using various mechanisms 567 568 569 570 571 the definition for an aedo transaction in the relevant pch agreement

stakeholders has agreed on the principles for the collection of debit payment instructions in do pchs microlenders who provide small loans to lowerincome clients prefer re payment through debit orders because of the increased risk in this segment of the market574 aedo transactions are debit cardbased575 and are authenticated at the time of electronic contract registration by production of the card and entry of the cardholder s pin in this way the borrowers debit card is used to iss ue series of future dated electronic payment instructions naedo transactions in contrast are based simply on signed mandate from the debtor authorising the futuredated payments the naedo user the creditor applies for and obtains user code acquiring in the aedo stream is done in conjunction with customer

575 576 577 578 579 sortingatsource is defined in the directive as the process whe reby the beneficiary of payment instructions sorts each paying banks payment instructions together and then submits those pay ment instructions directly to each paying bank where the proceeds of such payment instructions are credited to an account in the name of the beneficiary see the chapter on access to the payment system the reference to the abuse of the atm system is evidently refe rence to the practice of some microlenders taking possession of borrowers debit cards and pins in order to make atm

aedo is more of hassle because ou need the client to be present with his bankcard and pin in your office at the time of gran ting the loan on the other hand the benefit is that the client mandates his transaction by swiping h is card and entering his pin this brings major benefit the payment cant be revers ed by the client after you have received the funds in your merchant account in contrast to the more of hassle to load aedo transactions naedo might seem more streamlined and effortless to implement you dont need additional com puter hardware or terminals card readers to load payment transactions your client authoriz the payment by simply signing paper naedo mandate the mandate includes the bank accoun t number branch code and deduction amount for particular date the major disadvantage of naedo is its reversibility payment can be reversed for period f up to 40 days after it has been processed this means the client can request his bank to reverse the pay ment after you have received it in your merchant account according to information published by service provider intecon allps580 the interchange structure in the edo system is based on separate bilateral agreements between acquiring and issuing banks relating to socalled billable components of the interchange fees it appears that the interchange in the edo market has been set at much higher level than for eft

significantly higher than the flat confidential r023 uniform interchange fee applicable to ordinary debit order transactions ef t debit absa transactions see table 15 above this is puzzling as the processing required in bo th the edo and eft stream appears to be very similar and the value added services in the edo stream such as tracking are all being charged for separately mercantil stated that the major issuers have contended these are justified based on the amount of development done to facilitate the edo payment streams and the additional overhead on systems du to the extra processing required dictated by the timelines involved in provi ding feedback to acquiring banks586 however the feedback mentioned here evidently relates to the optional t racking service offered by the paying bank for which the beneficiary pays specially it would th erefore seem to be irrelevant to the basic interchange fees payable and its inclusion in the alleged justification for those fees merely clouds the issue the standard twosided market argument for higher interchange fees in p articular payment stream is that this will serve to enable the recipient of the interchange revenue to pr ice in such way to customers on its side of the market so as to attract them to the service in the edo streams both the recipient user such as the micro lender and t he paying customer whose account is being debited pay for the service so both sides of the market are charged for the service as is the case for eft debits despite higher interch ange in the edo environment than for ordinary eft debit orders the prices paid by paying custo mers to the issuing ie paying banks seem broadly to be the same irrespective of the payment 586 mercantile march 2008 competition enquiry questions and an

confidential absa sbsa source absa response to additional march 2008 it should be emphasised that the data in table 20 exclude any amounts payable by us ers for credit tracking where the user opts for credit tracking that could increase the to tal fees payable significantly in their submission mfsa stated that the banks determine the cost of edo independently of the users ie microfinanciers since edo is designed to facilitate payments across the banking network the banks under the guise of the nps set the price and are not required to disclose t he structure598 as table 19 reveals typical user fees for successful aedo transactions are much higher than those for successful naedo transactions thus for example where transaction value of r1000 is concerned the aedo user may well pay r2280 when the na edo user confidential is paying r798 for repayments greater than r3 50 naedo is better value it is partly for absa this reason that micro lenders appear to be shifting to naedo fnb justified higher aedo user fees as follows aedo offers merchants additional value adds when compared to naedo p articularly the protection against repudiation of transactions due to the authenticat ion of the transactions and thus tends to be priced higher to merchants599 598 599 micro finance south africa october 2006 microfinance south frica enquiry into competition in banking p 2 fnb march 2008 response

level the explanation is unsatisfactory given that many of the us ers in the aedo stream ie smaller micro financiers and nonbanks appear to be opting for the less expensive naedo moreover we have reason to think that pricing by major banks in this area is any more costrelated than in others considered in this report the leve ls of pricing and especially the much higher prices charged to users without significant bargaining power namely those in the aedo stream are most probably the result of banks ability to exercise market power additions of value utility for the consumer provide justification for an abovecompetitive price at the levels of interchange and user fees now applied especially in the aedo stream it is not surprising that acceptance of this new and clearly more

were processed through bankserv601 this is insignificant compared to the 28 million eft debit transactions processed through bankserv in october 2007602 another factor hindering participation in the aedo stream was mentioned by mercantile the reason why we participate in both the aedo and naedo payment st reams is that aedo has limited access to accounts that can be accessed via the bankserv debit card switch whilst naedo allows for much broader access to accounts this is chnical issue apparently not foreseen at the time of developing the aedo stream603 information submitted by fnb with regard to naedo charges to beneficiary customers confidential shows that the naedo user fees charged by fnb to beneficiary customers range betwee n frb r329 and r724604 even though this is still high in comparison to ordinary debit order fees605 the naedo user fees seem to bear relationship to the bilaterally negoti ated level of interchange paid away by fnb to other participating banks of flat

data and info request p 10 confidential frb chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 369 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the value added services that edo offers beneficiary clients and the specialist support and infrastructure required to run the systems could well justify higher user fees c ompared to previously used systems but the extremely high edo user fees currently charged to the beneficiary customers especially aedo customers compared to ordinary debit order user fees clearly impact on the success of this payment stream and the clear prefere nce of customers for the latter capitec explained that the edo service is deemed value added service over eft and decision was taken to charge the edo transactions at slightly higher rate than eft debits to be able to process these unique edo features and to meet the tigh t service level agreements for edo places burden on processing capacity at the bank eft on the other hand carries lower fee and is processed at the end of bus iness day where we have little more time to complete processing it is simple process that is done in batch processing mode during the night window of the bank much ss strain is put on the operators client has choice of edo or eft mandates and the price differenti ation is intended to act as disincentive to issue edo mandates when normal eft would suffice users should use edo selectively and use eft for the more established consumers the operational pressure on banks to complete processing on time is already high should the eft users move large volumes to edo it could create pressure on banks processing capacity and will require further investment in capacity to meet th early morning slas service level agreements607 it seems thus that the reluctance of banks to accept and use this more sophisticated payment system which clearly contains significant benefits for consumers608 and in which the banks have invested substantially is reflected in the pricing to the end users disincentivising the use of this payment method the pricing structures seem to only serve the best interest of the participating banks absa confidential taken together with nupay receives considerable fees for being the major acquir er in the absa aedo payment stream but is required to pay away in the form of the interchange on ly small part of the revenue

interchange fees bilaterally seems not to have produced any proconsumer competitive benefits if anything it tends to confirm the genera l analysis given above namely that bilateral interchange setting

objective regulatory scheme which we propose for p ayment cards and other payment streams where it would be appropriate once again establish ing the necessity of interchange in the payment stream concerned would be fundamen tal to the process that process will also help clarify the extent to which banks pricing to users in these streams is in excess of costs and whether specific investigation

interchange is not regulated competition authorities ar left with an unending predicament in their attempts to address the abuses or potential abuses identified above the point at which interchange

decision in the united states in the mid1980s seemed simply to give green light to interchange but as we have seen its analysis did not adequately distinguish and disentangle the necessity and legitimacy of interchange in principle from the reasonableness of the methodology and business judgment employed in setting it in t he latter respects the decision was merely casespecific at that relatively early stage in the developme nt of four party schemes the potential for systematic abuse was not identified614 everything was supposedly for the best in the best of all possible worlds in

various rules and regulations governing the visa association and its members to the european commission applying for negative clearance under article 811 of the treaty or in the alternative an exemption under article 813616 in 1992 the commission withdrew comfort letter previously given and reopened its investigation in 1997 the reopene d investigation also took into account complaint filed by eurocommerce european retailers organisation concerning various aspects of inter alia the visa international payment card scheme in particular interchange fees on 24 july 2002 the commission is sued decision relating to the intraregional interchange fee scheme of visa international for consumer cards as applied to crossborder point of sale visa card payment operations between eea member states617 the effect of this decision was to exempt visas intended multilateral interchange fee mif from the prohibition under article 811 until 31 dec ember 2007 on the basis of certain proposals and undertakings from visa the undertakings included significant reductions in the prevailing levels of interchange for different types of cards reduction of more than 50 per cent in the case of average debit card transac tions618 the proposals involved the use of costing methodology subject to independent audit which was designed to serve as proxy for benefits received by merchants from crossborder

on 1 january 1994 comprising the countries of the european union and the european free trade association see id 18 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 373 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information interchange for each card type in reasoning its way to its decision the commission concluded that whil visas mif did not have the object of restricting competition it did have the effect of appreciably restricting competition and therefore required exemption from article 811619 it found that adequate grounds for such an exemption existed the commissions analysis did not make clear distinction between the necessity of interchange in principle on the one hand an d methodology of interchange setting which may unnecessarily restrict or distort competition whether in object or effect on the other indeed the methodology which it ap proved for purposes of the exemption was essentially the same as the one used in south africa which we have found above to be inherently unsatisfactory620 although mentioning the argument regarding the need in principle for balancing mechanism in an open or fourpart scheme the commission seemed to give it weight it concluded that interchange was not technically necessary since the visa scheme could admittedly survive on greatl reduced scale without it621 we are unable to follow this line of reasoning by implication it acknowledges that interchange would have been necessary to enable the additional transactions to occur but the point at which technical necessity would be establish ed in twosided market remains unclear at the same time so the commissions reason ing went the necessity of interchange for optimising card usage was clear ough to warrant an exemption under article 813 subject to the provisos as to reduced levels and the proxy costing methodology 622 the logical consequence of this approach would seem to be that multilateral or other uniform interchange setting is always prone to prohibit ion in europe under article 81 unless specifically declared exempt that exemptions would have to be periodically reconsidered and that in this way regulation of interchange would in fact occur indirectly under the supervision of the competition authorities on 19 december 2007 the european commission announced its decision on mastercard which has been referred to earlier in this chapter still maintaining that open card schemes 619 620 621 622 see id paras 69 and 73 the methodology approved in the ecs visa exemption used th issuers costs of processing transactions b the issuers cost of providing the payment guarantee and c the cos t to the issuer of the free funding period as an acceptable proxy for the average marginal utility of visa c ard to the merchant accepting it see id especially paras 83 90 at best the commission could only say that t hese costs reflected the cost of services which issuing bank s provide wholly or partly to the benefit of merchants s ee id 91 in the case of the free funding period this was feature of international charge and credit cards that partly benefit s the merchant for crossborder transactions why the whole of these costs should then simply be included in the approved interchange methodology and others and why attempt to assess and balance elasticit ies of demand on the two sides of the market was thought necessary to rational outcome remains mystery the likelihood is that the grant of the exemption relied less on systematic reasoning than on the promise that visas interchange levels would actually come down see id 59 see id paras 98 and 99 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 374 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information can operate without mif623 and that methods other than interchange can provide balancing mechanism in fourparty scheme624 the commission nevertheless stated that it did not consider interchange as such to be prohibited625 however it found that mastercards multilateral intraeea default interchange fees for debit and consumer credit cards did violate article 81 of the treaty626 in its announcement the commission stated mastercard has six months to comply with the commissions order to wi thdraw the fees if mastercard fails to comply the commission may impose daily penalty payments of 35 per cent of its daily global turnover in the preceding business year627 mif are not illegal as such however mif in an open payment card scheme such as mastercard s is only compatible with eu competition rules if it contributes to technical and econ omic progress and benefits consumers628 the criteria mentioned are ones applicable to exemptions under article 813 thus suggesting that multilateral interchange is indeed to be treated as prohibited unless exempted629 at the same time the european commission drew attention to the fact that the visas 2002 exemption was about to expire from that moment on visa will be responsible to ensure that i ts system is in full compliance with eu competition rules630 from our perspective the eu approach lacks the clarity and certainty that we would be looking for 623

without the component of their revenues provided by interchange in other words 38 of the 100 would not ve been profitable without interchange as for the 62 the level of their residual profitability is not indicated nor is there an examination of the extent of any likely exit on their part from credit card issuing in the event that interchange i n respect of such cards were to be prohibited mere profitability may not be enough to keep firm in market i f the rate of profit is abnormally low the working document itself indicated need for caution when it stated the aim of this analy sis is not to argue in favour of zero interchange fee for all networks however in the light of the results it is leg itimate to question the optimality of the current level of interchange fees in several countries the inquirys findi ngs seem to confirm some recent theoretical predictions of the twosided market literature which suggest that privately optima l interchange fees may be too high notably if merchant fees increase with interchange fees but issuers do not pass the additional i nterchange fee revenue back to cardholders from the south african perspective we have addressed all of these aspects in this chapter above id ip071959 brussels 19th december 2007 p 1 on the same day mastercard europe announced that it would appeal the decision to the european court of first instance

with the commission while contesting the d ecision mastercard press release 19 december 2007 to the extent that in the commissions reasoning there is n implied approval of bilateral setting of interchange we consider this both impractical and at least in south africa highly undesirable for reasons discussed above introductory remarks at press conference brussels 19 dece mber 2007 by the european commissioner for competition policy p 3 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 375 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information like the european commission the south african competition commission has direct regulatory powers unlike the european commission our competition commission lacks wide powers of exemption the powers in terms of section 10 of the competition act to exempt practice from prohibition are very limited indeed631 even if these powers were to be expanded which may be warranted in any event we do not consider that exemption under competition legislation provides satisfactory framework for regulating interchange for the reasons explained above an approach which assumes that multilateral or uniform interchange is prohibited unless exempted seems inherently flawed at the same time the constant resort to exemption in order to legitimise interchange would oblige the competition authorities to function in effect as price regulators they are not cut out fo r such role moreover criteria for exemption under competition legislation criteria which by t heir nature need to be generally applicable across industries could not be tailored adequately to the complex subjectmatter of interchange and would thus not be sufficiently precis the vagaries of official discretion would conseq uently reign at the expense of objectivity clarity business certainty and the rule of law in australia the reserve bank cut through these difficulties by imposing regi of interchange regulation in respect of payment cards standing independently of competition law in an appendix to this report we have provided considerable det ail of the australian reforms for ease of future reference and comparison while our recommended methodology differs from that adopted by the rba for determining appropriate levels of in terchange we do recommend that south africa follows their pioneering initiative in moving to the regulation of interchange on an independent objective and transparent basis632 692 an independent objective and transparent process after the conclusion of the enquiry hearings the panel asked the technical team t engage in consultative process with banks and other relevant stakeholders in order to explore further the feasibility and practical implications of certain changes which had been mooted in the hearings one of these was the introduction of an independent objective and transparent methodology and pr ocedure for 631 632 section 10 3 of our competition act limits permissible exemptions t those

industry designed by the minister of trade and industry after consulting t he minister responsible for that industry section 10 4 further allows the possible exemption of agreements or practices

not matter for us to address an exem ption until 2013 of its interchange arrangements in south africa obviously domestic regulation cannot affect crossborder inte rchange rates there needs to be discussion between competition authorities internationally as to how to address this prob lem chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 376 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information determining interchange in all payment streams in which interchange is necessary633 series of exploratory meetings was then arranged it was emphasised that nothing said at those meetings would be considered as being on the record of the enquiry unless specifically advanced and recorded as an ontherecord statement at the instance of or by agreement with the participant concerned moreover participation in the exploratory process would not be taken to imply support for or endorsement of any particular chan ge or measure that the panel might ultimately recommend three such meetings on interchange were held on 15 august 4 sept ember and 30 october 2007 which were attended by representatives of banks card scheme s and the larger retailers the consultative process envisaged by paragraph 6c of the enquiry terms of reference continued also in other ways valuable contributions to our further understanding of the subject were made in this way both in oral debate and by mea ns for example of working documents for discussion and we have drawn on them t varying degrees in coming to our own conclusions they are not specifically id entified and acknowledged in what follows because they have remained off the record634 in our view there is need for the process of interchangesetting to be subjec t to regulation under specific statutory authority this is necessary to ensure inter alia that the global four party card schemes are effectively subordinated to the envisaged process in so far as their operations in south africa are concerned and that their participating institutions he re adhere to that process despite any provisions to the contrary regarding interchange that m ay exist or be adopted in the schemes own rules the regulator of the payment system the south african reserve bank sarb would appear to have the authority under section 101 c of its own enabling act635 to devise and implement the necessary rules and procedures that act however has to be read in conjunction with the nps act it should be noted that in the chapter of this r eport dealing with access to the payment system we have concluded that certain fundamental c hanges to the nps act are required other less fundamental changes may also be necessary currently section 12 of the nps act which allows the sarb to issue binding directives regardin g payment system does not apply to designated settlement system it will be impo rtant to ensure that regulated process of interchangesetting which might be provided fo r by way of 633 634 635 letters of invitation to stakeholders july 2007 the exploratory process on appropriate regulation of interchange went considerably beyond the ontherecord submissions of the various participants and similarly beyond the questions asked and the answers given by them at the hearings in that regard purpose would be served by r ecapitulating those earlier submissions questions and answers here the record stands as direct source of reference sho uld it be needed occasional references are made to the record in footnotes to this section below where that helps to elucidate certain issues not elaborated in the main text south african reserve bank act 90 of 1989 section 101 ci empowers the sarb to perform such functions implement such rules and procedures and in general take such steps as may be necessary to establish conduct monitor regulate and supervised payment clearing or settle ment systems section 101 ciii empowers it to perform the functions assigned to the bank by or under any law for the regulation of such payment clearing or settlement systems chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 377 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information directive under section 12 is not able to be circumvented by the simple dev ice of banks deciding to clear and settle their card transactions through designated off shore systems of the card schemes the regulated process of interchange setting which we have in mind w ould not cast the sarb or its national payment system department npsd in the role of having to establish the appropriate level of interchange itself it would not become in effect pricesetter rather its role would be to confirm that the process provided for in the envisage d rules had been duly carried out by the participants and on that basis to declare the result bindin g it would then have the role of ensuring compliance and dealing in the ordinary way with contraventions 636 the basic elements of the envisaged regulatory process are set out below pay ment streams that should be included in the process at the outset are the credit card debit card electronic funds transfer eft and early debit order edo streams in our view the regulator should have the authority to invoke the process also in respect of any other existing or future payment stream or any means of payment in any stream whenever satisfied that interchange in that connection however it may be set or proposed to be set may give rise to significant competition or consumer welfare concerns advice from the competition commissioner from time to time could assist the regulator in being satisfied or otherwise in regard to the first of those criteria at least the advantage of such flexible approach would be that at least initially where innovations occur in methods of payment including the introduction of new types of payment cards interchange could where it is necessary be established for them by private arrangements without immediately facing regulatory control there should however be requirement of public disclosure of all interchange arrangements at least twice year combined with frequent reporting to the regulator of all volumes and revenues connected with interchange whether regulated or not this would both enable complia nce with the regulatory arrangements to be monitored and put the regulator in an informed position from which to investigate further and invoke the process once concerns over unregulated interchange setting arise the possibility of such flexibility follows from the conclusion that mult ilateral or uniform interchange in payment stream where it is necessary to balance the two sides of the market is not unlawful per but that it may nevertheless be abused 636 this role appears to be in keeping with the responsibilities set ut by the bank for international settlements bis for overseers of systemically important payment systems in i ts core priniciples and responsibilities of central banks in particular core priniciple ix which aims to address acces s and competitive aspects in payment systems read together with the responisibilitiy c which is designed to incl ude overseeing compliance of other systems with the core principles would apply chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 378 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 693 participation in the process the process which we envisage would involve the establishment of an interchange forum within which there would be specific subforum for each payment stream where interchange is to be subject to regulation the mandate of the combined forum would be to consider and reach decision on the optimal ie welfare maximising level of interchange in respect of each of the relevant payment streams having regard inter alia to the way in which different payment streams may compete with each other the role of the subforums would be to consider and convey advice to the combined forum regar ding the optimal level of interchange from the separate point of view of each particular payment stream and its stakeholders decisions reached in the interchange forum need not set or modify the levels of interchange in all the relevant payment streams at the same time the sarb should appoint chairperson and deputy chairperson for the interchange forum these persons would also be responsible for convening and chairing the sub forums reasonable combination of independence and expertise or experience s hould be sought in these appointments participation in the interchange forum and its subforums should be open to all relevant stakeholders including for example merchants where relevant representative consumer organisations consumer protection authorities payment schemes and schem participants and other relevant payment service providers the npsd of the sarb as well as any payment system management body such as pasa should be informed of all meetings of the interchange forum and its subforums so as to be able to observe r participate in proceedings if it so wishes working procedures for the interchange forum and its subforums would have to be drawn up including provisions to ensure the submission of complete and accur ate information together with the protection of business information that firms may legitimately need to keep confidential from their competitors there should be restriction however on the public airing of different views and motivations regarding appropriate criteria methodolo gies and levels for interchange primary objective is to render the process of interchange setting as transparent as possible since divergent interests would be represented in the interchange forum nd its sub forums proceedings in each of the subforums could well give rise to conflic ting advice to the combined forum and consensus could well ultimately be lacking in the latter in our view the decisions in the interchange forum should be the decisions of the c hairperson or deputy in the absence of the chairperson duly recorded with reasons637 where 637 given that there will in fact not be democratic decision making in the interchange forum the setting out of reasons is chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 379 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information consensus exists and is recorded that would be reason enough the decision would simply express the consensus failing consensus the decision would have to be supported by adequate written reasons clear governance procedures should thus be established so as to allow for an orderly and expeditious process in the forums in which facts views and arguments are properly recorded and so that these can be adequately reflected in any reasons for decision which may ultimately have to be given there should also be an expeditious appeal procedure to tribunal appointed by the sarb but including at least one external independent adjudicator an appeal should be possible on grounds that the decision made is insufficiently supported by the reasons given for it in the interests of efficiency the appeal tribunal should also have power to revi ew and set aside procedural decisions and correct procedural omissions where fundamen tal failure of due process would otherwise result the appeal tribunal should be able either to remit an unsatisfactory decision to the chairperson for reconsideration or substitut its own decision with reasons where it has adequate information enabling it to do so at the conclusion of the process the sarb would bring the relevant interchange levels officially into operation by confirming the decisions reached in so doing the sar b would satisfy itself that the process has been duly carried out in compliance with the regulat ions or directives concerned 694 the methodology general criteria first among the decisions to be reached in the interchange forum woul d be the formulation of general criteria for the setting of interchange in payment streams which are to be subject to the regulatory process there would be need for subforums to debate this aspect separately unless particular criteria are thought to be streamspecific draft crit eria could be published to allow for comments to be more widely received after consideration by the interchange forum decision on the criteria would be arrived at again supported by reasons subject to appeal and subject to confirmation by the sarb apart from the decision on the general criteria and final decisions on the l evels of interchange to be applied it should not be necessary for the sarb to have to confir m each step or decision taken in the course of the interchangesetting process as it occurs its ability to observe and participate in the process should it so wish would enable it to indicate dissatisfaction at an early stage and advise remedial steps should the need for that arise essential moreover it captures the spirit of the countrys cons titution chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 380 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information among the general criteria should be the promotion and maintenance of effective competition both within and between payment streams for reasons extensively set out in this chapter above we consider that the objectives of competition are generally best secured by levels of interchange higher than is reasonably necessary to balance disproportions of cost and demand on the different sides of twosided market whereas hitherto business judgment profitmaximising judgment has been exercised in order to collectively optimise output by means of interchange in particular payment streams it should now be expected that the optimisation of the output of one payment stream visàvis other payment streams by means of uniform interchange would involve social valuejudgment ai med at welfareoptimising effects thus for example the replacement of cash with electronic and other paperless means of payment might legitimately be given weight as general objective in the interchangesetting process likewise the promotion of the use of debit ca rds by consumers and ending the privileged position of credit cards in payment trans actions for may also be an identified aim business judgment would now have to def end itself openly in forum concerned also with potentially divergent interests and wider social aims at the same time efficiency reliability profitability and the encouragement of modernisation and innovation within existing payment streams would surely constitute general cr iteria to be applied in evaluating appropriate levels of interchange638 the general criteria for the setting of interchange should be open to reconsideration if called for whenever the process of interchangesetting is repeated in any payment stream uniformity we have shown above why bilateral setting of interchange is in fact anticomp etitive639 and also why competition between card schemes would usually tend to raise or tain high interchange levels rather than bring them down accordingly in our view t here should be uniform level or levels of interchange compulsorily applicable on the same basis to all participants within the payment stream concerned save only that in the case of payment 638 639 visa for example has specifically put forward innovation as one of the strategic objectives involved in determining the appropriate rate of interchange visa june 2007 second submission d ocument b third part p 19

forum should in struct an independent third party with relevant experience and expertise to draw up and submit precise costing methodology in order to enable the disproportions in costs bet ween the issuing and acquiring or paying and collectingreceiving sides of the ma rket in each of the relevant payment streams and for each relevant means of payment or transaction type therein to be assessed641 this draft costing methodology would then be considered and debated in the interchange forum and could be referred back to the third party for further attention if necessary before becoming the subject of decision in the interchange forum if as seems like ly the appropriate costing methodology would differ for example in its relevant c ost categories between different payment streams and means of payment or transaction types then the need to involve particular subforums in considering and debating it would naturally arise in the event that the chairperson or deputy has to make the decision on the costing methodology in the absence of consensus and where reasons accordingly have to be given the decision would be subject to appeal we have indicated above why we consider that subset of issuing cos ts is not acceptable as proxy for use in the process of interchange setting as has hitherto been the ca with credit cards first it is altogether inadequate as means of determini ng the true disproportions of relevant costs on the two sides of the market second it subsumes int partial costing exercise on the one side of the market an alleged measure of the elasticity of 640 641 to ensure level playing field our recommendation of uniform c ap on interchange in each card payment stream is subject to one potential qualification which is addressed below independence here will obviously be relative the crucial requirement is that the entity concerned should not be financially interested in the outcome of the process transcri pt 19 april 2007 p 58 it should be independent of the issuing and acquiring institutions involved so that it can be ent rusted also with their confidential data in performing the costing exercise given the need for experience and expertise it i s probably inevitable that the entity concerned will have history of providing services to one or other of the card schemes and the expectation of continuing to do so whether in south africa or in other jurisdictions in these circumstances transparency becomes all the more important along with wide participation proper reporting open debate and informed decisionmaking in the interchange forum itself chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 382 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information demand on the other side not only have we found the justification advanced for this to be unconvincing and its true objective purpose to be objectionable it also simply disreg ards the need to evaluate the relative elasticities of demand on both sides of the market in order for the setting of necessary interchange to be properly carried out in any payment stream the costing methodology which is called for is one which assesses all relevant categories of costs incurred in supplying the payment service on both sides of the twosided market in each stream which categories are relevant and which are irrelevant is matter for recommendation by the independent third party and for debate in the interchan ge forum and subforums as we have explained above we do not consider that the costs of credit extension including the funding costs of the interest free or free funding period affor ded to credit card transactors are legitimately included in payment card interchange processing costs and the net costs of the payment guarantee to the extent that this is benefit truly provided by issuers and truly passed through to merchants are qualitatively different matter642 in our view it is the use of card as an effective means of payment that gives rise to the necessity and hence legitimacy of interchange in principle where fourpa rty schemes are concerned while the relevant cost categories may differ in detail as between debit ca rd and credit card interchange the principles for determining relevance would see m to us to be essentially the same it is as means of payment and not as means of credit extension that the credit card qualifies for interchange issuers costs of providing loyalty or frequentuser benefits to cardholders would so seem not to be legitimate component of interchange and indeed such costs are conventionally excluded from existing interchange calculations 643 642 643 we recognise that the payment guarantee is essential to the acceptance of card as means of payment and could legitimately be included among the costs relevant to interchange i t is at least arguable that the cost of the payment guarantee would include the cost of cardholder default this arises poten tially when in using the card to make payment the cardholder draws on credit facility of some kind that is invariably the case with credit card transactions but may also occur where debit cardholder draws on an overdraft faci lity in this connection the question arises as to the period within which default and with it the cost of default ght reasonably be regarded as relevant to interchange suitable period would need to be identified in order to prevent i nterchange being used to finance what is essentially the issuers lending business the cost of the payment guarantee i n the case of credit cards is commonly taken to include the cost to the issuer of default by borrowers during whatever free funding period the issuer allows but this period varies between countries and there is nothing logically sacrosanct about it clearly the longer the period the ss relevant the costs of the borrowers default becomes where payment card interchange is concerned nevertheless the inclusion of some part of the cost of cardholder default in interchange calculations would seem unobjectionable at least when as we go on to recommend the merchant is free to acc ept schemes debit cards or credit cards or both without being obliged either to accept its cards of all types or none at all for reasons discussed above however qualitatively different policy considerations come into play when the inclusion of costs in interchange setting is extended to the funding costs incurred by the issuerlender in providin g to its customers period of credit that is interestfree we do not regard such lending costs as legitimate component of interchange it is instructive nevertheless to find in 2005 study by datam onitor on the effects of the australian interchange reforms that lower interchange rates have been found to result in cutback of loyalty benefits or higher charges for providing them interchange in australia global implications supplied by visa june 2007 second submission document t card issuers have long used interchange revenues t fund loyalty schemes it is therefore surprise to see that the reforms have brought about raft of loyal ty scheme cut backs and fee increases id p 34 loyalty scheme access is now considerably more expensive id p 43 datamonitor also says that one of the outcomes of the interchange reforms has been to expedite the trend towards lowr ate cards which have limited or loyalty schemes consumers have lost out as result of higher fees for loyalty but have gained from greater competition at the low rate end of the market id pp 4344 chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 383 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in drawing up an appropriate costing methodology for consideration the indep endent third party should recommend the size and composition of the representative sample to be used for the cost study in our view the advantage of establishing and utilising wei ghted average costs rather than the costs of the most efficient firm on each side of the market is that the competitive incentive for firms to reduce their costs would be more likely t be stifled if firm could not retain the rewards of aboveaverage efficiencies but instead were to l ose those rewards automatically the next time interchange levels came to be evaluated we were informed that currently the costs incurred by card scheme p articipants while they vary considerably as between the issuing and acquiring sides do not vary signific antly as between the two major card schemes this is something the independent third part would have to confirm if correct it would mean that averaging of costing data as between participants in the two schemes would not give rise to major anomalies if in fact there are significant differences or if for example one scheme or both were to change appreciably the allocation of costs in terms of their rules as between the issuing and acquiring sides then it might well be necessary to change or set different interchang caps for them in order to take proper account of this and level the playing field the consequent cost study once the appropriate costing methodology has been finally formulated and formally decided upon the interchange forum through its chairperson or deputy would inst ruct the independent third party to carry out cost study accordingly participants in t he relevant payment streams would be required to submit cost data to the independent th ird party on confidential basis the latter would check and interrogate the data supplied by pa rticipants to ensure accuracy and consistency another independent entity should be engaged to audit the calculations that have been made with the collected data as well as ran dom audit of data supplied644 the independent third party which has conducted the cost study would the n submit the results to the interchange forum these would need to be accompanied by calculations showing the effect that different rates of interchange would be likely to have n ultimate average net costs on each side of the market and advice as to whether interchange should be applied in each stream or to each means of payment or transaction type at flat rate or on an ad valorem basis 644 cf mastercard october 2006 first submission 163 ne method adopted by mastercard to verify the integrity of the data collected and utilised in the cost study is to ensure tha t edc maintain an audit trail of all documentation received this audit trail makes it possible for participating m embers to trace the reported cost revenue and statistical data back to their source detailed documentation of source data is devel oped by customer banks during the data collection process in order that reported cost revenue and sta tistical data may be traced back to its source chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 384 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information all recommendations and calculations by the independent third party once formally submitted to the interchange forum should also be made available to the genera l public in the interests of transparency and to encourage public awareness of and confidence in the process assessment of demand elasticities and application of general criteria objective methods of assessing demand elasticities on both sides of the ma rket in each relevant payment stream or for each means of payment or transaction type should be adopted if they can feasibly be devised in order to assist the eventual judgment proces s in the interchange forum and its subforums that judgment process as alrea dy indicated would be aimed at achieving optimal levels of interchange in accordance with the general criteria previously established recommendations should be made by the independent third party in this regard to the extent that it is possible to do so consideration could also be given to whether different interchange rates should apply to different types of merchants or segments of the market within payment stream to the extent that it proves impossible or unreasonably difficult to establish objectively the relative elasticities of demand the judgment process itself will have to suf fice in this regard guided mainly by experience the interchange forum in exercising its own judgment would have to take carefully into account the implications of any shift from existing vels of interchange in any payment stream and would need to consider calculations estimates and recommendations by the independent third party in this regard the interchange forum would not be bound by any recommendation of the independent third party where appropriate the implications of particular proposal arising in the interchange forum r its subforums could be referred by the chairperson or deputy to the independent third pa rty for an assessment of its implications before decision is adopted decision on interchange levels as outlined above the decision of the interchange forum would be made by the chairperson or deputy as the case may be either on the basis of consensus or failing consensus on the basis of reasons given the decision would then be subject to possible appeal and to ultimate confirmation by the sarb upon confirmation and publication of the decision the interchange levels so determined would apply in the payment streams concerned until duly altered by subsequent interchangesetting process conducted in due course the consensus during the enquiry has been that review every two or three ye ars would be sufficient in australia the costing process for the setting of interchange is carr ied out every chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 385 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information three years in our view this seems adequate and could be laid down as the norm in particular case if the independent third party has so advised and the interchan ge forum so decided shorter period could be determined at the time when the level of interch ange is set in any event however there should be provision allowing the regulator to invoke review at an earlier time in respect of any payment stream or streams if it appea rs that material change in circumstances has occurred cost of the process it may be anticipated that the process outlined above will especially at the outset be intensive timeconsuming and costly once the relevant procedures have been laid down the necessary appointments made and the methodology established and tes ted the process can be expected to become more efficient and streamlined over time subject to what is said below stakeholders participating in the interchange forum and its subforums should bear their own costs incurred in doing so including their ow n costs incurred in any appeal participants in payment streams who are required to submit cost data to the independent third party should likewise have to bear their own expenses in doing so however the costs of establishing and operating the interchange forum and its subforums the costs connected with the appointment of the chairperson and deputy and the cost s of engaging the independent third party and auditor should in our view be seen as public expense645 if these costs were to be borne directly by banks card schemes or other powerful participants then the suspicion would inevitably arise in the pub lic mind that he who pays the piper calls the tune whether public funds duly expended for this purpose could and should be recovered by levies on participating entities which are involved in receiving or paying interchange revenue is matter for consideration by the authorities concerned moreover it may be necessary to fund the participation of appropriat and relevant consumer bodies 695 avoiding negative c onsequences of regulation we appreciate and this has been emphasised especially by mas tercard646 that the regulation of interchange can potentially have negative unintended consequences two categories of possible consequences require particular consideration the effect of regulation on competition between threeparty and fourparty schemes and the effect of regulati on on 645 646 and for example administered by the sarb or the national treasu ry see eg transcript 18 april 2007 pp 3538 exhibit mm s lide 18 exhibit bbb slides 12 13 and also mastercards published critique on the rbas regulatory intervention in aus tralia insights mastercard worldwide first quarter 2007 although it would not be directly affected by the regulation of interchange american express likewise warned in its submission october 2006 p 9 against regulatory intervention chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 386 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information innovation the effect on competition between threeparty and fourparty schemes it is suggested that threeparty schemes such as american express and diners club in respect of which there is explicit interchange and which would thus be unaffected by the regulation of interchange could gain an undue advantage over their fourpart rivals if for example so the argument goes interchange levels affecting the fourparty schemes were to be brought down as result of the regulatory process the threepa rty schemes could still maintain their intrachange or implicit subsidy from the acquiring side to the issu ing side at existing levels and so provide greater benefits to cardholders for compara ble issuing fees than the issuing participants in the fourparty schemes could afford more banks would be inclined to become issuers of the threeparty cards under licensing arrangem ents the three party schemes would therefore be able to grow their market share at the four party schemes expense perverse and anticompetitive consequence of regulation in order to address the problem rationally it is necessary first to examine its assumptions and also strip away the elements of special pleading which overlay the manner in wh ich it is expressed just as the interchange in fourparty schemes is financed ultimately by the merchant service charges levied by the institutions participating on the acquiring side so the intrachange of the threeparty schemes is financed by the merchant service charges which these schemes themselves levy our analysis earlier in this chapter has shown that the premium benefits provided to cardholders in the threeparty schemes are financed to th extent that there is reliance on intrachange by way of premium merchant service charges insofar as the threeparty schemes have to compete with the fourparty schemes for merchant s willing to accept their cards their merchant service charges must retain relation to the rough benchmark of comparative merchant service charges generally applicable within the far larger fourparty schemes higher merchant service charge than the norm would thus generally have to be justified by higher value of benefits to the merchant fro m accepting the threeparty scheme card if the process which we have outlined of arriving at appropriate levels of interc hange to be applied to the fourparty card schemes is carried out effectively if the imbalances in issuing and acquiring costs as well as the differing elasticities of demand on the issuing and acquiring sides of the market are reliably assessed then the new comparative benchmark of merchant service charges resulting in the fourparty schemes should be rationa l one producing few if any anomalies in time competition between the schemes should then cause the merchant service charges of the threeparty schemes to be brought again into relationship with the fourparty chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 387 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information merchant service charges so that any threeparty premium again has to be justified by additional benefits to merchants it would be different if appreciable market power could be exercised and sustained by threeparty schemes over merchants but at present it is most unlikely that it could assuming that interchange levels were to come down in say the cre dit card payment stream as result of the regulatory process it is likely that there would be period in which the threeparty schemes could take advantage of merchant inertia by continuin g to levy their merchant service charges at or relatively nearer to the existing level that appea rs to have happened initially in australia but if in accordance with the recognised purpose in adjusting interchange the merchant service charges in the fourparty schem were to come down significantly in consequence of lower interchange rates the n pressure on the threeparty schemes to reduce their merchant service charges or increase their benefits to merchants for the same charges should follow in the interim the perverse consequence entailed in the advantage that could be t aken by the threeparty schemes as interchange levels come down would be the result of more fundamental perversity namely that the preexisting rates of interchange had been collectively applied within the fourparty schemes at level above the neces sary one implying the extraction of supracompetitive profits within those schemes c orrecting the more fundamental perversity assuming there is one which falls to be corrected by the lowering of interchange should not be held back by fears of resulting temporary anomalies the suggestion that the threeparty schemes should also be subjected to regulation in this area is not one that we can accept they do not have interchange their intrachange is matter of applying revenue to different costs within single firm and of t hat firms own pricing to its cardholding and merchant customers respectively to regulate int rachange in these firms at this stage would effectively require nothing less than the regulatio n of merchant service charges that is not recommended however as the threeparty schemes develop the authorities including the competition commission should keep an eye on the situation one may expect that their competitors will do the same if their licensing arrange ments were to evolve so that whatever the form of things there is in substance transfer of revenue between different firms in order to use one firms revenue from the acquir ing side to subsidise another firms issuing then something akin to fourparty sche will have been developed in that event the adaptation of the regulatory process to include them would have to be considered the effect of regulation on innovation we have addressed this above recommending that where innovations occur in the form of new methods of payment including the introduction of new types of payme nt cards interchange could where interchange is necessary be established for them initially by chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 388 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information private arrangements without immediately facing regulatory control the regulatory process would be invoked as and when the development of the new means of payment so takes hold that competition andor consumer protection concerns aris in connection with the interchange arrangements so far as existing means of pay ment are concerned the flexibility of the interchangesetting methodology which we have proposed the use of weightedaverage costs as criterion and the possibility of invoking the process for reviewing interchange levels when new circumstances arise should allow for and indeed encourage improvements the process provides mechanism for the setting of interchange in all payment streams where interchange is deemed necessary and provides framework within which interchange for new payment mechanisms can be assessed and applied it allows for the avoidance of situation where innovators are disadvantaged by the pricin g decisions of incumbents in certain pch and the setting of interchange below sustainable levels647 the possibility which would be open to the fourparty schemes of introducing new t ypes of cards including premium cards initially outside of the regulated interchange process should also assist in ensuring level playing field in this regard between them and the three party schemes it is important to ensure however that this latitude does not open the way for evasion of interchange regulation the critical requirements here must be that the new card is not introduced and issued simply as replacement however modified for an existing card currently subject to interchange regulation but has to be separately applied for by cardholders and b that the merchant has complete freedom whether or not to s ign up for the acceptance of the new card on separate and distinct basis if any aspect of the honour all cards rule were to be applied by scheme or any of its participants so as to constrain the merchant who accepts card that is subject to the regulation of interchange also to accept the new card then the new card should b included automatically under the regulatory regime should the new card indepe ndently come to be issued and accepted masse it would soon enough become candidate for inclusion in the regulatory process in its own right 610 other rules of the schemes 6101 the honour all cards rule the honour all cards rule is often abbreviated in the submissions as the c rule or the hacr 647 concerns related to current pricing practices affecting innovation are f urther discussed in the chapter on access to the payment system chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 389 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mastercard worldwide explains that the hac rule stated that if merchant participates in the mastercard system it must accept all mastercardbranded cards the rule ensured that consumers have th ability to choose their preferred method of payment at the point of sale in fact many ne tworks that offer payment cards including mastercard visa and american express have honour all cards rules648 mastercard internationals merchant rules manual revised 7 april 2006 which was submitted to the enquiry provides excerpts from mastercard bylaws and rules published in april 2005649 these include that each participating merchant must accept mastercard cards universally650 and that the merchant must honor all valid mastercard cards without discrimination when properly presented for payment651 as to the comparable maestro rules see maestro global rules published july 2005652 mastercard has confirmed that these rules allow merchants to accept either all mastercard cards or all maestro cards or both as they wish653 however that would still oblige the merchant who accepts mastercard credit cards also to accept all mastercardbranded signaturebased debit or cheque c ards hybrid cards visas general rule in this regard is as follows if merchant decides to participate in the visa internation network the hacr obliges the merchant to accept all visa cards equally654 visas international operating regulations lay down that merchant must acc ept all cards properly presented for payment as specified in table 41 655 the effect of the table is to include inter alia all visa and visa electron cards in the hacr these provisions to the extent that they are not subject to exceptions applicable in various jurisdictions combine into one rule what we would rather separate for purposes of analysis into two rules namely an honour all products rule and an honour all cards rule in the narrower sense of all scheme cards of the same product type taking the hac rule in its narrower sense we consider it to be legitimate the positive network effects of payment card systems have been discussed above the schemes exist precisely to maintain and develop such networks the benefits to cardhold ers of being able to carry and rely on using card instead of cash are obviously fundamental to the viability of 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655

bank to pay the particular acquirer and not choose whether or not to enter into and honour transactions depending on the ident ity of the merchant or the acquiring bank etc 6102 the honour all products rule the matter is different however with the honour all products rule this rule in our opinion facilitates the accumulation of market power by sche mes and their participants over merchants in principle we consider that it constitutes anticompet itive product bundling or tying for which necessity exists it obliges the rchant who wishes to accept card of one type under the particular scheme to accept car ds of other types also notwithstanding that the latter may cost the merchant more on account of higher merchant service charge per transaction resulting from higher interchange rate657 in south africa interchange hitherto has varied only according to whether the ca rd is pin based debit card credit card or hybrid card658 in future however there could be different interchange rates for premium credit cards for example the introducti on of the emv card may also bring with it different interchange rates659 in our view where different interchange rate is applicable to the type of card the merchant should have choice whether or not to sign up for the acceptance of that card and so be obliged to honour all cards within the accepted card type660 the honour all products

which merchants can choose to accept mastercardbranded credit cards but not mastercardbranded deb it cards some consumers may get to the front of the checkout line and find that the merchant rejects the payment option they have chosen while this could impact consumer s ability to choose their preferred method of payment mastercard is confident that because of the strength of the mastercard brand and the value proposition it brings to merc hants and consumers the vast majority of merchants will continue to choose to accept mastercar dbranded debit cards if consumer finds that after january 2004 merchant rejects his her mastercardbranded debit cards the consumer has several options first the consumer can cho ose store that welcomes the mastercard debit card alternatively the consumer can utilize mastercard credit card or other form of payment finally the consumer can expres s hisher opinion that the merchant should offer their customers the broadest choice of payments by accepting mastercard debit cards in south africa the elimination of the honour all products rule would seem most lik ely to facilitate the acceptance of debit cards by completely freeing the acc eptance of

july 2005 is to similar effect chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 393 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information discounts or other incentives extends beyond payments in cash to include rival networks payment cards666 it is argued that the rule against surcharging is necessary to sustain the honour all cards rule667 there seems to be merit in this argument at least so far as the legitimate am bit of the honour all cards rule ie in its sense of cards of the same product type is concerned at first sight this view may seem to lack foundation inasmuch as merc hants who have signed up to accept scheme cards do not widely use surcharging where it is allowed668 for example there has been only small incidence of surcharging by merchants in australia669 however it stands to reason that consumers will tend to be deterred both from taking cards and from attempting to use them once issued where surcharging is kno wn to be real possibility as visa puts it670 even though surcharging where it is permitted may affect only min ority of transactions it can still have profound effects on the reputation and reliability of the payment card system which can consequently lead to reduction in the number of cardholder s andor card usage in particular as cardholders will tend to blame the system and not the merchant if they are surcharged one recent example of the impact of abolishing surcharging rules is the experience in denmark following changes to the danish payment act which permitted f rom 1 january 2005 charging only capped msc to merchants and to surcharge dankort the danish national debit system transactions the total number of dankort transactions fell fr om 42 m illion in january 2004 to 33 million transactions in january 2005 following the introduction of surcharging similarly the average number of dankort transactions per card fell from 175 in 2004 to 167 in 2005 due to customers fears of being surcharged due to opposition from cardholders preelection debate created political pressure to change t he legislation again with the result that surcharging has not been allowed on dankort transact ions since march 2005 and on any danish issued card since june 2005 although the danish competition authority estimated that only approxima tely 19 per cent of mainly the very large merchants initially surcharged in denmark the effec t on cardholders across the board was substantial as it resulted in the loss of certainty for cardholders that payment card could be used anywhere which accepted that particular payme nt card without penalty or unpleasant surprises and consequently without damage to the payment cards reputation in australia however where far smaller percentage of merchants engaged in surcharging after the rule against surcharging was prohibited see above negativ effect on card issuing and usage has not so far been shown during our hearings absa indicated that

chapter 6 payment cards and interchange 394 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information surcharging rules671 however it would not want merchants to be able to surcharge in excess of the merchants service charge when accepting payment by card672 in our view it would not be practicable to have to track and enforce such limits the rules against surcharging should either stay or go generally we do not consider that there is sufficient reason in the public interest to prohibit such rules because of price coherence and the cost to merchants of price differentiation the freedom to surcharge would not provide adequate protection for merchants and end consumers against the abuse of interchange setting by the schemes and their participating banks thus the abolition of the surcharge rule in and of itself would be of little use as remedy if on the other hand the honour all products rule is eliminated and if the setting of interchange is subjected to an independent objective and transparent proces s under regulatory supervision as we recommend then the continued existence of the surcharge rule can do little if any harm at least in domestic transactions indeed there are positive reasons for maintaining the rule surcharging where permitted has mostly been utilised by large merchants rather than smaller ones or by merchants having market power over customers as device for extracting additional revenue we find the following submission by visa persuasive experience has shown that customers are most likely to be surcharged where they are captive cardusing customers captive cardusing customer is one who on particular buying occasion does not have ready access either to nonsurcharg ed means of payment such as cash or to cardaccepting merchant who is not levying surcharge the high cost to cardholders is particularly onerous where merchants taking advantage of the fact that the customer may have choice but to pay with payment card seek to make profit from surcharging by imposing surcharge with reference to what it costs the merchant to accept the card foreign and outoftown consumers are those likel to be most at risk with the increasing influx of tourists to south africa and as 2010 appro aches the argument for retaining the nosurcharge rule as measure of consumer protection appears all the stronger although international interchange rates would not be subjec t to the regulated domestic process which we recommend we would advise caution at this stage over any attempt to interfere with the schemes

contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 397 71 introduction and synopsis the arrangements networks and institutions associated with making payment s are typically referred to collectively as the national payment system historically the payment system is privileged space of banks because banks are the principal if not the only providers of transaction accounts and of payment instruments and services to individual customers and firms particularly privileged are the clearing banks for they alone are permitted to clear and to settle payment instructions where the customer of one bank makes payment t the customer of another bank1 clearing involves the verification and calculation of banks obligations to each other arising from such payment instructions and the issuing of resulting settlement instructions to the central bank settlement involves the discharge of the banks obligations to each other typically by means of credits and debits to the accounts which the clearing banks have at the central bank nonclearing banks do not share this privilege and have to rely on clearing banks to provide clearing and settlement services on their behalf the organisation of the payment system takes into account the fact that th payer and the payee may not bank at the same bank if they do bank at the same bank then clearing and settlement do not arise the process of verification and calculation takes place inhouse and payment is effected by means of book adjustment within that bank if the payer and payee bank at different banks clearing house and settlement institution typica lly central bank will be involved our interest is mainly in those situations where the banks of the payer and payee have to interact to complete the payment process in recent years technological innovations have created opportunities for the outsourcing of payment activities and for the direct entry of nonbanks into the payment arena the extent to which these opportunities have been realised within any country is an ou tcome of number of factors not least of which is t hat the provision of some payment services is intrinsically linked to the provision of deposit accounts moreover in most cou ntries the specific legislation and regulation which governs banking and deposit taking sets banks apart in spite of technological innovations the participation of nonbank provi ders in the payment system is far from resolved in this chapter possibilities for enhancing the access of nonbanks and noncl earing banks to the south africa national payment system nps are explored ac cess to the nps means different things to different stakeholders but as we shall see the crux of the matter is who and under what conditions can clear and settle payment instructions of various kinds 1 further distinctions within the category of clearing banks are d iscussed below banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 398 the banking enquiry is interested in access to the extent that barriers may prevent the effective and competitive provision of payment services to consumers as can be seen from the terms of reference of the enquiry in particular the subject matter of the enquiry includes the feasibility of improving access by nonbanks and wouldbe banks to th national payments system infrastructure so that they can compete more ffectively in providing payment services to consumers furthermore one of the objects of the enquiry is to engage with the banks and other providers of payment services the appropri ate regulatory authorities and other stakeholders in order to ascertain the extent to which consistent with the soundness of the banking and payments system there could realisti cally be improvements in the conditions affecting competition in th relevant markets including increased access to the national payments infrastructure when considering the need for improved access to the nps it is important to kee p in mind three connected questions access to what access by whom access to what end answering the first question requires an analysis of the various roles and func tions carried out within the payment system as it is now developing answering the second question involves considering who in addition to participant s currently permitted in the system would be able to participate effectively in performing th ose roles and functions if criteria for access were to be changed an answer to t he second question implies appropriate selection criteria and is in this way linked to the third question answering the third question requires considering the advantages and the dangers inherent in changes to the access regime on the one hand the concern is to remove unnecessary restrictions on access on the other hand it must be to ensure and promote the qualit rather than merely the quantity of increased participation an emphasis on the pos itive regulation of access and participation in the payment system is thus required in this chapter the accent falls on the access that firms banks and nonbank instituti ons have to the payment system as service prov iders that this type of access has implications for consumer access to financial services in general is obvious but matters related to such general consumer access are not the focus here essentially those institutions which have direct access to the payment sys tem are the ones with access to clearing and settlement activity at present they have to be banks over and banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 399 above that they have to be clearing banks however other institutions are vyi ng to enter the payment arena should the criteria for entry be broadened to include entities t hat are not banks should the institutions simply be told that if they wish to participate have access they must first become clearing banks issues of access are thus intimately related to issues about barriers to entry at pres ent if an institution wishes to become member of the payment system it will ve to become clearing bank from the viewpoint of the regulator the south african rese rve bank sarb the process of erecting and maintaining barriers to entry is by means arbitrary the idea is to provide an efficient payment system free from systemic risk the analysis takes into account the distinction between banks as registered deposittaking institutions and other institutions involved in various aspects of the payment system as the following excerpts reveal the importance and strengths of the current payment system is commonly recognised mr jordaan of fnb south africa does have world class national payment system which does not mean it cant be improved but it is something that we as banks and we as south africans can be proud of 2 mr von zeuner of absa i would like to get to the thr ee areas that the technical committee has pointed out to us but i think just before getting there and possibly just stating the obvious the importance of the national payment system particularly to uphold what we believe is world class banking system this payment syste m surely is one that is for the benefit of all south africans3 the enquiry has led us however to conclude that the regulation of the south african payments system has fallen behind best practice as it is developing internationally this conclusion stems from evidence that regulation is failing to adequately address the changes in payment services provision which are resulting from technological change new payment streams and the increasing provision of paymentrelated services by nonbanks while our payments system is technically advanced the structure of our access and regulatory regime remains locked in the past and rests too much on the laurels of past successes as the chapter will show the result is that reluctant and inadequate adaptations are made i n this area whereas in australia and europe for example the regulatory authorit ies have taken major initiatives to restructure their access policy to meet the challenges of technological innovation and change and to foster competitive dynamics this regula tory conservatism which prevails even though the exclusion of nonbanks has been shown to be unnecessary for the maintenance of stability and effective management of risk has serious implications for competition and needs to be fundamentally reconsidered in the light of more advanced regulatory practices taking hold elsewhere 2 transcript 28 may 2007 p 2 3 transcript 25 may 2007 p 64 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 400 much of the discussion that follows emphasises the distinction between those participants that are permitted to clear and settle clearing banks and those participant s that are not permitted to do so in order to set the scene for this discussion few definitional issues need to be addressed in south africa clearing is often referred to as the exchange of payment instructions given that this is how it is defined in the national payment system act nps act 78 of 1998 however this definition falls short of the bank for international settlements bis definition that clearing is the process of transmitting reconciling and in some cases confirming payment orders or security transfer instructions prior to settlement4 as the bis has it clearing includes all of this as well as possibly the netting of instructions and the establishment of final positions for settlement5 settlement is the act that discharges obligations in respect of funds or securities transfers between two parties settlement typically takes place via the transfer of fun ds between the clearing banks through their accounts at the central bank this settlement effectively encompasses settlement at payerpayee level as the successful settlement at int erbank level is associated with the transfer of funds between individual accounts at different banks clearing and settlement are related activities the former ensures the c alculation and transmission of obligations and the latter involves the discharge of those obligations hence it is surprise that they are typically referred to as single activity clearing banks are banks that clear and settle in the bis definition and indeed in practice in south africa and elsewhere clearing encompasses broad range of activities take for instance payment serv ice provider like bureau that collects payment instructions from third parties such as small businesses that have monthly debit orders against the accounts of customers for gardening or cleaning services and transmits these into the payment system via system operator such service provider is engaged at least in part in clearing even although the bureau is not exchanging payment instructions as per the nps act the mere transmis sion of such instructions is part of the process of clearing in south africa where clearing and settlement are restricted to clearing banks such activity by bureau must be done under the auspices of clearing bank 4 bis cpss 2003 glossary of terms used in payments and settleme nt systems p 13 5 while clearing is often associated with netting in the sout h african nps there is netting in the clearing activit as each transaction is separately recorded and aggregated in terms of each clearing banks position against the other gross obligations are hence calculated for settlement this allows tr ansactions to be tracked with greater ease through the system in south africa the clearing house is responsib for the establishment of the final gross positions for settlement visàvis each bank in each stream banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 401 in the same way the dominant payment clearing house pch system operator bankserv is also involved in clearing because it has been appointed by two or more clearing banks in each retail payment stream6 as pch system operator bankserv is the institution which receives and transmits retail payment instructions from different payment streams such as atms and payment cards when more than one bank is involved this position makes it the ideal candidate to calculate the obligations of clearing banks in all the relevant payment streams which it does on continuous basis and transmits the gross obligations to the settlement system of the sarb in the lowvalue or retail stre ams settlement takes place on delayed basis at specific time or times of the day the examples above show that while the act of clearing and settlement is legally the preserve of clearing banks in south africa others may be involved however this involvement is predicated on such others operating under the auspices of one or more clearing banks as the discussion below will reveal the debate centres around whether such lega l privilege is justified and whether or not technical access under the auspices of the clearing banks sufficiently stimulates competition and innovation in the payment system the discussion below is organised along the following lines section 72 provides an introduction to the importance of the payment system and presents brief historical overview of the payment instruments the discussion sets out the risks that can aris in the payment system and distinguishes between high and lowvalue payment strea ms in general highvalue payments are more likely to generate systemic settlement risk where one bank fails to honour its financial obligations resulting from payments instruct ions than lowvalue payments for this reason highvalue payments are typically processed in real time through the central banks settlement system lowvalue payments like cheque payments atm transactions electronic fund transfers efts and credit and bit card purchases are defined as such in terms of some value threshold in south afri ca all payment transactions below r500 000 are seen as low value payments7 these are settled on deferred basis at specific time or times of the day section 73 focuses on international approaches to the regulation of clearing and settlement in retail payment systems the discussion shows that several countries are mov ing towards functional rather than institutional based approach to regulation in t he payment system this means that the function performed by firm rather than its institutional iden tity is the more important issue in its regulatory treatment this approach has allowed countrie s such 6 the card pch agreements allow for more than one pch system operat or to be appointed if participants so choose 7 for cheques values up to r5 million fall into the retail cate gory see section 74 for more detail banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 402 as australia to define explicit access regimes for nonbanks into clear ing and settlement activity alike section 74 provides an overview of the south african payment system including the participants regulatory structure and payment streams details as to how t he high and low value payment streams are processed are provided data is presented that shows that all the lowvalue streams together account for less than 10 per cent of the value fl owing through the nps this means that in general lowvalue payments streams hold fa r less inherent risk than high value streams section 75 presents the current regulatory and legislative framework in south africa the status quo supports the exclusive access of banks to the clearing and settle ment arena and the selfregulatory structure means that clearing banks set the operational rules of each payment stream although the national payments system department npsd retains oversight of the payments system the section sets out the prevailing regulatory models for participation by clearing banks and points out that these models do not in fact reflect the realities of the participation of exempted institutions like the postbank and ithala which are excluded or exempted from the application of the banks act inadequate regulatory treatment of such institutions may well increase risk within the system which more developed and active regulatory approach to access would serve to reduce other non banks which introduce transactions under the auspices of clearing banks are also not adequately regulated and monitored the discussion shows the need for better quality of access where all those permitted access are effectively regulated it also shows that there is little in the new nps governance structure that deals with the inadequate nd piecemeal regulation of nonbanks section 76 considers particular matters of concern related to the nps the key concerns relate to the conservatism in the regulatory approach which relies on its existing approach of preserving clearing and settlement activity as the privilege of clearing banks whe re there are exceptions to this like postbank and ithala such arrangements present facto challenge to the one recorded in law but there are also concerns raised about the access of smaller banks and the discrimination between large and small clearing banks with t he latter encountering additional barriers to entry the discussion further shows that the approach to nonbanks in terms of the recently issued directives does not provide an adequate framework for their regulation moreover since pasas membership continu to be confined essentially to clearing banks and since pasa will be enforcing the direct ives they ultimately entrench the power of the clearing banks over their nonbank competitors section 77 focuses on one of the matters brought to the attention of the enquiry multiple acquiring and sorting at source while the latter has been presented as m echanism to improve access we do not find it so banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 403 the final section provides concluding remarks and recommendations 72 importance of the payment system and historical overview much like power supply the importance of the payment system is often onl obvious at time of failure for this reason it is nec essary to spell out how the payment system affects the daily lives of all individuals and firms for an economic system to function properly payment system is required s that buyers can pay sellers for goods and services in its most familiar form notes and coins oper ate as payment stream allowing for the physical exchange of cash for goods and rvices as economies and technologies have developed payment instruments have evolved s that for example cheque is paper payment instrument which under certain circumstances can be used as substitute for notes and coins the means of payment may inc lude electronic fund transfers such as debit orders for standing obligations or onceoff bill payments and debit and credit card transactions all of these payment instruments allow for pa yment and settlement of financial obligations different payment instruments give rise to different payment streams f or which rules are generally set in terms of operations item limits and so on by the participating payment system members the rules relating to operation of payment stream are determined by the members of the respective payment clearing houses pchs as payment instruments have evolved so have the systems for clearing and settlement between banks on behalf of their account holders the speed efficiency and seamlessness of payment system structures mean for inst ance that municipal account can be paid by means of an internet banking instruction or by means of credit card and the customer has the assurance that the municipality has received it and attributed it to the correct account even though the process may take several days to complete 721 security efficiency and accuracy of the payment system regulatory authorities raise the importance of security efficiency and acc uracy in the payment system to underpin consumer confidence in the system thes features give consumers reason to believe that payment instructions from their bank to another bank have been settled and have gone through to completion at account level nce so instructed while for the most part payment instructions can be reissued if they fail th ere may be crucial missed opportunities for example in the case of equity purchase or sale or crucial chain of events set in motion by the failure of payment instructions for examp an individual may believe that he has paid all outstanding traffic fines at his banks tm but be arrested for nonpayment of fines the following evening in road block clearly the failure banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 404 of payment instructions to go to completion can have harmful negative effects on individuals and firms and ultimately the performance of the economy as mr shuter of nedbank set out during the hearing on 29 may 2007 there has been quite lot of talk around confidence stability and i ntegrity i think the only slight nuance we would like to bring into the discussion is that obviously what the system really requires is trust faith for end users to be comfortable that if they present card at merchant their confidential information will not be stored they will be set tled and that if they provide payment details to somebody else only those amounts will be drawn off their account so trust is very very important for the system to operate efficien tly and i think the point is that the existing regulatory framework has accommodated that8 if the payment system were vulnerable to security breach or if it were inefficient or inaccurate the public would lose faith in dematerialised payment streams and revert to notes and coins this would introduce transaction costs into the payment activity and w ould not be optimal by contrast efficient and secure payment systems enhance the transparenc of transactions lower transaction costs improve operational efficiency of trade an d commerce and provide support to the globalisation of the economy this can ultimately improve the quality of living for the population 722 risk and the payment system systemic risk in payment system if one bank fails to honour the financial obligations resulting from the payment instructions during the course of day the net position of other banks ma be so compromised that clearing and settlement fail this is known as systemic risk and typically arises because one partys failure to pay can cause others also to fail to pay whe n due the classic case in banking is where the failure of one bank can lead to run on other banks pushing them into illiquidity and even in some extreme cases ins olvency hence liquidity risk where participant cannot settle in full when the obligation is due but only at some unspecified time later can lead to credit risk where the participant is ultim ately unable to settle in full whether at the specified time or any other9 this can lead to losses in the real economy through both direct and indirect effects directly because payments have been delayed or have not been effected at all and indirectly 8 transcript 29 may 2007 pp 140141 9 although in practice the two forms of risk may be difficul t to distinguish from each other bis cpss 2000 p 11 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 405 because failure of one participant has caused losses among one or other participant10 if participant and the payment system itself becomes illiquid then the remaining participants may be open to losses based on their positions visàvis the insolvent pa rty and one or more could even themselves be rendered insolvent efficient and reliable payment systems contribute to overall financial sys tem stability by providing the certainty associated with settlement and completion of transactions settlement is an act that discharges obligations in respect of funds or securities transfers the case of securities settlement system between two or more parties in national payment system the central bank generally acts as the settlement institution the paying and receiving institutions typically clearing banks which in turn provide accounts and payment services to their own customers are both direct participants in the payment system and hold accounts at the settlement institution11 settlement takes place by means of book entries at the central bank with both paying and receiving banks having accounts at that institution it is effected by debit from the account of the paying bank and credit to the account of the receiving bank both clearing banks are reliant on the settlement institutions the central banks operational soundness the larger the value and volume of payments the institution settles the more importan t are its creditworthiness and operational reliability12 in payment settlement systems highvalue or wholesale payments are typically view ed as systemically important individual lowvalue or retail payment streams d not typically pose an immediate threat to systemic stability because of their smaller values for this reason the realtime high value clearing and settlement systems around the world tend t be owned and operated by central banks in contrast within lowvalue payment s treams there is extensive use of private sector systems for transactions processing and clearing although the settlement institution for the most part remains the central bank the mechanisms procedures and technology to ensure that the payment sys tem does not fail in both clearing and in settlement are high on the agenda of the regulat ory

bank in terms of assets in south africa at the time banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 406 systemwide risks the bank of england uses the phrase systemwide risks for those risks that do not immediately pose systemic risk or threaten financial stability but may still cause system wide disruption systemwide risks include operational risks where system operator or co re infrastructure provider is unable to process payments as consequence of human error or breakdown in systems and business risks where provider of infrastructure fails financi ally and can longer operate as going concern14 operational risk is the risk of incurring financial loss because of various types of human or technical error this can range from having one terminal down for few m inutes because of telecommunications failure to whole authorising system for card payments fa iling for few hours or longer fraud risk is the risk that wrongful or criminal deception will lead to financial s for one of the parties involved examples range from forging signature on payment instruction such as cheque to obtaining access to the computer of financial institution der false identity from remote location legal risk arises when the rights and obligations of parties in the payment system are subject to the uncertainty that participants bankruptcy may mean that the multilateral arrangements between clearing members and the clearing organisation will not be upheld under national law15 various risk reduction measures may be used even in retail systems including the us of antifraud technologies system controls and standards for technical features of payment instruments16 and the appropriate legal foundations to reduce the advent of such risks importance of highvalue vs lowvalue payment streams lowvalue payment systems and instruments are significant contributors to the financial system as they facilitate commerce and support consumer confidence in the medi um of exchange lowvalue payments are made in large numbers by trans actors and are the ones most consumers and firms are familiar with in purchasing goods and services 14 bank of england 2006 p 8 15 bis cpss 2000 p 10 16 id banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 407 while most ubiquitous the value of the flows through lowvalue payment str eams is small in comparison with highvalue streams in south africa for example all the lowvalue streams together account for less than 10 per cent of the value flowing though the payme nt system lowvalue payment systems tend to include wide range of payment instruments such as cash cheques electronic funds transfers and payment cards facilitated through different payment streams such as atms the internet cellular telephony point of s ale devices and so on but up to certain threshold amounts by definition high value payment streams are those that carry higher systemic ris k and hence tend to be processed in realtime for example in south africa the real time line is facility for settling singlesettlement instructions immediately on gross basis currently all credit transactions exceeding r5 million must be processed through this facility and electronic fund transfers above certain value will fall into the highvalue stream from the perspective of risk associated with clearing and settlement lowvalue payment systems are generally deemed to be of less systemic importance than the highvalue streams17 for this reason the bis through its committee on payment and settlement systems cpss typically distinguishes between systemically important payment systems sips and lowvalue payment systems and the relevant oversight and regulation in each case this will be the focus of the discussion in section 73 73 the regulation of clearing and settlement at the risk of oversimplifying things for most payments to oc cur three elements must exist the first is that there must be store of value that can be access ed the second is that there needs to be system for exchanging payment instructions between institut ions sometimes loosely referred to as clearing arrangements and third there needs to be settlement system whereby value is moved from one account to another in the world of few decades ago all three functions main taining the store of value developing and running messaging and processing systems and having access to settlement systems were almost always the exclusive preserve of banks the world of payments was the world of banks and that was that this was reflected in the view that it was only banks that could be allowed into the inner sanctum of the payments process the settlement accounts at the central bank in some countries including my own this idea led to legislative restrictions on the type of institutions that could issue cheq ues and other payment instruments the world of today is lot differentmessaging and processing systems do not need to be run by banks and in some countries nonbank providers of payment services ar able to have accounts at the central bank as we have been discussing over the past coupl of days this new world opens up whole range of possibilities from my perspecti ve the central 17 in countries where particular stream dominates and the aggregate value of payments handled by retail stream is very large such stream may be deemed to be systemically important irrespective of the size of individual payments banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 408 issue seems to be how you can best take advantage of these possi bilities without adding unnecessarily to the risk in the system phillip lowe assistant governor of the reserve bank of australia18 the discussion so far has shown that clearing and settlement is regu lated activity throughout the world with international standards promoted by the bis it is appa rent that in lowvalue payment systems there are number of intercountry differences in the approaches of regulators all purporting to meet the bis standards differenc in regulatory approaches affect the payments landscape in the different countries as we shall see below we begin by providing an overview of the processes involved in clearing and settlement then biss recommended approach to regulatory supervision of lowvalue paymen t systems is presented this is followed by review of the regulatory approaches towards clearin g and settlement that have been adopted in several countries 731 clearing and settlement the processes involved in completing payment can be described by examinin g the authorisation and authentication process and then the clearing and settlement processe s in turn the process of making transaction requires the creation validation and transmissi on of payment instruction it can be divided into number of main steps19 verification of the identity of the involved parties validation of the payment instrument verification of the ability to pay authorisation of the transfer of the funds by both the payer and the payers financial institution communication of the information by the payers financial institution to the payees financial institution processing of the transaction the structure of such steps varies considerably with the type of payment instrument an d in practice the steps may not be performed sequentially moreover there are different procedures for authenticating and authorising payments again the variation has to do with payment instruments used for example debit card transaction at the point of sale pos 18 in speech at the nonbanks in the

access to the payment system 409 with the use of pin code20 generally involves both authentication by keying in the pin and authorisation confirmation of the transaction and initiating the online approval by pressing the ok key authentication and authorisation can be immediate given by the payers financial institution at the initiation of the payment transaction process such as for card payments or deferred if it is deferred it is given by the payers financial i nstitution at the end of the transaction process following the request of the payees financial institution handling the payment information21 during the clearing process two main functions may be performed the exchange of the payment instrument or of relevant payment information between the payers and the payees financial institutions and b the calculation of claims for settlement the outcom of this process is fully processed payment transaction from payer to payee as well as valid claim by the payees institution on the payers institution in general four types of arrangements for the clearing of payment instructions can be identified the first arrangement takes place within one and the same financ ial institution the other three types require interbank arrangements inhouse transactions the verification of information and the calculation of balances that characterise the clearing process can be performed within the single financial institution in bilateral arrangement the exchange of instructions and the sorting and processing of payments flowing between two financial institutions is handled by the institutions themselves alternatively financial institutions may employ common third party separate financial institution known as correspondent for clearing with one or more institutions forwarding payment instructions to the correspondent for sorting and processing correspondents generally provide services to other financial institutions according to contracts that are negotiated bilaterally multilateral clearing arrangements are based on set of procedures whereby financial institutions present and exchange data andor documents relating to funds transfers to other financial institutions under common set of rules one example of such an arrangement is clearing house an organisation that operates central facilities and which may also act as central counterparty in the settlement of the payment obligations under multilateral netting arrangement 22 20 personal identification number 21 bis cpss 2000 p 11 22 bis cpss 2000 p 13 banking enquiry report to the competition

the payers institution to the payees institution specifically the steps in the settlement process are collection and integrity check of the claims to be settled ensuring the availability of funds for settlement settling the claims between the financial institutions logging and communication of settlement to the parties concerned settlement balances resulting from multilateral clearing organisations are post ed to participants individual accounts at the settlement institution which is ty pically the central bank access to settlement accounts at the central bank may be either open to all institutions participating directly in clearing arrangements or limited to financial ins titutions satisfying specific criteria such as being deposittaking institutions in the latte r case institutions that do not have access to central bank account settle their payments with direct participant in settlement which in turn settles across the books of the central bank for lowvalue payments settlement is usually on deferred basis once day after the clearing balances have been calculated whereas for large volume real t ime systems the transactions are settled individually and in realtime23 732 central banks and their ro in lowvalue payment systems central banks play three possible roles in lowvalue payment systems this includes an operational role their role in the oversight of the payment system and their role as catalysts or facilitators of market and regulatory evolution in the case of the operational role most central banks provide settle ment services for at least some of their lowvalue payment systems in addition there are s till central banks that provide the clearing services for lowvalue payments although in many coun tries the view appears to have been taken that the objectives of efficiency and safety are best served if clearing services are developed and provided solely by the private sector24 23 bis cpss 2000 pp 8 and 16 in south africa lowvalue settlements take place several times day in some payment streams 24 bis cpss 2003 p 10 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 7 access to the payment system 411 the provision of services may be seen as mechanism to enhance understand ing and influence over the lowvalue payment system and in so doing assist c entral banks in their role as overseers the oversight role of central banks over the lowvalue payment system arises in most cases from their responsibility for safety and efficiency in sips at the v ery least it is the central banks that set or advise on the thresholds that distinguish between low and high value payments hence their explicit legal authority with respect to the sips ext ends from the high value payment streams to the lowvalue streams25 in most cases the chief concern of the regulatory authority in lowv alue payment systems is efficiency and safety in other cases it extends to consumer protection and t he prevention of money laundering26 the bis cpss points out that the role of central banks in lowvalue systems should be cognisant of the fact that those systems with greater sign ificance require greater regulatory attention from this perspective central bank may restric t its actions and monitoring to the recommended minimum these minimum regulatory functions indicated for lowvalue payment systems are address legal and regulatory impediments to market development and innovation foster competitive market conditions and behaviours support the development of effective standards and infrastructure arrangements provide central bank services in the manner most effective for the particular market27 the role of catalyst or facilitator provides for many central banks policy tool to guide market and regulatory evolution through their cooperation with the private sector including their formal governance role of lowvalue payment systems in som countries central banks can apply their research and analytical capabilities to support or speed up market outcomes in addition liaison and information sharing between the payment system regulators and other public authorities can enable their influence in the design and operation of payment systems this can include memoranda of understanding between the central bank and the competition authority as in australia or between payment overseers and financial and banking regulators as in the eu or between the central bank and the ministry of finance as in the case of canada28 25 bis cpss 2000 p 17 26 bis cpss 2003 p 12 27 id

as early as 2000 the bis noted that the role of the private sector in providing clearing services already significant today is becoming more important furthermore in almost all countries cleari ng arrangements for payment cards are solely operated by the private sector as the share of these instruments in the overall use of payment instruments rises so will the share of private sector arrangements in the overall provision of clearing arrangements29 the increasing role for nontraditional nonbank providers in the payment system has been linked in part to technological innovation the application of information and communication technology to paymen t processes has made it possible to meet the increasing demands of end users through innovations in delivery channels products and clearing arrangements the availability of new products and delivery channels such as the internet has allowed financial institutions to r eview their distribution strategy and has given customers the possibility to choose from wider variety of payment services furthermore the application of new technology together with the efforts by market players to reduce costs has been encouraging greater standardisation the widespread application of technology and standardisation also favours the restru cturing of payment processes which tends to become separable into various activities t hereby facilitating the entry of new service providers into the market for clearing services30 this discussion suggests an accepted and perhaps even encouraged role for non traditional participants ie nonbanks to become involved in trans action processing and clearing in large part such role has evolved as an outsourcing role from the clearing banks where consolidation of technical processes has potential to lead to eco nomies of scale some have linked the rise in nonbank participation with the trend towards using electronic means for making payments as these new forms of payments are more adv anced31 banks may feel that developing such expertise is not their core business and the com plexity of electronic payments offers opportunity for specialisation which may attract nonbank specialists into the field in one example of electronic payments those that take place via atms the rise in participation of nonbanks has been marked in the us for ex ample the share of atm transaction volume accounted for by nonbank owned infrastruct ure rose to 65 per cent in 2005 from less than 5 per cent in 1995 in many countries however both nonbank financial and nonfinancial institutions providing lowvalue payment services or involved in processing are not able to access the arrangements for settling lowvalue payments as result of statute or policy the bis maintains that

settlement to take place32 however the regulatory trends in australia the uk and the eu suggest this may not always be the case in the discuss ion below the examples of few countries that offer diffe rent clearing and settlement models are briefly examined in this regard there are number of factors to consider who has access to the clearing and settlement mechanisms who provides the clearing and settlement services where nonbanks have access to either clearing or settlement what are the conditions of such arrangements 734 access to national payment systems number of countries have recently completed or are in the process of completing review of the restrictions associated with access to clearing and settl ement some of these are reviewed below canada canadas clearing and settlement systems have developed historically into hierarchical or tiered arrangements the tiered arrangement in the automated clearing sett lement system acss has existed since inception given that membership was granted to deposittaking institutions of all kinds banks credit unions and trusts the twotier struc ture allows for direct participants direct clearers and clearing agents and indirect participants referred to as indirect clearers with rules governing each in 2001 following review of policy by the department of finance and the bank of canada the canadian payments act 2001 opened membership of the canadian payments association cpa to nonbank financial institutions such as life insur ance companies securities dealers and money market mutual funds the cpa currently has 123 members of which 62 are registered banks the rest are trust and loan companies and credit unions of the banks 12 are direct clearers all the rest are indirect clearers33 to become direct clearer cpa

canada process 05 per cent of the total national clearing volumes the volume requirement meet the technical and other requirements outlined in the bylaws and rules the opening of the cpa membership led to questions around the relevance of these eligibility requirements in particular the volume requirement and institutional restrict ions for participation as direct participant in the acss this is in spite of the fact that since 2001 nondeposittaking institution has applied for membership of the cpa pr ocess of review followed in their june 2006 report the tripartite study group into eligibility crit eria comprising members of cpa the bank of canada and the department of finance recommended the following34 the current institutional restrictions be retained in particular life insurance companies and money market mutual funds be restricted to indirect clearer status this means such institutions while members of the cpa and hence within the regulatory framework of the payment system and its rules would have to use the services of one of the clearing agents ie one of the 12 direct clearers the reasoning behind this centres around retaining the position of relatively few direct clearers in the system which supports their volumes and hence economies of scale and encourages mutual trust the review suggested that indirect clearers sa ved on back office costs when using clearing agent part of the reasoning in retaining the status quo was that to date nondeposittaking institution had sought membership of the cpa the volume requirement be removed and replaced with appropriate alternative criteria the rationale for this is that volume is not indicative of the operational or financial capability of an institution to clear and settle payment transactions accordingly it was argued that volume should not be used to restrict direct ccess to the acss but that instead the following requirements be imposed prime credit rating on shortterm paper participation in the large value transfer syste m lvts and meeting certification testing on entry and material change the canadian example provides an example of broad based access to clearing at least in principle which enables standardised regulations and rules while the discussion above has focussed on participation in the cpa nondeposittaking access to participation in the countrys atm and electronic fund transfers at point of sale eftpos network k nown as interac has been facilitated since 199635 the canadian authorities have however retained tiered structure in settlement which effectively keeps this as the preserve of the clearing banks 34 tripartite study group final report 2006 35 rba 2007 p 14 chapter 7 access to the payment system 415 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information australia the reserve bank of australia rba widened the eligibility for exchange settl ement accounts at the central bank in march 1999 applicants for accounts do not need to be banks but must be an actual or prospective provider of third party payment servic with need to settle clearing obligations with other providers36 and must be able to demonstrate they have the liquidity to meet settlement obligations at all times there are two categories of possible applicant those that are regulated by the australian prudential regulation authority apra for financial institutions and those which are not nonfinancial institutions those regulated by apra and which can satisfy the rb they are able to meet their settlement obligations are eligible for accounts without special conditions except that such accounts must be in credit at all times those not re gulated by apra will have to meet collateral requirements on an ongoing basis except w here they are net receivers in payment clearing arrangements 37 the general approach of the rba has been to adopt functional rather th an an institutional approach in the words of assistant governor lowe this approach reflects the fact that many types of payment can be brok down into number of separate functions each of these functions is potentially c ontestable including by nonbanks what we have been trying to do is to obtain the benefits of t his contestability without unnecessarily adding to the risks in the system where nonbanks do bring extra risks as they sometimes do we have asked how the risks c an best be managed rather than simply excluding nonbanks from the system38 the rba has played significant role in improving access in the payments lan dscape this intervention39 includes setting out an access regime for credit and debit cards where applications from non banks known as specialist credit card institutions in this instance need to be treated on the same basis as banks in addition mastercard and visa may not penalise any participant based on its issuing activity relative to its acquiring act ivity or vice versa in the case of eftpos the rba has set price cap on the cost of standard direct connection with another participant to aus 78000 in the atm stream the rba have facilitated the encouragement of new regime for atms and the industry will shift to direct charging approach in oct ober 2008 36 so retailers that acquire their own debit transactions but are not providing services to others do not qualify for settlement accounts they can however be clearers and members of apacs 37 rba 2007 38 lowe 2007 emphasis in the original 39 rba 2007 p 6 chapter 7 access to the payment system 416 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the australian example of intervention of the rba as overseer and catalyst in the payments arena has much to do with their explicit legislated objectives ie not only of stabilit but also of efficiency and competition uk in 2002 the bank of england published its policy for granting access to settlement accounts to any direct participant in payment system the bank of england argued that provision of such accounts enables the central bank to act as the settlement agent bringing with it the advantages of risk reduction service assurance competitive neutrality and efficiency intraday credit would typically be provided by the bank of england only where the scale of the account holders payment activities would make it significant direct participant in systemically important payment system and where its direct membership would re duce risk for the financial system the banks review was motivated by range of factors including the des ire reflected in the core principles for regulation of sips to implement transparent and obj ective access criteria and the fact that number of nonbank payment service providers applied for access to accounts in the context of the bank of englands role as settlement institut ion for the link atm network40 european union the european union has recently issued payment services directive psd which provides legal framework to ensure the coordination of national provisions on prudential requirements the access of new payment service providers to the market information requirements and the respective rights and obligations of payment services users and providers 41 previous eu directives had laid down prudential requirements and other supervisory provisions for existing providers of payment services involving deposittaking and the issue of electronic money while post office giro ie credit transfer institut ions obtained their entitlement to provide payment services under national law42 40 bis cpss 2003 p 35 41 eu 13 november 2007 oj 5122007 l 319136 directive on payment services in the internal market 5 of the preamble 42 id 8 chapter 7 access to the payment system 417 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the psd recognised however that in order to remove legal barriers to market entry it is necessary to establish single licence for all providers of payment services which are not connecte d to taking deposits or issuing electronic money it is appropriate therefore to introduce new category of payment service providers payment institutions by providing for the authorisation subject to set of strict and comprehensive conditions of legal persons outside the existing categories to provide payment services throughout the community thus the same conditions would apply communitywide to such services43 the prudential and other regulatory requirements applicable to such payment institutions should reflect the fact that they engage in more specialised and limited activities thus generating risks that are narrower and easier to monitor and control than those that arise across the broader spectrum of activities of credit institutions in particular payment institutions should be prohibited from accepting deposits from users and permitted to use funds received from users only for rendering payment services provision should be made for client funds t be kept separate from the payment institutions funds for other business activities payment inst itutions should also be made subject to effective antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing requirements44 the fundamental principle behind the psd appears to be nondiscrim inatory access of non banks to clearing and settlement facilities the idea is that payment institutions will have nondiscriminatory rights of access to interbank payment systems or sw itches or pch system operators as they have been referred to in this chapter while t he directive does not explicitly say so it appears that if participation in these systems requires certain access to services or accounts provided by central banks then the same princ iples of non discrimination should also apply to the central banks45 eu member states have until november 2009 to transpose the psd into natio nal law and this will mark just the beginning of putting the psd into practice the psd is part of larger initiative led by the eu institutions and indu stry bodies to eliminate barriers to the realisation of single internal market across europe fo r payment services this initiative is referred to as sepa single euro payments area by harmonising the laws and regulatory requirements that govern the pr ovision of payment services across the eu member states and thereby eliminating national legal an d regulatory barriers the psd helps to create level playing field across europe 43 id 10 as to the rigorous approach taken to th authorisation of payment institutions see article 10 of the psd as to the control of outsourcing by payment institutions see art icle 17 44 id 11 45 provision should be made for the nondiscriminatory treatment f authorised payment institutions and credit institutions so that any payment service provider competing in the internal ma rket is able to use the services of the technical infrastructures of these payment

clearing andor settlement of payment tran sactions chapter 7 access to the payment system 418 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the aim of article 28 of the psd is to ensure nondiscriminatory access to payment systems so that competition is stimulated as sepa becomes reality 1 member states shall ensure that the rules on access of authorised or re gistered payment service providers that are legal persons to payment systems shall be objective non discriminatory and proportionate and that those rules do not inhibit acc ess more than is necessary to safeguard against specific risks such as settlement ri sk operational risk and business risk and to protect the financial and operational stability of t he payment system payment systems shall impose on payment service providers on p ayment service users or on other payment systems none of the following any restrictive rule on effective participation in other paym ent systems any rule which discriminates between authorised payment servic providers or between registered payment service providers in relation to rights oblig ations and entitlements of participants any restriction on the basis of institutional status the psd is clearly mechanism intended to ensure inter alia that sepa does not reinforce the dominance of banks in the payments industry 74 an overview of the payment system in south africa sections 223225 of the constitution46 provide for the sarb to be the central bank of the republic subject to an act of parliament having the powers and functions customarily exercised and performed by central banks and having as its primary but not sol object the protection of the value of the currency in the interests of balanced and sustainable economic growth section 10 1 c i of the south african reserve bank act 47 empowers the sarb to perform such functions implement such rules and procedures and in general take such steps as may be necessary to

south african rese rve bank to take the lead in the modernisation process of the domestic payment system the nps project which was initiated by the bank in april 1994 was launched as collaborative effort between the bank and the banking industry and the initial focus was to formul ate long term strategy for the modernisation and development of the domestic payment system this initial work resulted in the development of the south african national pa yment system framework and strategy document the socalled blue book which was published by the ba nk in 1995 the blue book contained the vision and strategy for the nps up to 2004 an important component of the implementation strategy entailed the establishment of an umbrella body the payment association of south africa it was envisaged

limited to the collate ral value of the collateral reserved for this purpose and is based on the statutory liquid asset res erve of 5 per cent of the banks liabilities54 bankserv bankserv is the largest pch system operator in the south african payment and clearing system it is involved with the processing and clearing of lowvalue payment instruct ions in the atm card eft electronic fund transfer and cheque streams and delivers the resulting instructions to samos for settlement prior to the establishment of bankserv in the first half of 1993 the banking industry in south africa jointly owned several companies that provided shared services to th banks in number of different payment channels the companies in this sector each followed their own direction and operated in their separate silos an interbank task group was appointed to investigate the feasibility of new operator and in march 1993 the banking industry reached agreement and founded bankserv bankserv was the

instrument s that allows the settlement of obligations while notes and coins are still wi dely used other instruments such as cheques debit and credit cards and efts now dominate proceedings the differences between the payment instruments lie in the technology th customer interface the processes and risk involved the pricing and who bears the cost over time there has been migration of usage from cash to cheque to ectronic instrument which includes cards and efts electronic fund transfers may be credit or debit transfers an example of credit transfer is salary pa yment and an example of debit transfer is debit order as technology has evolved debit and credit cards have become more ubiquitous payments made by telephone cellular phone and internet are also increasingly used and are termed electronic payment instruments with such instructions reflected in the ef t credit stream the technological development of payment streams has led to the possi bility of nonbank technology

highvalue and are settled through the real time high value stream debit trans actions other than cheques smaller than r500 000 are deemed to be lowvalue payment transactio ns for cheques values up to r5 million fall into the lowvalue category once the value of transaction exceeds the specified threshold it can longer be processed in the lowvalue streams and is designated transaction for the real

squareoff62 the realtime nature of the process allows for settlement risk and hence systemic risk to be better manage d as liquidity crunches can be monitored and dealt with during the course of the

payment system nps act 78 of 1998 as amended in 2004 2005 nd 2007 provides the legislative framework for the oversight of the payment system the npsd the operational department of the sarb for regulatory oversight of the payment system is assisted in this role by payment system management body t he payments association of south africa pasa in terms of the nps act payment system management body has the object of organising managing and regulating the participation of its members in the payment sys tem64 it will enable the reserve bank to adequately oversee the affairs of the payment system management body and its members and will assist the reserve bank in the discharge of the reserve banks responsibilities specified in section 10 1 c i of the south african reserve bank act regarding the monitoring regulation and supervision clearing and settlement systems65 pasa is recognised by the sarb in terms of the nps act66 section 3 3 of the act provides that the sarb itself may be member of pasa and restricts the further membership to banks mutual banks cooperative banks and branches of foreign banks institutions or bodies referred to in section 2 of the banks act 1990 and in paragraph dd i of the definition of the business of bank in section 1 of that act if the entity concerned complies with the entrance and other applicable requirements laid down in the rules of the payment system management body ie of pasa itself the institutions or bodies referred to in section 2 of the banks act are those specially excluded from its provisions among them being the land bank the development bank of respectively 64 section 3 1 65 section 3 2 c 66 the reserve bank recognised pasa as payment system manage ment body in june 1999 under the provisions of the nps act the national payment system in south africa 1995 to 2005 supra p 9 chapter 7 access to the payment system 431 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information southern africa and by ministerial designation the postbank those referred t in paragraph dd i of the definition of the business of bank in section 1 of the banks act include by ministerial designation from time to time ithala limited the banking rm of what was formerly the kwazulu finance and investment corporation its banking busi ness is by virtue of this designation deemed not to be the business of bank requiring regulation under the banks act section 3 3a of the nps act allows the abovementioned institutions or bodie s to be granted limited membership not defined of pasa subject to approved criteria nonbanks generally do not have this facility notwithstanding that as system operators authoris ed to provide payment services they will be subject to pasas supervision and control even the institutions or bodies such as postbank and ithala which may in principle become pasa members may not engage in clearing or settlement section 3 4 of the nps act stipulates that67 person may participate in the reserve bank settlement syst em unless such person is the reserve bank bank mutual bank co operative bank or branch of foreign institution and in the case where payment system management body has been recognised by the reserve bank as contemplated in subsecti on 1 such person is member of the payment system management body so re cognised or b such person is designated settlement system operator section 6 of the nps act prohibits persons from clearing payment instructions unless they are reserve bank settlement system participants or unless they are bank mutual bank cooperative bank or branch of foreign bank specially authorised to do so this excludes all nonbanks apart from designated settlement system operators of course as we s hall go on to show postbanks access to clearing is an anomoly in this regard p resumably the pending change to the nps act recently published as part of the financial services laws amendment bill which will allow the npsd to designate clearing settl ement participant other than bank mutual bank cooperative bank or branch of foreign bank will cr eate mechanism to deal with this anomalous situation in effect as general rule and as pasas mr coetzee expressed it during the hearings only banks who are members of pasa may clear and settle 68 this follows from section 3 4 of the nps act which provides that apart from designated settlement syste m operators person may participate in the reserve bank settlement system unless such person is member of the payment system management body recognised by the reserve bank ie pasa pasa membership in turn is restricted as we have seen above 67 nps act section 3 4 68 transcript 29 may 2007 p 24 chapter 7 access to the payment system 432 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the regulation of the nps can effectively be termed selfregulatory in that while the npsd has oversight of payment activities pasa which is made up of clearing bank members creates the rules for participation and operations which are subject to approva l by the npsd this will be theme that will be examined in later sections of the chapter the objects of pasa as the payment system management body are to organise manage and regulate in relation to its members all matters affecting payment inst ructions and to provide forum for the consideration of matters of poli cy and mutual interest concerning its members b to act as medium for communication by its members with th south african government the reserve bank the registrar of banks the cooperativ bank supervisors the registrar of financial institutions any financi or other exchange other public bodies authorities and officials the news media the general public and other private associations and institutions and c to deal with and promote any other matter of interest to its mbers and to foster co operation between them69 in addition the payment system management body is empowered to admit members and to regulate control and with the approval of the reserve bank terminate membership b to constitute establish or dissolve any body committee or for um consisting of its members and which has an impact on interacts with has access to or makes use of payment clearing or settlement systems or operations c to i recommend for approval by the reserve bank criteria

shall settle payment obligations on behalf of such bank mutual bank or branch of foreign institution referred to in subparagraphs i and ii70 we shall return to the matters under d below 69 nps act section 4 1 70 nps act section 4 2 chapter 7 access to the payment system 433 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information pasas role and powers are also set out in its constitution which shows that it is requir ed to play both the role of advocate on behalf of the banks and regulator of the banks activity within the payment system in terms of its constitution pasa clause 51 is required to sponsor oppose support procure amendment of or make representations in regard to any legislation official regulations directives or circulars as proposed or issued by the reserve bank registrar of banks or the department of finance or any other department of the central or provincial government deemed capable of affecting members directly or indirectly the matter of dual role was raised in the hearings initially by mrs nyasulu of the panel who expressed her discomfort with body that has been set up by an act of parliament that acts for small group of members and has such powers71 the same issue was pursued by mr bodibe of the panel mr bodibe it seems to the way your objects and powers are defined you have dual role an advocacy lobby on the one hand and an institution or organisati on that has been delegated power of regulation and in way what makes you different then from the banking association and how do you mediate these roles specifically wit h these areas that mrs nyasulu has pointed out because by your constitution you are obliged to advocate and put forward the interests of your members and at the same time u have duty to look at the interests of the system and that seems to to be conflat ion of roles mr coetzee i think ultimately that the objective of pasa i s to ensure that there is an efficient national payment system but the act specifically provides fo r the regulation organisation and management of its members being banks now the act restricted the members of the payment system and it restricted member ship of the payment system management body and pasa has to regulate and manage within that domain i do not understand clearly what is meant with the conflict with the inter ests of the members the interests of the nps because the two according to go hand i n hand and also if you refer to the admission of new participant the rules are clear i n terms of this process the criteria are fair and objective and as we have stated in our submiss ion we have not had one rejection of any application in the past mrs nyasulu the problem mr coetzee arrivesnotwhen things are going s moothly but when things become problem so in pursuance of that little article that i read if there was ever an occasion where the banks felt threatened in other words the entry of particular participant was deemed capable of threatening the banks you would have seri ous problem on your hands because your role is to then protect the interest of tha t to the point where you have to oppose as specified in your constitution that is the confl ict it has not arisen and i am really happy for you but it may just arise and the question is how then do you extricate yourself from position where it does not threaten the nps in whatever manner but it threatens the members of pasa mr coetzee it might be perceived to be conflict of interest if i may put it that way but that is why pasa and the reserve bank have introduced these clear processes these objective criteria to ensure that there is stumbling bloc k and that if competitor for instance comes in that competitor is assessed objectively and t hat it has the mechanisms if any such assessment is subjective and unfair to escalate to the rese rve bank mr bodibe sorry chair 51 of the pasa constitution actuall creates that scenario much more clearly if you really say your role is to spons or oppose support procure amendment of or make representations in regard to any legislation offici regulations directives or circulars proposed or issues by the reserve bank regist rar of banks or the department of finance or any other department of the central or provincial government 71 transcript 19 june 2007 pp 116119 chapter 7 access to the payment system 434 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information deemed capable of affecting members directly or indirectly i read that to mean if national policy was to suggest what is deemed to be against the interes t of your members in that specific situation you would be called upon to act as an advocacy group and you are longer acting as body mandated with role to manage and regulate their payme nt system you are now acting more like the banking council and i think that specifically for conflates the role of regulatory body with the role of body that has to adv ocate the interest of its members of course this is as it stands now and i do not think going forward the role of pasa should combine these two functions because otherwise it creates conflict of interest because your constitution gives you obligation to represent the intere st of your members at all times and you are answerable subsequently to your members and what happens in situations where you now have to oppose position that may not necessarily be i n the interest of your members but is maybe in the public interest mr pienaar yes to be quite honest i do not perceive that to be problem because at the end of the day should pasa oppose specific proposal that comes to pa rliament or that comes from parliament certainly pasa cannot decide for parliamen t so if parliament would like to override pasa they will they will create an act an d we will have to play and our members will have to play in that particular act from that perspective72 pasas point that the interests of the payment system are the interest of its members appears to stem from the restriction of the inner core of the system to cleari ng banks and designated settlement system operators the concept of the inner core and outer core was presented in number of submissi ons to the enquiry and was frequently made with reference to diagram variati on of which is reproduced below 72 transcript 19 june 2007 p 119 120 chapter 7 access to the payment system 435 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information figure 2 inner and outer core of national

nonclearing banks retailers mobile phone operators sponsored int clear ing samos thesettlement system managed and r by the sarb postbank direct clear ing mentored clear ing sponsored clearing ithala clearing switching and calculation of settlem ent obligations payment service system operators bureau payroll providers source variation on banks submissions in figure 2 the inner core is the clearing and settlement domain the settle ment system is managed and run by the reserve bank the clearing banks operate in the clearin g domain with the technical support of the pch system operators of which bank serv is the most important in addition there are excluded and exempted entities which operate in this domain the entities in question are ithala limited and postbank these are not fully fledged banks although they are permitted to take deposits in terms of provisio ns excluding or exempting them from the application of the banks act this latter group represents an anomaly from number of pers pectives first their existence in the left hand side of the diagram goes against the fundamental principle that only regulated entities can enter the clearing and settlement space second it goes against the principle that entities that clear must do so in their own name third there is definition in the legislation or in directives that matches the way in which these entities have been accommodated in the system these matters will be discussed in further detail below the participants of the outer core of figure 2 are nonbanks and nonclea ring banks the nonbanks are typically part of the acquiring infrastructure for transactions in t he case of retailers or mobile phone operators or atm providers or outsourced providers to the banks chapter 7 access to the payment system 436 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information such as bureaux system operators or payment services to corporates under t he auspices of banks such as payroll providers and payment service providers the participation of nonbanks in this way means that it is frequently maintained that non banks have access to the nps although there is little discussion as to whether it is the kind of access they seek mr von zeuner one of the important issues that we absa would l ike to stress is that the nps is already accessible to many parties including nonbanks nonbanks already participate in many areas of the payment system for example eft and naedo there are large number of nonbank bureaux who provide the infrastruct ure capability and are sponsored by bank into the payment system currently there are seven active non bank bureaux in the eft environment although there are 31 registered parties with bankserv on the aedo services they are currently provided by mercantile athens and absa but in all three cases the infrastructure is provided by nonbank nupay is sponsored by absa intecon is sponsored by mercantile and mycomax is sponsored by athens and on the card side there are many nonbank infrastructure providers including some of the large retailers and it companies73 of course given that they are not permitted into the inner core it could just as well be said that nonbanks and nonclearing banks are denied access the regulatory distinction between the treatment of inner and outer core participants exceptions in the inner core notwithstanding was emphasised by the banks in the transcripts the followi ng two extracts are from standard bank and fnb respectively with mr shun mugam appearing for standard bank and mr jordaan for fnb mr shunmugam the inner core of the national payment system is hi ghly regulated environment whose threads lie in its governance compliance with the bank f international settlement principles risk reduction measures and high level corporat ion to maintain very high standards as you see on the righthand side of the inner and outer core dia gram are our current non bank players who participate in or influence the national payment system with regulatory oversight in governance i think if you look at the categorie s of nonbanks that currently exist they extend from retailers all the way through to money transfers systems including beneficiary service providers bureaus that we alluded to earlier syste m operators and mobile phone operators if you look at the current governance on regulatory oversight of banks lthough intensive and costly are absolutely necessary to ensure safe sound and stable nat ional payment system if you look at banks on the inner core they are closely monitored for capital adequacy liquidity which is secured by cash reserves with the sarb disaster recovery plans and all of these ensure that the confidence in the national payment system i s maintained and promoted nevertheless the nps is only as strong as its weakest link and the partic ipation of nonbanks in the national payment system should introduce more risk t han banks do and therefore nonbanks must be subject to capital adequacy liquid reserves governance and regulation that is appropriate to the risk that they introduce 73 transcript 25 may 2007 pp 6667 chapter 7 access to the payment system 437 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information i think the lack of appropriate regulation oversight of nonbank activities suc h as introduction of payment transactions deposit taking multiple acquiring sortinga tsource float holding introduces risk which needs to be regulated and overseen74 mr jordaan the point is that there are risks in all of these sy stems but when it comes to clearing and settling the core of our system there are only 21 banks75 that can clear and settle and yet i say only at the same time that we believe that is lot they can also sponsor other players into that core or the heart of the system participation in these activities does bring risk and we s imply believe that with that risk we need to make sure that certain prerequisites are satisfied to maintain the safety and stability which is so important for an economy to function well it is so extremely convenient if one had to start with cl ean slate what would these requirements be well they would be capital requirements that are commensur ate with the risk introduced sufficient funding or liquidity intere st in the good functioning of the system and technical competence now these are all features that apply to banks we have very high capital requirements we do have culture of compliance believe you there is public trust there is liquidity and we have very big interest in the payment system functioning well we have the technical competence and we have another poi nt that applies particularly to banks and it is one we never want to use but there is the abilit to have lender of last resort which is the function the reserve bank traditionally plays for the banking system76 both of these banks argued as if there is real distinction between clearing and non clearing banks which we know to be incorrect absa also neglected that distinction mr von zeuner however as is common across the globe the national payment systems act only allows banks and other regulated entities to participate in the settlement system77 it would be more accurate to say that the nps act only allows clearing banks to participate in the clearing and settlement system to think that such restriction is co mmon around the globe would be to ignore important developments in other parts of the world such as europe and australia which are outlined above moreover the implication that nonbank entities apart from designated settlement system operator are today potentiall able to participate in the settlement system in south africa is simply not correct the point that nonbank entities should be allowed access to t he inner core only if adequately regulated was recurrent theme running though the hearings this is key to the qualityofaccessprinciple that we would endorse entity should be allowed in to the inner core ie clearing and settlement unless appropriately regulated but once appropriately regulated then nonbank access should be allowed 74 transcript 29

information in recent months there has been some slight movement on regulation of nonbanks with the publication in 2007 of two directives by the npsd for the conduct of system opera tors and payments to third persons78 however this form of regulation is obviously not intended to allow such entities to enter the inner core of the nps this was not the objective of the directives and could not be so in the light of section 6 of the nps act as it now stands instead they were designed to address untoward conduct in the hitherto unregulated domain of the outer core whether they will achieve even this limited objec tive remains to be seen the matter is addressed further in section 76 752 clearing and nonclearing banks in the sarb position paper on bank models in the national payment system

chapter 7 access to the payment system 440 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 753 sponsorship and ment orship of clearing banks in the sarb position paper on bank models in the national payment system 2000 84 there are two categories of participation that apply to clearing banks that have been allowed membership of pasa but are not yet considered as being direct clearers these are mentorship and sponsorship85 as dr hawkins set out at the hearings then we also have two categories which we refer to as sponsorship and mentor ship which again have been set out within the statutory legislation mento rship is associated with an apprenticeship now this is where bank wishes to participate in the existing pch of course it is condition that is waived where brand new pch is established but where we have an existing pch in other words we already have banks participating in clearing arrangements for particular payment stream and new entrant wishes to come in typically mentorship would be required86 one commentator has suggested that we should see mentorship as an education route whereas sponsorship is participation route mentored bank now participates i n clearing within the pch and so is responsible for the clearing of payment instr uctions with the other banks in that pch or payment clearing house it also participates i n settlement having its own samos account however it is subject to guidance and assistance from more experienced participant87 in the view of npsd mentored clearing is the model for an entrant bank into particular pch the bank will parti cipate as direct clearer but will have contractual arrangement with another direct cleari ng bank for purposes of guidance and assistance when problems are experienced and or skills th at are not available within the entrant bank are required 88 in the case of sponsored clearing bank however while it engages directly in clearing payment instructions the settlement of its obligations towards other participants in the pch is undertaken on its behalf by the sponsoring bank the conclusion drawn by dr hawkins was and so when we talk of sponsoring and sponsored clearing it is probably more correct to actually talk about sponsored settlement because this is the model where in eff ect in terms of an agreement the sponsored clearing banks settlement obligation is fulfilled by sponsoring bank 89 84 published by the national payment system department as position p aper 022000 85 the category of direct clearers is confined to clearing banks which are not subject to mentorship or sponsorship but is something of misnomer inasmuch as according to the np sd position paper referred to above both mentored and sponsored clearing banks also engage directly in clearing indeed ment ored clearing banks also engage directly in settlement 86 this waiver was part of the npsd position paper 022000 section 53 b ut was omitted in the position paper of

for retailers the sarbs 1995 blue book allowed for broadly defined category of customer payment service providers cpsps but never set the rules for their participation the rules have been modestly set out in two new directives t hat are discussed in section 76 in this section we set out the existing arrangements which nonbanks have with clearing banks we begin by briefly considering the more general views that banks expressed at the hearings and what nonbanks do in the system except for the above directives nonbanks are unregulated this means that any other participation they have in the system is deemed to be carried by what is som etimes referred to as the sponsoring bank this is an unfo rtunate term as it may carry connotations of sponsorship of clearing and so on which we would like to avoid also the sponsori ng bank has specific meaning in the eft payment stream and so where possible we will avoi d this and refer instead to the clearing bank with which the nonbank has an arrangement most of the banks alerted the enquiry to concerns regarding the unregulated behaviour of nonbanks mr jordaan for fnb mr jordaan if i could just make an introductory remark and now i do not want to be at all disparaging about any other players in the economic activity but really if you look at the culture of compliance i would think there is vast difference between retailers and banks i honestly believe that the way that we are set up we really are creatur of compliance of 232 statutes with independent compliance officers i mean an interesting example there was carte blanche exposé of one specif ic retailer that operates in the credit space and its space where we long felt ver very uncomfortable operating just from an ethical point of view you know types of rates that had been charged we do think our capital that we have to hold is vastly different you know 10 of all the deposits for example so i the first point i would make is techni cally that there is really really is big difference between them whether somebody would trust t heir deposit with retailer or with the bank94 mr shunmugan of standard bank compared the rigorous regulatory and compliance requirements facing banks with the lack of appropriate regulation and overs ight of the activities of nonbanks 95 mr coaker and mr bloem of mercantile bank expressed similar concerns adv petersen of the panel now i am just looking t systemic risk in relation to participation in the national payment system on page 7 of your answers on access and interoperability the next page you say and i quote any inc rease in the number of participants you are talking about the settlement system w ill by definition increase systemic risk now surely that answer is somewhat one sided would you agree that s ponsorship itself tends to aggregate and concentrate risk into and via the sponsoring bank 94 transcript 28 may 2007 p 29 95 transcript 29 may 2007 p 76 chapter 7 access to the payment system 443 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mr coaker i think that i would agree with your statement adv petersen would you agree that direct participation by more smaller participants if properly supervised and regulated could in fact serve to spread and thus reduce systemic risk mr coaker again that is going to be function of that regulatio n chairperson yes the difficulty i have with this stateme nt by its very nature seems to suggest that there should not be any new entrants tell if i am wrong you know because if you say the introduction of nonbanks will introduce systemic risks i t might give an impression that we are saying nobody else should come into mr coaker well if that is the impression i apologise but that is certainly not the intent mr bloem definitely not does that answer your question sir mr coaker what my answer was trying to allude to was more around the regulatory side of monitoring new entrants needs to be fairly robust and possibly more robust than it is today96 allowing nonbanks into clearing is often equated with such entities want ing to have access to the customer accounts this was view that was propagated by fnb at the hearings mr taylor the issue of being the core is exactly the ability to reach into somebodys bank account and to take money out of it and that is clearing and settling and t hat is the domain that is where is the store of value is and the store of value implie s that you are deposit taking institution and part of that remit is why we have all f that governance around it97 in fact it would seem more accurate to say that nonbank transmitting payment instruction merely introduces into the clearing and settlement process an instructi on issued by participating banks customer and assuming the instruction is cleared is consequently able to obtain payment from the bank for the debit of the customers account in other words it is the paying bank itself which accesses its customers account if this is correct then the proper focus would be upon ensuring the reliability of the payment instructions so introduced this concept was explored in the hearings mrs nyasulu now if we define clearing as the exchange of payment instruc tions simple analogy to is mr jordaan and i share mother and my mo ther has packet of sweets which belongs to so she is the deposit taker she has got the packet of sweets i have promised you sweets for whatever reason and you and i are able to exchange an instruction to her to release two sweets to you so my question is why do you have to be bank because you are not holding depos its and understand i am still just on the clearing why do i have to be bank to exchange that instruction that says someone else holds the deposits the pack et of sweets we are just exchanging the instruction to pay to hand over the two sweets98 after setting the scene for the role of the deposittaker mrs nyasulu went on to ex plore the concept of the integrity of the instruction mr jordaan and mr pintusewitz appear here for fnb 96 transcript 28 may 2007 p 176 97 id p 31 98 id p 58 ff chapter 7 access to the payment system 444 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mrs nyasulu you are really touching on exactly what i want to come to is it really the integrity of the instruction that we have to concern ours elves about mr jordaan correct mrs nyasulu because they are my sweets you just happen to hol d them i can give them to whomsoever i want your the banks responsibility as the holder of the packet of sweets is to check the integrity of that instruction mr jordaan yes mr pintusewitz can i just add that what gives us comfort is t hat the people who are accepting those instructions whether we like them do not l ike them know them do not know them we know that they have gone through certain set of hurd through the sarb and other means to know that we should trust that what comes from has is trustworthy i guess that they ultimately will settle an obligation there or fut ure obligation that may come from that transaction and that we can go back and have that settled on our behalf mrs nyasulu thank you99 nonbank players be they system operators providers of atm or pos devices or bureaux or microlenders do not appear to be interested in doing the main business of bank they do not want to take deposits100 nevertheless it seems clear from submissions that they can introduce risks of various sorts relating to fraud technical standards disaster recovery and the like into the system if they are not adequately regulated indeed this is the crux of the issue simply allowing more nonbanks into the system is not enhancing the qual ity of the system however allowing more appropriately regulated nonbanks in the system is likely to enhance the system we now turn to the existing activities of nonbanks in the clearing and settle ment system system operators provide technical and information technology services of various kinds to banks and other clients retailers and nonbank financial intermediaries and other large corporates included among the newly established association of system operators aso101 are non financial firms that facilitate the necessary back office solutions for banks so that they can transmit instructions to bankserv those that provide point of sale devices and the associated links for microlenders to make use of the early debit order edo payment streams and those that own and deploy atm machines102 around the countryside on behalf of banks simply put they provide services to the banking industry and other clients tech nically they access bankserv directly but they do so under the auspices of the clearing bank s and are 99 100 101 102 id however they may be interested in doing the business of facilita ting or switching clearing instructions and hence compete with bankserv which came into being as consequence of the system operato rs directive of the npsd this includes direct transact nupay and atm solutions for exam ple chapter 7 access to the payment system 445 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information typically not distinguishable from the clearing banks in terms of the instructions they transmit or facilitate bureaux typically enable their clients to submit payment instructions such as payroll instructions or claims by clients for payment for services such as life insuranc into the payment system in order to do so their participation is determined by the assig nment of user codes by the bank with which they have an arrangement each transaction s ent through to bankserv needs user code from the bank involved as the bank is seen to carry the responsibility for any transactions introduced in its name according to nedbank and standard bank this process can take place in the following ways bureaux can submit transactions on behalf of bank clients also known as technical bureaux in this case the client has to obtain user code from clearin g bank which is used to submit transactions into bankserv the requirement of user code from the bank provides an opportunity for the bank to assess possible risks and assign the appropriate value item limit for the client none of the funds involved get transmitted directly into the bureau account at any stage it is the responsibility of the bureau then to ensure that the client is always identifiable through the user codes the bureau merely collects and collates electronic transactions on behalf of clients and submits them to system operators including bankserv the bureaus m ain function is to provide software and hardware for the client in effect provide back office or accounting function which is enhanced by its ability to forward instruc tions to bankserv bureaux processing transactions as thirdparty participants standard bank coined the phrase float bureaux103 to refer to such entities in this case the bureau itself obtains user code and credit limit from the clearing bank involved the bureau signs up clients typically without the bank being informed of the underlying risks of clients the bureau then processes all the transactions under the bureaus assigned user code and receives funds or makes payments on behalf of its clients using its own account and user code the banks can themselves perform the functions of bureaux for clients banks als assign user codes to these clients based on risk and necessary credit assessments which ar then used to process transactions at bankserv104 in spite of being in competition with bureaux banks acknowledge that the added value propositions of bureaux make their services valuable to some corporates 105 103 104 105 sbsa april 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 28 float bureau is defined as bureau that collects and pays away for its corporate client from its own account which has been prefunded by the corporate client nedbank march 2007 second submission access and interopera bility p 30 frb march 2007 second submission access and interoperabi lity p 8 bureaux allow small users to aggregate their chapter 7 access to the payment system 446 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the conditions of participation by bureaux are based on the assigned user codes even though in certain cases the access is only granted based on the clientbureaus c redit limit held at the sponsoring bank in high risk cases the banks may request that th clientbureau provides some collateral to mitigate the risks associated with thei r transactions according to nedbank collateral up to maximum of t percent of the value of the transactions of the clientbureau may be requested regardless of whether it is being processed t hrough the bank or directly into bankserv standard bank states that the collateral and threshold limits are set on an individual basis for each client according to credit vetting process nd maximum or minimum values apply106 high collateral requirements could obviously be used to restrict participation by bureaux besides the fact that user codes facilitate risk management and govern the payment limits these user codes also identify which services clients are designated to use and can help trace back any transactions to the sponsored users in the case of third pa rty processors or float bureaux the risks and ultimate client profiles are typically unknown to the sponsoring bank even though it is liable for the risks in the words of pasa the overarching principle is that he who allows risk to enter t he nps must manage such risk which means the banker introducing them into the nps mu st be responsible for their conduct 107 however as was noted in the hearings by absas mr volker mr volker i think it is true to say that while most sponsoring b anks take cognisance of the credit risks exposure they are obviously driven by commercial interests as well and sometimes some of the criteria that might regulate this better coming from directive would be missed out on by the normal sponsorship arrangements so we think that the directive will improve the health of that whole part of the payments value chain108 standard bank raised the following concernsrisks with regards to third party float bureaux109 the float increases the potential for systemic and reputational risk sorting at source and multiple acquiring may arise110 direct submission to nps operators bypasses the banks even though the banks still carry the risks 106 107 108 109 110 transactions benefitting from economies of scale and often repr esent the most costeffective method of processing efts for smaller users in meeting with ciba the impression was gained that 100 p er cent collateral requirement from banks is common place pasa may 2007 response to the technical committee p 2 transcript 25 may 2007 p 151 sbsa april 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 3 032 this aspect is dealt with separately below chapter 7 access to the payment system 447 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information bureaux are not subjected to any regulation governance or compliance obligations in the nps while banks are payment aggregation reduces volumes payment authentication through client user codes is essential to coun teract fraud what is clear is that the float option where the bureau has its own user code and uses its own account to pay or collect on behalf of client is not widely approved of by the banks111 section 7 of nps act makes provision for third party payment providers to accept funds in order to make payments and in keeping with this the directive for third party payment providers does not prohibit such activities for bureaux the eu payment service directive is instructive here it too allows for nonbanks to hold payment ac counts for their clients which are to be used exclusively for payment transactions very specific rule s govern the activities of nonbanks in terms of such payment accounts and how fu nds in such accounts are to be treated whether the bank signs up the client with user code or whether the bureau p rocesses the transaction using the bureaus assigned user code the sponsoring bank is held responsible for any fraudulent transactions and risk that may be associated with the tr ansactions eg collection of debit orders particularly in the case of float bureaux this raises concerns with regard to systemic risk and the governance of the transactions pas sed through the system in terms of financial action task force fatf recommendations112 the bank is required to do ongoing due diligence on customers account and some banks claim that this is not possible where float bureaux are concerned113 however it appears to the enquiry that the matter of fatf requirements is red herring as such requirements refe r to the banks monitoring their clients not the clients of their clients instead what is called f or is more appropriate regulation of the activities of bureaux 111 112 113 see for example sbsa april 2007 second submission

in 1996 and 2003 among the customer due diligence measures expected of financial institutio ns is ongoing due diligence on the business relationship with the customer and scrutiny of transacti ons

this aspect must be performed by the financial institution itself reco mmendation 9 details are accessible at huhttpwwwfatfgafior uhug u nedbank march 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 31 makes the points that one cannot identify the clients of the bureaux see also sbsa 2007 access and interoperability submission p 35 where concerns related to introduction of fraudulent debits are raised as well as the fact that bureaux are not subject to fatf chapter 7 access to the payment system 448 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information standard bank has indicated that they would not support the model of thirdparty processors submitting directly to bankserv114 and absa also appears to have concerns about this model115 as it would mean that the bureau would be participating in its own right without its obligations being underwritten by bank these submissions make the point that the regulatory framework for such activity is insufficient to ensure that nonbank participation introduces only acceptable risk if there is not an adequate system of oversight and supervision the facilitation of entry by nonbanks could lead to disruption of the system indeed one could argue that the current directives notwithstanding existing access could lead to disruption at any time 755 vision 2010 and regulation of nonbanks nonbanks provide range of payment services to customers and banks under the auspices of clearing banks for the most part they have remained without any explicit regulation or voice in the south african payment system however the nps vision 2010 document published in 2006116 indicates that the npsd is beginning to see an expanded role for itself in the supervision of nonbanks payment system participants participants in the payment system include registered banks in terms of south african legislation as well as nonbank participants these nonbank participants include thirdperson service providers 117 as well as system operators118 114 sbsa april 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 3 5 115 absa march 2007 second submission access and interoperabilit p 7 116 117 118 on the same day that the banking enquiry was launched by the competiti on commission the reference here to thirdperson service providers is evidently reference to nonbanks authorised in terms of section 7 c of the nps act as amended in 2004 to accept money or payment instructions from others for purposes of making payments on their behalf the reference to system operators is explained as follows in t he document system operator provides services to any two or more persons in respect of payment instructions the expression system operator is defined in section 1 of the nps act as amended as person authorised in terms of sec tion 4 2 c to provide services to any two or more persons in respect of payment instructions section 4 2 c provides for the establishment of criteria in terms of which any person ie including nonbank may be admitted to limite d membership of pasa presumably in terms of section 3 3a or be authorised to act as system operato r in providing payment services in accordance with section 6a of the act as amended in 2005 the criteria fo r access to or participation in payment system must be f air transparent and equitable and criminal offence would be commi tted by any person who having set criteria for access or participation denies the same to anyone who meets th criteria the sarb itself is juristic person in t erms of section 2 of the south african reserve bank act 90 of 1989 while pasa i s constituted as legal entity distinct and separate from its members with the capacity to conduct all admini strative and judicial acts in its own name pasa constitution clause 1 by virtue of section 2 of the interpretation ct 33 of 1957 read with section 1 of the nps act pasa is person for purposes of the latter act section 6 of the nps ac t however despite receiving legislative attention in 2004 continues to exclude nonbank payment service pr oviders from clearing even if they qualify as system operators in terms of section 4 2 c it should be observed that even the limited space for non bank payment service providers created in principle by the amendments to the nps ac t in 2004 and 2005 have not been turned into reality the pasa constitution submitted to the enquiry in 2007 co ntains provision for limited membership and only allow s new membership by members of pchs nonbanks being excluded from clearing cannot be members of pch chapter 7 access to the payment system 449 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information nonbanks nonbanks are allowed to issue payment instruments which are linked to credit line whereby they provide credit to the public nonbanks may also provide pay ment services to third persons criteria exist for thirdperson payment providers and agency agreements are in place between these providers and their principals development paths exist for nonbanks to become clearing and settle ment banks in the payment system for example nonbanks coul d become dedicated banks and could then be sponsored andor mentored into the clearing and settlement system nonbank institutions excluded or exempted from the relevant legislation or criteria do not qualify to hold settlement accounts with the sarb different tiers of banks within the payment system reduce the requirement for exclusion or exemption119 the vision set out above is one of tiered banking where it is possible for non bank to become for example dedicated bank with lower capital requirements the last sentence of the above quote suggests this would be route to regularise the activities of postbank and ithala whether or not the tiered banking approach will become reality remain s an open question the dedicated banks bill was published in 2004 and caused an initial flurry of excitement but since then nothing has ensued the cooperative banks bill was also first pu blished in 2004 and then reissued in 2006 it went though process of public comment and amendment and was subsequently passed by parliament it was signed by the president on 22 february 2008 as act 40 of 2007 cooperative banks are membership based banks and it is possible that the two mutual banks may become reclassified as coope rative banks other memberbased organisations such as credit unions may join them but these are very small institutions in south africa and the take up of this third tier option is uncertain cooperative banks will not be supervised by the registrar of banks and the quality of their access to the payment system remains to be seen in the npsd vision the development route proposed involves movement from nonbank to clearing bank nonbanks may be permitted to be involved in the provis ion of certain payment services but are to continue to be denied access to the clearing and settlement space all that is mentioned is that the nonbanks specially excluded or exempted fr om the banks act such as postbank and ithala will not be permitted settlement accounts as part of broadening access where nonbanks can issue payment instruments and provide payment services npsd have furnished us with picture of the proposed nps governance structure 119 section 24 of the document

changes do not appear to provide mechanism for direct participation by nonbanks nor do they provide voice for nonbanks in pasa it seems that nonbank membership of pasa as provided for in section 4 2 c of the nps act is not actually envisaged for the most part the banks have indicated support for an expanded ro for the npsd in terms of oversight of nonbanks chapter 7 access to the payment system 451 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information absa for example said it believes that nonbanks should be more rigorously regulated as they are currently not regulated despite facto holding deposits for third parties120 it anticipated that sarb directives for the regulation of bureaux and payment system operators would address such risks nedbank quoted the sarb governor as saying that the bank will soon be issuing directives in terms of the nps act wh ich will regulate non bank participants in the nps for the first time we have noticed th at the number of nonbank participants has increased to the extent that the risk associated wi th their operations and the risk that they bring to the payment clearing and settlement environment requi res some formalisation 121 it went on to say nedbank welcomes the addition of these new parties into the structures of engagement with the nps either as new membership category at pasa or as new recognised payment system management body status currently enjoyed by pasa 122 it is clear that nedbank anticipated that increased regulation of nonbanks would come with voice for them in the system rather different to that which is currently outlined or provided for by the npsd indeed in nedbanks view the critical success factors i n applying regulation to nonbanks and in defining the necessary structures of engagement between the parties include governance structures that are neutral in respect of all the stakeholder groupings123 such neutrality is apparent in the governance structures envisaged by the npsd in which pasa remains both the only payment system management body and one whose membership is confined exclusively to banks while deferring pointedly to the sarb fnb acknowledged that effective competition requires that the rules do not prejudice against or in favour of nonbank players124 furthermore all banks and nonbanks participating in similar activities mus t be bound by similar rules sanctions and satisfy oversight requirements125 saying that the transparency of pasa and its decisionmaking could be improved mr jordaan added 120 121 122 123 124 125 absa

rability p 36 id exhibit ss slide 7 id chapter 7 access to the payment system 452 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information we can see the benefit of more independent representation on pasa and to our knowledge this is exactly what the sarb is already exploring how one can hav greater external stakeholder involvement126 he was evidently unaware that the exploration by the sarb has not taken th route of independent or nonbank representation in pasa standard bank adhering firmly to the division of the payment system betwee n an inner core responsible for the governance and regulation of the payments system and an outer core of other roleplayers performing paymentrelated functions placed all its emphasis on the need for more direct regulatory oversight of nonbank participants127 it saw the need for changes to the nps act to ensure inter alia that the scope of duties of the sa rb is clearly defined to ensure that the sarb has oversight of all participants and activit ies of the nps128 moreover this oversight function cannot be performed by pasa as pasa has the responsibility to manage the affairs of banks under the delegated mandate from the sarb pasa will provide link between payment service providers the banks the nps operators and the sarb but will not assume direct responsibility for managing the affairs of service providers as they are responsible for the safety and security of the inner core toget her with the sarb129 while we endorse the view that the further development of regulatory oversight of nonbanks in the payments system needs concerted attention along with expanded acce ss on their part we do not agree that nonbank participants should continue to be excl uded from membership of pasa as the payment system management body and be allowed in future only an advisory or consultative role this will tend to perpetuate the privilege enjoyed by banks in providing payment services even where these are not by nature peculiar to the business of banking and so will tend to sustain the shelter that they enjoy from effective competition by other firms the sarb dealing with oversight of the national payment system in its vis ion 2010 document notes that the stated objective of wider access to the payment syste m for participants ie by providing for different categories of participation provide s the basis for more competition however it goes on to say that the competitive environmen t for payment systems and their members is matter for the competition commission130 the implication is that competition is not matter that should be of central concern to the regulators of the payment system we beg to differ 126 127 128 129 130 transcript 28 may 2007 pp 1314 sbsa april 2007 second

note in this regard that the role of the sarb in ensuring healthy competition between financial institutions and financial system in which services are supplied at competitive prices was recognised by mr christo wiese then the registrar of banks in south afr ica in his article competition and stability in the banking sector 131 moreover the modernisation and development of the payment system emphasised by the governor of the sarb mr tt mboweni in the speech quoted earlier in this chapter depend crucially on competitive conditions being actively promoted by the regulators themselves in our view the competition commission should take steps to ensure that the sarb fully appreciates how the existing structure of oversight and regulation of the payment s system creates unnecessary obstacles to effective competition obstacles which could be reduced significantly or overcome by considering instead the different approach to such regulation now being adopted in jurisdictions such as australia and the european union 76 matters of concern in the nps 761 sponsorship of nonclearing nonbanks the definitions provided by the npsd and pasa position papers 022000 and 012007 and 012001 respectively on sponsorship leave one in some confusion as they do not capture all the relationships which have actually arisen and are currently allowed to exist in the clearing space the facto situation does not correspond to the stated jure one the fluidity of the term sponsored banks is apparent in the 2007 pasa document submitted to the enquiry132 in which pasa states the following tiers of operation have been established and are curren tly operative in the nps direct clearing banks which are banks that clear and settle in their own name for longer as five years mentored banks which are banks that clear and settle in their own names for l ess than five years with another banks that act as their mentor only if so required by such mentored bank sponsored banks which are nonbanks such as the postbank and ithala on which behalf pasa member banks clear and settle as indicated in section 4 2 d ii of the nps act133 131 132 the goals of the regulator are firstly to ensure safe sound nd stable financial system secondly to enhance the confidence of and fairness to investors by eliminating ba d business practices and ensuring healthy competition between financial institutions and thirdly to ensure an effic ient and effective financial system in which services are supplied at competitive price and the majority of the popu lation has access to the various financial services offered pasa may 2007 response to the technical committee note there i s some debate as to whether the quoted section in the nps act actually does make provision for nonbanks assert ed in this quotation matter that is highlighted further below chapter 7 access to the payment system 454 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information it is confusing to find nonbanks being included in the definition of sponsored bank s this position is furthermore in contradiction to the pasa position paper of 2001 which sees sponsored banks as category of clearing banks that do their own clearing but are sponsored for purposes of settlement through samos that position paper is consistent with the npsd position paper 022000 neither has been updated as far as we know the clearing banks provided information on their current sponsorship relationships which are reflected in table 5 the reality is that apart from bidvest bank which is clearing bank and is entitled to be sponsored in terms of the npsd position paper th sponsored entities all have some exceptional status table 5 sponsorships in the system clearing bank sponsorship payment stream

card transactions standard sapopostbank atm eft debit credit mzansi money transfers and debit card source south african banks submissions on access and interoperability confidential sbsa postbank for example is excluded from the banks act and hence is not regulated by the registrar of banks which undermines the reliance placed on clearing banks being adequately capitalised and regulated ithala is exempt from the banks act and is not regulated by the registrar of banks nor is ithala member of pasa ithalas sponsor absa accepts responsibility for its transactions toward the other partic ipants while the pasa website now lists postbank and ithala as nonbanks sponsored into the system this is somewhat absurd as they are excluded from membership and cannot participate in pch meetings etc the discussion in the transcript of 19 june 2007 below confirms this absa also sponsors meeg bank meeg is not clearing bank although being regis tered as bank in terms of the supervision of financial institutions rationalisation act 32 of 1996 it is entitled to be given that it is in the process of becoming fullyowned subsidiary of absa meegs clearing is performed by absa134 and absa accepts responsibility for all of meegs transactions both ithala and meeg use card bins bank identification numbers that ar linked to absa this means that other participants cannot distinguish between absas ithalas or meegs 133 134 pasa may 2007 response to the technical committee p 9 bank supervision department annual report 2006 p 68 chapter 7 access to the payment system 455 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information transactions furthermore meeg makes use of absas it infrastructure an d payment systems while it could be argued that as exempted and excluded institutions ithala lim ited and postbank are in effect the same as banks as they are permitted to take deposits fr om the public they do not meet the npsds own stated framework for participation135 in effect while associated with banking they are not banks in the way we commonly understand the exclusion or exemption from regulation is matter of concern as it undermines the supervision that appears to provide some discipline to what is otherwise largely self regulatory approach136 that the arrangements with postbank are anomalous is acknowledged by mr c oaker of mercantile mr coaker you do have that current arrangement whereby the sout h african postbank is sponsored by standard bank they postbank connect directly to bankserv under their own name and transact in their own name but standard bank is responsible for their settlement and standard bank is responsible for ensuring that any problems that occur with their transactions get sorted out they are not really bank they operate under that exclusion from the banks act but nevertheless from regulatory perspecti ve standard bank is held responsible for their transactions137 in the same way there was agreement from absa that the sponsorship of it hala was anomalous adv petersen let preface what i say about it by saying that i hav got doubt that ithala needs to have the access which it currently has via woul d it be right to call it sponsorship arrangement with absa mr volker it is sponsorship arrangement adv petersen we must call it ithala limited and not ithala bank mr volker yes adv petersen now it is clearly not clearing bank it is not entitled to be participant in any payment clearing houses am i right mr volker yes adv petersen now the bank models directive from the reserve bank that was covered in dr hawkinss presentation made it clear that sponsorship as it was conceived at that time i think in 2000 was confined to arrangements between pch participants now they would be directly clearing but sponsored participant would be sponsored for settlement purposes in fact the notion of sponsorship for clearing purposes does not come up in that directive am i right so far mr volker yes 135 136 137 the forthcoming financial services laws amendment bill does make allowance for the npsd to designate clearing system participant such as the postbank or ithala which would p otentially regularise their participation membership of the banking association provides similar goal t ensure that banks have subscribed to the banking code of conduct transcript 28 may 2007 pp 165166 chapter 7 access to the payment system 456 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information adv petersen so here we have an entity with socalled exe mption under the banks act ithala limited was designated by the minister of finance by government notice r511 of 17 april 2003 and the effect of that is to exempt it fr om the requirement to be registered as bank as i understand it138 right so it can take deposits and carry out the functions of bank which it is doing but what is the legislation or regulati on which permits it access to the clearing space by sponsorship what do you base that on mr volker i think once again the postbank and ithala are real anomalies and there is still tremendous ambiguity in terms of their position which we have requested on number of occasions to be finalised the current reality in terms of ithala is t hat because of the current status of the nps act and the regulations they may not participate in th clearing system in their own right as consequence absa clears and settles on behalf of ithala so they are not seen by the other banks there is an arrangement between us and them in terms of sponsorship but in terms of the actual processing through t he interbank space they would see an absa transaction and not an ithala transaction139 standard banks submission indicates some concern with sponsorship even though it states that in general sponsorship arrangements are acceptable to sbsa as means of facilitating entry into the banking sector140 sbsa indicates that its arrangement with postbank which they refer to as south afric post office sapopostbank is not altogether satisfactory confidential sbsa in terms of the banking models position paper 200002 issued by sarb and the rules relating to the banking models position paper issued by pasa141 if the sponsored banks volumes and value in any pch exceed 10 of the sponsoring banks volumes and value the sponsored bank must within 12 months find another sponsoring bank or change its status and become mentored clearing bank in the applicable pch currently sapopostbank exceeds sbsas volumes by more than 10142 predominantly in relation to atm transactions this area of concern has been reported to pasa the s arb and national treasury sapopostbank participates in the nps as an entity exempted from the banks act and the nps act and is unable to become bank its primary regulator is the mini ster of post and telecommunications while the primary regulator of banks is the mini ster of finance this presents conflict as the two portfolios have different objectiv for this reason sbsa finds itself in difficult position as commercial bank rather than th sarb attempting to govern and oversee government entity in highly regulated nps with very li ttle authority with which to compel compliance the risk introduced into the payments system is systemic in nature given that sapopostbanks volumes are significant in some payment streams they are more than 10 of sbsa volumes if sapopostbank experienced settlement failur the quantum of the failure could have extensive impacts on the industry as whole 138 139 in fact that designation expired on 31 december 2005 it was subsequently renewed until 31 december 2008 by government notice r57 government gazette 28414 27 january 2006 transcript 25 may 2007 p 144 140 sbsa april 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 24 section 86 standard bank is evidently referring here to sponsorship of clearing andor settlement in resp ect of firms entitled either by registration or exemptionexclusion under the banks act to carry on the business of bank 141 142 position paper 12001 banking models within the nps rules f or participation in clearing at paragraph 4312 what is evidently meant here is that postbanks volumes exceed 10 per cent of sbsas volumes confidential sbsa chapter 7 access to the payment system 457 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information further concern is that sbsa as commercial bank is re sponsible for the full extent of confidential sapopostbanks participation in the nps this includes clearing switching settlement sbsa operational risk and risks associated with unmandated andor fraudulent transactions introduced by sapopostbank into the nps143 the concern regarding the volumes that originate from postbank may be difficu lt one for authorities to grapple with as it could well be that there is other bank with higher atm volumes than sbsa in terms of the current rules this means that the po stbank can longer be sponsored into the system hence its status must become regularised i it can longer be an excluded entity or the rules governing its sponsorship must be changed this volume and value matter aside there is doubt that sponsorship of an entitys entire acquiring clearing and settlement function may create potential problems for the sponsoring bank and may increase settlement risk in addition sponsorship may have certain disadvantages for the sponsored entity which has its volumes and values transparent to the sponsoring bank it is perhaps because sponsorship is currently associated with entities that apart from bidvest bank and meeg are not registered banks and hence by virtue of their current status cannot become clearing banks that the sponsorship has come to mean dependent rather than an enabling route for them hence those sponsored have ambition nor as the l egal position currently stands do they have the right to do the clearing and settlement activity themselves they leave it up to the sponsoring bank the apparent misalignment between the jure and facto positions led to line of questioning at the hearings that sought to establish if there was some statutory provision that had been missed by the enquiry panel and technical team the discussion recorded below144 indicates on the contrary that there is legislative omission which has caused the npsd and pasa to make discretionary adaptations mrs nyasulu one of the things that is covered in secti on 3 of the nps act is pasas ability to facilitate limited membership but you yourselves expres s certain frustration because you are unable to invoke that clause145 mr coetzee yes mrs nyasulu could you just explain what stops you from being able to invoke that clause to allow limited membership mr coetzee section 3 3a of the nps act provides that the institutions or bodies referred to in subsection 3 3 b that comply with the entrance criteria for limited membership as recommended by the payment system management body and approved by the reserve bank in terms of section 4 2 c i may be granted limited membership we have identified and we have made proposals in this regard to the reserve bank we have als alluded to this 143 144 145 sbsa april 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 23 ff transcript 19 june 2007 p 107 ff see pasa may 2007 response to technical committee in particul ar 55 chapter 7 access to the payment system 458 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information fact in our submission that if you look at section 6 secti on 6 does not make provision for or does not allow limited members to clear in terms of section 6 onl banks mutual banks and branches of foreign institutions may clear but the limi ted member is not necessarily bank mutual bank or branch of foreign institution so tha t is the technical problem with the act mrs nyasulu and do you as pasa see discord in those two sections mr coetzee i think it was mrs nyasulu or misalignment i should say mr coetzee it was yesi think it was an oversight when we drafted the nps act and that is why i think it was in 2005 letter was addressed to the sarb indicating that we pasa are sitting with this problem and that we cannot allow limited member s to be members of pasa however we have allowed sponsored participation of ithala an d postbank into the payment system under sponsorship arrangements but they effectively clear and while they do not settle they clear and participate as each and every other member of pasa adv petersen may i follow that up mrs nyasulu yes sure adv petersen can you in developing that practical arrangeme nt which is clearly necessary mr coetzee yes adv petersen can you find anywhere where that is permitted under the act mr coetzee it does refer to in section 3 well the act does not allow for membership but it does allow for sponsorship adv petersen well does this kind of sponsorship feature in the existing position paper of the sarb on banking models mr coetzee adv petersen so it is something that has been improvised to m eet practical necessity mr coetzee yes this was adv petersen caused by an oversight during the drafting of the amendment to the nps act mr pienaar yes i think it is actually coming from histo ry because the ones that we allow to operate the entities that we allow to operate on that basis actually w ere operating in the system before the creation of the nps act so we actually had choice where you cannot simply kick them out based on technical error that was made initially adv petersen but that was an amendment that was enacted in 2004 t hat error mr pienaar that is correct adv petersen we are now in 2007 i would have thought it might have been corrected in the act mr coetzee mr petersen can i just add to that i was actual ly aware of some provision in the act referring to the situation and that is section 3 3 whic h says besides the reserve bank the following may also be members of the payment system management body and in b it says an institution or body referred to in section 2 of the banks act and in terms of that provision we have allowed the postbank and ithala to participate under sp ecial provisions approved by the reserve bank as sponsored entities into the payment system adv petersen but you will accept that in terms of the nps act they would be excluded from clearing section 6 mr coetzee yes adv petersen and they cannot participate in the reserve bank sett lement system in terms of section 3 4 chapter 7 access to the payment system 459 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mr pienaar that is correct adv petersen so again as i emphasise i appreciate the practic necessity of this it would be absurd otherwise but what i am driving at is that there appears to be something that has had to be improvised using as it were discretionary powers which are not actually provided for in the law of the land the point here is not that the participation of postbank and ithala should be prohibited but that their participation should be reflected in appropriate legislation and regulations there appears to be disquieting reliance placed on discretionary adaptation by the authorities adv petersen i think i perceive so much in this area rest ing with the discretion of officials without clearly transparent delineated boundaries to that decisio nmaking and the fact that the omission in the amendment anybody drafting an act can make mistake that it has not been corrected since 2004 signals to that there is an attit ude here that it is enough to have discretionary powers rather than powers which are subject to t he rule of law in the sense that we have come to understand that since the chang in this country146 moreover the access that postbank and ithala have is an example of poor access where the participation of these unregulated entities can be said to raise concerns and risks by their own lights this should be unacceptable to the npsd and pasa either these entities need to be regulated as banks or they need to be regulated for their payment service activities as nonbanks 762 governance and selfregulation selfregulation emerged as theme of concern in the hearings the enquiry is of the view that the concern is not with selfregulation per as selfregulation that meets the requirements of appropriate participation transparency and the establishme nt of objective criteria can often be the most appropriate regulatory system for an industry or market segment however as the discussion reveals not all these criteria are met in the south african payment system pasas membership is made up of clearing banks who draft and authorise the rul of participation of each of the pchs as well as the composition of the pasa council the mechanism and processes for entry redress and so on this led to comments about self regulation as well as lack of transparency and independence at the hearings mr pelser was at the time the chief operating officer and ceo of pasa adv petersen i will ask you question or two if i may i read this whole thing the nps act as statutory framework for selfregulation would th at be correct mr pelser i believe so yes adv petersen so when we come to rules it is not the whole picture but fundamentally these are selfgenerated rules mr pelser that would be correct yes 146 id pp 113114 chapter 7 access to the payment system 460 147 transcript 30 november 2006 pp 214 215 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information adv petersen so it is not really situation where on can throw up ones hands helplessly and say these are the rules i am talking about the banks now to the extent that they have been involved in generating them mr pelser you are talking about pch rules adv petersen pch rules and pasa constitution and rules mr pelser yes that would be yes adv petersen and indeed the definition of payment system has alte red so that it now reads very widely system that enables payments to be effected or facilita tes the circulation of money and includes any instruments and procedures that relate to the system that is not intended to be anything other than very wide net am i right mr pelser in terms of the act yes adv petersen yes so there will be potentially at least number of participants who will be regulated under the system but who may not be members of pasa mr pelser that would be correct 147 the concerns here are that pasas selfregulatory remit extends beyond that of its members hence participation in the selfregulatory structure is of concern moreover the matter of transparency and confidentiality also arose in the transcript below pasa is represented by mr coetzee and ms ntlha of cliffe dekker attorneys chairperson mr jali why did you seek confidentiali ty on the entire pasa constitution i cannot come to terms with why any organisation will say its constitution is confidential unless it was secretive organization mr coetzee it is definitely not secretive organisation the consti tution is available to any member bank it is also available on our pasa intranet so it was just from maybe legal assistance that we have received but as i said chairperson are you saying this was legal advice to say the docume nt is on the internet it is freely available yet its confidential ms ntlha mr jali if i could assist there i think the subm ission that mr coetzee is making is that the document is not available on the internet it is av ailable on the intranet which is closed system only available to the banks as far as confidentiality is concerned from pasas perspective it would have required the consent of the member banks fo r them to make it available on the basis of that it was claimed to be confidential as at that time permission from the member banks had been sought and as i understand we can take inst ructions as to whether pasa maintains the confidentiality chairperson we will give you opportunity to take those instruc tions because we really find it difficult to operate under these circumstances when people claim confidentiality even on names of people sitting in committees that is what is going on here we get people saying the entire page is confidential and when you look at the page you find t hat it is just names of people sitting in certain committee but let us move on and why is the pasa regulatory framework including the application form for membership f pasa confidential mr coetzee mr jali chairperson because that is again confidentiality has been c laimed with regard to that chapter 7 access to the payment system 461 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mr coetzee well i have been assisted by mondo ntlha in the sense that at the time of disclosing this to the competition commission we did not obtain t he necessary signoff from our members and we felt that it might be necessary to do it this way chairperson well your members have been appearing before the commiss ion and all of them have been saying they want to cooperate saying we will get pasa to com here we will get documents we will get pch agreements to be given t you now we do not understand this that is why we do not understand how we can be expected to function and to come up with recommendations which will suit the general publi c of south africa if this is happening mr coetzee mr jali yes we take cognisance of that concern and as i indicated we do not have problem in removing confidentiality as far as the constitution and application form is concerned at present we have 20 full members and to consult with all members without knowing what impact it might have on each of those members because only few of those members appeared in front of this commission so i n consultation with our members we would not have problem to disclose chairperson well i know i think mrs nyasulu has got some questions followup question to these so i will let her ask but i am bit surpri sed this enquiry was announced as early as august last year we are now in may and it has not be possible to round up all the members to get permission but anyway i will leave it at that mrs nyasulu mr coetzee and your team thank you very much can i ju st say you know as direct followup to the questions that the chairman has asked th at it has come up as regular feature of the governance structure of pasa that to large extent the tail wags the dog and i think if i could just really ask pasa to look at how it is structured that its members are able to tell it what it can and cannot do it should be the other way round so if you could in looking at all of these things that we have been asking have look at whether the governance structure of pasa and how you relate to your mbers is really healthy relationship they have lot more power than members should of particular system particularly of regulatory nature such as yours 148 the power of pasa members ie the existing clearing banks to control access for new clearing banks arose in this context as it stands participation in any pch such as atm or card requires written permission from each incumbent to say that the woul dbe entrant has met the necessary technical requirements while in principle objecti ons to providing such letters can only be on the basis of possible risks introduced there may be frustrating months of delay before an incumbent produces such letter after having tested the interoperability of the new entrants systems one of the smaller clearing banks mercantile represented by mr coaker saw it th is way mr bodibe my final question on pages 3 to 6 of your submission ou usefully showed us steps that will take new bank to the requirements to be full participant in the nps can you clarify how long it will take for new bank to be full parti cipant bank in the nps having set out those steps mr coaker it is very difficult for us to comment on tha t in real terms because we did not have to go through the process having been involved at the banking si of things for many years but we have observed some of the other smaller entrants coming into th market in some of the payment streams and i think it is function of how many payment streams the smaller player would like to play and then generally what you would find is that they would obviously have to get the reserve bank and in terms of participating in th payment streams 148 transcript 29 may 2007 pp 1317 chapter 7 access to the payment system 462 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in terms of setting up settlement accounts and all the rest of t hat once that has been done the pasa membership process would have to be engaged in and part of that pasa membership process would be the engagement with whichever particular stream they wanted to participate in so if for instance they are going to enter into the atm stream there is prescribed process and that can take as long as the slowest player in terms of signing off letters of authorisation so to put an actual timeframe on it i thin k we are the wrong people to answer that i think you should possibly direct the question to say capitec or rennies bank who are relatively new players who probably have been through that process and also possibly teba bank mr bodibe are you confirming or are you making statemen t that the current pasa rules allow the slowest mover to determine the pace mr coaker well not to 100 per cent extent i mean obviously if there is recalcitrant bank there are ways and means of pasa getting them to sign off be cause generally you would find its not because they did not sign off it gets lost on somebody s desk and that sort of things 149 in the technical team presentation at the start of the hearings on the subject it was suggested that model like the link atm network in the uk was an improved mode l for entry in the case of link objective criteria for entry are set and the executive director grants access on the basis of these criteria mr coetzee and mr pienaar represen t pasa in this extract from the transcript mrs nyasulu in other words the rules say that that new participant would need to get written permission from each and every one of the banks i am not sure if you were here yesterday but i gave the analogy of polygamous marriage where it is ridicul ous to have the two wives who are already in the marriage regulating if third wife should come in because they have vested interest in saying there are enough of us i n this family so i am asking whether you anticipate in south africa that syst em where an executive director or in this case someone within pasa is the one that mak ruling on whether the new or wouldbe entrant in the atm pch or whatever pch meets all the requir ements so that they do not have to ask the wives who are already in the marriage mr coetzee yes there is requirement that the new entrant m ust negotiate with each of the participants in pch and what we referred to is letter of c onfirmation by each other participant to allow the new participant in the pch now there was spec ific reason for that requirement and the requirement is based on the fact that each other bank wi ll have to make risk assessment of the new participant and also to expose the new part icipant to the other banks and to enable them to commence discussion on bilateral pric ing however do i perceive whether such decision will should vest in the managing or execut ive director in pasa it is it possible it could be but i do not believe the function performed by obtaining letters of confirmation will be achieved by one person sitting in pasa150 mr pienaar in sense we may be erring on the conservative side by allowing the people to discuss with that particular bank its position to understand i ts position but in the end finally the decision lies with the reserve bank should there be decline refusal on the side of one of the banks so it is just question of allowing the bank s to go about their business as normal without interference by the regulator unnecessarily and that is why the term that has been chosen to regulate the national payment system i s also oversight and not regulation it is in other words to my mind at least lighter sen of regulation than having 149 150 transcript 28 may 2007 p 152 transcript 19 june 2007 p 90 chapter 7 access to the payment system 463 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the regulator always take the decision from that perspective but rather have the people that is in play in the system make the decision mrs nyasulu in other words is selfregulation the term that applies in this case mr pienaar it can never be seen as total self regulation it is rather allowance within rules and positions set out by the regulator if they go outside of that then obviously the regulator will come in so it is not totally selfregulation no151 the notion that the payments system is selfregulated was contested by some of the banks for example in their presentation mr jordaan of fnb stated that mr jordaan the type of regulation that we have in south frica has been called self regulation although we believe that to be erroneous in fact if you broadly distinguish between types of regulation one gets selfregulation and deleg ated regulation where regulation is formally delegated you get the regulation where the regulator will consult with the players in the market or you get regulation where somebody clearly just makes the regulation we th ink we fit into the second category because it is not self regulation it is delegated by the south african reserve bank in terms of the national payment act 152 however it is clear that as it stands t he framework is one of selfregulation and the banks have been involved from the beginning see governors speech quoted above in section 74 the nps project which was initiated by the bank in april 1994 was launched as collaborative effort between the bank and the banking industry the process of approval of new entry was further explored with mr coetzee of pasa adv petersen is it true that wouldbe new entrant either in coming to pasa or in going to the existing participant banks would be expected to disclose their business plans mr coetzee in the previous presentation i have alluded to this fact the only business plan that may be disclosed is that if bank wishes to participate in t he eft environment it must state its estimated volumes and values state that i have clien ts i have existing client base this is my estimated values and volumes and i will partic ipateclient names client details and so on are not disclosed adv petersen and does that disclosure take place to pasa to the participant banks or to whom mr coetzee in the pch application form the prospective applicant is required to provide per pch for instance if it is an eft pch application it will state on t hat application form that i am going to participate in this pch the pch system operator is b ankserv i will have the following estimated volumes and values in this pch it addresses issues of drp bcp confirmation that it will sign the pch agreement the settlement agreement et cetera so we do not request them to provide their business model their details f their clients adv petersen and then finally before relinquishing th is are you aware of any other country where access to the payment system is regulated in manner which i ncludes the requirement of consent from each of the existing participants mr coetzee i will ask mr pienaar to address this question 151 152 transcript 19 june 2007 p 94 transcript 28 may 2007 p 12 chapter 7 access to the payment system 464 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mr pienaar i think we are not that au fait with all the systems in all the other countries but if you think about the australian model where the banks have direct li nks with each other it actually comes to that point because if the one does not want to trade wit h the other one he would not trade with him so it is exactly the same the only diff erence is that we managed it through central switch which is very much more efficient it has actually been confirmed to us by the australians that they deem it to be much more effic ient than the direct link scenario they have got153 the australian regulators have confirmed with the technical team that di rect connections between banks are the order of the day in that country in fact they referred several times to spaghetti network being in existence however they also pointed out that in some cases this disguises universal access for example in the case of atms there are 6 netw orks in australia but any participant bank or nonbank that participates is in effect member of them all in terms of new participants gaining access the australian regulator has s et an access code which sets explicit criteria for technical require ments including the costs and timing associated with participation so it is difficult for an incumbent t block the entry of new participant in the view of the panel the approach adopted by the uk link network would benef it the entry of new participants into existing pchs we recommend that such an approach is adopted by pasa 763 ownership and control of infrastructure there are two key infrastructures of the south african clearing and settlement sys tem as they now stand samos and bankserv the first is owned by the sarb and the latter by the banks as has been mentioned earlier the operational role by the central bank in terms of the provision of the samos infrastructure and the services associated with it is globally common especially as regards settlement infrastructure there were submissions which suggested this w as anything but functional system the public ownership of samos shall not concern us further here bankserv on the other hand represents the crucial clearing infrastructure of t he sa payments system as apart from few exceptions in card payments the payment instructions from all the payment streams will be accumulat ed and used to calculate the obligation of each clearing bank visàvis every other clearing bank and submitted to the deferred settlement system each day mr cilliers of bankserv set out their activities at the hearings 153 transcript 19 june 2007 p 105 chapter 7 access to the payment system 465 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mr cilliers mr chairman we would just like to present bankserv in two ways this morning first it is brief overview of our place in the nps system and then secondly just couple of our value propositions and core competencies and core reasons we exist so we will go through the slides in that order firstly we are 35 years old you well know bankserv is quite small company just point on the volumes we process about two billion transactions ye ar of which about 12 billion is nps transactions clearing and settlement transactions mr jordaans presentation talked about value of 46 trillion rand going through the system each year we process about 6 trillion rand year so it gives you perspective our valu are lot lower than our volumes we have low value payment process high values do not flow through us they flow directly to the sarb through the samos system we have about 45 customers being the banks and the rest some corporate and other bureaus and customers154 the importance of bankserv compared to the other pch system operators mastercard and visa was also emphasised mr bodibe what is the share of bankserv relative to other switches like visa and mastercard mr cilliers i have idea really but i can make an estimat i would estimate we have probably 90 plus of the volumes in our domain which are low valu transactions domestic transactions international transactions we have 0 share but domestic transactions i believe we have by far the majority but not onus transactions i should add155 the change of ownership of bankserv was explored at the hearings ownership was linked to the usage of bankservs services and loyalty to it the spectre was raised that changing ownership could have unforeseen consequences in that banks would be more inclined to shift their volumes to other operators such as visa and mastercard should one of the big banks do so this could seriously undermine the volumes of bankserv the practicality of such move was explored at the hearings with absas mr volker adv petersen now to get back to my thread connected with b ankserv you have raised today and you raised it with respect on previous occasion that th major banks could find alternatives for themselves to bankserv if they were not satisfied with the way bankserv was going about its business and one of the things you have raised today is tha t if the major banks if i understood you correctly were not happy about nonbank acquirers being allowed to deliver directly into bankserv to use my rather crude expression you could turn your backs on bankserv and make other arrangements mr volker yes adv petersen is that practically correct mr volker yes i think it is156 the shareholder interests clearly influence the future business strategy of bankse rv in this regard two alternative futures for bankserv were explored the first was presented as its 154 155 156 transcript 28 may 2007 p 78 we will refer to bankservs non bank customers further below transcript 28 may 2007 p 88 transcript 25 may 2007 p 82 chapter 7 access to the payment system 466 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information continued pursuance of commercialisation ie finding other it business apart from the clearing service to banks the second was the alternative of treating bankserv as public utility the latter would mean that clearing banks would be compelled to use the bankserv infrastructure for lowvalue payments which would ensure the retention of v olumes through the switch the suggestion of move to national utility was made by standar d bank in their written submission and repeated by their representative mr shunmugan at the hearings mr shunmugam bankserv was created by the banks for the banks to ac hieve greater efficiencies and switching and to maintain the safety and soundness of the clearing and settlement system the move of bankserv to becoming commercial vehicle undermines this and therefore standard bank believes that bankserv should be managed as national utility on selffunding nonprofit basis i think some of the unintended consequences of the commercialisation of bankserv may lead to increased cost to the consumer cause bankserv to take its eye off its core function within the nps of clearing and settlement thereby jeopardising integr ity of the nps and could and may drive behaviour that potentially introduces more risk into th system bankserv is near monopoly in relation to the provision of domest ic clearing switching services clearly the alternatives for the banks include direct c learing or switching off shore however this comes at incurring massive risk in cost so the b anks in south africa have viable alternatives to bankserv in the short to medium term espe cially in eft as you have heard from the ceos presentation yesterday that it covers more than 50 per cent of bankservs volumes157 the idea of becoming national utility was tested the day before with the c eo of bankserv mr cilliers adv petersen now it has been raised and i think we may hear this more directly in the course of these hearings that the commercialisation of bankserv was bad idea and for policy reasons it should rather be reconsidered and approached as public utility do you have particular point of view or comment that you would care to m ake in relation to that idea mr cilliers yes advocate i certainly have an opinion i do not believe that going the utility route would be the correct route for number of reasons th first thing is it is not what is happening internationally the biggest dynamic going on at t he moment in the payment world is the sepa movement in europe the single european payments area and what is happening there is more commercialisation of companies li ke ours and not less through various ways acquisitions consolidation of the space and then divers ification of their services in many cases they are moving to exactly the model th at we do have in south africa they are combining switches in the uk for example they are combining the eft space with the link with the card swit ching space to become more viable internationally speaking so i think the international example is more commercialisation not less domestically speaking i think the risk of being utility in this space can be described as two big elements to that go hand in hand the one is you are taking choice away from the players in the market from t he participants i mean to make us survive in that mechanism you have to build in regulations to say they have to use our services otherwise we will not be viable that seems unnatural in this day and age secondly the very real risk of utility so protected to become uninnovative it has been there for years in bankservs case and we have been over the t five years trying 157 transcript 29 may 2007 p 8081 chapter 7 access to the payment system 467 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information to move to be more innovative and more dynamic and offe r more options to the world rather than less at the moment we are surviving because we are more cost effective than international switches and we provide the same levels of service so we have right of existence158 the banking industry appears to have taken the view that rather than tamper with bankserv ownership at this stage it would be more acceptable to adopt the formation of an independent board as has been mentioned above until very recently the structure of bankservs board mimicked the shareholder structure in the last year there has been an attempt to improve the independence of the board with the appointment of five nonbank members to the board bankservs board structure is modified from 10 nonexecutive directors the big 4 and dandyshelf appointed by shareholders 2 each 2 executive directors appointed by the board to the following 1 board member where shareholding exceeds 5 per cent 5 independent nonexecutive directors 2 executive directors in the new structure there will be as many independent nonexecutive directors as there would be board members representing shareholders interests to d ate enactment of this new structure has not been successful with only one independent being appointed the responses of the banks to the restructuring are listed below159 absa the restructuring of the bankserv board was welcomed as it embraces good standards of corporate governance this means that decisions on pricing and access are made by an executive independent board it should be noted that representatives of various bank s on the board of directors of bankserv have always had an obligation to act in i ts best interests by increasing throughput 158 159 transcript 28 may 2007 pp 117118 banks submissions march and april 2007 access and interoperabilit question 3 chapter 7 access to the payment system 468 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information fnb fnb supports bankservs efforts to improve its corporate governanc structure in line with global trends the changes made by bankserv will allow for decision m aking and participation by independent nonexecutive directors on the board which shou ld increase transparency and accountability nedbank to qualify as an independent board member of bankserv candidate must have direct indirect or implied relationship between shareholders and board members relationship with any shareholder that may interfere with t heir ability to act in an independent manner in addition to the above there may be voting pool arrangements bet ween shareholders the chairman has second or deciding vote and executive directors have voting rights as they are employees of bankserv the recent changes have been to large extent to distance the shareholders from the board nedbank supports this rationale as well as the changes to the boards structure standard bank historically major shareholders had the power to elect the chairman of the bankserv board on condition that their candidate had sufficient knowledge of the functioning of nps operators in terms of the nps act interoperability of the banking sector and the role of the operator the importance of protecting the economy from systemic risk should the chairman not have extensive knowledge in these areas this would cert ainly have an adverse impact on effectiveness efficiency and interoperability due to bad decision making this would result in loss of focus and increased syst emic risk previously the board of directors was made up of executives appointed by shareholders based on their knowledge of banking with specific reference to payment sectors similar issues as related to the chairmanship are relevant to the members of the board from the submissions it appears that three of the big four support bankserv s board restructuring while standard bank has various caveats with regard to the necessary and appropriate expertise this was tested at the hearings with mr sar of standard bank chairperson yesterday there was also reference to the rest ructuring of the board and do you think that will also affect the manner in which bankserv works mr sar mr chairman exactly to my point earlier that the board will now have fiduciary role to focus purely on the good of bankserv as opposed to if you were under the utility focus that we are looking at on the broader domain s it is focussed purely on profit motive to now be appointing members to the board who have little or payments related knowledge to be driving the company and making decisions on its behalf i shudder to think where that could possibly impact on this industry r elevant to the risk and stability and efficiency of the clearing and settlement type servic it provides chapter 7 access to the payment system 469 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information chairperson i may be wrong but it was my understanding that the t alk was about appointing people who have payments knowledge mr sar mr chairman i stand to be corrected but as fa r as i remember from the presentation banks who make up more than 5 per cent of the volume will be assigned each chair up to maximum of five the remaining five board memb ers will be independents which necessary talks to where would you find those type of chairperson it does not necessarily mean that they do not have pay ments knowledge if they are independent mr sar that is why i said they may have little or chairperson that is why i am raising the concerns that it was not m understanding that it would be people without any payments knowledge mr sar correct but what we are saying is that hypothetically where you are sitting is that you could be appointing anybody to that board which would not neces sarily bring in payments knowledge you are driving for profit maximum and hence that could take you down different route chairperson ok there is also reference in slide 12 that the commercial profit maximum motive may drive behaviour that potentially introduces more risk into the system can you maybe expand on that mr sar mr chair i think the short answer to that is if you are now starting to drive services potentially utilising the same infrastructure th at you used for clearing and settlement but your focus is on driving profit type related services which now start expanding your services which may not even necessarily be constrained to anything to do wit h payments you start running the risk that the lack of focus which we have had to date on ensuring clearing and settlement and sound systems could come apart160 the discussion above while not exhaustive provides flavour of the pressure bankserv is currently under in terms of satisfying its shareholders 764 development path for nonclearing banks as registered entity nonclearing bank is regulated by the registrar of banks but is not system participant as defined in the nps act nonclearing bank may not provide payment services to its clients as defined in the npsd position paper may t clear domestic payment instructions to or from other banks may not be sig natory to any payment clearing agreement may not operate samos account and may not enjoy membership of pasa as noted earlier in this chapter while nonclearing bank may allow its customers to withdraw their deposits and transfer amounts within its own custome r base using its own atm infrastructure it may not facilitate any payment where another bank is involved when another bank is involved as payer or collector of funds the exchange of clearing instructions is involved and this exchange of instructions is the exclusive domai n of clearing banks 160 transcript 29 may 2007 p 8688 chapter 7 access to the payment system 470 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the development path in moving from being nonclearing bank to clearing bank is not set out as strictly speaking mentoring and sponsorship are only open to those who are already in effect clearing banks161 the difficulty for new player remains transparency and familiarisation with the entry requirements of pasa the pchs and the sarb one bank grindrod which is the most recent bank to become clearing bank has made submission to the effect that obtaining access to clearing and settlement acti vity and pasa took it 153 working days between february and september 2007 to complete t his is in spite of fulltime team working on the project so that where possible t asks were performed concurrently the listing of activities together with the length of t ime it took is in itself instructive and includes such tasks as information gathering preparing application forms meeting with bankserv testing with the other banks in the relev ant pchs testing with samos etc the list is included as an appendix to the report how the current structure enables new entrants into clearing and settlement and facilitates the transition from nonclearing to clearing banks was tested at the h earings messrs pienaar and coetzee were appearing for pasa adv petersen so to get into mentoring you have to first get into the category of clearing bank mr pienaar yes adv petersen right that was what i was getting at mr pienaar yes adv petersen so there is at least as far as this positi on paper is concerned there appears to be provision for the education of nonclearing bank to prepare it for that entry into the clearing bank category now is that correct mr pienaar you are quite right but there are obviously in formal relationships between banks i mean most of the banks that are not clearing banks hasve got corporate client relationship with another clearing bank the nonclearing bank has got to hav it so the relationship is already there with clearing bank so should he want topick up knowledge he will probably discuss it with his bank on the how to what to et c etera et cetera so the informal relationships certainly will be there mr coetzee if there is the perception that there was first clearing then mentoring that is not correct it is at the moment when clearing starts you st art out as mentored clearing bank adv petersen the point is however that there is mentoring before clearing mr coetzee well before joining pasa then as member yes162 given that there is much discussion about the entry of other tiers of banks both dedicated banks and cooperative banks the setting out of development path for new entrants may become more pressing the cooperative banks act 40 of 2007 was signed into w on 22 161 162 of course we have noted the exceptions to this throughout the chap ter transcript 29 may 2007 p 6667 chapter 7 access to the payment system 471 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information february 2008 consequential amendments to the nps act of 1998 make provision for co operative banks to participate in the clearing and settlement arena how ever the way in which access to the clearing and settlement system will be facilitated fo r these entities is not clear clarity on the position of cooperative banks needs to be obtained giv that they will not be regulated by the registrar of banks will not fall under the banks act and its regulations and hence will not necessarily fulfil the liquid asset requirements that are statutory for clearing bank to obtain settlement account at the sarb it is also likely that even secondary cooperative banks may not have the technological infr astructure or technical skills to be direct participant and while greater clarity on this is necessary it may not be sufficient to lower barriers into what pasa itself calls the complex clearing arena163 surely there is need for expanded membership to the clearing and settlement space going together with more active mentoring process what we are raising for consideration here would be for at least some of the risk and responsibility in the smaller lowvalue payment streams to be borne direct ly by the sponsored bank or nonbank hence they would have settlement accounts but perhaps only in certain lowvalue pchs this should avoid the problem raised by standard bank in which within the relationship between the sponsor and the sponsored entity the sponsoring bank is liable for settlement 765 discrimination between clearing banks in the discussion below the submissions related to the relative uneven ness of the playing fields between large and small clearing banks are presented the discussion is relat ed to relative prices faced by big and small players and the terms and conditions under which they operate although this discussion is part of the section relating to concerns around access to the payments system it is one of the more vexing areas as different parties have frequently argued that the discrimination is simply part of rational business arrangements involving firms and activities of different scale hence solutions may not be easy to identify from the submissions it is clear that pricing and risk in the nps are associated wi th the basic principle that if an entity introduces risk to the system and to other participant s there is price to pay while there is the principle that lower fees are charged for higher v olume as certain costs are reduced higher volumes may actually increase risks in terms of insurance costs for example 163 in the pasa position paper on banking models within the nps rules for participation in clearing 012001 chapter 7 access to the payment system 472 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information hence even once registered bank becomes clearing bank there are disparities of pricing and activity associated with volume that may hamper the success of ne w bank entrants and their ability to compete effectively with the incumbents bankservs pricing differentials came under attention in this regard as commercial operation bankserv sets prices for participants typically on volume basis h ence larger banks with larger volumes pay lower fees on per transaction basis than smaller banks the matter of pricing was raised with mr cilliers of bankserv at the hearings mr bodibe if there was decision or if you have to shift to s ay to flat rate mr cilliers yes mr bodibe what will be the impact on the company mr cilliers in other words there is differentiation per customer mr bodibe yes mr cilliers well we will certainly we will make sure that flat rate equates to our current revenue if that is so it will be an interesting calculation t start with mr bodibe as normal business practice mr cilliers yes but i think the effect on us may not be so obvious fi nancially speaking at least to start with the effect long term is this word unfores een consequences comes to mind you know obviously there will be questions asked i think the eff ect on the industry is more relevant and that is that 94 per cent of our volumes come from t he large banks in south africa so effectively you will have 94 per cent of the fees paid by the large banks in south africa and that does not reflect our reality our reality is that you know depends on your definition between 60 and 80 per cent of our costs are fixed costs and they ar not all related to volumes so we have organised our pricing systems such that our pr icing system for these core services are stripped between fixed fee and transaction fees and the fixed fees are trying to recover some of this fixed cost that are equal or more or less equal between the participants whereas the transaction fee is really tiered at the volume element of our pricing on the volume side specifically you know we believe or we have proven that our cos t per transaction declines as volumes increase so we passed that into the transacti on fees pricing mechanism that we have on the fixed fee we are unable to recover what we c onsider adequate compensation from the smaller players in the industry so we have rising fixed fee per client where the bigger players also pay you know up to four times what the s mall payer pays the small bank for example but at least we still have some semblance of us being able to r ecover some of our fixed cost from every participant if you just go to purely fla t pricing mechanism that flexibility disappears i think we had bank last year with 30 transactions month so whatever your price is they will be participant in the nps at r30 month may be you know whatever you can charge164 several of the big banks pointed out that they could shift their custom from bankserv or switch to direct clearing between themselves if bankserv pricing did not serve them given the commercialisation of bankserv and therefore the optio n of competing switching systems to establish themselves in the market the fee structu re and levels of bankserv need to be set in manner that retains their customers and volumes th is is especially true for the 164 transcript 28 may 2007 pp 9294 chapter 7 access to the payment system 473 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information larger banks that bring in substantial volumes to bankserv and which therefore lower the cost of service for all participants165 if the fee structure did not pass on some of the volume benefit s brought by large banks then the fee structure might create incentives for larger banks to tak volumes out of bankserv166 banks have the option of making direct bilateral clearing arra ngements with each other should they so wish and this possibility remains threat for bankserv167 as small clearing bank mercantile raised concerns regarding the pricing differential for big and small banks although bankserv had recently provided mercantile with new pricing proposal which had met mercantiles concerns somewhat mercantile proposed flat pricing mechanism for all players in the hearings however mercantiles mr bloem conceded that this would not necessarily provide an ideal solution the transcr ipt picks up with mercantiles discussion of new pricing proposal from bankserv 168 mr bloem well it is pricing proposal from their side and what it basi cally says is that they are willing to revise the original set of prices proposed for t he next year with the new set of pricesthe proposal is that they are prepared to revise the pricing they did not change anything as far as the floating component the variable component is concerned they basically revised the fixed component to actually streamline the pr icing so that if we sit on one million rand pricing tier now it will make sense for us to rather m ove to three or four million rand because there is an advantage overall advantage in do ing that the proposal is subject to threeyear contract then so we need to give them commitment that we will continue with this service for threeyear period adv petersen fine so far as the anomaly was concerned that u mentioned in your submission which i understand to refer to the distance between the west tier and next tier mr bloem yes adv petersen has that anomaly been satisfactorily ironed out as far as you are concerned mr bloem yes if we accept the new proposal absolutely sir adv petersen now you went on to say today that it is nev ertheless still an uneven playing field mr bloem yes sir adv petersen and your answer your proposed solution to that if i understood you correctly was uniform per transaction price for all participants mr bloem yes sir adv petersen do you recognise that there may be problems in the application of uniform transaction price mr bloem yes i do agree adv petersen what would you say those problems are 165 166 167 168 sbsa april 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 11 id p 12 absa march 2007 second submission access and interoperability p 2 transcript 28 may 2007 pp 158162 chapter 7 access to the payment system 474 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mr bloem i think the challenge sits in the fact that banks erv is service provider it is trying to remove lot of risks out of the local settlement system and therefore one must also look at the fixed component that they need to fund out of their pricin g model there is certain set of costs that they cannot move away from so they mu st guarantee in any pricing proposal that they at least cover that in order to make sure that they ca n continue operating as an efficient service provider and at the same time obviously continue with this job or the roles that they are fulfilling so i think the challenge sits in how to balance the requirement to keep everybody happy with the fact that they need to obviously ensure that they do not introduce risk i nto the system and the way to do that is to make sure that in the pricing they make sure that they get in sufficient funds to cover at least their operating cost so yes we are aware of those facts and therefore it is i think it will be quite challenge to find suitable solution at the end of the day but we still feel that the current pricing is not keeping us warm adv petersen you recognised that the large volume players m ight find other switching operators more attractive mr bloem yes sir adv petersen if there was uniform transaction pricing at bankserv mr bloem yes adv petersen and would you recognised that the loss of vol ume if large player was to withdraw from using bankserv would in turn impact upon the uniform transac tion price for the remaining participants mr bloem absolutely you are absolutely correct but nothing would prev ent the smaller players then to join the one big player that moved away and also join the new service provider i can maybe just mention that mercantile for example is using visa as our service provider on credit card transactions we are not currently swit ching through bankserv just to prove the point that you are making so it will be possible f or some of the players to move away adv petersen so you are not suggesting that the uniform per transaction price is necessarily solution mr bloem i think it could pose its own challenges definitel it can introduce risk to the system in that one or two of the bigger players can decide to move away whic h will obviously put whole new perspective on the way that the market is going to oper ate it appears that bankserv is currently in dominant position169 which clearly should not be abused in terms of section 8 or 9 of the competition act from the evidence presen ted to the enquiry we are unable to conclude that the differential pricing treatment of it s customers actually falls foul of the competition act whether as prohibited price discrimination or prohibited exclusionary conduct nevertheless it is recommended that the competition commission keeps bankservs pricing practices under observation discrimination between large and small banks is also feature of access to suc h payment services as acquiring credit and debit card transactions in south africa th issuing of scheme cards has always been the domain of banks in the case of ac quiring of participating merchants this has traditionally been the domain of large banks both visa and mastercard have very strict rules and regulations regarding the eligibility and participation of prospective 169 this is not assured going into the future with new and exi sting players competing for its switching business chapter 7 access to the payment system 475 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information and incumbent members there are also practices of the schemes which hav created unnecessary barriers to acquiring by smaller players this is dealt with in detail in the chapter on payment cards and interchange in australia the authorities intervened in the card market by creating an access regime where the card associations are longer permitted to deny access to acqu iring on the basis of an institution not having established an adequate issuing base or programme first on the regulatory side two changes have allowed nonfinancial instituti ons to participate more fully in payment systems the first was the establish ment of an access regime for the bankcard mastercard and visa credit card schemes in 2003 the creation of new class of authorised deposittaking institution known as specialist credit card in stitutions sccis has provided an avenue for firms that are not traditional deposit takers t enter the credit card system as either an issuer or an acquirer or both170 in the chapter of this report dealing with payment cards and interchange we have recommended that if the card schemes do not voluntarily both formally and in pract ice abandon restrictions which limit acquiring to issuers then the matter shoul d be addressed either by the initiation of formal complaints and investigati ons by the competition commission or by regulatory intervention or by both in the event of regulatory remedy being embarked upon the australian precedent would merit further study 766 nonbanks and the recent directives key concern raised above is the lack of regulatory framework for nonbanks in spite of the 1995 blue book referring to nonbanks and the rules for their participation some rules in the form of directives from the npsd were published in september 2007 these have appeared as the directive for conduct within the nps payments to third persons and the directive for conduct within the nps system operators respectively in these documents the npsd acknowledges that the provision of services relating to payment instructions to two or more persons by persons other than banks in certain circumstances adds value to the users f the nps in broader market provided that risk in the nps is controlled in the case of the payments to third persons directive both manytoone such as bill payments for utility by customers and onetomany such as salary payments are mentioned those entities undertaking such services must be appointed as an agent of each beneficiary keep records of such payments for five years 170 rba 2006 payments system board annual report p 9 chapter 7 access to the payment system 476 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information keep separate and distinct the business divisions associated with payments ensure its systems are safe and efficient so as not to introduce risk including reputational risk into the nps inform its banker of its involvement in payments to third persons and the ba nker in turn must inform pasa pasa should keep record of such entities and inform npsd upon request in the case of the system operator directive system operator provides services to any two or more persons in respect of payment instructions including the delivery to andor recei pt of payment instructions from bank andor pch system operator the persons to whom such service may be provided include banks beneficiary service providers payer service providers institutions exempted or excluded from the banks act and clients of banks the directive excludes those who perform such services on their own behalf howe ver they are expected to meet the operational and technical requirements set out in the criteria for system operators annexure to the directive system operator shall meet the criteria as recommended by pasa have written agreement with each person to whom services are rendered keep the information in respect of the services rendered confidential and separate in respect of the bank accounts from which funds are to be paid or to which funds are to be transferred only act in accordance with instructions issued by the person to whom the service is rendered and not pay such funds from or transfer such f unds to its own account note this is presumably intended to prevent such operator s from holding float keep separate the business divisions providing system operator services refrain from providing services which allow the offsetting of mutual obligatio ns by trading partners or persons for whom they are processing payment instructions this prevents netting of obligations keep records of all each and every payment instructions for five years these directives hence provide framework for regulation for these two catego ries of non banks it is notable that system operators appear to be precluded from keeping float of funds to which others are entitled however bureaux which would be involved in th ird party payments do not appear to be so constrained there are few points that are worth noting regarding the directives chapter 7 access to the payment system 477 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the directives give authority to pasa to authorise determine the criteria for authorisation and provide the npsd with information regarding the registration of third party payment providers and system operators in their comment on the system operator directive in october 2006 the association of system operators r aised concerns that pasa is traditionally an organisation acting in the interests of t he banks which in turn control process payments the banks being competitors of the system operators have traditionally and generally been opposed to the involvement of system operators in the processing and services relating to payment instructions ccordingly it is submitted that conflict of interest would exist should pasa oversee the management and control of system operators 171 while the npsd has ultimate authority to approve the rules set by pasa pasa remains the operation manager of the directives and the author of any rules at the same time that system operators are managed by pasa they are denied access to mbership of the organisation which is exclusively for clearing banks these directives are created in the context of nonbanks not being permitted direct participation in the clearing and settlement arena in and of themselves it is diffic ult to interpret the extent to which the directives truly bring order to the outer core even the criteria for authorisation to act as system operator published as an annexure to the system operator directive leaves room for interpretation and decision making by the pasa council and one cannot conclude that they provide holistic framework for the regulation of nonbanks in the payments system the latter would be ne cessary to ensure qualityofaccess concerns regarding governance in the payments system date back to t he task group report on competition in south african banking172 and the subsequent report for the competition commission on competition in south african banking and national payments system173 and have been expressed at the public hearings of the banking enquiry itself hence pasa has been aware for some time of the concerns round its structures and governance it is currently going through process of restructuring of both the organisation and its decision making body the pasa council while the restructuring is not yet complete it is clear that the council will continue only to allow participation by its clearing bank members and although each member will have 171 172 173 aso 2006

confidential information fiduciary duty to pasa it is difficult to see how the new structure brings advancement in terms of nonbank participation concerns relating to the continued reliance on pasa as payment system management body with vested interests coupled with restrictions on its membership to clearing banks only are thus exacerbated by the publication of the npsds two directives for nonbanks 767 innovation in principle the possibility that innovators may be rewarded with in creased access is likely to enhance innovation and efficiency to restrict access means to rely on only small cohort of incumbent firms to introduce efficiencies and innovations that may cut across ex isting sub markets number of current arrangements in the nps undermine innovation namely the restriction of participation in clearing and settlement to clearing banks only except in the case of technical outsourcing under the auspices of clearing bank the pricing of such participation by the existing incumbents or by means of bilateral negotiations with unequal power relations may also be barrier to the sustainability of new entrants the arrangement whereby introduction of change or innovation must be agreed by incumbent competitors who may play gate keeping role undue restrictions on participation in lowvalue payments activity only clearing banks may participate here these will be discussed briefly in turn participation under the auspices of clearing bank the restriction of participation to clearing banks means that participation by nonclearing bank or nonbank must be under auspices of clearing bank this implies that to gain acceptance the innovative idea must first be adopted by clearing bank that in turn will take the innovation to the pch this may involve number of hurdles including that to gain acceptance the clearing bank will need to be convinced that s uch an innovation will not undermine revenues from its existing busine ss lines the successful innovator is tied to the terms and conditions of the clearing bank concerned and typically gets locked into an arrangement from which there are high risks of switching chapter 7 access to the payment system 479 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information the current arrangement may stifle or delay innovation as incumben t clearing banks are likely to adopt very conservative approach to innovation and hence ma reject viable innovations out of hand or take an unduly long time to approve any change the current arrangement may also introduce hazard where the regulated entities or clearing banks do not themselves have the mechanisms or motivation to monitor the transactions introduced by those acting under their auspices currently it is the clearing banks that have lender of last resort assurance but business arrangements with nonclearing banks may potentially introduce risk174 the principle that the entity that introduces the transaction should be responsible for any associated risk is sound but this fails when the bank introducing the transaction does so only in name and is neither equipped to regulate the introduced entity nor interested in doing so in general nonbank participation in the payment system is associated with innova tion at recent conference in the us this was affirmed by the president and ceo of the federal reserve bank of kansas city the retail payments system is certainly undergoing fundamental change it is dynamic coming from variety of sources and it is significant it is so coincidence that nonbank firms are significant part of this change and have become increasin gly prevalent throughout the worlds payment system nonbank companies have had positive influence in the areas of efficiency and access around payments by helping to introduce new technologies and products enteri ng new markets and tapping into the economies of scale and scope nonbanks are enhancing the efficiency in the payments system by offering payments rvices that frequently transcend geographic restrictions for example by facilitating online payment options nonbanks are enhancing on balance consumer access175 of course nonbanks are not the sole nor always the prime source of innovatio n but since they can improve efficiency and access for consumers their access to infrastructure needs to be taken seriously hence enhancing the regulated access of nonba nks or non clearing banks into the clearing space and even the settlement arena would improve innovation and efficiencies the risks associated with such access re greatly reduced if such entities are appropriately and explicitly regulated such access which we can r efer to as qualityaccess is superior to the current approach where they are regulated on t he basis of transactions under the name of clearing bank 174 175 transcript 25 may 2007 p 151 hoenig t 2007 central bank perspectives federal reserve bank of kansas city president and ceo at t he 2007 payments

payment system 480 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information obtaining agreement from incumbent competitors in this instance we refer to the introduction of an innovation potenti ally from nonbank by member of an existing pch here there are two hurdles for the wouldbe innovator obtaining permission from the incumbents to introduce the innovation and establish ing sustainable interbank pricing arrangement the case of miniatms gives us some insight into these issues while the relevant submissions received have been set out in some detail in the atm chapter and will not be repeated here the example shows that it is difficult to introduce an innovation int an existing pch as competitors may feel threatened and hence unduly cautious in accepting the innovation into the pch there is also an intellectual property is sue here as the innovator is required to unveil the innovation to competitors in addition as the arrangements currently stand the wouldbe innovator has to accept the classification of the type of interbank price that should apply to the innovation in the case of the miniatm transactions these were reclassified as nonatm devices nads after having originally been accepted as atm transactions with the associated carri age fee the carriage fee applicable to nads is considerably lower than that for atm transact ions and was concluded on bilateral basis between acquiring and issuing members of th pch moreover although there is lower interbank fee applicable the bene fit of the lower cost does not pass through to the customer as the issuing banks cannot discern the difference between an atm and miniatm transaction and so the standard atm fee is charged176 the alternative to introducing an innovation to an existing pch is to establis h new pch pasa rules allow for any two members to establish new pch and appoint their own pch system operators this process is not without its own difficulties as for any pch to warrant the necessary investment it must have general acceptance through crit ical mass of acquirers and issuers the new pchs established in recent years such as edo aedo and naedo and mzansi money transfer have been established in response to external stimuli such as pending regulation or the financial sector charter rat her than in order to accommodate innovation this suggests establishment of new pchs is not an easy way of introducing an innovation into the payment system regulatory restrictions on participation in low value streams one of the areas where nonbank participation has generated dynamism in payment services worldwide has been in low value payments through smart cards and cellphones 176 sbsa april 2007 second submission atm transactions p 25 chapter 7 access to the

the uk the purse limit is gbp 250178 issuers of electronic money are required to register with the financial ser vice authority fsa and are subject to money laundering regulations and other associated regulations the legislation aims to be fair and equal in that it permits both banks an d nonbanks to issue electronic money in south africa the npsds position paper on electronic money179 states that only clearing banks will be permitted to issue electronic mo ney electronic money will therefore be subject to regulation and supervision by the bank180 the south african regulatory approach to emoney is problematic as it c ontinues to retain the exclusivity of the clearing banks in this arena and in so doing may well be setting the country back in terms of range of innovative payment mechanisms that could benefit low income consumers once again there are workable and operationally secure international examples which suggest that the local approach is unnecessarily closedminded and protectionist in nature there need to be clear and objective criteria for the submission evaluation and acceptance of innovations along with changes to the access regime 177 178 179 180 fsa 2001 the

acquiring and sorting at source the concepts of multiple acquiring and sorting at source have been introduced by non bank participants particularly retailers in the enquiry as possible mechanism to improve access to the payment system and also reduce layers of pricing181 consequently the concepts have been explored at the hearings and in written submissions 771 multiple acquiring vs sorting at source the concepts of multiple acquiring and sorting at source are frequently used synonymously except that the term multiple acquiring is usually reserved for the payment card arena and sorting at source extends to other payment streams most notably efts or even atms however as we shall see they are not identic their similarity arises in their challenge to single acquiring term used to indicate that in most payment streams nonba nk be it retailer or insurance company or bureau typically has relationship with si ngle bank to acquire or introduce its transactions into the payments system the single acquiring model predominates in the payment system an example would be where an insurance company say with client base that banks at different banks sends all the payment instructions for its monthly premiums to single bank also known as the single acquirer bank bank will process all the transactions for its own bank customers the onus transactions the result of this intrabank processing will mean that for each payment instruction the account of the insurance company will be credited with the val ue of the premium and the paying customers account will be debited the remainde r of the transactions typically the majority182 will then be relayed for collection via system operator such as bankserv to the other banks banks b c d etc where the clients of the insurance company have their accounts the process results in interbank clearing and settlement where the other banks debit their customers accounts in favour of bank and the insurance company while strictly speaking it is only this latter group of offus transactions that will attract an interchange fee as described in the chapter n interchange we have reason to believe that bank charges the insurance company different rate for processing onus and offus transactions but instead uses standard rate in the sorting at source model the insurance company in the example above would have multiple bank accounts with number of different banks typically those that suit its clients banking profile the insurance company would sort the payment instructions per bank and 181 182 see eg the letter from shoprite to the banking enquiry july 2006 pp 26 onus volumes are estimated to account for 2530 per cent of the sa payment volumes this number was confirmed by mr pienaar of pasa at the hearing of 19 june transcript p 15 5 chapter 7 access to the payment system 483 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information relay them to each respective bank which would in turn process them as onus transactions if there were clients with accounts at banks where the insurance company did not itself have an account these transactions would be processed via system operat or in this example it is likely that the minority of transactions would be offus in the case of multiple acquiring retailer is able to process different brands of payment cards through different acquiring banks however the fourparty model described further in the chapter on interchange appears to remain intact so that each acquiring bank still processes the onus transaction and then relays the rest via system perator or payment processor such as bankserv mastercard or visa the current rules of the ga are that merchants are permitted to appoint an acquirer for each of the card brands and types namely visa mastercard visa electron maestro diners club and american express183 information supplied to the enquiry suggests that the largest retailers such as pick n pay have two acquirers for payment cards184 in this example it is likely that the majority of the transactions will still be offus and either way the same merchant service charge will apply to all transactions of the same type processed through the acquirer concerned mastercard suggests that the key difference between multiple acquiring and s orting at source lies in the relationships involved multiple acquiring should be distinguished from sorting at sour ce multiple acquiring requires the acquirer the acquiring bank in each case not merchant to have re lationship with the payment processor ie bankserv mastercard and visa sorting at source as mastercard understands the model contemplates that there is role for the acquirer the merchant transacts directly with one or more issuers issuing banks185 whether in the last mentioned case the merchant has an acquiring relationship with each issuing bank is moot point what is clear is that taken to its extreme in sorting at source the system operator or payment processor as mastercard calls it is largely bypassed instead the nonbank or its back office operator links directly through to each issuing bank from an access perspective the implication is that the restrictions associated wit h clearing and hence access to bankserv could be avoided whether this method of pursuing this objective results in positive outcome for the system as whole is questionabl however where nonbank is able to send instructions to more than one bank t he nonbank will have less processing risk this appears to be the essence of the shoprite checkers submission which points out that if the systems of its single acquirer fail it cannot process any debit card and only credit cards below the prevailing offline threshold186 however 183 184 185 186 pick n pay october 2006 submission of information p 6 id mastercard march 2007 supplementary submission to the banking enqui ry p 1213 shoprite checkers letter to the banking enquiry july 200 6 p 7 at the time of submission shoprite had only sing chapter 7 access to the payment system 484 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information since multiple acquiring is permitted as explained above and enables the additional acquirer to serve as backup in handling all transactions in the case of tech nical failure by the other this would seem largely to dispose of shoprite checkers technical concern the key benefit of the widespread adoption of sorting at source set out by its proponents appears to be potential cost reduction for example the sorting at source model will allow nonbanks greater negotiating power with regard to bank processing fees as there will be an ability to play one acquiring bank off against another187 in addition allowing nonbanks to transmit transactions directly to each bank rather than via bankserv would pot entially allow for the reduction in one layer of cost it has been suggested further that the interchange fee could be avoided188 the enquiry has confirmed however that while the interchange fee would not be paid away by the acquiring bank in the case of onus transactions both issuing and acquiring costs ar still being incurred necessitating transfer of intrachange between the different departments of the bank 189 to the extent that levels of interchange which enter into merchant service charges may be set too high and thus be open to abuse we have addressed this problem in the ch apter on interchange by proposing an independent objective and transparent process for regulating interchange we consider that sorting at source is neither necessary nor adequate as remedy 187 188 189 acquirer for payment cards strategy mentioned by both shoprite checkers id p 5 and pick n pay october 2006 p 6 shoprite checkers letter to the banking enquiry july 2006 p 7 see chapter on interchange chapter 7 access to the payment system 485 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 772 the regulatory position as has been stated above multiple acquiring is permitted in the payment cards arena along the lines of different branded cards the status of sorting at source remains unclear however in letter to pasa dated 1 december 2003 the npsd declared mo ratorium on all new sorting at source arrangements190 the chief reason given for the decision by the npsd was that such activity reduced interbank clearing which in turn meant that exposures were not transparent to the sarb it appears that as consequence of this decision by the npsd some existing sorting at source arrangements were retracted191 in subsequent letter to pasa dated 3 january 2006 the npsd withdrew its moratorium on the grounds that it had legislative grounds to continue its stance192 as stated in its letter this was based on legal opinion from the sarbs own legal services department lsd that sorting at source is not clearing and therefore the sarb has legislative grounds to outlaw sorting at source except if the practice should lead to form of systemic risk the letter goes on furthermore lsd are of the opinion that claim that sorting at source will hide exposures from the npsd does not hold water as the npsd may call for any inform ation it may require relating to payment system in terms of section 10 of the n ps act193 the npsd goes on to say please take note that the npsd remains averse to arrangements th at allow for the by passing of the clearing system other than for reasons previousl mentioned our letter of 20040923 we are concerned that the proliferation of such arrangements could lead to distortion in the pricing of interbank clearing and seriously aff ect the ability of smaller banks to participate in the process194 773 the standpoint of the banks and bankserv the resulting situation appears to be one where the banks aware of the npsd s misgivings on the matter have generally refrained from allowing sorting at source arrangements since the lifting of the moratorium shoprite checkers submission for example sho ws that in 190 191 192 193 194 historically sorting at source was associated with preferential pay ments as mr shunmugam of standard bank put it at the hearings it is where the corporate beneficiary would get first hit of the funds with the introduction of the aedo system and the neado system and consequently the national credit act all preference from systems has been removed and replaced with randomization transcript 29 may 2007 p 79 pick n pay for example had direct acquiring relationships with each issuing bank for cashback at point of sale arrangements associated with debit card purchases in place from 1989 from 2005 it was compelled to appoint single acquirer for each card brand pick n pay october 2006 submission of information p 6 npsd january 2006 confidential

within the banking sector annexure s3 id p1 id p2 chapter 7 access to the payment system 486 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information response to its request to discuss sorting at source with absa in early 2006 it was rebuffed195 the reluctance was also apparent in the submissions and hearings absa for example represented here by mr von zeuner stated that sorting at source would not result in the efficient use of the payment system and moreover that the supposed cost savings were not likely to emerge mr von zeuner sortingatsource leads to payment transactions being less efficient than the current system the processing that arises currently still has to arise under the sortingat source sortingatsource does not reduce or remove the different steps that need to be taken and so there is efficiency of processing that arises from it it does not reduce any cost sortingatsource brings we believe duplication in inv estment all merchants with their different switches needs different links into all of the issuers if transactions go through these different switches then there will be f ar more switches with far fewer transactions through each compared to today when most of the transactions go through one switch referring to bankserv if transactions ar taken away from bankserv then it will not be able to exploit these scales of economy and the unit co st of transactions will obviously go up since it would mainly be the large retailers who would source at sour ce this means that the small retailers will be left facing higher costs than before196 standard bank also submits that the reduction of volumes through bankserv would raise unit costs and force smaller banks to have costly direct links with each of th larger banks or bear these costs ultimately they foresee interoperability being jeopardised197 bankserv confirmed that should sorting at source be taken to its extreme it would effectively leave role for bankserv in the system mr cilliers look sorting at source in its ultimate form wil l make bankserv obsolete overnight there will be offus transactions to process so bankserv would not have an nps role per and it is risk you know i appreciate the comm ents made that there is real international precedent for that happening at big scale but i t certainly is happening i mean it is happening on small scale already we see that in the volumes we see little differences in vol umes from time to time we know about corporates that are sorting at source and so forth but i think that is very obvious scenario we process offus transactions if everything is sorted at s ource there are offus transactions so that is quite simple198 195 196 197 198 shoprite checkers letter to the banking enquiry july

emphasis on the differential outcomes for big and small players mr jordaan ppears here for frb mr jordaan sorting at source benefits bigger players in the c ase of merchants it would really only make sense to the larger merchants to do so and we feel that could be that the expense of smaller merchants but i think size would also play out in the banking sphere in other words if sorting at source were to happen that would completel marginalize small banks for the benefit of the larger banks because they would have m ore onus transactions by virtue of having larger customer base so sortin g at source helps big merchants and the bigger banks199 the matter was probed with smaller clearing bank that is able to offer its servic as an acquirer in number of payment streams mr coacker was asked to indicat mercantiles attitude to sorting at source mr coacker this again is doubleedged sword for small player if you were to fully allow sorting at source i think it would dilute our ability as s mall player to compete in the switching process particularly because what would the need be to swi tch through us if you have direct relationship with an absa standard fnb and nedbank for submitting your transactions directly through to them then it removes any usefulness th at we might provide to the payments market and we would therefore in our capacity as smal l bank not support sorting at source over and above any other reasons200 shoprite checkers through the intervention of mr nilson confirmed the insign ificance of the number of transactions through any bank other than the big four mr nilson there is huge huge gap between the big four and the res t massive it is not even in the same ball park i mean i will give you an example we r an internal card shoprite staff card that staff can use we are doing about 170 000 tr ansactions month or something if i take the big four banks and i put them down bank b c d in order of number of cards and value that are processed the next highest volume card that i process is my staff card so down below that big four line is really rats i call them rats and mice qui honestly the volumes are really minuscule compared to the big four201 there seemed to be little benefit to smaller merchants mr cope of pick n pay suggested here that sorting at source will bring little change to the circumstances of smaller merchants adv petersen moving on then from that mr cope can we j ust consider for minute where multiple acquiring sorting at source would leave the small rchant whose volume of transactions might not justify having multiplicity of acquirers have you considered what the likely effect of the change that you are proposing would be upon sm all merchants 199 200 201 transcript 28 may 2007 p 24 transcript 28 may 2007 p 188 transcript 25 november 2006 p 88 chapter 7 access to the payment system 488 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information mr cope i think there will always be situation where you will need single acquirer for certain transactions if card is issued by bank offshore on diff erent continent and there will be cards issued by hundreds of thousands of banks globally clearly i n that situation you would need to have an arrangement of single acquiring in those situations s it will always be there similarly in the case of small merchant they m ay be obliged to use single acquirer if they are not in position to develop their own switchi ng situation or negotiate bilateral arrangements with the major domestic banks202 the panel have come to the conclusion that there is little merit in promoting so rting at source as distinct from multiple acquiring while it may well provide shortlived benefit to powerful nonbank users of the payment system in their own negotiations with banks t his benefit will not necessarily accrue to all nonbanks and may well undermine the benefits of interoperability of the system for this reason the panel can find reason from competition perspectiv to recommend sorting at source the panel favours instead the participation and regulat ion of nonbanks who wish to engage in payment processing and clearing along t he lines described in this chapter this avoids introducing backdoor approach of which sorting at source smacks 78 conclusion and recommendations the analysis in this chapter has challenged the notion that the existing regulato ry regime for the national payment system is meeting the needs of south african consumers for competitive and technically innovative payment services the approach of largely ignoring nonbank activities has begun to shift but persistence in the view that on ly clearing banks may participate in clearing and settlement is not an approach that will best serve south africas interest we are convinced of the need for revision of the regulatory app roach and the development of an appropriate regulatory regime for payment system activi ty which is functionallybased rather than institutionallybased so as to ensure quality of access those participating in payment activity should be adequately reg ulated regardless of whether they are clearing banks or not the recommended approach requires an explicit access policy for banks and nonbanks alike bank access is based primarily on banks being regulated by the registrar further the selfregulator pasa has confined its membership to clearing banks leaving npsd wi th an oversight role while the use of the term oversight is internationally adopted visàvis pervision its use is somewhat ironic given that it may simultaneously mean one thing and its opposite the regulatory regime in the payments system which has relied ssentially on the sarbs 202 transcript 25 november 2006 p 18 chapter 7 access to the payment system 489 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information supervision of clearing banks has lacked in terms of its inadvertence towards other legitimate contenders our recommendations regarding the regulation of the national payment system are as follows an access regime that includes nonbank providers of payment services should be developed so as to allow for their participation under effective regula tion and supervision in both clearing and settlement activities in appropriate low value or retail payment streams the national payment system act and the associated position papers of the npsd should be revised accordingly the membership and governance of pasa should be revised so as to include non bank participants governance revision should also allow for objective application of entry criteria and formalisation of reporting to the npsd payment system ombud should be established that would assess whether or not applications have been fairly dealt with and whether or not participants have been fairly treated in terms of access and the pricing of such access 781 development of an access regime that includes nonbanks there is currently access regime for payment system participants other th an one in which once bank is registered as deposittaker it can potentially become member of pasa thereafter the pasa rules and regulations apply if south africa is to have holistic access regime for the payments system it makes sense to define criteria that relate specifically to payments activity rather than piggyback on the prudential req uirements of the registrar of banks the australian approach is instructive here some years ago the rba relied on the prudentially specified liquid asset requirement as the basis for collateral in the settlement system when the authority to regulate banks was shifted to the austra lian prudential regulatory authority apra the payment policy department of the reserve bank of australia was obliged to set out an access policy that was not based on prudential regulations for banks but instead was based on payment system activit hence capital and other requirements are based on volumes and values through the payments system rather than values of assets or liabilities as set out by the prudential authority this paration of requirements makes it easier to allow nonbanks to enter the system as these requirements can be applied on functional rather than institutional basis if properly formulated chapter 7 access to the payment system 490 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information in its vision 2010 the npsd sets out that the oversight domain of the nps entails the entire process of maki ng payment in other words it entails the process including but not limited to that nables the payer to make payment that is issuance of payment instruments the payer to issue payment instruction via payment instrument or other infrastructure the institu tion to receive the payment instruction via clearing or otherwise the process of clearing and settlement where applicable the beneficiary to accept the payment instruction t he beneficiary to deliver the payment instruction to an institution for collection the institution to receive and deliver the payment instruction for collection into clearing and settlement and the beneficiary to receive the benefit of the payment within the described process banks thirdperson payment providers system operators pch system operators and agents of payers andor beneficiaries are included203 hence the oversight domain can be seen to embrace the entire payment va lue chain and it includes nonbanks however as has been described in some detail above the blue book and vision 2010 approach to supervision of nonbanks has been piecemeal and incomplete and does not provide satisfactory access to clearing and settlement the current approach which identifies the inner core as the exclusive dom ain of clearing banks apart from the anomalies mentioned and distinguishes it from the outer core means that those that are in the outer core remain excluded in spite of the words ex tracted from the vision 2010 document above the underlying belief that only clearing banks ought to be permitted in t he clearing and settlement arena has perpetuated the situation where only banks are permitted t be members of the payment system management body pasa all registered banks are allowed to take deposits but only those banks qualif ying in terms of the banks ie sarbs payment criteria are eligible to clear in their own name and settle in the books of the bank in their own name the payment system management body the payments association of south afr ica pasa manages the conduct of its members defined as the bank bank mutual ban k or branch of foreign institution or any other class of bank in relation to all matters affecting payment instructions204 this is in spite of the provision made in the nps act section 4 2 c i to allow for limited membership of pasa for exceptional entities such as postbank and ithala hence although strictly speaking the nps act potentially allows for limited membership of some nonbanks this is nowhere further defined in the pasa constitution there is provision for limited membership and only bank membership of pchs is allowed postbank and ithala are not members of pchs and this leaves the concept of limited membership obscure 203 204 sarb 2006 vision 2010 nps framework and strategy 341 sarb 2006 vision 2010 354 and 355 cooperative banks have n ow been added to the list chapter 7 access to the payment system 491 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information because nonbanks are not catered for as members of pasa they are excluded from having an effective voice moreover they are excluded from the rigour of particip ating in policy and regulatory debate and contributing to greater understanding of what takes place in the outer core an access regime that includes nonbank providers of payment services should be developed so as to allow for their participation under effective regulation and pervision in both clearing and settlement activities in appropriate lowvalue payment stream s as has been discussed earlier there are international precedents that suggest that an access regime of this sort can be designed that does not threaten the systemic stability of the existing system in our view the new structures proposed such as the new n ps framework and the directives discussed above do not adequately address these concerns 782 revision of the nps act and ssociated position papers and directives the discussion of the chapter leads to the conclusion that the nps act need s to be substantially redrafted with new access framework in mind this w ould allow for non banks to be clearing and even settlement participants and hence members of pasa it would allow for different types of participants and membership of pchs this is especially so given the omission acknowledged by pasa in the piecemeal approach of the 2004 amendments for example the 2004 amendments to the nps act introduc ed number of changes that potentially expanded access to the payment system f or example they introduced the concept of system operator person other than designated settlement system operator authorised in terms of section 4 2 c to provide services to any two or more persons in respect of payment instructions205 it also introduced the concept of payments to third persons made or accepted in accordanc with directives to be issued by the sarb however it failed to allow such participants access to the clearing arena or to allow defined membership of pasa once the nps act has been redrafted the associated position papers and directives would also have to be revised obvious examples are the bank models position paper to accommodate the realities of postbank and ithala and the emoney position paper as well as the directives on system operators and third party providers 205 npsa act as amended section 1 definitions chapter 7 access to the payment system 492 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information 783 pasa membership and governance pasa is the delegated selfregulatory authority of the payments system in our opinio n this position together with the professed view of the npsd that their remit and that of the payment system management body extends throughout payment system activity means that pasa membership should be extended to nonbanks however this does not necessarily require all members to be on an equal footing again the australian example is instructive where three types of membership in the australian payments clearing association apca are catered for owner membership members are also shareholders participating membership members of the pchs associated membership members who would like to remain informed206 the governance structure includes owner and participating member overl aps these categories are open to banks and nonbanks alike these members are clearing members as they are members of clearing house of which there are five in australia the requirements for membership are that participant must be body corporate which carries on business at or through permanent establishment in australia be able to comply with any applicable laws and apcas constitution regulations and procedures and related technical and operational standards agree to pay all applicable fees costs charges and expenses 207 moreover the participating members are divided into tier 1 and tier 2 members wi th only the former settling their own obligations and those of any tier 2 participants that appoint them as clearing agents while tier 1 members are subject to supervision nd are likely to be financial institutions of some type this requirement does not apply to tier 2 members 208 more nuanced membership of pasa will lead the way to improved governance as the current and proposed governance structures are dominated by the biggest banks which have the greatest volume and values through the system in an environment where both bank and nonbank members of pchs can be members of pasas highest authority its council governance concerns associated with clearing banks regul ating nonbank competitors will tend to fall away 206 207 huwwwapcacomau uh accessed 4 march 2008 id participating membership webpage 208 correspondence from mr nick roberts senior manager payment pol icy rba chapter 7 access to the payment system 493 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential information other governance concerns that also need to be addressed are those associated with permission for entry into pch and formalisation of reporting mechanisms to t he sarb in south africa each existing pch member has to provide written permission f or new entrant to operate in payment stream however in the uk for example in the link atm network the chief executive applies the criteria for entry into the payment st ream without referring the decision to existing members in the view of the panel s uch an approach would benefit the entry of new participants into existing pchs we recomme nd that such an approach is adopted by pasa during the course of the enquiry it became apparent that the selfregulat ory approach of pasa gives it considerable authority in the nps and that there is need for more regular and formal reporting requirement to its overseer npsd we recommend that such formalised reporting mechanism be put in place 784 creation of payment system ombud this entity would play the role of an ombud to payment system participants or prospective participants the ombud could assess whether or not applications have been fa irly dealt with and whether or not they have been fairly treated in terms of access and the pricing of such access included in the remit of such an ombud would be the entir ambit of the payment arena and it would include access to the infrastructure of bankserv or t he relevant pch operator access to settlement accounts processing of membership of pasa as well as the processing of pch applications the enquiry recommends that the competition commission together wit h the payment system ombud keeps

appropriate to refer to the competition act to remind ourselve s of what the legislature anticipated in promulgating the act the preamble to the competition ac t stipulates that the people of south africa recognise that apartheid and other discriminatory laws and practices of the past r esulted in excessive concentrations of ownership and control within the national economy inadequate restraints against anticompetitive trade practices and unjust restrictions on f ull and free participation in the economy by all south africans that the economy must be open to greater ownership by greater number of sou th africans that credible competition law and effective structures to adm inister that law are necessary for an efficient functioning economy that an efficient competitive economic environment balancing the i nterests of workers owners and consumers and focussed on development will benefit all south africans in fitting with the preamble the main objectives of the competition act are set out as follows the purpose of this act is to promote and maintain competition in the republic in order to promote the efficiency adaptability and development of th economy b to provide consumers with competitive prices and product choices c to promote employment and advance the social and economic welfare of south africans d to expand opportunities for south african participation in world m arkets and recognise the role of foreign competition in the republic to ensure that small and mediumsized enterprises have an equi table opportunity to participate in the economy and f to promote greater spread of ownership in particular to increase the ownership stakes of historically disadvantaged persons1 the recommendations of the enquiry contained in this report are an attemp t to introduce or encourage changes in the south african banking sector which will be in line wi th the objectives of the competition act the recent developments in overseas markets in respect of the banking sector which have been referred to in this report such as the shift to direct charging model fo r atms in australia the investigations into payment card interchange in number of jurisdictions and the openi ng up of payment systems to nonbank payment service providers in europe and australia cannot be ignored and they call for concerted intervention by the south african regulators 1 see

have been canvassed with the banking sector and other stakeholders during the hearings and through consultations between the enquiry technical team and relevant stakeholders as can be expected there was not meeting of minds in respect some of the recommendations it is apparent from the objectives of the act that promoting efficiency developin g the economy and providing consumers with competitive prices and product choices should be the goal of any government or regulator which seeks to protect consumers in developing economy section 211 of the competition act gives the competition commission the responsib ility to implement measures to increase market transparency section 212 b empowers the commission to enquire into and report to the minister of trade and industry on any matter concerning the promotion and maintenance of competition in the republic our constitution the supreme law of the country enjoins us to strive for democratic and open society transparency and accountability are values enshrined in our constituti on banking customers should benefit from these values as well traditiona lly banking has been secretive industry and this was manifest at times during the enquiry nevertheless nd despite participation in the enquiry being voluntary great deal of information was prov ided and examined in public some of the issues addressed in this report were highlighted but not conclusively alt with in two previous investigations into competition in the banking sector we have had the b enefit of considering some of the issues raised in the task group falkena iii and feasib ility reports2 the work in these two reports has been invaluable to us we have had the fu rther benefit of receiving submissions both verbal and written directly from the banks and other stakeholders all interested persons and stakeholders including the banks were invited to resp ond to the feasibility report and voluntarily to provide detailed information and answers on relevant questions to the enquiry the competition commission has not initiated any specific complaint and has acc ordingly not invoked its formal powers to compel the production of information and answers to question in connection with this enquiry we therefore appreciate the voluntary co operation of the banks regulators and the other stakeholders who took trouble to prepare and make s ubmissions to the enquiry the conclusions and recommendations contained in this report are based in large part on those submissions 2 see chapter 1 for summary of these reports banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 497 the banking enquiry report is the beginning of process which will assist the commissioner in deciding whether to initiate formal investigation into any of the cu rrent practices in the banking sector whilst this enquiry within the limits of its terms of reference examined the banking sector generally and was voluntary process the commissioner may follow different process based specifically on the powers given to him by the competition act and our constitutional legal framework3 in our analysis of the submissions and in making recommendations we have always been guided by this fact it is in this context that this report must be read we are aware of the fact that some of the banks have implemented some changes du ring the course of the enquiry with the view to addressing some of the issues which we re its subject matter in considering these changes the commissioner will have to cons ider their sustainability and the context in which they were undertaken we are also aware of the proposed new developments in so far as the pow ers of the competition commissioner are concerned the department of trade and ind ustry we are advised is contemplating an amendment to the competition act which will enable the commissioner to set up other enquiries similar to this one with more powe rs than is currently the case in our view there is better way to end this report than with the quote it is not the strongest of the species that survives nor the mo st intelligent but rather the one most adaptable to change4 the competition act seeks to introduce changes in the manner in which we as south africans do business those businesses which dont want to change will encounter challenges i n the south african market the business report of 15 november 2006 stated that the reserve bank governor mr tito mboweni said yesterday that it was appropriate for the competition authorities to investigate high fees in the bankin g industry the necessity for the enquiry has been confirmed by the public and stakehold ers support for which we are grateful 3 see

aging house of representatives one hundredth congress first session 25 september 1987 banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 498 82 recommendations the recommendations of the enquiry aim to address the concerns raised by various stakeholders in particular and of chief concern has been the experience that cons umers have brought to the attention of the enquiry moreover the concerns raised by merchants nonbank service providers and small banks have also been examined by the enquiry with view to making appropriate recommendations the recommendations of the enquiry set out below are summarised from the v arious chapters of the report those chapters should be referred to directly for more detail 821 recommendations on product and price comparison and switching the report identified clear need for measures aimed at improving the ability of bank customers to compare product offerings and prices and switch providers with minimum of c ost and difficulty in order to achieve these objectives the enquiry recommends standards and criteria for transparency and disclosure the banking association should develop set of minimum standards for t he disclosure of product and price information to be included in the banking association cod of banking practice5 this code should at least include criteria regarding standardisation of terminology and plain language requirement communication and provision of information to clients requirement for at least certain minimum information to be included in bank statements summary and breakdown of charges and interest both debit and credit n every account advance notice of new charges and altered charges regular rights reminder to customers the code on transparency and disclosure should be subject to process of periodic review 5 after consultation with the ombudsman for banking services c onsumer protection agencies and organisations the regulatory authorities the competition commission and other relevant bodies banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 499 the provisions of the code should be incorporated by reference into banks standard customer contracts so that the protection which they afford to customers become pa rt of the customers contractual rights capable of being enforced with the assistance of the ombudsman for banking services although membership of the banking association is not compulsory for banks and its code is therefore not binding on every bank all the major banks are members and would be bound by changes to its code should this position change or should the provisions of the voluntary code prove inadequate for the purpose described legislative or regulatory intervention would be warranted to impose appropriate standards on all banks measures to reduce search costs and improve the comparability of banks product offerings and prices while improvements in transparency and disclosure of product and price information should help reduce search costs the enquiry found that more direct and proactive measures are needed to simplify comparisons between the prices and product offerings of different banks therefore the enquiry recommends that generic customer profiles be drawn up and publicised to facilitate compariso n shopping in this regard profile is essentially typical combination of customer needs for this purpose the banking association should initiate and support an independent process to establish limited number of generic profiles that would apply to various typical customers of all banks in the middle market segments 6 once the profiles are established and publicised by the banking association the different banks can reveal in their own advertising and other information whether ho w and to what extent they accommodate them and their respective prices in that regard misleading advertising could then be combated via the advertising standards author ity or with the assistance of the ombudsman for banking services regular review would also be needed to account for changes in technology and consumer behaviour to monitor the effectiveness of the process in facilitating comparabilit and stimulating price competition 6 this will not be simple task as banks themselves apply somewhat differ ent criteria when deciding on the segmentation of their product market thus the profiles must be constructed from t he point of view of various typical customers and not from the point of view of particular banks to the extent say th at some customers may typically prefer product bundle emphasising electronic payment channels and others the facility of branc h and paperbased transactions that would have to be taken into account in deciding on the range of appropriate profil banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 500 to determine whether any changes to profiles andor the process is necessary in order to achieve the stated objectives establishment of centralised banking fee calculator service this should provide an accessible facility for consumers to input their own product requirements with assistance if necessary and obtain without cost an automatic objective indication of w here they could obtain those services and for what prices7 the competition commissioner should propose to the minister of trade and indus try that serious consideration be given to permitting comparative advertising that would allow banks to compare their own prices and product offerings directly and explicitly with those of their rivals if after two or three years the recommendations put forward to improve c omparison and switching have not been implemented or once implemented have not had the desired effect of increasing price competition and bringing prices down significantly th the competition commissioner should revisit the idea of obliging the banks to provid one or more basic banking products with similar content capable of being simply and directly compared this would enable customers whose needs would be satisfied by such particular product to compare price and choose their bank accordingly that in turn would intensify price competition and cut across the existing segmentation of the market at least to the extent that segmentation has been contrived by banks in order to mainta in market power measures to reduce switching costs and assist consumers switching easier product and price comparison will not help consumers much if it remains too expensive or troublesome to switch banks measures to reduce switching costs and assist ba nk customers in switching are therefore of crucial importance code of switching practice we recommend that the banking association develop set of criteria for switching code to be included in the banking association code of banking practice this c ode should include criteria regarding the provision of sufficient information and documentation by banks to new and existing customers explaining the process of switching in their branches schedule in terms of which the old bank is to provide the new bank with information on standing orders and direct debits within specified period of time of 7 it would be up to the banks to make available reliable product and pri cing data open to public inspection and to audit and correction by the banking association in the event of dispute i f they wish their services to be included in the answers supplied by the calculator service banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 501 receiving the request to do so schedule in terms of which the balance on the account standing orders and direct debits net of any charges and interest but including any interest due will be transferred from the old bank directly to the new bank and the account with the old bank closed within specified period of time provision to be made for customers to be exempt from paying or be refunded any fees andor interest charges which are incurred within specified period after the new account is opened as result of failure in the switching process the code on switching should also be subject to an independent process of periodic review we recommend that the national treasury encourage and pursue the notion of central fica information hub in consultation with the banking industry to see whether it could be established as central repository of customer information used to facilitate compliance with fica and operated in manner that is consistent with the antimoney laundering objectives of fica expand the mandate of the ombudsman for banking services we recommend that the role of the ombudsman for banking services be expanded to include enforcement and monitoring of compliance with the proposed codes of conduct for information disclosure and switching 822 recommendations on costing and pricing the pricing initiatives said to be aimed at reducing the feeburden on customers such as ad valorem pricing banded fee options and appropriate bundled packages which were highlighted by the banks during the course of the enquiry do not appear to be ge nerally offered to lowerincome customers it is puzzling that the benefits of such initiatives do not accrue to those who most need them building on from our recommendations on product and pricing comparison and switching we recommend that together with improving transparency standardising terminology and educating customers the banking association should encourage the appropriate application of these pricing initiatives to entry level accounts the mzansi initiative which is making considerable progress in extending bank ing services to the previously unbanked also needs constant scrutiny to ensure that the structure of its bundling and pricing is truly propoor banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 502 consideration should also be given to ensuring that recipients of social grants ar not disadvantaged by the cost of receiving and accessing their grants though bank accounts 823 recommendations on penalty fees both the level and the volume of the fees charged for rejected debit orders by th major banks provide grounds for grave disquiet payment by debit order is routinely required nowad ays for all manner of regular services which have become an essential part of everyday life reliance on debit orders is widespread throughout the mass market served by banks an d it is notable that debit order facilities have recently been added to the basic mzansi account offerings analysis of the banks data revealed that the average rate at which debit orders are rejected and thus attract penalty fee is roughly twice as high for basic savings or transmission accounts as for all ptas taken together in other words in accounts typically h eld by lower income customers relatively high proportion of debit orders presented for payment are dishonoured for insufficient funds this means that the burden of penalty fees is falling disproportionately on those least able to afford them where detailed data has been provided indications are that as much or even more revenue is earned by banks from rejected debit orders on these accounts than from the processing of successful debit orders many ordinary bank customers are not in position to pad their bank accounts with funds that are surplus to their immediate needs they face the situation where when credit s such as salary payments are delayed this causes the debit orders which they have signed in good faith to bounce for insufficient funds it is not matter of neglect or irrespons ibility but of circumstances beyond their control yet the penalty fee is applied per debit order item so that customer may face multiple penalties to add to the primary misfortune of getting paid late customers on low incomes with tight credit margins can readily find themselves lacking sufficient funds without having had any intention of defaulting on their paym ents or of breaching their undertakings to the bank it seems to us quite unacceptable that bank should recover more than the co st incurred in processing the rejections in such cases it is answer for banks to say th at on application they might reverse the penalty fee in deserving case very many consumers even if they were assured of the possible indulgence would suffer in silence rather than muster the confidence or find the time to challenge the debit when it appears on their account we recommend that cap be imposed on the price of processing rejec ted debit orders at approximately r5 per dishonoured item we have reason to believe that currently banks banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 503 would be unable fully to recover their costs ordinarily incurred in respect of rej ected debit orders within such cap such cap should be imposed by regulation it should apply both to savings and current accounts and to ordinary as well as early debit orders banks which incur add itional expenses or losses in particular cases through their customers default in respect of debit orders can terminate those customers accounts andor sue for damages the regulatory remedy should also include provision to ensure that the representation of dishonoured items cannot itself amount to an abuse whether such price regulation should be imposed using existing regulatory po wers of the sarb or by way of section 91 of the sale and service matters act 25 of 1964 as amended or by other existing or special legislation is matter on which we are not best placed to express an opinion in our view if the necessary regulatory intervention is not forthcoming withi n reasonable time the competition commissioner should recommend to the minister of trade and indu stry that he consider directing the consumer affairs committee established under the consum er affairs unfair business practices act 71 of 1988 as amended to conduct fulls cale investigation into dishonour fees in respect of debit orders charged by the four major banks should the latter act be replaced by the enactment of the consumer protecti on bill 2007 now before parliament then the necessary investigation could be initiated or cont inued as may be appropriate under the new act we also recommend that systems should be put in place by the bank s which will enable customers to cancel any direct debit instruction at any t ime by phone internet or over the counter at branch subject to written confirmation by th customer where necessary this would not alter the customers contractual obligation to the creditor in respect of payment arrangements 824 recommendations on atms and direct charging atm cash withdrawals are common activity for most bank customers in 2006 around 1 billion atm transactions were made through the network generating gross revenu in excess of r4 billion for banks we have come to the conclusion that pricing arrangements between banks have served to shelter the provision of atm services from effective price com petition and that this situation needs to be changed banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 504 in particular we are concerned with the pricing arrangements that are curren tly in place when customer of one bank uses the atm of another bank while only 15 per cent of atm transactions are of this kind ie offus transactions analysis shows that they have been unduly restricted and that the pricing arrangements in respect of them have had and continue to have repercussions for all cash withdrawal transactions made at an atm the consumer is typically charged substantially higher fee for offus transactions and for an average sized cash withdrawal substantial part of this fee is retained by the iss uing bank although it has not provided the cash dispensing service the fee that is paid b the issuing bank to the service provider that dispenses the cash for an atm transaction is generally referred to as carriage carriage is fee agreed upon between banks ie an interbank fee not only is carriage itself sheltered from competitive forces the consumer is not free to shop around for atm services but also by interbank arrangement treated as belonging to the issuing bank in all atm transactions accordingly banks own atm services to their customers are also significantly sheltered from competition if the carriage fee is abolished and the cash provider instead charges the consumer directly for the cash dispensing service ie if the direct charging model is adopted price competition can become more effective we recommend that the current interbank pricing system of carriage be replaced with model of direct charging in the atm stream as soon as possible for the direct charging model the carriage fee would be replaced by direct ch arge set by each atm service provider instead of recovering costs from the issuing bank th rough carriage fee the atm service provider would be recovering costs directly from the customer who uses the payment card the basic obligation to pay the atm service provider would shift from the issuing bank to the customer and so carriage would altogethe r fall away in this instance ie an offus transaction any existing basis for cash withdrawal fe charged by the issuing bank would also fall away we recommend that the necessary compensation to the issuer in respect of its own processing and related service to it s customer for an off us atm transaction be obtained through the issuer levying its own charge directly on its customer whether as separate charge or in any other manner our recommendation is that the change to direct charging m odel should be accompanied by regulatory prohibition whether by way of pch clearing rules or otherwise against any atm service provider discriminating in pr ice between customers using cards issued by other firms it appears to be commonplace that where direct charging banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 505 as opposed to surcharging is adopted elsewhere in the world such rule of nondiscrimination on the basis of issuer holds this has been raised as concern by smaller banks in the hearings if the recommendations which we make in this chapter regarding change to di rect charging model for atm transactions are not adopted by the banks within reasonable t ime then it would be appropriate in our view for the competition commissioner to begin formal investigation into whether or not the continuing practices of the banks regarding interbank carriage fees contravene section 4 of the competition act the implications of having direct charging for miniatms have not been f ully considered by this study and there may be other issues which require further consideration if ca rriage is to be retained in relation to miniatms then the appropriate carriage fee s hould be determined through an independent process comparable with that which is proposed fo r the setting of interchange see recommendations below given the infancy of cashback at point of sale pos and the dearth of information available to us in regard to this service we are not in position to draw conclusions as to whet her carriage could effectively be replaced by direct charging model in this context we therefore recommend that the competition commission revisit the question once adequate experience has been obtained of direct charging in atm services and consider at that stage the case for and against extending the direct charging model to cashback at pos and miniatms 825 recommendations on payment cards and interchange we recommend that an independent objective and transparent regula tory process for determining interchange in the payment card and other relevant payment streams be effected and enforced as soon as practicab such process under compulsory regulation should be based on transparent methodology have objective criteria established for each relevant payment stream through participatory process and justified in public have the resulting appropriate levels of interchange where applicable independently assessed on the basis of audited data have the integrity of the process verified under regulatory oversight banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 506 have the levels of interchange so determined thereafter enforced details on this process are set out in the chapter on payment cards and interchange we recommend that certain rules restricting the participation f duly qualified institutions as acquirers in the payment card schemes be abolish ed if the schemes do not voluntarily both formally and in practice abandon these restrictions forth with then the matter should be addressed either by the initiation of formal complaints and investigations by the competition commission or by regulatory intervention or by both the rules in question include visas general international requirement that acquirers be authorised to take deposits is in our view too restrictive in the south african context and indeed is likely increasingly to be challenged around the world however if proper regulatory and supervisory framework for nonbank acquir ers were established here schemes could in terms of their own rules requiring compliance with local laws be brought into line where necessary to ensure this the regulat ory and supervisory framework would have to oblige the relevant card schemes to accept as eligible without discrimination those banks and nonbanks meeting the domestic requirements 8 the rules or practice of restricting acquiring to institutions which issue scheme cards and indeed which issue them on significant scale in our view are cl early restrictive of competition on the acquiring side such restrictions on acquiring have legitimat basis acquiring should not be limited to issuers regarding other rules of the payment card schemes we do not recommend any interference with the card schemes current rules against merchants surcharging customers who use payment cards we accept the legitimacy of the honour all cards rule in the narrower sense but n ot the honour all products rule commonly associated with it in south africa the eliminatio n of the honour all products rule would seem most likely to facilitate the acceptanc of debit cards by freeing merchants acceptance of these cards from being tied to more expe nsive credit card acceptance if the withdrawal of the honour all products rule cannot be negotiat ed on voluntary basis with the schemes concerned then we would recommend regulation or 8 provision comparable to section 6a3 of the national payment system act 78 of 1998 as amended but tailored for the purpose is what we have in mind nonbank ac quiring is dealt with fully in the chapter of this report on access to the payment system banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 507 other appropriate statutory intervention to prohibit it if this is not forthcoming within reasonable time we would recommend that the commissioner give consideratio n to initiating and investigating complaint or complaints of possible contraventions of the comp etition act through the application of the honour all products rule we recommend that the card schemes should be requested by the competition commission formally and forthwith to withdraw their prohibitio ns on pure cashback at pos at least to the extent that such transactions are permitted under domestic law failing satisfactory responses in that regard we would recommend regulatory measures to correct the situation decisively if such measures are not forthcoming then th commissioner should consider initiating complaint and investigating the relevant scheme rules for possible contravention of the competition act as prohibited restrictive practices we make the following recommendations regarding interchange in other payment streams in our view even though eft debit transactions meet the basic criterion of twos ided market the actual necessity of interchange in this payment stream has not been demonstrated we are not in position to say conclusively on the basis of the information voluntarily submitt ed to us that it has been proved not to be necessary consideration should therefore be given by the competition commissioner to initiating complaint with reference to sect ion 41 b and alternatively section 41 of the competition act in order formally to investigate possible contravention or contraventions arising from the past and current interbank arrangem ents in respect of interchange in this stream as regards the future if interchange is to be levied in re lation to eft debit transactions then we recommend it ought to be included within the regulated proc ess which we set out for interchange generally and so be subject to the p articipatory procedures involved in arriving at and implementing an appropriate level of intercha nge the first step would be to establish whether the interchange in this stream is necess ary at all we recommend that the interchange fees applicable to edo transacti ons also be brought within the transparent and objective regulatory scheme which we propose for payment cards and other payment streams once again establishing the necessity of interchange for the edo stream would be fundamental to the process that exercise will also help clarify the extent to which banks pricing to users in these streams is in excess of costs and whether specific investigation into excessive pricing either under the competition act or consumer protection legislation is warranted banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 508 826 recommendations on ac cess to the payment system the existing regulatory regime for the national payment system does not appear to meet the needs of south african consumers for competitive and technically innovative payment services the approach of largely ignoring nonbank activities has begun to shift but persist ence in the view that only clearing banks may participate in clearing and settlement is not an pproach that will best serve south africas interest we are convinced of the need for revision of the regulatory approach and the development of an appropriate regul atory regime for payment system activity which is functionallybased rather than institutionally based so as to ensure quality of access those participating in payment activity should be adequat ely regulated regardless of whether they are clearing banks or not we recommend an approach that requires an explicit access policy fo r banks and non banks alike our recommendations regarding the regulation of the national payment system ar as follows an access regime that includes nonbank providers of payment services should be developed so as to allow for their participation under effectiv regulation and supervision in both clearing and settlement activities in ap propriate lowvalue or retail payment streams there are international precedents such as those from australia and the european union that suggest that an access regime of this sort can be designed that does not threaten the systemic stability of the existing system the national payment system act should be revised this would allow for nonbanks to be clearing and even settlement participants and hence members of pasa it would allow for different types of participants and membership of pchs once the nps act has been redrafted the associated sarb and pasa position papers and directives would also have to be revised obvious examples are the ba nk models position paper to accommodate the realities of postbank and ithala and the emo ney position paper as well as the directives on system operators and third party providers the membership and governance of pasa should be revised so s to include qualified nonbank participants pasa is the delegated selfregulatory authority of the payments system in our opinion this position together with the profess ed view of the npsd that their remit and that of the payment system management body extends throughout payment system activity means that pasa membership should be extended to participating nonbanks however this does not necessarily require all members to be on an equal footing more nuanced membership of pasa such as exists in the australian payment system would banking enquiry report to the competition commissioner contains confidential informationchapter 8 conclusion and recommendations 509 lead the way to improved governance as the current and currently proposed governance structures are dominated by the biggest banks which have the greatest volume and values through the system in an environment where both bank and nonbank members of pchs can be members of pasas highest authority its council governance concerns associated with clearing banks regulating nonbank competitors will tend to diminish moreover system whereby the executive officer of pasa rather than t he incumbent members of pch takes the decision regarding the entry of new participants havi ng met the appropriate requirements for pch is also recommended the selfregulatory approach of pasa gives it considerable authority in the nps which creates need for more regular and formal reporting requirement to its overs eer npsd we recommend that such formalised reporting mechanism be put in place payment system ombud should be established this entity would play the role of an ombud to payment system participants or prospective participants t he ombud could assess whether or not applications have been fairly dealt with and whether or t they have been fairly treated in terms of access and the pricing of such access includ ed in the remit of such an ombud would be the entire ambit of the payment arena and it would include access to the infrastructure of bankserv or the relevant pch operator acces s to settlement accounts processing of membership of pasa processing of pch applications and so on the enquiry recommends that the competition commission together with the payment system ombud keeps bankservs pricing practices under observation given its current dominant position in the industry banking enquiry report to the

enquiry into competition in banking composition of the enquiry and terms of reference introduction 1 the purpose of the competition act set out in section 2 is to promote and maintain competition in the republic in order to promote the efficiency adaptability and development of the economy b to provide consumers with competitive prices and product choices c to promote employment and advance the social and economic welfare of south africans d to expand opportunities for south african participation in world markets and recognise the role of foreign competition in the republic to ensure that small and mediumsized enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in the economy and f to promote greater spread of ownership in particular to increase the ownership stakes of historically disadvantaged persons 2 section 21 of the competition act gives the competition commission the responsibility and the function among others to implement measures to increase market transparency and to enquire into and report to the minister of trade and industry on any matter concerning the purposes of the act 3 in 2004 the task group for the national treasury the south african reserve bank recommended that the competition commission should investigate the possibility of complex monopoly in the governance and operation of the national payments system the commission is also aware of widespread public concern regarding the level of charges made by banks and other providers of payment services to consumers 4 following on the findings in the research report the national payment system and competition in the banking sector the commission announced earlier this year that it would hold an enquiry in terms of section 21 into particular aspects of competition in banking terms of reference 5 the subject matter of the enquiry will be the level and structure of charges made by banks as well as by other providers of payment services including i the relation between the costs of providing retail banking andor banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential informationappendices 513 payment services and the charges for such services ii the process by which charges are set and iii the level and scope of existing and potential competition in this regard b the feasibility of improving access by nonbanks and wouldbe banks to the national payment system infrastructure so that they can compete more effectively in providing payment services to consumers c any other aspect relating to the payment system or the abovementioned charges which could be regarded as anticompet itive 6 the objects of this enquiry are in connection with the subject matter stated above to increase transparency and competition in the relevant markets b to ascertain whether there are grounds upon which the competition commissioner should initiate and the commission consequently use its powers to investigate any specific complaints of contraventions of the competition act c to engage with the banks other providers of payment services the appropriate regulatory authorities and other stakeholders in order to ascertain the extent to which consistent with the soundness of the banking and payments system there could realistically be improvements in the conditions affecting competition in the relevant markets including increased access to the national payments infrastructure d to enable the commission to report to the minister and make recommendations on any matter needing legislative or regulatory attention panel 7 the enquiry is to be

appendix f complex monopoly collective dominance and tacit collusion the purpose of this appendix is to address briefly three matters of legal nature which arise in connection with an analysis of market power and with the behaviour of firm s in an oligopolistic market the are complex monopoly b collective dominance and c tacit collusion complex monopoly in 2004 the task group falkena iii report recommended that th competition commission should investigate the possibility of complex monopoly in the governance and operation of the national payment system it also advised the concept of complex monopoly should become part of the vocabulary of the competition commission complex monopoly occurs when firms whether voluntarily or not and with or without agreement between them so conduct their business that it prevent s restricts or distorts competition this would give the competition commission scope t investigate anti competitive behaviour even where it does not involve proven collusion4 the concept of complex monopoly does not have any foundation in south african competition law the concept was but is longer used in uk competition legislation the uk fair trading act of 1973 since repealed provided for monopoly situat ions to be referred by the office of fair trading oft to the competition commission i n that country for investigation following investigation va rious remedies including if appropriate structural remedy were available to the secretary of state5 monopoly situations could be of structural or behavioural type an example of structural monopoly was scale monopoly where at least one quarter of the goods or services of particular description supplied in the uk were supplied by or to one and the same person complex monopoly on the other hand was an example of behavioural monopoly where at least one quarter of the relevant goods or services were supplied by two or more persons who whether by agreement or otherwise so conducted their respective affairs as to prevent restrict or distort competition6 complex monopoly was thus term of uk legislative art it enabled parallel conduc t by firms not prohibited by the competition act to be scrutinised by the competition commission under the fair trading act firms could be considered part of complex monopoly in terms of the fair trading act without necessarily being found t be collectively dominant in terms of the competition act or article 82 of the european treaty see below 4 exhibit h p iv p 155 5 richard whish competition law 4th edition p 363 6 id pp 3645 encyclopedia

report appeared the fair trading act had in fact been repealed and replaced by the uk enterprise act 2002 com plex monopoly disappeared with the fair trading act under the new provisions of the enterprise ac t the oft has power to make reference to the competition commission for purp oses of market investigation where it has reasonable grounds for suspecting that any feature or combination of features of market prevent restrict or distort competition wide array of powers is available to the commission following its investigation including where appropriate the power to impose structural remedy7 it does not appear that any advantage was lost but on the contrary it seems that greater flexibility was gained by giving up the concept of complex monopoly in the uk law we see reason to import the concept into our legislative framework the present enquiry has been conducted on the basis of the general powers of the competition commission contemplated by section 21 of the competition act 89 of 1998 the department of trade and industry is reported to be considering possible amendment s to the competition act including expanded powers on the part of the competitio n commission to conduct market investigations our views based on the experience of the present enquiry have not been sought and it is not part of our mandate under our terms of reference to consider and make recommendations in that regard b collective dominance article 82 formerly article 86 of the european treaty prohibits any abuse by one or more undertakings of dominant position this wording raises the question of collective dominance by firms although that expression is not actually used in our competition act by contrast it is simply prohibited for dominant firm to abuse its dominance in any of the ways specified8 concept of collective dominance appears to be invoked in our competition law each firms position must be evaluated on its own ter ms at first sight this may seem flaw but on closer study in our opinion it turns out not to be the case in examining whether particular firm has market power the ultimate tes t for dominance in terms of section 7 of our competition act one must consider whether the firm has the power inter alia to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its customers9 in an oligopolistic market firms independence of its customers its ability for example to raise prices significantly and sustain them without significantly losing sa will depend on the reliance it can place on the behaviour that will be forthcoming from its rivals in response 7

competition commissioner contains confidential information to its pricing decisions where the individual firm can rely on the response of the other firms not being vigorously competitive one that is factor which is properly to be taken into account when assessing whether the firm concerned has appreciable market power in an oligopolistic market whether or not each firm actually derives market power from the behaviour of the other firms whether and to what extent it is able to rely on non competitive response from them is always question of fact the likely beha viour of the other major firms in such market is thus factor contributing to the market power which each of them may have individually the market power of each thus depend s upon the others their market power would be interdependent in that sense but each would have it or not as the case may be special concept of collective dominance seems unnecessary to the analysis and it is unclear what if any thing it adds in the jurisdictions where it is employed10 section 791 of the canadian competition act applies test of dominance by requiri ng finding that one or more persons substantially or completely control class or species of business the competition bureau counterpart of our competition commission considers control to be synonymous with market power where market power is the ability to profitably set prices above competitive levels for considerable period of time11 the canadian competition act provides for prohibition order to be made by the competition tribunal in cases where persons who are collectively dominant gage in practice of anticompetitive acts likely to prevent or lessen competition substantially i n market12 the wording of the act clearly contemplates cases where group of unaffiliated firms may possess market power even if single member of the group is dominant by itse lf in joint dominance cases there are three sources of competition that can defeat the profitability of price increase these are competition from existing rivals outside the allegedly jointly dominant group competition from potential rivals ie entrants outside the allegedly jointly dominant group and competition from within the allegedly jointly dominan t group given this an additional element of proof is necessary to establish joint contr ol or market power by more than one firm as compared to the case of single dominant firm the jurisprudence provides only limited insights into the additio nal evidence necessary to establish control by group of firms to date there have been only tw cases involving joint dominance under the act13 in both instances the fact that joint dominance existed was taken 10 see sutherland and kemp competition law of south africa 714 cf irvine does the south

appendices 537 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information as given and was supported by an explicit agreement group of firms that collectively possesses market power may be able to coordinate its actions in manner that allows the market price to be profitably i ncreased above the non coordinated price levels without the firms entering into an expli cit agreement firms within an oligopoly normally base their decisions on how their rivals have behaved i n the past in addition firms recognize that their current decisions may affect their rivals future reactions the fact that firms recognize these interactions over longer t ime period results in competitive response strategies becoming more complex it is po ssible for firms to act in consciously parallel fashion thereby achieving higher profits than would be the case in competitive environment the jurisprudence in respect of the criminal conspiracy provi sions is clear in not condemning conscious parallelism14 the bureau has adopted similar position with respect to the abuse provisions recognizing that something more than mere conscious parall elism must exist before the bureau can reach conclusion that firms are pa rticipating in some form of coordinated activities the ability of group of firms to coordinate actions without entering into an explicit agreement can be addressed under the abuse provisions to infer control by group of fir ms the bureau will consider the following whether the group of firms collectively accounts for large sh are of the relevant market b any evidence that the alleged coordinated behaviour is intended t increase price or is for the purpose of engaging in some form of anticompetitive act c any evidence of barriers to entry into the group or barriers to entrants into the relevant market d any evidence based on the particular facts of the case that mbers of the group have acted to inhibit intragroup rivalry and any evidence that significant number of customers cannot exercise countervailing power to offset the attempted abuse 15 it does not seem to us that any of these factors would be left out of account in an investigation under our competition act as to whether particular firm or each fir m on list of firms in an oligopolistic market actually possesses market power as defined in ur view all relevant structural and behavioural facts and circumstances must be take n into account in evaluating whether firm has such power where oligopolists are able to act in parallel so as to avoid competitive outcomes in the market concerned although they may remain within the law in doing so the ev idence of this ability will serve as evidence of the degr ee of independence of its customers that is enjoyed by each of the firms concerned it is therefore difficult to see that t he test for collective dominance outlined above would really enlarge the number of firm s in respect of which an individual finding of dominance could be made the concept of collective dominance does not seem to add anything definite or material to the exercise 24 trib dec ct940219 14 the author cites r v canadian general electric 1974 17 ccc

confidential information european jurisprudence points towards the same conclusion richard whis h writes16 one of the most complex and controversial issues in community competition law has been the application or nonapplication of article 82 ec and the cmr merger regulations to socalled collective dominance discussion of this question in relation to article 82 can be traced back at least to the early 1970s an enormous body of literature has developed the law and decisional practice on collective dominance under both legal in struments developed considerably in 1998 to 2002 of particular importance are the ecjs european court of justice judgments in france v commission the socalled kali und salz case17 and compagnie maritime belge transports sa v commission 18 and the cfis court of first instance judgments in gencor v commission 19 and airtours v commission20 in the 1970s in hoffmannla roche v commission21 the ecj had held dominant position must also be distinguished from parallel c ourses of conduct which are peculiar to oligopolies in that in an oligopoly the courses of conduct interact whilst in the case of an undertaking occupying dominant position the conduct of the undertaking which derives profits from that position is to great extent determined unilaterally however subsequent european cases have amply confirmed that undertakings firms can derive their dominance or market power their ability to behave to an appreciable extent independently of say their customers from the adoption of common conduct in market even where they are not united by structural links or by actual agreements or understandings22 thus in compagnie maritime belge transports sa v commission the ecj held the existence of an agreement or of other links in law is not indispensable to finding of collective dominant position such finding may be based on other c onnecting factors and would depend on an economic assessment and in particular on an assessment of the structure of the market in question23 in gencor v commission the cfi had to deal with proposed merger of platinum and rhodium producers which in the view of the commission was incompatible with the common market in that it would create or strengthen dominant position that would hinder competition the court held that the merger regulations although referring on ly to dominant position should be interpreted so as to apply also where the cre ation or strengthening of collective dominant position would result that is to say dominant position held by the parties to the concentration together

in terms of market concentration transparency and product homogeneity those parties are in position to anticipate one anothers behaviour and are therefore strongly encouraged to align their conduct in the market in particular in such way as to maximise th eir joint profits by restricting production with view to increasing prices in such context each trader is aware that highly competitive action on its part designed to increase its m arket share for example price cut would provoke identical action by the others so that it would derive benefit from its initiative all the traders would thus be affected by the r eduction in price levels25 thus market conditions may be such that each undertaking may become aware of common interests and in particular cause prices to increase without having to enter into an agreement or resort to concerted practice26 in our view this approach can serve just as well as basis for the evaluation of the degree of market power enjoyed by each firm in such market need would seem to arise for special concept of collective dominance in order to arrive at findings of dominance based on market power in terms of chapter 2 part b of our competition act section 12a of our competition act dealing with consideration of mergers similarly requires consideration to be given inter alia to the probability that firms in the market after the merger will behave competitively or cooperatively by watching anticipating and shadowing each other oligopolists may behave cooperatively without crossing the line to prohibited agreements and concerted practices which are the hallmarks of actual collusion and cartels c tacit collusion while parallel behaviour by oligopolists may provide evidence of market power n their part and thus place them under the legal duty not to abuse their dominance it does not follow that their behaviour would necessarily contravene the provisions of the competition act 24 125 25 276 26 277 cf also airtours v commission supra appendices 540 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information prohibiting competitors from engaging in restrictive horizontal practices27 john campbell notes that section 41 of the south african competition act prohibits an agreement between or concerted practice by firms or decision by an association of f irms between parties in horizontal relationship that brings about or constitutes restri ctive horizontal practice the prohibition in article 811 of the treaty of rome governing european comm unity competition law is in virtually identical terms as is s 21 of the engl ish competition act of 1998 the formulation in the united states is directed at every contr act combination in the form of trust or otherwise or conspiracy that is anticompetitive and in aust ralia anticompetitive conduct in the form of contract an arrangement or an understanding is the target the different formulations are directed at precisely the same conduct28 section 1 of our competition act provides that an agreement when used in rela tion to prohibited practice includes contract arrangement or understanding whether or not legally enforceable and concerted practice means cooperative or coordi nated conduct between firms achieved through direct or indirect contact that replaces their independent action but which does not amount to an agreement as defined these definitions are as clear and precise in their distinctions as language will allow the difficulty lies in determining when parallel conduct by firms is the result of contact whether direct or indirect between them which has replaced their independent action this is problem of evidence and of the proper characterisation of any conduct proved to have taken place it is not made easier by the widespread use of loose terminology that obliterates the distinctions which the legislature has taken care to make tacit collusion is an example of terminology that has come to be used in way that confuses rather than cl arifies the issues writers on competition economics are in the habit of using the expression tacit collusion to refer without distinction to conduct which crosses and conduct which does not cross the line of legal prohibition referred to above this is because it may make differe nce to the economic result whether the conduct crosses that line or not29 27 see section 4 of the competition act parties are in horizontal rela tionship if they are actual or potential competitors 28 brassey ed competition law chapter 5 restrictive horizontal practices pp 129130 29 whish writes op cit 5th edition p 508 there is little doubt that there are markets in which it is possible for economic operators to coordinate their behaviour without entering into an agr eement or being party to concerted practice in the sense of article 811 or the chapter i prohibition such behaviou r will be to their own selfadvantage and to the disadvantage of customers and ultimately consumers this situat ion is often described by economists as tacit collusion enjoying the benefits of particular market structure without actually entering into an agreement to do so if the firms in question had achieved the same end through xplicit collusion economists would have the same objection that prices would be higher than they would be without coordination economists have particular interest in whether collusion is tacit or explicit it is the effects of the collusion that matter lawyers however are considerabl less comfortable with the expression tacit collusion collus ion is the evil at which article 81 and the chapter i prohibition are directed any agreement or concerted practice which has as its object or effect the prevention restriction or distortion of competition in the same way secti on 1 of the us sherman act forbids every contract in restraint of trade where the notion of collusiveness is in herent in the idea of contract in fact section 1 of the s herman act also prohibits every combination and conspiracy in res traint of trade words which likewise import the noti on of collusion appendices 541 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information michael d whinston writes30 for example imagine scenario in which two firms sit down at table w ith each declaring in sequence i am mortally opposed to price fixing but tomorrow i will set my price equal to 100 should such unilateral speech be treated differently than if they instead each said ill set my price equal to 100 if you do and does that differ from the situ ation in which firm 1 says lets set our prices equal to 100 tomorrow and firm 2 replies i agree the problem with this set of examples is that it characterises the first scenario somewhat naively as involving only unilateral conduct in fact the act of the two firms in deliberately conveying their pricing intentions to each other in this way while avoiding actual or apparent agreement could well be characterised as procuring coordinated conduct through di rect or indirect contact that replaces their independent action that would fall within the definition of concerted practice in our competition act campbell illustrates aptly the legal boundaryline between unilateral and collusive conduct31 assume that apple farmers in the western cape number about fifty some are bigger than others and one or two are very big indeed one of these raises the pric of apples and soon the others follow is this concerted practice prima facie evidence of one or just the normal workings of the market clearly costs rise and sooner or later producers will have to adjust their prices to preserve their viability someone has to be the fir st to do so and the news will always leak out generally sooner rather than later the competition laws are not designed to hit parallel conduct of t his description more is required there must be evidence of contact direct or indirect and of so form of co operation direct contact is relatively straightforward if two or more farmers following the above example set price for apples by means of direct notificat ion between them of the prices they intend to charge and with the understanding that neither will under cut the other court will have little difficulty in finding concerted practice b ut such communications can also take place without any such notification through indirect contact for example where the farmers hold press conferences in order to state their views on issues such as output prices demand costs industry margins of profit etc the more farmers that speak publicly in this manner the greater the level of communication and in this way behav iour can be both instigated and modified in ici v the commission32 the european court was fully aware of these possibilities although every producer is to change his prices taking into acc ount in so doing the present or foreseeable conduct of his competitors nevertheless it is c ontrary to the rules on competition contained in the treaty for producer to cooperat with his competitors in any way whatsoever in order to determine coordinated course of act ion relating to price increase and to ensure its success by prior elimination of all unc ertainty as to each others conduct regarding the essential elements of that action such as t he amount subjectmatter date and place of the increases something more than mere indirect contact must be required if innocent price leadership is not to be caught in the net it is undesirable and probably impossible to provide numerus clausus of the additional ingredients but they must be such as to remove the r isk of for example increasing prices or at more general level involve some organization or plan that replaces genuinely independent

whether overt or covert in which written or oral contract is established among cartel members or an impli cit tacit agreement which simply establishes common understanding among suppliers as to the benefits of cooperative pricing or output decisions and the consequences of deviations from cooperation the concept of tacit agreement or tacit collusion covers wide range of behaviour at one end of this range the distinction between tacit agreement and an explicit agree ment can be as tenuous as the difference between wink and handshake at the other end of the range of tacit collusion the border between agreement and rational independent be haviour by competing suppliers becomes murky in many oligopolies each fi rm in the market sets price close to the monopoly level purely as matter of individual interest with communication whatsoever with other firms the recognition by each firm of responses by ot her firms to potential price cuts leads to nonaggressive pricing do firms in any oligopoly not consider their rivals reactions to potential price changes despite these clear passages the authors go on to suggest that tacit collus ion between competitors is outside the scope of the law34 that cannot be correct tacit merely means unspoken silent or wordless the fact that collusion is tacit rather than express in way suffices to remove it from the prohibition this can readily be illustrated by examining the use of the word tacit in conjunction with agreement is an unspoken silent or wordless agreement between firms in horizontal relationship outside the scope of the prohibitions against price and other forms of market fixing it would be startling if the law could be so easily circumvented in the law of contract the concept of tacit term is well recognised it is used to denote an unexpressed term read into an otherwise express agreement on the basis of the unarticulated but nevertheless inferred or imputed intention of the parties to treat the term as binding between them the inference or imputation is usually derived from the express terms of the agreement and the surrounding circumstances35 and just as there can be tacit term 33 the law and economics of

means of words spoken or written but this is not always so the offeror may choose to make his i ntention clear by conduct unaccompanied by words in which case his offer would properly be descr ibed as tacit or partly tacit such an offer could also be described as an offer by conduct or by actions or an implied offer countless offers of this sort are made daily in shops buses and railway stations

acceptance as well as by words expressing acceptance generally it can be stated that what is required in order t create binding contract is that acceptance of an offer should be made manifest by some unequivocal act from which the inference of acceptance can logically be drawn it being possible to make an offer tacitly and to accept tacitly i t follows that tacit offer may be tacitly accepted

differently that such behavior itself constitut sherman act offense circumstantial evidence of consciously parallel behavior may have made heavy inroads into the traditional judicial attitude toward conspiracy but consci ous parallelism has not yet read conspiracy out of the sherman act entirely39 american antitrust author and federal appeals judge richard posner has argued for new legal boundaryline which would prohibit unilateral parallel conduct by fir m in cases where it is intentionally rather than unconsciously parallel in character40 tacit collusion is not an unconscious state if the firms sales manager recommends that the firm offer wider variety of products in order to exploit consumer demand more effectively and the financial vice president recommends against that course on the grou nd that it will make it more difficult for the industry to maintain healthy pr ices the president of the firm can be in doubt of the significance of his action if he adopts the financia l vice presidents recommendation or if salesman has correctly calculated that pr oposed sale would yield handsome profit and his boss turns it down on the ground that it might prov oke competitor to retaliate because the sale price would be considered price cutting gain there would be ambiguity that the firms action was designed to preserve col lusive arrangement or take the common case in which each seller in market has sleepers that is customers who do not shop around for the best deal but are content with their current s upplier if each seller declines to try to wake the other sellers sleepers on the ground that if he does so the others will try to wake his sleepers and everyone will then be worse off the ller will know that he is acting to preserve collusive arrangement in our view this argument begs the question which it is supposed to address ne of the conduct described is necessarily indicative of the existence of collusive arrangement or conversely necessarily inconsistent with purely unilateral calculations by the firm concerned payment may be taken to be offering to furnish them for re asonable compensation the question of fact in each case is whether reasonable person in the position of the other party w ould understand that payment was expected for the services and that they were not gratuitous in 313 the author dds that an acceptance likewise

contains confidential information about the likely conduct of its competitors in the event that it were to adopt particular output or pricing choice the difference between express collusion and tacit collusion is that in the latter instance the firms conspire ie arrange to act together without needing to use words collusion whether express or tacit requires more than that the firms separately arrive at the same conscious calculation of selfinterest taking each others likely behaviour into account it is essential not to confuse the common rational behaviour of oligopolists who necessarily and indeed by definition take into account the likely behaviour of their competit ors with tacit collusion between the firms concerned the approach advocated by posner would demand of firms behaviour that is not rational market conduct in their circumstances in the examples which he puts forward he would in each case require of the firm shortterm profit maximising decision which while understandably recommended by the sales staff is understood by the senior executives to be likely to reduce profit in the longer term expecting oligopolists not to behave as oligopolists ie not to take each others likely conduct into account is to repudiate the rationality of individual conduct which is the central claim of the market system as means of regulating social production and distribution it is to expect of market participants that they should while facing competition abandon the calculation of selfinterest in their business decisions such an approach is too hazy to recommend itself as solution to the serious competition issues that are posed by oligopoly behaviour behavioural prohibitions requir clear delineation or else the rule of law is undermined if for structural reasons r ational market decisions must produce an antisocial result and behavioural prohibitions are unsui table the remedy must be sought in regulatory or other intervention of public power it is with these considerations in mind that we have addressed the issues and assess ed the available evidence discussed in this report appendices 546 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information appendix g concurrent jurisdiction as defence the effect of the atm pch agreement and rules at the hearing of the enquiry on 25 may 2007 absa drew attention to the issue of concurrent jurisdiction in regard to banking practices which comply with current regulatory stipulations although they may be thought to fall foul of the competition act41 the discussion concerned access to the national payment system and nonbank ac quiring but the principles would be applicable equally for example to the question of interbank arrangements in respect of offus atm transactions banking is an industry under the regulatory authority of the minister of finance and of the south african reserve bank the sarb the same applies to the national payments system section 4 of the competition act prohibiting restrictive practices by parties in horizontal relationship ie by actual or potential competitors is part of chapter 2 of the competition act section 31a of the act provides in so far as this act applies to an industry or sector of an in dustry that is subject to the jurisdiction of another regulatory authority which authority has jurisdiction in respect of conduct regulated in terms of chapter 2 or 3 of this act this act must be construed as establishing concurrent jurisdiction in respect of that conduct b the manner in which the concurrent jurisdiction is exercised in terms of this act and any other public regulation must be managed to the extent possible in accordanc with any applicable agreement concluded in terms of section 211 h and 821 and 2 section 211 h gives the competition commission the responsibility to negotiate agreements with any regulatory authority to coordinate and harmonise the exercise of jurisdiction over competition matters within the relevant industry or sector and to ens ure the consistent application of the principles of the competition act section 82 deals further with the negotiation of such agreements such agreements as are in existence currently between the competition commission and these authorities do not operate to reconcile the regulatory arrangements applicable to atm service provision with the principles of the competition act that is matter which in our view needs attention in the absence of relevant agreement the issue raised by absa must be addressed on general principles the clear implication of sections 211 h and 82 of the competition act is that the legislation empowering other regulatory authorities should as far as possible be interpreted 41 transcript pp 101103 appendices 547 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information consistently with the principles of the competition act such other legislation should never lightly be read as having been intended to permit anticompetitive conduct i t would be contrary to legal principle and public policy to construe such other legislation as suggesting or encouraging the disregard of the basic competition law enacted by parliament in our view furthermore where the law in terms of which the other releva nt authority exercises its concurrent jurisdiction may permit but does not actually require the conduct allegedly contravening the competition act the existence of concurrent jurisdiction would not provide defence42 the question also arises as to what the legal outcome would be where the applicable regulatory provisions cater only for particular mode of agreement or arrangement devised by the parties in the horizontal relationship themselves that would allegedly contravene the competition act in our view if the parties could have devised and obtained ap proval for an agreement or arrangement that would not contravene the act but failed to do so they ought not to have such defence the provisions of the current pch agreement between banks that is applicable t offus atm transactions together with the accompanying clearing rules applied by the payment system management body pasa do not explicitly require any particular pricing arrangement nevertheless they are obviously predicated on the current charging m odel so far as we can see there is nothing to prevent banks entering into an atm pch agreement and obtaining through pasa appropriate clearing rules predicated on direct charging model 42 in the united states the socalled state action doctrine provides def ence to alleged contraventions of federal antitrust law this doctrine applies under certain circumstanc where states have created their own regulatory regime that displaces competition in certain market s see hovenkamp antitrust 4th edition pp 332337 however historically the state action doctrine applie d only to conduct mandated by the state see eg goldfarb v virginia state bar 421 us 773 95 s ct 2004 1975 where the state merely authorises the conduct under its regulatory regime the conduct is not generally shi elded from antitrust enforcement it may be different however where the r egulatory scheme itself depends on the conduct which would otherwise be condemned for example where the scheme of regulation necessarily involves the participants setting price or engaging in other antic ompetitive conduct cf eg southern motors carriers rate conference v us 471 us48 105 sct 1721 1985 also where the state itself does not conduct cf hoover v ronwin 446

whish competition law 5th edition p 128 this defence has been raised on numerous occasions bu t has always failed for successful defence it would seem that three req uirements must be satisfied first the state must have made certain conduct compulsory mere persuasion is insufficient secondly the defence is available only where there is legal basis for this compul sion and thirdly there must be latitude at all for individual choice as to the implementati on of the governmental policy broadly speaking similar criteria would not seem to jar with the approach to concurrent jurisdiction as contemplated by our competition act appendices 548 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information appendix h fica and direct charging this appendix sets out reasons for the view that in the absence of suitable exemption fica might present an impediment to the implementation of the direct charging mod for offus atm transactions in terms of section 21 of fica an accountable institution an expression whic h includes banks43 may not establish business relationship or conclude single transaction44 with client45 unless the accountable institution has taken the prescribed steps to establish and verify inter alia the identity of the client this presents of course unusual difficulty in the case of onus atm transactions because in that case the atm service provider transacting with the client and th institution which has issued the card to the client are one and the same the issuer would ordinarily have complied with fica when entering into its business relationship with t he client46 or would have been required to do so subsequently in terms of that act47 however the matter is different where offus atm transactions occur here the user ordinarily has preexisting relationship with the atm provider the prescribed steps48 in terms of fica for establishing and verifying inter alia the identity of the client are such that they could not practically be taken by the atm provider itself in that situation the customer approaches the termin the card goes in buttons are pressed electronic signals fly and the cash come s out or payment is effected the relationship between atm provider and customer in off us situations is impersonal momentary and mechanical accordingly the atm provider would not have complied and would not be able to comply with fica if fica were to be applicable to that 43 accountable institution is defined in section 1 of fica as m eaning person referred to in schedule 1 that schedule contains 19 items item 6 refers to person who carries on the busi ness of bank as defined in the banks act 1990 act 94 of 1990 item 7 refers to mutual banks item 14 to the postbank which is excluded from the banks act and item 16 to ithala which has an exemption under the banks act 44 single transaction is defined in section 1 of fica as meanin g transaction other than transaction concluded in the course of business

shops clientele are its customers the shorter oxford english dictionary although the word client may usually imply professional relationship here in its actual context which must include the full range of business entities identified as accountable institut ions in schedule 1 of fica it could be held to bear the broader meaning 46 business relationship is defined in section 1 of fica s meaning an arrangement between client and an accountable institution for the purpose of concluding transactions on regular basis 47 read with government notice r749 government gazette 26487 of 21 june 2004 48 see government notice r1595 government gazette 24176 of 20 december 2002 chapter 1 appendices 549 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information service provider in respect of the transaction under current arrangements between banks the problem is avoided because the offus atm provider does not conclude transaction with the cardholder instead the atm provider undertakes the cash dispensing or other atm service on behalf of the issuer the latter by means of this outsourcing arrangement49 itself provides the cashdispensing or other atm service to and enters into the relevant transaction with the client thus c urrently the offus atm service provider is not required to take the steps prescribed under fica for establishing and verifying inter alia the identity of the cardholder in respect of the transaction change to direct charging for atm services would mean that in offus situatio ns as well transaction would be concluded directly between the atm service provider and the cardholder to whom the cash is dispensed or other atm service is supplied would it necessarily follow that in offus situations the atm service provider would be in br each of fica for failing being unable in fact to establish and verify inter alia the identity of the client where the atm service provider is not bank it would ordinarily not be an accountable institution within the meaning of fica50 and so would not be required to take the prescribed steps to establish and verify inter alia the identities of those with whom it enters into transactions the fact that it would be unable in any case to take the steps pr escribed by fica is thus irrelevant fica simply would not apply we are confronted ther efore by the anomaly that banks51 which are accountable institutions could having the same inability to take the prescribed steps where they directly provide the service in offus atm transactions be held to be in contravention of fica whereas nonbank atm providers woul d ordinarily be in the clear it is arguable that an offus atm transaction with stranger would not be transaction as defined in fica ie one concluded between client and an accountable institution in accordance with the type of business carried on by that institution w hen the institution concerned is bank it is similarly arguable t hat the banks customer in such case is not its client as contemplated by fica because accountholding by the customer with that bank is involved however this is an area where clarity and certainty rather than p oints of argument are needed for institutions to rely on current exemptions from the provisions of fica and the regulations do not seem to cover 49 it is unnecessary to consider whether agency or rather simply mandat would describe the legal relationship involved here 50 likewise merchants providing cashback at the point of sale would ordinarily not be accountable institutions as contemplated by fica note however that nonbank atm service prov ider or indeed an entity providing cashback at the point of sale might also be engaged in some other kind of business dealing in foreign exchange for example which is referred to in the list in schedule 1 in that case it w ould be an accountable institution 51 also mutual banks the postbank and ithala appendices 550 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains

gazette 27011 of 19 november 2004 does not seem to cover the situation of direct charging where the offus atm service provider concludes transaction directly with the customer and not simply with the issuing bank acting on the customers behalf paragraph 17 does serve to limit the scope of the particulars required and the records to be kept where withdrawals transfers and payments not exceeding r5 0 00 per day or r25 000 per month are involved and where accounts with balances not exceeding r25 000 are maintained however the remaining particulars and records which are required would themselves

appendices 551 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information appendix i the payment card reforms in australia 1 introduction leading the drive to regulate the interchange fee has been the reserve bank of australia rba54 it has been concluded earlier in this chapter that an interchangesetting methodology which merely quantifies certain costs and does not assess demand elasticities can not be adequate for achieving the legitimate purpose of interchange as mechanism balancing the two sides of twosided market it has been concluded further that in calculating relevant co sts on the issuing side as necessary ingredient in interchange setting the costs of credit extension should not be included having regard to these fundamental considerat ions the banking enquiry panel cannot recommend for south africa the methodology adopted in australi for regulating interchange nevertheless the australian experience remains highly instructive 2 background to the reforms in australia the prices surveillance authorities psa raised the first questions about interchange fees and ad valorem merchant service fees in report on credit card interest rates in 199255 these issues were again raised in 1995 with the psa concluding that the interchange fees on credit and debit cards were unlikely to be priced efficient ly56 in its 199596 annual report the australian payments system council questioned the mechanisms of the card schemes and rationales for their pricing structures57 the financial system inquiry the wallis committee was established in 1996 t look into the efficiency and governance of the payments system58 its report in 1997 recommended that the australian competition and consumer commission accc and new payments system board psb within the rba review the credit and debit card interchange fee arrangements as well as limitations on access to the mastercard and visa card schemes 54 mastercard worldwide insights first quarter 2007 interchange regulation lessons learned from t he rba intervention in australia p 1 55 in wideranging inquiry that looked at amongst other thi ngs the profitability of credit card operations the psa noted that interchange fees for credit cards had not changed despite technolo gical improvements and the increasing scale of credit card operations it also questioned why fees to merchants we re charged on an ad valorem rather than flat rate since the costs incurred by their financial institutions vari ed more directly with the number of transactions than their value reserve bank of australia

indications that unit costs for debit card transactions should have fallen over the 1990s interchange fees in debit card payment schemes had not change d since they were first negotiated in the late 1980s id 57 id 58 the inquiry strongly advocated the substitution of electronic fo rms of payment for paperbased transactions as means of achieving substantial gains in efficiency id p 3 appendices 552 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information in september 1999 the accc and the psb jointly launched an investigatio n into interchange fees for debit and credit cards and membership criteria for credit card sch emes59 their report suggested inter alia that interchange fee arrangements for credit cards might be encouraging the use of credit cards relative to more efficient payment instrum ents such as debit cards60 among the recommendations was that the rba regulate credit card schemes in 2001 the rba designated the bankcard mastercard and visa credit card schemes as payment systems under the payment systems regulation act 1998 in august 2002 the rba formulated standard for the setting of credit ca rd interchange in all these schemes61 as result interchange fees were reduced in november 2003 from an average rate of 095 per cent to an average of 055 per cent of credit card62 transaction values63 the standard required recalculation of the benchmarks every three years using updated cost estimates the first recalculation occurred in the third quar ter of 2006 resulting in new benchmark of 050 per cent effective from 1 november 200664 rules against surcharging by merchants were abolished from january 2003 rules regarding the membership criteria of visa and mastercard were amended to ease the restricted access to these schemes65 the honour all products rule was abolished with effect from january 2007 leaving merchants free to choose to accept either debit cards or credit cards or both66 reforms to be implemented in the debit card market were only finalised in the fir st half of 200667 these included the improvement of access and transparency in the eftpos system abolition of the honour all products rule and lowering of the

the credit card system as indicated above the standard enforced from november 2003 reduced c redit card interchange fees by an average of 40 basis points ie by 040 per cent it appears that the reduction in interchange was fully passed through by acquirers to merchants by way of reduced merchant service charges the merchant service charge has declined by 06 per cent since the implementation of the reforms69 following the mastercard visa and bankcard reductions the merchant service charges of american express also decreased but only by approximately 29 basis points since september 2003 ie

service charges of the threeparty schemes remained significantly higher than for the fourparty schemes it is estimated that since the inception of the reforms merchants have saved net total of at

554 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information evidence that consumer prices had actually fallen as result of the interchange reductions76 on the issuing side although interchange revenue contracted marginal pr ices charged to cardholders did not adjust as such77 however actual prices facing cardholders did adjust in three ways benefits and reward programs became less generous annual and other fees increased and surcharging by merchants was permitted according to the rba and th four major banks in australia the average amount that had to be spent by cardho lder in order to receive loyalty benefits increased by about 31 per cent78 and the average annual fee revenue per credit card account increased by about 43 per cent from 40 to 7 079 other effects included changes in the product offerings and adjustments of interest rate charges on credit in order to attract customers discouraged by higher cardholder f ees competition on interest rates charged on credit cards led to proliferation in the number of wrate cards that emerged according to the 2006 annual report of the psb the newly applied interest rates could be as low as 899 per cent compared to interest rates in the order of 16 per cent to 18 per cent before the reforms80 surveys also indicated that only about 12 per cent of large companies and about 2 p er cent of smaller companies had started to surcharge within few years after the ref orms81 where merchants did introduce surcharging it tended to be arbitrary and nonsystematic furthermore it has evidently occurred mainly in markets with low levels of competit ion most retail segments show very little or surcharging82 in 2006 the rba commissioned east partners to include questions regarding surcharging in their survey of merchant acquiring business the results showed that surcharging is becoming more common amo ngst large merchants and in june 2007 17 per cent of large merchants imposed surchar ge most merchants apply the same surcharge to both debit and credit cards with some merchants applying higher rates to more expensive cards such as american express and dine rs club the average surcharge for mastercard and visa cards is around 1 com pared to 2 surcharge on american express and diners club cards83 the combined market share of american express and diners club increased from an average of

confidential information 2005200684 this fuelled arguments that merchants have been harmed because of the relative increase in the usage of the more expensive threeparty model cards howev er the bulk of this increase occurred in 2004 when two of australias major bank s commenced the issuing of american express and diners club cards85 even though the rate of growth in credit card transactions in australia decreased substantially from about 34 per cent during 2000200186 it still increased by around 7 per cent during 20052006 and 54 per cent during 2006200787 thus answering mastercards warning that the reduction of interchange might lead to death spiral of its network88 under the 2002 standard determined by the rba for the setting of credit card interchange fees each participating scheme appointed its own specialist to collect verify and calculate the eligible costs in order to arrive at benchmark for interchange to ensure that the cost calculations were representative the data of issuing banks making up at least 90 per c ent of the volume of card transactions for the scheme had to be included th eligible costs were set out comprehensively by the rba and include issuers costs associated with authorisation processing fraudrelated expenditures and the freefunding period89 once each scheme had calculated its benchmark it was required to set its weighted average interchange fees90 higher than that91 under the standard set in 2002 the rba required recalculation of the interchange fee in september 2006 during 20052006 however the rba made changes to the regulations affecting credit card systems under the amended standard the procedures would stay the same but aft er the individual schemes cost calculations had been completed the rba would us the information to calculate single weightedaverage interchange fee which will th be set as 84 rba psb annual report 2006 p 14 85 id their combined share in the volume ie number of transac tion however was 124 for 20052006 lower than their share in the value of transactions this is indicative of their dif ferentiated business model and concentration of customers in the higher networth population resulting in hi gher per transaction values 86 rba psb annual report 2006 p 13 87 rba psb annual report 2006 p 13 rba psb annual report 2007 p 11 88 see frankel and shampine 2006 the economic effects of interchang fees 73 antitrust law journal 32006 627 673 p 656 89 this is fully explained in the guidance note attached to rba november 2005 common benchmark for the setting of credit card interchange fees initially the rba argued that the interestfree period being benefit provided to cardholders ought not be recovered through fees charged to merchants the int erchange fee should consequently comprise only costs attributable to the merchants benefits net of any costs associated with the line of credit provided to cardholders subsequently however the rba accepted that the costs associated with the interestfree period be included it in their list of eligible costs for the purpose of the intercha nge calculations 90 the weighted average fee is calculated using weights for each scheme that reflect the sturcture of its own business over the previous financial year this is also one of the aspects of the standard that is proposed to be reconsidered in the rbas next review of the reforms rba psb annual report 2007 p 25 91 in other words its particular interchange levels for different categ ories of cards and card usage could vary above or below the benchmark provided that the weighted average did not exceed t he benchmark appendices 556 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information common benchmark for all the scheme participants to adhere to92 each scheme would then have to ensure that the weighted average of its own interchange fees did not exceed the common benchmark the nominated issuing banks chosen to participat in the cost calculations had to include minimum number also bankcard was now exempted from the rba regulations93 the amendments resulted in common benchmark interchange fee of 050 per cent implemented since 1 november 2006 both visa and mastercard also introduced an array of different interchange fees applicable to different cards transactions and merchants 94 the reason for the change to common benchmark was to overcome the pr oblem that under the original standard scheme with higher costs would be entitled to s et higher weighted average interchange than scheme with lower costs and thus gain an undue competitive advantage in attracting issuers95 the rba stated that the new standard was not aimed at further reducing the interchange fee it was intended rather to promote more sound competition between the schemes and increase the incentives towards cost saving 4 regulation of the debit card system there are two distinct debit card systems in australia the eftpos syst em and the scheme debit card systems the local eftpos system has accounted for 85 per cent of debit card transacti ons96 it is purely domestic system and its cards cannot be used overseas the system involves bilateral negotiations between the participating parties and the interchange fee is flat fee paid from the issuer to the acquirer ranging between 18 to 25 cents per transacti on97 this was obviously designed to subsidise merchant acceptance the eftpos system w anted to change its interchange fees to zero in 2003 at first this was rejected due to access considerations but accepted in december 2003 conditional on adequate investigations into the access issues by the industry and the rba98 despite legal challenges by merchants wishing to retain the benefit of the previous interchange arrangements the eftpos system is now subject to regulated interchange standard 92 id 93 it was decided that bankcards costs were reflective of small domestic scheme and were not representative of the industry as whole and credit card issuing in general id p 3 the bankcard scheme closed down in the first half of 2007 94 id p 24 95 this aspect has been dealt with earlier in this chapter 96 rba psb annual report 2006 p 15 97 id 98 id p 17 appendices 557 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information in the scheme debit cards system the cards are signaturebased and can allow for transactions over the internet and telephone as well as overseas transactions in contrast to the eftpos system an interchange fee of 055 per cent of the transaction value was being paid from the acquirer to the issuer in 200699 in the most recent report of the psb the current regulatory regime applicable t debits cards is described as follows100 as part of the package of reforms to australias debit card systems announced i n april 2006 the bank introduced interchange standards for the eftpos and visa debit systems these standards came into effect on 1 november 2006 the same date as the new credit card benchmark came into effect in the scheme debit systems interchange fees have historica lly been the same as in the credit card systems prior to november 2003 these fees averaged around 095 per cent of the transaction value excluding gst they then fell to around 055 per c ent when the credit card reforms were introduced in contrast interchange fees in the ftpos system are flat fees historically averaging around 20 cents per transaction and f low in the opposite direction to those in the credit card and scheme debit systems that is f rom issuers to acquirers these differences in interchange fees in the two types f debit card systems meant that on 100 debit card transaction an issuer was around 75 cents better off in ter ms of interchange revenue if its customer used scheme debit card rather than an eftpos card the board was concerned that if this situation persisted the ef tpos system would have difficulty competing simply because of the structure of interchange fees which thems elves were not subject to the normal forces of competition the eftpos interchange standard requires that interchange fees in th eftpos system which are bilaterally negotiated be between 4 and 5 cents excluding g st if the transaction does not involve cash out component interchange fees for transact ions that do include cash out are not covered by the standard the banks liaison suggests t hat in some cases the interchange fees on these transactions remain at around 20 cents or higher while i n other cases the fees have fallen in line with the new rates for purchas transactions the visa debit interchange standard operates in similar fashion t that of the credit card interchange standard in that the weightedaverage interchange fe must be more than costbased benchmark based on information supplied by industry the b ank announced on 29 september 2006 that the benchmark was 12 cents excluding gst in announcing the visa debit interchange standard the bank indicated that the same arrangements would apply to the debit card schemes operated by both mastercard and visa it also indicated that the schemes could provide undertakings that t hey would comply with the standard rather than having it formally gazetted in particular in april 2006 the board announced that the visa debit standard on interchange fees will only be gazetted if by 1 july 2006 visa has not provided the bank with an enforceable undertaking that would deliver the same outcomes as the standard similarly the bank will c onsider designating the mastercard debit system and then imposing standard if by 1 july 2006 mastercard has not provided the bank with an enforceable undertaking to the same effect mastercard voluntarily agreed to set interchange fees for its debit card in acc ordance with this benchmark in contrast visa did not and consequently on 7 july 2006 t he bank gazetted the visa debit interchange standard 99 100 id p 15 rba psb annual report 2007 pp 2223 appendices 558 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information as for credit cards both schemes have number of different inter change categories for different types of merchants and types of payments table 7 mas tercard has also introduced chip rate for its debit cards applicable when card wi th chip is used in terminal that is not chip enabled mastercard initially had relatively simple structure with only electronic and standard rates at the end of june 2007 it released ta ble of rates very similar to those of visa mastercard also introduced tie red merchants rate for large merchants that is substantially below other interchange rates this r ate requires merchants to meet volume thresholds but unlike mastercards tiered merchant s rate for credit cards does not require merchants to accept all mastercard products 5 regulatory issues concerning the threeparty schemes in australia both american express and diners club agreed in negotiations to rem ove their nosurcharge rules101 media release by the rba dated 24 february 2005 stated american express and diners club over recent months the bank has examined whether it would be in the publi c interest to regulate the american express and diners club card payment systems this fo llows the issuing of american express cards by two banks and the establishment of partnership between another bank and diners club the bank considered in particular whether there was case to regulate the payments between american express and diners club and their bank partners it concluded t hat at this stage such regulation would not improve the overall efficiency of the payments system in its view regulation of these payments would have relatively little ffect on merchant charges further the existing incentives facing issuers of these cards coul d only be addressed through considerably more extensive regulation than that currently existing in t he credit card schemes in the bankcard mastercard and visa schemes the interchange fe paid by the merchants bank to the cardholders bank has an important influence on the charge l evied on the merchant by its bank in contrast in the american express and d iners club arrangements the causation runs the other way merchant charges are determined largely in dependently of the payment to the partner banks instead the fees that merchants pay influence the size of the payments to the banks given this regulating the payments that flow between american express and diners club and their partners would be likely to have little eff ect on merchants costs of accepting the cards this is in contrast to the credit card schemes where merchant service fees fell quickly following the reforms to interchange fees on the issuing side regulation of specific payments to the partner banks would be likely to lead to other forms of payment leaving the incentive of banks to participate in the arrangements largely unchanged one possible response might have been to regulate the totality of payments including marketing payments between american xpress and diners club and their bank partners such regulation would then also be required in the bankcard mastercard and visa schemes the banks view is that at the current time this form of extensive regulation is not in the public interest while the bank is not intending to regulate the payments betwee n american express and diners club and their bank partners it has had concerns about number of cl auses in these schemes agreements with merchants the relevant clauses have had the ef fect of reducing competition between the schemes by limiting merchants ability to steer customers to lower cost means of payment given this the bank has sought the agreement of american express and diners club to either delete or change these clauses it has also sought greater transparency in the average fee charged by the schemes in response both american 101 visa june 2007 second submission document u p 5 appendices 559 banking enquiry report to competition commissioner contains confidential information express and diners club have agreed to i reword clauses in their merchant agreements that currently prohibi t merchants from encouraging cardholders to use another card and ii publish their average merchant service fee in australia on quart erly basis diners club has already done so american express has also agreed that should it seek to introduce debit or prepaid card in australia it will not require merchants to accept such cards as condition of accepting its existing cards provided schemes issuing similar cards are subjec t to the same requirements as result of these changes merchants will now have at least thre options if they are not satisfied with the cost of accepting american express or diners cl ub cards they can decline acceptance of any cards issued by the schemes they can accept the sc hemes cards but charge customers for using the cards or they can accept the schemes cards but indicate to customers that they would prefer another payment method be used in addition merchants will be better informed about how their particular merchant service fee compares with the average fee
