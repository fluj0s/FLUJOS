since 1960 federal regulations have specified that i ndividuals age 60 and older may not serve as airline pilots over the years the age 60 rule as it is commonly known has been the topic of considerable controversy and debate the central issue in this debate is whether pilots age 60 and older exhibit agerelated declines in health and cognitive abilities that compromise flight safety as the federal aviation administration faa maintains or whether these effects typically occur later in the life span another key issue is the potential economic impact to pilots and the airline industry continued uncertainty in the air line industry is prompting many pilots who once supported the rule as mechanism fo r career advancement to rethink the rule in light of large numbers of furloughs sign ificant financial risks to legacy airline pension funds and the lack of defined bene fit retirement programs at many low cost airlines advocates for relaxing the age rest rictions for airline pilots also argue that doing so may be viable means for main taining sufficient numbers of experienced pilots and avoiding possible pilot shortage congress has expressed considerable interest in this issue over the years the rule has been examined in oversight hearings several bills to increase the age limit have been offered and c ongress has mandated studies examining the rule and its relationship to aviation safety affected pilots have petitioned the faa for waivers to the rule and have challenged the rule in the federal court system on several occasions all to avail while the age 60 rule has withstood these challenges there is currently significant interest in reexamining and perhaps revising this rule recently some airlines have voiced ope n support for increasing the upper age limit for airline pilots and the air line pilots association alpa is reviewing its 25year stance supporting the rule many foreign pilo ts are already permitted to fly past age 60 and new international st andard is under considerati on to raise the maximum age for airline pilots to 65 with the proviso that one of the pilots in the cockpit be under age 60 possible options for statutory or regula tory change to the age 60 rule include increasing the upper age limit for airline pilots conducting trial program to examine the possible implications of incr easing the upper age limit for airline pilots or eliminating the upper age limit altogether relying solely on medical testing to determine each pilots fitness for duty in the 109th congress two identical bills s 65 and hr 65 seeking to raise the upper age limit for airline pilots to correspond to their social security retirement ages ve been offered other legislative options may seek to modify retirement entitlements for pilots to make

code of federal regula tions cfr part 1211 while this is limitation or restriction on the use of pilots over age 60 in what the airlines refer to as line operations it is not specifically mandatory retirement age because it does not preclude airline pilots from performing various other pilot duties for an airline2 for example pilot over the age of 60 could be employed by an airline to co mplete nonrevenue ferry flights serve as maintenance test pilot to check airplanes before they return to service after maintenance or repairs are performed or could serve as flight instructor pilots over the age of 60 could also be employed by charter or air tour operators fracti onal ownership programs that operate business jets or as pilot for corporate and private general aviation aircraft while this rule cannot be t echnically considered form of mandatory retirement the typical career path of professional airline pilots have been predicated on retirement at age 60 ever since it was promulgated in

battle over manda tory retirement policies impos ed by the airlines usually being set at age 60 it was the dawn of th age of commercial jets and several airlines were of the opinion that is was in their ec onomic best interest to recruit young pilots leaving the military who had flown jet aircraft rather than training its older more senior pilots to transition from pistonengine airplanes to jetpowered airplanes several senior pilots who had been forced into retirement based on these company policies filed grievances although an arbitrator sided with the pilots and ordered that they be reinstated management at american airlines refused to abide by the decision and continued to enforce the companys age 60 retirement policy this and other grievances led pilots to strike during the holiday trav season of 1958 to nd the strike american airlines agreed to many of the pilots demands however the issue of maximum age limit for pilots was far from settled3 thenpresident of american airlines c r smith took his case for pilot age limits to the faa writing in february 1959 that it may be necessary for the regulatory agency to set suitable retirement age4 to bolster the argument for age limits american airlines provided the faa with data from 31 pilots trained on the boeing 707 with the purpose of showing that younger pilots required fewer hours of flight tr aining to transition from propeller to jet airliners than older pilots and were more likely to successfully complete the training5 according to accounts of subsequent faa actions two proposals were subsequently considered one to set maximum age of 55 for pilots to receive certification to fly jet aircraft and second to set an ag limit of 60 for all airline pilots6 an expert panel was convened to review the proposals and the suppor ting data provided by american airlines and recommended favorably on adopting both recommendations but eventually dropped the recommendation to limit jet ty peratings to pilots under the age of 55 however when the faas legal counsel reviewed the propos it found that the training data did not provide compelling argument for setting maximum age for airline pilots and recommended that the faa instead focu s on available medical knowledge in tting maximum age for pilots the faa did s and on december 5 1959 published final rule that went into effect on march 15 1960 tablishing

perform highly skilled tasks rapidly resist fatigue maintain physical stamina perform effectively in complex and stressful environment apply experience judgment and reasoning rapidly in new changing and emergency situations and learn new techniques skills and procedures while the faa followed standard rulemaki ng procedures including an opportunity for public comments and justif ied the rule on the grounds of safety concerns stemming from the health and fitness of older pilots oppone nts have long criticized the rule as being quite arbitrary and imposed largely to support the position of the airlines the circumstances under which the rule was adopted have certainly contributed to the long standing controversy surrounding it in the late 1990s the number of pilots and types of operations subject to the age 60 rule was expanded when the faa phasedin requirements to enhance the safety of scheduled commuter operations and bring them under the more stringent rules of part 121 under those requirements the operations of all commuter turbojets and commuter turboprop aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats were required to operate under the same rules as air carriers flying larger airc raft including the requi rement that prohibited the use of pilots aged 60 and older8 during the transition pilots over the age of 60 that had been flying for commuter airlines were permitted to continue to do so up until december 20 19999 today part 121covers scheduled passenger operations of jet and turboprop aircraft having seating capacity of 10 or more passengers and allcargo aircraft with payload capacity of 7500 pounds or greater under the age 60 rule airlines are not permitted to use pilots age 60 and older in these operations challenges to the rule opponents have used two vehicles to ch allenge the age 60 rule first pilots impacted by the rule have petitioned the faa di rectly for an exemption to the rule under general provision set forth in title 14 code of fede ral regulations 1161 et seq while many pilots have petitioned the faa for such an exemption over the years to date pilot has ever been granted such request the second mechanism has been to challenge the faas position on the age 60 rule through the federal court system while those seeking remedy in the federa l courts have garnered s upport from the equal employment opportunity co mmission eeoc since 198110 the courts have consistently ruled in favor of the faa authority and basis for the ag 60 rule most recently on may 2 2005 the supreme court denied petition filed on behalf group of several

rule itself and therefore should properly be effected thr ough petition for rulemaking rather than petition for exemption the circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia had previously upheld the faas authority and stance on the age 60 rule similarly refusing to hear oral arguments in the case as refl ected in this recent decision the position of the courts has consisten tly upheld the faas authority to implement and enforce the age 60 rule and the legal basis for its establishment based on these precedents any change or exemptions to the age 60 rule are not lik ely come about through the federal court system therefore any modifications to the rule would likely require either regulatory change by the faa initiated through the rulemaking process or statutory change initiated by congressional action recent congressional interest unlike the statutory upper age limit for air traffic controllers and federal law enforcement and firefighting personnel th upper age limit for airline pilots is regulatory action and therefore may be modified either throug h statutory or regulatory change the faa has continued to defend its position that 60 is an appropriate upper age limit for airline pilots based on its analysis of available safety and medical data historically the federal cour ts have upheld the faas authority and position on the age 60 rule in this context airline pilots seeking to have the upper age limit increased have turned to congress seeking legislative action to modify the age 60 rule several members of congress have been suppor tive of such action and numerous b ills and amendments to increase the upper age limit for airline pilots have been introduced and debated over the years additionally cong ressional committees have c onducted oversight hearings on the issue and congress has mandated and recommende d studies examining the relationship between age and medical fitn ess pilot performance and flight safety on march 13 2001 the senate committ ee on commerce science and transportation held hearing on the age 60 rule in the context of potential future pilot shortages and the potential impact of these shortages on rural air service and the military speaking at the hearing senator mccain noted that the available pilot pool to meet these needs is directly affected by the age 60 ru noting that many european nations have increased the maximum age of pilots to 65 senator mccain urged reconsideration of the rule noting that while safety is param ount there are almo st certainly ways of ensuring that pilots who decide to fl beyond

by the federal governments pbgc currently guaranteed benefits under the pbgc are reduced for pensioners under age 65 and these benefits are often signif icantly less than what retirees would have received under their companys ponsored pension programs15 safety issues safety concerns over aging pilots that form the basis for the age 60 rule have focused on three topics 1 the potential in creased risk associated with aging pilots reflected in aircraft mishap da ta 2 underlying medical fact ors associated with the risk of incapacitation or the inability to perform pilot functions and 3 agerelated declines in piloting skills and abilities that may pose an increased safety risk age as risk factor flight crew performance is the leading cause of large commercial airplane accidents worldwide in analyzing worldwide commercial jet hull losses over the tenyear period from 1994 through 2003 the boeing commercial airplane group found that 62 of those accidents with known causes were primarily attr ibutable to the actions of the flight crew16 therefore reducing pilotrelated accident causes has been major focus of efforts to improve aviation safety in this context determining the extent to which age contributes to an increased risk of pilotrelated accidents and incidents and identifying an age at which this increased risk becomes unacceptable are the primary safety issues surrounding the age 60 rule httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32960crs6 17 ej kay dj hillman dt hyland rs voros rm harris j d deimler age 60 study part iii consolidated da tabase experiments final report

research project examining the relationship between age and accident risk the project became popularly known as the hilton study after the prime contractor hilton systems inc the study found evidence of increased accident rates among air carrier pilots as they approached age 60 examining accident data for older private pilots who were fairly experienced and remained rather active in flying by general aviation standards the researchers concluded that there was only slight hint of increas ed accident risk for pilots beyond age 63 and indication of increased risk below that age17 based on their findings the hilton study researchers concluded that cau tiously raising the upper age limit for airline pilots to 63 would not compromise safety in response to these findings the faa held

following ushape curve as function of age see figure 1and figure 2 in other words accident rates were highest for younger and older pilots and lowest for pilots in their mid 30s and 40s while this

55 and 59 years old however the accident rate for the 6063 year old pilots holding either an atp or commercial rating and either first or second class medical certificate was significantly higher than

atp pilots with first class medical certification those considered most representative of pilots flyi ng for the airlines was due to having too small of sample in the upper age ranges or is an

age oklahoma city ok civil aeromedical institute june 27 2003 while these results provide interesting insights into the relationship between pilot age and safety it should be noted that ther are significant limitations associated with using accident and incident data to draw conclusions regarding the age 60 rule by the very fact that the age 60 rule exists studies examining accidents and incidents in the united states suffer from the limitation that there are air carrier operations using pilots older than 59 consequently one must eith er draw inferences from data based on air carrier operations using pilots under age 60 or make comparis ons from safety data involving flight operations that do not meet the rigorous safety standards and pilot qualifications of airline operations this complicates matters in terms of both identifying pilots that are most representative of us airline pilots and identifying categories of operations to examine that are most similar to air carrier operations in light of this significant limitation the experience of other countries who already allow pilots age 60 and older to continue flying in airline operations is of par ticular interest

accident and incident rates for these pilots are yet to be published so far specific safety concerns re garding the use of older airline pilots have been raised risk of incapacitation in promulgating the age 60 rule the faa highlighted the safety risk of sudden incapacitation as major consideration in tablishing this age restriction the faa noted that there is progressive deterioration of certain important physiological and psychological functions with age that sign ificant medical defects attributable to this degenerative process occur at an increasing rate as age increases and that sudden incapacity due to such medical defects becomes more frequent in any group reaching age 6020 the faa has continued to express these c oncerns in defending the age 60 rule in 1995 the faa noted that cardiovasc ular disease rises steeply as function of age between the ages of 55 and 6521 in the faas opinion the increas ed incidence of cardiovascular disease presents risk for unexpected threaten ing events that can incapacitate pilots the faa found that while such events are rare they have been observed at relatively consistent rate over the years and have on rare occasions resulted in general aviation accidents other experts have not agreed with the faa assessment of risk associated with sudden incapacitation for example the f aasponsored hilton study concluded that sudden incapacitation while intensively studi ed has been shown to be relatively unimportant factor in aviation accidents thus studies of the relationship between age and cardiovascular fitness in p ilots are somewhat tangential to the questions of whether the probability of an accident increases with age22 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32960crs10 22 continued aviation medicine october 1994 23 pamela s

the overall risk of an aviation accident resulting from incapacitation at one accident per 83 billion flight hours23 given that there is system redundancy in place by requiring two pilots fo r all airline operations the overall risk of medical incapacitation is sufficiently small that it would generally meet the engineering criteria of an acceptable risk24 internationally icao considers safety level in which the probability of an incapacitation event is one percent per year or one every 876000 hours or less to be acceptable in multicrew ope rations this is referred to as the 1 rule icao contends that ma pilots are likely to appro ach this upper risk level near age 65 and female pilots around age 68 or 69 applying this rule the probability that both flight crew members of two person crew would become incapacitated during the same onehour flight pe riod would approach one in one trillion 1012 which is widely regarded as an acceptable level of risk25 2004 faa study examined inflight medical incapacitation and impairment events involving us airline pilots26 results indicated significantly larger number of incapacitations as function of increasing age particularly for those with neurological or cardiac causes see figure 3 however none of th 39 incapacitation incidents examined resulted in an accident furthermore age of the incapacitated pilot had influence on whether the safety of flight was seriously impacted by the event thus while the data show positive and statistically significant relationship between airline pilot age and the risk of inflight incapacitation whet her this poses meaningful and unacceptable risk to the overall safety of airline operations remains highly contentious issue the aerospace medical association concluded that given the infrequency of occurrence and negligible impact on flight safety in c ontrast to various other pilotrelated accident causes such as judgment decision making and communication pilot incapacitation does not pose significant risk in airline operations and is largely mitigated by the presence of two qualified pilots27httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32960crs11 28 title 14 cfr 67111 29 civil aviation

over mandatory upper age limits for pilots is whether the risk of inflight incapacitation can be adequately assessed and mitigated through medical screening alone airline captains are required to maintain first class medical certificates and in pr actice most airline pilots maintain first class medical certification first class medi cal certificates are good for si x months and pilots required to have first class medical certificates must consequently be examined by flight physician on biannual basis to obtain first class medical certificate pilots older than age 40 must submit to annual

the age 60 limitation placed on airline pilots is unjust and unfounded29 the effects of age on piloting skills and abilities while medical examinations may be effective in screening for latent

research findings on the effects of aging on piloting skills and abilities 31 pamela s tsang assessing cognitive aging p 535the relevance of these age related declines in establishing an appropriate upper age limit for pilots these questions include to what extent does experience mitigate or compensate for agerelated declines in performance do pilots exhibit the same agerelated decline in performance observedin samples taken from th general population are pilot medical exams proficienc checks periodic observations and airline monitoring programs adequate to detect performance deficits on an individual basis and can an age be identified at which deterioration of component mental skills and abilities critical for pilot performance are sufficiently degraded in the pilot population that they introduce an unacceptable increase in risk despite extensive research examining the effects of aging on performance research examining the performance of aging pilots is relatively limited and has not always produced consistent results consequently the answers to these questions are not clear cut in very general sense agerelated declines in cognitive functions considered essential for piloting begin to appear as individuals enter their 30s and continue throughout the life span while groups of p ilots have demonstrat ed less agerelated deterioration in performance compared to samples from the general population in some studies they are still prone to these agerelated declines research has also shown that experience and expertise can compensate for some agerelated declines in piloting skills and related tasks but they cannot entirely make up for the effects of aging with the possible exception of the ability to divide attention among multiple competing priorities30 research has not attached any particular significance to age 60 in terms of identifying an age at which pilot skills nd abilities markedly decline and pose safety risk pinpointing an appropriate upper age limit is further complicated by large individual differences in aging effects research suggests that as age increases so does variability in performance across individuals therefore it appears that as age increases age by itself becomes poorer predictor of an individual s performance one review of the literature summarized the current knowledge of agerelated declines in pilot skills by concluding there is not one age when all co gnitive capabilities decline for everybodythe prevailing data strongly suggest that the quest for determining specific cutoff age that could be applied

shifted to consideration of the economic ramifications of the age 60 rule several economic factor s including ongoinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32960crs13 32 elizabeth arias unite d states life tables

alpa foughtairline furloughs and the financial uncerta inty of many airline pension funds and retirement benefit programs make the prosp ect of retirement at age 60 significant challenge for increasing numbers of pilots besides the economic impact to the livelihood of retired pilots and future retirees the age 60 rule has also been tied to the debate over growing concerns that the united states may face future shortage of qualified pilots to replace an aging workforce these economic factors are likely to place increasing strain on the faa to justify the age 60 rule but are not likely to be sufficient justifications by themselves for modifying or removing pilo t age restrictions which have always been rooted in concerns over safety career advancement and retirement benefits today the potential economic impacts of the age 60 rule to retiring pilots and the pension and retirement benefit programs that support th em are becoming more salient as life expectancies continue to increase when the age 60 rule was promulgated in 1959 average total life expectancies in the unite d states for those reaching age 60 were 759 years for men and 795 years for women32 at that time almost all pilots were men so the average life expectancy beyond the age rest riction would have been about 16 years for typical pilot today life expectancies ar considerably longer the average total life expectancy for 60 yearold male is 802 s the average number of years male pilot can be expected to live beyond the age restriction is now more than 20 years for female pilots who currently make up about 3 of the airline pilot workforce the average life expectancy beyond the upper age limit of 60 is 235 years in light of this trend of increasing longevity there is growing concern among pilots that airline pensions and retirement savings may be insufficient to sust ain them financially for these longer periods there is also growing concern that the equ ity in pilot pension and retirement benefit programs at major airlines will be insuffici ent to support large number of retiring pilots for these extended retirement durations thes concerns have been heightened by the fiscal uncertainty in the airline industry historically large pilot organizations such as the air line pilots association alpa have supported the age 60 rule b ecause it afforded their core membership of younger and midlevel pilots with opportunitie s for career advancement and the existence of the rule provided the unions with clear ly defined target for negotiating retirement benefits33 however in the current economic clima of instability in the airline industry many older pilots longer view their pens ion plans as being stable reliable income sources to carry them through their retirement years few major carriers have already turned their pension programs over to the pb gc this effectively reduces the pension annuities of many pilots also growing number of pilots flying for lowcost carriers do not have defined benefit pension plans and will have to rely solely on investments in retirement savings plans upon reaching age 60 furthermore pilots must cease part 121 flight activities before they are eligible for social security benefits currently pilots like other workers who contributed to the social security system can begin receiving reduced benefits at age 62 and full benefits between age 65 and age 67 depending on their yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32960crs14 34 arlene dohm gauging the labor forc effects of retiring baby boomers monthly labor review july 2000 pp 1725of birth based on phasedin increase to the social security full retirement age this creates gap that could last as long as seven years in which pilots might not receive social security benefit to supplement th pension annuities nd retirement savings even pilot electing to receive reduced benefits would have to wait two years before becoming eligible for such entitlements these multiple financial considerations may make full retirement at age 60 difficult for increasing numbers of pilots in the future necessitating that they seek other employment the long term impact of these financial factors could make it more difficult to recruit fu ture generations of p ilots this and other factors could lead to future pilot shortages possible future pilot shortages it is hard for many to imagine that airlin could be facing shortage of qualified pilots in the near future given the current stat us of the industry whic h has left many pilots on furlough however according to the bur eau of labor statistics as the economy expands the demand for pilots is expected to increase at rate consistent with overall job growth during the next seven years in 2002 there were about 79000 pilots employed by the airlines and this number is expected to grow to 94000 by 2012 growth in demand for pilots is likely to be fueled by increasing demand for air travel as well as shift toward using smallersized aircraft on domestic flights thus the largest growth in demand for pilots is likely to be for commuter airlines that might find it difficult to recruit and retain highly qualified applicants amid an increasing availability of pilot slots at major airlines besides an overall projected growth in demand for air travel airlines are faced with an aging workforce see figure 4 with steady stream of retirements expected over the next 5 to 10 years according to recent analysis of labor statistics airline pilot jobs are expected to be the leading occupati on impacted by babyboomer retirements retirements among airline pilots and navigato rs were expected to increase by 173 percent during the period from 2003 through 2008 compared to 1993 through 199834 growing demand on the one hand and an aging population of pilots on the other could contribute to future shortage of qualified pilots to address this shortage congress may consider programs to attract future ge nerations to careers in aviation and in the current context may also consider whether changes to the age 60 rule can help alleviate potential shortages of highly qualified pilots the prospect of future pilot shortage could certainly complicate the public policy debate regarding the age 60 rule this is because if airlines are faced with significant growth in the demand for pilots they may be forced to lower their hiring standards while all airline pilots must meet rigorous faa minimum standards pilots hired by major air carriers and commuter operators in todays competitive job market are usually said to far exceed these minimum qualifications thus there is considerable room between the minimum acceptable qualifications and the qualifications needed to be considered for pilot position at major airline or large commuter airline from policy standpoint one might consider the poten tial safety tradeoffs of airlines becoming less selective by hiring younger less experien ced pilots as result of shrinking labor pool on

maximum age limit this tradeoff is likely to be quite subtle and difficult to predict howeve r analysis of recent safety data reported by the faa at least suggests that the level of ri sk posed by an airline transport pilot under the age of 30 is roughly equivalent to the ri sk posed by pilot between the age of 60 and 63 see figure 1 and figure 2 in other words raising the age limit to 63 does not appear to pose any greater risk than hiring younger pilots under age 30 to fill those slots vacated by pilots reaching age 60 although more thorough analyses may be needed to substantiate this comparison source federal aviation administration office of aviation policy and plans the availability of highly qualified younger pilots may also be tempered by persisting uncertainty in the airline industry and the promise of greater job opportunity in other high technology fields while pilot careers have been viewed for many years as highpaying and intrinsically rewarding current economic turmoil and uncertain job outlooks for pilots may make it somewhat more difficult to attract highly qualified individuals to pursue careers as airline pilots evidence that such trend may be emerging is reflected in the declining number of student pilots as well as private and commercial pilots35 compared to the early 1990s see figure 5 however such conclusion may be premature because while fewer students are initiating flight training compared to the early 1990s more of th students could be planning careers as professional pilots rather than simply learni ng to fly for recreational purposes

needs of the airlines from the end of world war ii to the mid1990s about 80 percen t of airline pilots were military trained compared to only 40 percent in 200136 this decline in military trained pilots transitioning to airline cockpits may continue as the armed services take steps to retain their cadre of highly qualified pilots whet her civilian flight schools will continue to provide adequate numbers of highly qualified pilots to make up for the declining numbers of military pilots transitioning to airline careers remains an issue of considerable interest in the current context

introduced by re presentative gibbons have been offered in the 109th congress these bills would effectively raise the age at which pilots can continue flying for air carriers to be equa l to their full retirement age under the social security system some airline pilots aged 65 ½ and under could potentially return to the cockpit if either of these bills were enacted for current airline pilots the age at which they would be required to leave the cockpit would range from 66 to 67 according to the graduated scale of full social security retirem ent age based on birth year however these ages could increase if social security laws were changed to increase the age at which full benefits become available legislative proposals offered in prior c ongresses sought to establish fixed retirement age typically coinciding with the pilots 65th or 64th birthday this option would set the upper age limit for airline pilots in manner that woul d not be altered by actions taken for unrelated purpos such as raising the soci security retirement age as means to maintain solvency in the social security trust fund the faasponsored hilton study concluded based on limite d data from agerelated acci dent trends in general aviation that one could cautiously increase the retirement age to age 6337 several other countries have implemented various other approach designed to limit the potential risk of raising pilot age limits for example in 1997 japan increased the upper age limit to 63 but required that at least one pilot in the cockpit be younger than 60 the european joint aviation authority jaa permits airline pilots to fly up to age 65 but also requires that the other pilot on f light be younger than 60 however not all european countries agree with this approac h france in particul ar has maintained its maximum age limit of 60 for airline pilots and like the united states is of the opinion that this is the most appropriate upper age limit38 adopting the jaa approach worldwide was recently proposed by icao in icaos survey of member countries the large major ity 72 out of 112 countries indicated that 65 is the most appropriate uppe r age limit for airline pilots39 several countries indicated that the upper limit of 65 should be limited to multicr ew operations ie flights with two or more pilots and predicated on having one p ilot under the age of 60 in the cockpit some countries also suggested that pilots over the age of 60 be subject to more rigorous medical checks and not be granted any flexibility in meeting medical qualifications if the suggested amendment to

are merely recommendations countries around the world have adopted vari ed approaches to pilot age limitations and many countries already have older maximum ages or age restrictions at all for airline pilots however the icao rules do have bearing on international flights in that the in the absence of specific age restrictions for pilots of foreign carriers set in regulation or statute the icao rules would apply in other word s while the united states may continue to limit the age of pilots on us carriers under ex isting regulations older pilots of foreign carriers operating to and from the united states would typically be allowed to operate so long as they meet the applicable icao st andards including the proposed maximum age of 65 if it is adopted implementing trial program of waivers another approach would be to implement trial program in which limited number of airline pilots could be granted waivers to the age 60 limitation under such program pilots volunteering for the program could be subjected to close scrutiny that may include detailed medical physiological and psychol ogical testing and detailed performance reviews this would permit data to be collected about older pilots enabling more informed decisions similarly increases in maximum pilot age could be phasedin over time by adopting goslow approach the israeli civ il aviation authority implemented such an approach in 1990 israel began allowing pilo ts aged 6065 to continue flying for israel airlines but these pilots were initially only permitted to serve as first officers then in 1995 pilots aged 6065 were permitted to serve as cr uise captains where they could operate as pilotinco mmand on long haul flights when the aircraft was operating above 20000 feet but could not operate as pilotincommand during takeoffs and landings in may 1999 based on review of the safety and medical f itness of those pilots over age 60 flying for the israeli regulations were again expanded to permit pilots aged

only pilots of allcargo airlines to participate allcargo operations would offer platform to examine potential implications before expanding the trial program to passenger airlines or raising the age

stressors such as fatigue any observed agerelated effects in allcargo pilots might not generalize well to pilots engaging in passenger airline operations furthermore pilot groups may argue that adopting varied standards for cargo operations is contrary to their efforts to promote one uniform level of safety across the entire air carrier industry the concept of initiating trial study examining changes to the age 60 rule in the united states is not new similar pproach was proposed by the faa in 1982 in response to the national institute on agings recommendation that the faa or some other appropriate federal agency engage in systematic study to collect medical and performance data for use in considering whether to relax the age 60 rule despite this recommendation the faa ultimate ly scrapped the idea of trial study because in its opinion valid selection test for identifying the test group did not exist and consequently conducting such study would raise the safety risk to unacceptable levels44 eliminating age limits another alternative would be to fully eliminate any regulatory or statutory reference to age with regard to issuance of pilot medical certificates or qualifications to act as an airline pilot under such plan any qualified pilot could serve in the capacity of an airline pilot so long as he or she could dem onstrate medical fitness and flight proficiency currently canada and australia and fe w smaller nations have upper age limit for commercial pilots45 in canada more than 1300 ai rline pilots are older than 6046 by eliminating an upper age restriction the faa and airlines would rely solely on pilots medical certification and demonstrated flight proficiency to assess his or her continued fitness to fly p ilots typically undergo biannual medical examinations and are observed routinely by other pilots and comp any and faa check pilots so there are many opportunities to detect agere lated medical factors or s ubstandard performance while such an approach has been advocated by the civil aviation medical assoication cama and others there are some possible drawbacks to such an approach first sophisticated medical and psychological testing to detect latent agerelated degradation of pilotrelated cognitive ab ilities are not conducted during medical exams and agreedupon measures of cognitive ability re lated to piloting an airplane are generally lacking furthermore available cognitive tests may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle cognitive deficits that may only ma nifest themselves under certain conditions also there may be reluctance among younger pilots to report sa fetyrelated incidents involving the performance of older more seni or pilots therefore detection of those older pilots posing significant safety ri sk may not be optimal the aerospace medical association asma suggests that enhanced cognitive screening and neuropsychological testing may show promise for accurately ev aluating

surgeons medical bulletin spring 2000 considerable investment would be needed to implement nonag ebased criteria for determining the fitness of older pilots47 keeping the age 60 rule in place the most conservative approach would be to keep the existing age 60 rule in place because maintaining the status quo would not introduce any potential for increased safety risk the existing age restriction is weakly supported by the research associating pilot age with slight increase in risk while research has generally failed to demonstrate statistically significant differences in risk among pilots in their early 60s compared to pilots in their late 50s significant ushaped trend indicating elevated risk among older as well as younger pilots has been demonstr ated in recent analyses of accident data however because the increased risk associated with increased age is subtle there is clear guidance for where such an age restriction should be set in general research has generally placed the elbow of the ushaped curve where accident risk begins to increase more steeply as function of age in the mid50s this certainly gives some basis for the selection of age 60 as an upper limit however because the increased risk associated with advancing age is subtle and not statistically significant this evidence is not overly compelling furthermore becau pilots over the age of 60 may longer serve as airline pilots comparative accident risk has been based on flight operations that have historically been more risky than sc heduled airline operations in light of this limited evidence one might consider whether it would be prudent to expand the age 60 rule or some other appropr iate age limitation to these ri skier types of operations particularly charter or air t our operations where older pilots may seek employment after completing airline careers the ushaped trend at least suggests that pairing older pilots with young inexperienced pilots which may commonly occur in these types of operations could increase risk however it is unlikely that age alone would increase the risk factor associated with crew pairings to unacceptable levels using older pilots in singlepilot charter and air tour operations however could raise significan t safety questions regarding possible incapacitation because this risk is not mitigated by the presence of second pilot while one key consideration is the types of operations that should be subject to age restrictions the more fundamental questi on is what the appropriate age limit should be or whether such age limitations should exist at all the faa federal air surgeon jon l jordan noted that the selection of ag 60 as the appropriate age at which one should longer serve as pilot in air carrier operations was somewhat discretionary few people like inflexible discretionary rules and i am among them unfortunately how to solve the problem of deterioration in performance with aging and its impact on aviation safety in an enigma i only wish i knew
