bridge publications inc newsletter date postulates and the time stream if youre in good shape you can pick up all the postulates you ever made clear back to the beginning of time i wont say what youll come out to be here though you might suddenly turn into griffin but thats danger you can risk so it doesnt matter what postulate youve made that postulate is bound to make you into an effect by it so you must be willing to some degreeif youre going to live in time stream in time span then you have to be willing to some degree to be an effect see how that is i mean if youre going to be in time stream at all you must be willing to be an effect at least of yourself and of course most everybody is affected by everything thatthis society makes complete dance out of being effect never be cause be effect or if you wanted to avoid this utterly youd have to live in time maybe thats desirable i dont know heres time its desirable if its up here at the top of the tone scale because you can get everything done in the world because up at the top of the tone scale you see you dont have any concept of time you have concept of action which you can change at will l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture decision cause and effect contained in the route to infinity lecture series the motion that pins you on the track an article by l ron hubbard from the route to infinity lectures now it may take an emeter to find it actually they have tendency to sort of look at an emeter and they say all right ill take hold of the canssort of like lets make little pact here that you dont ask any of these questions that are really hot and you say well now lets see what happened to you and so forth and he says well so my younger brother kept hitting over the head with brickbat and he hit over the head with hammer and did this and he did that and did this and did that come on you say now what did you do to your younger brother nothing the needle will go wheww and you say well now youre sure you never did anything to him oh whewww you say well now what about it cant you just give us just little inkling maybe hah well of course there was that business about the kiddie car but thatthat was nothing that was nothing well what did happen well iwell i dont know you see i was never suremy mother said i was but ii was never sure that i did knock him off of the kiddie car knocked him off of what kiddie car well little kiddie car down the street that i brought in and of course it fractured his skull and he was in the hospital for about six months and hes never been quite right since but now youll get this type of interplay in any case and it follows some very very definite rules it follows some very definite rules any time person is protesting about motion having happened to himand this is hard and fast rule by the way any time person is protesting about motion that has happened to him you can be assured that he has tried to use this motion and has hung himself up in maybe or he is merely telling you about lock on that situation one or the other now any time he gets one of these computational things that wont resolve his mind is neither peaceful nor clear and his beingness is impeded on all fronts you can be sure that if hes protesting about any motion of any kindthat something thats happened to him if hes protesting about that motionor actually if hes protesting about any motion on any dynamic violently you know very well that hes guilty as of having tried to use that motion and found out it was the wrong motion to use in processing case if you will follow that thing through you will see case start to fall apart in front of you i dare say there are people who have run for couple of hundred hoursas much as that maybe maybe many more nearly all the auditing was merely their justification they were just running justification justification justification and theyre not going to run out of justification as long as you leave untapped the incident that they are trying to justify so what are you trying to justify you know the religious world tells you repent ye sinners they tell you youre all sinners and everybody says yup yup were sinners all right its good thing the fellow up there on the altar doesnt just know how much but whats well they seldom bother to explain that they make big plaque or something of the sort and they say is one two not putting dollar in the collection plate down the line they give you nice long list of sins well theres reason to list it is misusing countereffort you have received thats all is because every time you do badly itll wind you up in this squirrelup if you refuse to commit an overt act or if you commit one and are very sorry for it you will then be unable to remain yourself but will do to some degree life continuum for the thing you hit you say bang i regret it that means that you go right around here and that is not beingness on other dynamics that is being an effect not cause theres two ways that this sort of overt act happens to you one itsyoure cause and you go along and youre just fine and you receive motion of some sort or other and youve got that back here and youve never worried about this motion before but youre being cause and one day you decide to be cause with violence so you pick up this motion and you go wham with it but just as its going you say snnnff but its too late and you spend the next thirty fifty or five thousand years trying to pull back this instant of time which keeps you there on the time track l ron hubbard from the lecture therapy section of technique 80

the data from those lectures the route to infinity i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true my wife and i have been scientologists for over 25 years for variety of reasons we got stalled on the bridge i was at clear my wife at ot iii although we had the purpose and intention to move up the bridge it just wasnt happening as any scientologist would agree this creates serious failed purpose i started listening to the the route to infinity lectures while in my car driving to and from sales and service calls and key datum that ron repeats frequently began to sink in from my own duplication of lrh it was as follows the mest universe is reality only because we all agree to it but that it is really an illusion and shabby one at that ones own universe is the actuality as thetan slides down the scale he reverses this concept so that his own universe becomes seemingly insignificant illusion the mest universe becomes the reality and that the actuality is lost to that thetan somewhere around the fourth lecture the datum finally sunk in and i cognited on what he was saying that the reason i was so pressed back having my intention blunted etc was because i believed that i could survive only if i agreed with mest until it would permit to survive when i got home i put aside all of the problems i was facing located myself in the room i was in and then created the illusion that i was in fact quite successful in anything i wanted to be that had all of the space i needed and could enjoy the game of life and get up the bridge less than two weeks later i pulled in the money to get going on the bridge again and to do it full time this year i have moved from stalled clear to ot iv my wife has completed ot iv and v and in less than two months we will be going to flag for vi and vii now from this viewpoint i see that i was imprisoned in structure of my own making unable to get out even though i was holding the key in my hand which i had forgotten about and i wasnt even aware that i held anything in my hand without the data from those lectures i never would have dreamed such wild dream and been able to hold it there until it came true i share this data with you with the hope and postulate that you can use the data in these lectures and if you are stuck trapped or blunted on your progress up the bridge i cannot recommend this data highly enough mt ot iv order your set now by clicking here or by phone 800 7221733 send your friends this newsletter sendandsubscribelink removelink 2003 bridge publications inc
