series of meetings this week i discussed with president karzai number of issues including karzais concerns with the future of us policy on afghanistan and his opinions on where us policy here had failed the meetings were cordial but raised certain concerns for about the status of the usafghan relationship both in the lead up to the election and over the long term should karzai win reelection karzais comments reinforce my belief that our relationship must be twoway partnership of obligations and responsibilities we must also convince karzai to put his backing behind democratic institutions and professionalized security forces are better equipped to lead afghanistan into the future rather than karzais preference for tribal structures and informal power networks this cable summarizes the content of these four recent meetings as well as subsequent conversation with interior minister atmar end summary 2 snf i met with karzai on four occasions this week on june 30 with comisaf gen mcchrystal and most of karzais national security team and three times on july 1 xxxxxxxxxxxx and finally with codel ellsworth karzai maintained calm demeanor throughout but at several times displayed views that troubled with their potential implications for usafghan relations i also called on atmar on july 2 kandahar incident 3 snf at the june 30 meeting with karzai and his national security advisors gen mcchrystal and i briefed karzai on june 29 incident in which usgfunded equipped and mentored paramilitary force attacked kandahar courthouse the incident resulted in the deaths of several afghan national police officers karzai had earlier received phone calls from highlevel us officials regretting the incident so was calm and did not display the type of emotive anger he has shown following civilian casualty incidents in the later oneonone meeting with i reminded karzai that he had selected and introduced this paramilitary units recruits to the usg in 2002 fact that he had conveniently omitted in larger group settings 4 snf karzai insisted that units operating outside of the afghan armed forces must be brought under the legitimate control of the afghan government gen mcchrystal and i agreed that both counterterrorism paramilitary units and private security companies pscs require more rigorous oversight and be brought under the eventual control of the afghan government pscs required stronger regulations yet the government should also adopt more transparent licensing procedures us policy on afghanistan 5 snf karzai declared in all four meetings that he believed the us was not speaking clearly to afghans on its goals in afghanistan karzai contended that in 2002 the us had stated clear purpose for being involved in afghanistan but had lost its purpose over the past six years as he has in past meetings with us karzai either stated his belief in or repeated rumors questioning the us commitment to strong partnership with afghanistan 6 snf karzai reported pakistani intelligence officials had alleged to afghan officials that the us intended to divide pakistan and weaken afghanistan in order to pursue its fight against terrorist groups at the same time karzai accused iran of trying to weaken afghanistan by supporting the presidential campaign of abdullah abdullah in order to promote decentralization agenda that would strip power from the central government to give to subnational actors over whom iran believed it would have more control incredulously karzai appeared to accept socalled rumors that the us and iran were working together to support abdullah against him 7 snf i pushed back strongly on this misinformation in the june 30 meeting with karzais national security team reiterating to karzai that there was overt or covert us program to support any presidential candidate i then asked karzai if he took at my word on this issue karzai perhaps not wanting to back down in front of his advisors said that he did not karzai said the us had actively encouraged abdullah ashraf ghani and zalmay khalilzad to run for the presidency at one point karzai joked that i should consult my above buddies on national security issues i repeated that the us had favored candidates in kabul 00001767 002 of 003 the race and the formal setting of the meeting was not proper forum to make such inappropriate comments he was embarrassed and helpfully shifted the conversation to another topic i also urged karzai to move away from conspiratorial thinking and instead focus on bringing ideas for the future into his campaign introducing clear platform now will put him in better position to move forward if he wins reelection us mistakes in afghanistan 8 snf karzai and i held oneonone meeting shortly before meeting codel ellsworth karzai agreed with my suggestion to make better effort to present the case for continued and productive us engagement in his meetings with usg visitors from washington however as the codel meeting began karzai reverted to old form and launched into familiar review of the many instances where he believed the us had miscalculated its policies in the region in summary the us had failed to formulate an effective post2001 policy on pakistan had pulled out of southern afghanistan particularly helmand too soon and given too much responsibility to illequipped and casualtyaverse nato allies had failed to effectively engage with and pay respect to the importance of tribal leaders in afghan society and had allowed tribal leader networks to be decimated by insurgent attacks i spoke up then observing that i had visited helmand several years ago before other nato forces took over military operations there and witnessed signs that governance and security were declining under thengov sher mohammed akhundzada atmar on karzais paranoia 9 snf i told interior minister atmar at our july 2 meeting that with his conspiratorial behavior karzai would run the risk of leaving usg interlocutors with the impression that we have accomplished very little here and that the afghan government believed most of the failures lay with us this is not dialogue that will lead to an effective partnership the us has been clear in its past shortcomings in afghanistan but we have yet to see karzai admit to the serious shortcomings in his administration 10 snf atmar agreed with the importance of karzai presenting himself as better international partner he also detailed three existing paranoias that affected karzais worldview 1 karzai did not understand us policy in the region and suspected ulterior motives in our relationship with neighboring countries 2 he suspected the us was contemplating shortterm strategy in afghanistan that would result in our disengagement within the next two years and 3 the us was intent on dumping karzai and supporting another candidate fourth emerging paranoia was of us plot to divide and weaken pashtuns on both sides of the afghanpakistani border despite these paranoias atmar assured that karzai had confidence in his personal relationship with and recognized the need to meet more frequently to work through his misperceptions of us policy and intentions our relationship with karzai 11 snf in these meetings and other recent encounters with karzai two contrasting portraits emerge the first is of paranoid and weak individual unfamiliar with the basics of nation building and overly selfconscious that his time in the spotlight of glowing reviews from the international community has passed the other is that of an evershrewd politician who sees himself as nationalist hero who can save the country from being divided by the decentralizationfocused agenda of abdullah other political rivals neighboring countries and the us in order to recalibrate our relationship with karzai we must deal with and challenge both of these personalities 12 snf the danger of longterm damage to our relationship with and thus our influence over karzai who for now is the clear favorite to win the election is real but not irreversible we need to carefully ensure that the distance between us and karzai does not grow over the remaining weeks before the election karzai has invited for series of oneonone meetings in the near future according to atmar karzai recognizes the importance of closer dialogue i will use this opportunity and others to refocus our dialogue on several points that can improve our mutual understanding including 13 snf we need to seriously examine the issue of armed groups that currently operate outside of the purview of kabul 00001767 003 of 003 official afghan government control the activities of paramilitary units and pscs combined with civilian casualties night searches and others issues related to the presence of foreign forces play into the manifestation of afghans anger that they are not in control of their own country karzai claims only to be vessel for his peoples anger all hubris aside he is expressing legitimate concern of his constituents these problems will be barrier to moving forward in other areas of our relationship until we have properly addressed them 14 snf at the same time we must convince karzai that the usafghan relationship is twoway street of obligations and responsibilities while we accept our own responsibilities karzai must accept and act on our expectation that he elucidate clear vision for how he intends to lead afghanistan over the next five years in way that encourages democratization promotes economic development and recognizes the poisonous effects corruption has had on his governments ability to win the trust and respect of its people if reelected it is my hope that karzai who longer needs to run for reelection will be better positioned and in healthier frame of mind to pursue this agenda as well as meaningful national reconciliation 15 snf i will work now to lay the foundation for improved trust and advances on the two key themes outlined above i will work in tandem with gen mcchrystal on both of these fronts on the discussion of shared responsibilities i will begin frank collaborative and perhaps at times confrontational dialogue with karzai alternative approach is now evident karzais current vision for afghanistans future relies too strongly on warlords tribal chiefs and other personalities of the past who would be difficult to reconcile with our commitments to build strong government institutions and professional security forces eikenberry
