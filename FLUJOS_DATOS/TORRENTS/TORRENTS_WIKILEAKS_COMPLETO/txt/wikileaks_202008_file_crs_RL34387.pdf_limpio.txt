march 20 2003 with the immediate stated goal of removing saddam husseins regime and destroying its ability to use weapons of mass destruction or to make them available to terrorists over time the focus of oif shifted from regime removal to the more openended mission of helping the government of iraq goi improve security establish system of governance and foster economic development gradually an insurgency gained strength in iraq and violence escalated in january 2007 the bush administration announced new strategy the new way forward which included both troop surge and new counterinsurgency approaches that emphasized population security and reconciliation the last surge brigade redeployed from iraq without replacement in july 2008 most observers agree that security conditions in iraq have improved markedly since mid2007 on september 9 president bush calling the decision return on success announced that about 8000 additional us troops would redeploy from iraq without replacement by february 2009 the next major development in the campaign is likely to be implementation of two new us iraqi strategic agreements finalized in late 2008 the documents include strategic framework agreement which outlines principles for bilateral cooperation in multiple areas and status of forceslike document that defines the legal basis for the presence of us forces in iraq and imposes number of constraints on us military operations there together the documents suggest shift toward greater exercise of iraqi sovereignty nearterm issues that the new administration with oversight from the 111 th congress may choose to address include determining how best to build on recent security gains in iraq assessing how much us help is enough in terms of funding personnel and other assistance to support the goi but also to encourage its independence establishing the criteria for further troop drawdowns and continuing to revise the organi zation and focus of the iraqi security forces training and advisory mission longerterm iraq strategy and policy considerations include clarifying longterm us strategic objectives related to iraq and shaping more tr aditional future bilateral relationship with iraq defining us policy toward iranian intervention in iraq and assessing the implications of oif lessons learned for the future of us military forces and for us government interagency collaboration in general this report is designed to provide an assessment of current oif developments in the context of relevant background in order to support congressional

struggling to consolidate those gains and rebuild two new usiraqi strategic agreements finalized in late 2008a strategic framework agreement and status of forceslike documentsuggested shift toward greater exercise of iraqi sovereignty key policy issues the new us administration may choose to address with oversight from the 111 th congress include identifying which us national interests and strategic objectives in iraq and the region should guide further us engagement and determining the timing pace and nature of the transition of the us effort in iraq from counterinsurgency operations to more traditional bilateral relationship g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 oif was launched on march 20 2003 the immediate go as stated by the bush administration was to remove saddam husseins regime including destroying its ability to use weapons of mass destruction or to make them available to terrorists the broad longerterm objective included helping iraqis build new iraq that is prosperous and free1 in october 2002 congress had authorized the president to use force against ira q to defend the national security of the united states against the continuing threat posed by iraq and to enforce all relevant united nations security council resolutions regarding iraq2 after the initial combat operations the focus of oif shifted from regime removal to the more openended mission of helping an emerging new iraqi leadership improve security establish system of governance and foster economic development over time challenges to the emerging iraqi leadership from homegrown insurgents and some foreign fighters mounted sectarian violence grew catalyzed by the february 2006 bombing of the golden mosque in samarra accordingly the character of the war evolved from major combat operations to multifaceted counterinsurgency coin and reconstruction effort in january 2007 in an attempt to reverse the escalation of violence president george w bush announced new strategic

are victory dances in the end zone3 practitioners and observers identified number of factors that may have contributed to the security improvements including the additional surge forces new and institutionalized counter insurgency approaches concerning population security and reconciliation the application of high end technological capabilities by special operations forces sof and closer integration between sof and conventional forces the accumulated experience of us leaders at all levels after multiple tours in iraq the growing numbers and capabilities of the iraqi security forces the groundup rejection of violence and support for the coalition by many sunni arabs and the ceasefire declared by shia cleric moqtada alsadr and the abandonment of violence by many of his followers while conventional forceonforce wars tend to end with the unequivocal defeat of one party the parameters for mission success in counterinsurgency efforts like oif tend to be less definitive and more subject to qualitative interpretation oif remains more likely to end with policy decision by the us or iraqi government or both than with decisive military victory on the battlefield

major but uneven transitions first the substantial security improvements achieved over the course of the surge further deepened with some fluctuations during combat operations in specific regions 4 second most experts believe that the operational capabilities of the iraqi security forces isf continued to grow reflected inand catalyzed byisf operational experiences in basra sadr city amarah mosul and diyala according to us commanders the march 2008 isf operations in basra targeting shia militias were poorly planned and required strong rescue effort by coalition forces the august operations in diyala targeting affiliates of qaeda in iraq aqi were planned by the iraqis in advance but still required coalition forces to provide enablers and to help hold areas once they were cleared 5 some us officials suggested that the ultimate success of these operations facilitated by the coalition gave iraqi political leaders disproportionate confidence in the capabilities of the isf 6 third transition was that formal government of iraq goi responsibility for security grew as additional provinces transitioned to provincial iraqi control pic in practice pic arrangements vary from province to province7 fourth as the isfs basic capabilities improved 3 rod nordland victory dances interview with general david petraeus newsweek august 21 2008 on september 16 2008 gen petraeus relinquished

evolved substantially though unevenly across iraq in terms of substance many embedded transition teams shifted their training focus toward more advanced skills in terms of organization the use of unittounit partnering complementing the work of transition teams grew substantially fifth the geographical focus of us forces in iraq shifted somewhat from north to south in part in anticipation of future challenges and in part in response to the drawdowns of coalition partner forces sixth and finally as civilianled provincial reconstruction teams grew they increasingly took the lead in some efforts formerly spearheaded by the us military nevertheless the militarys extensive presence on the ground at district and local levels compared with the limited number of us civilian experts meant that in practice the military continued to play strong supporting role in helping iraqis develop civil capacity

above unfolded against backdrop of several persistent strategic challengespotential spoilersthat could still disrupt not only security conditions on the ground but also progress toward unified and stable iraq one major challenge is resolving the political status of the multiethnic and oilrich city of kirkuk together with other disputed territories along the green line that divides the kurdistan regional government from the rest of iraq while kirkuk itself has been relatively calm coalition and iraqi officials in kirkuk noted with concern in 2008 that outside players with strong vested interests including ethnically based iraqi political parties and supporters of iraqi turkmen in iraqs neighboring state turkey sometimes use inflammatory language to stir up tensions in the city 8 second major challenge concerns how effectively sunni arabs who are concentrated in western and central iraq are incorporated socially economically and politically into the iraqi polity particular concern is the integration of members of the sons of iraq soi community watch program majority of the sois were sunni arabs and some were former insurgents key shia officials in the goi were long wary of the sois and while some formal mechanisms were established to help integrate them into permanent security and civilian jobs the process has been very slow on october 1 2008 the government of iraq assumed command responsibility for the soi program in baghdad province and in november the goi began paying the sois salaries during the transition sois generally continued to report to work and there was sharp increase in detentions of sois in baghdad however coalition officials have expressed concerns about the possible security repercussions if the goi were to shut down the program cease paying salaries or fail to secure alternative employment for the sois 9 the goi was scheduled to assume responsibility for sois in diyala province in december 2008 and for all remaining sois by mid2009 third major challenge is the potential for violence in the south home to longstanding and growing competition for power and resources between wellestablished shia political factions continued had

both civilian and military have suggested that the appetite of goi officials to be mentored advised or guided by us officialsand thus the leverage that the us government is able to exerciseis diminishing in 2008 as iraqi capacity and capabilities grew and as iraqi confidence in those capabilities increased goi officials demonstrated growing assertiveness and less inclin ation to consult with us officials before taking action 11 that approach was manifested for example in the decision by prime minister nouri maliki to launch military operations in basra in march 2008 and the gois

officials signed two key new agreements designed to define the terms of their future partnership at the strategic and operational levels on november 27 the iraqi parliament voted its support for the two agreements and on december 4 the iraqi presidency council approved them 12 the first document is broad strategic framework agreement designed to provide framework for future cooperation in multiple fields including diplomacy culture economics and energy health and the environment information technology and law enforcement the agreement was based broadly on declaration of principles signed by president bush and iraqi prime minister nouri almaliki on november 27 2007 13 the second document referenced by the strategic framework agreement is similar to status of forces agreement

the us military presence and it imposes number of constraints on the presence and operations of us forces it provides for the withdrawal of all us combat forces from iraqi cities and towns by june 30 2009 and for the withdrawal of all us forces from iraq by december 31 201115 this language is stricter version of earlier drafts that reportedly provided for time horizons or target dates the sofa provides that the united states shall not use iraqi land sea or air as launching or transit point for attacks against other countries16 the strategic framework agreement which echoes this language also provides that the united states shall not seek permanent military presence in iraq the negotiations process reportedly considered various formulations regarding external threats to iraqs sovereignty the agreed language which appears in the sofa requires bilateral consultations in case of such threat but makes other actions compulsory17 the sofa requires that us forces coordinate all military operations with iraqi authorities18 it also grants iraq some legal jurisdiction over us servicemembers and defense civilians specifically in cases of grave premeditated felonies committed off base and outside duty status19 as senior officials on the ground have underscored the sofa acknowledges that many of its provisions will require further interpretation it establishes committee

everything possible to get iraqi institutions up and running limited primarily by resources and personnel available to implement the efforts as iraqi capacity has grown the role of iraqi officials and institutions has shifted to various degrees from sharing responsibilities to leading with some support or backup from the coalition number of us officials both civilian and military have argued that in the words of one military commander its time to take the training wheels off that it is okay to let the iraqis fail taking step back they have argued is not only key to reducing the us commitment over timeit may also be the best way to reduce the risk of iraqi dependence on us help and to encourage iraqis to assume more responsibility and to learn to solve problems themselves the premise might apply to both military capabilities in the form of independent operations by iraqi security forces and to civil capacityfor example in the form of independent efforts by provincial governments to seek the funding they need from the central government and to craft and execute their own budgets other officials have pointed out that the advisability of loosening the reins may depend on the location and the circumstances for example us commanders have noted the march 2008 iraqilaunched military operations in basra would likely not have been success without substantial enablers provided by the coalition in that case since the prime minister himself had launched the operation the political consequences of failure were likely to have been great so it was important for th coalition not to let the iraqi effort fail 21 other us officials in iraq have cautioned that progress to date notwithstanding it is important not to declare victory too soon they stress that it is the us presence and support that have made improvements possible and while further drawdowns may continue to be possible that is different from full departure one us military commander observed in august 2008 if we left today it would be significant problem if we left ten months from now it would also be significant problem 22 g8g158g155g157g145g142g155g561g22g155g152g152g153g561g6g155g138g160g141g152g160g151g156g561 the likely future trajectory of the us presence in iraq following the redeployment of the last surge brigade in july 2008 includes further troop drawdowns on september 9 2008 speaking at the national defense university president bush announced the planned redeployment from iraq without replacement of an additional 8000 troops including combat support forces marine battalion and an army brigade combat team the president described these drawdown decisions as return on successwhile progress on the ground was still fragile and reversible the gains had achieved degree of durability he did not name timeline for decisions concerning possible further drawdowns but he added if progress in iraq continues to hold general petraeus and our military leaders believe additional reductions will be

capabilitiesmay be germane to the future drawdowns debate first forthcoming political milestones in iraq may shape both us and iraqi thinking iraq is tentatively scheduled to hold both provinciallevel and nationallevel elections in 2009 24 some us officials in iraq and some outside observers suggest that the potential security risks of these events argue for sustaining sizable us troop presence through the elections25 some goi officials too might have an interest in maintaining sufficient us forces to help provide security through the elections other goi officials on the other hand might have an interest for election purposes in playing the nationalism card and publicly calling for an early drawdown of us forces second the drawdown debates may be affected by the redeployment of most coalition partner troops the expiration of the mandate authorizing multinational force in iraq applies to all other coalition partner countries as well as the united states and the usiraqi sofa does not apply automatically to other coalition members and most were expected to withdraw from iraq rather than face tough negotiations with the goi about their troop presence third the high demand for forces for the ongoing commitments in iraq and afghanistan has meant for many servicemembers repeated deployments extended deployments andor short dwell times at home between tours military departments responsible in accordance with title 10 us code for organizing manning training and equipping the force are concerned about the stress these demands have placed on the force over time dod has introduced series of policies designed to manage that stressfor example limiting active duty army deployments to 12 months for those deploying after august 1 2008 such stress on the force and the personnel policies designed to manage it may help shape future iraq drawdown decisions fourth further drawdown decisions may be affected by competing strategic demands for example potential requirements for additional us forces in afghanistan chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral michael mullen has publicly stated the need for more forces in afghanistan and underscored the connection between the ability to meet that need and the troop requirement in iraq 26 continued house armed services committee september 10 2008 24 in october 2008 iraqs presidency council passed

by several sets of practical constraints including available ground and air transportation for withdrawing personnel and equipment from iraq and both the willingness and capacity of neighboring states

major schools of thought about the basic logic of further troop drawdown decisions one school argues for conditionsbased approach and the other for phased withdrawal according to timeline the conditionsbased approach calls for carrying out continual assessments of the situation on the ground and initiating further troop drawdowns as conditions allow bearing in mind the final withdrawal date of 2011 the relevant conditions might include security conditions on the ground isf capabilities and the capacity of iraqi governing institutions at all levels 27 this approach is generally favored by commanders on the ground and it was also supported by the bush administration speaking at the pentagon in march 2008 on the fifth anniversary of the start of operation iraqi freedom president bush indicated that further drawdowns of the surge brigades would be conditionsbased any furt her drawdown will be based on conditions on the ground and the recommendations of our commandersand they must not jeopardize the hardfought gains our troops and civilians have made over the past year 28 in his september 9 2008 announcement of further troop drawdowns president bush made clear that the reductions were response to improved conditions on the ground and that further reductions would depend on future conditionswhether progress in iraq continues to hold29 the conditionsbased approach is highly dynamic mnfi expects continued progression over time in its relationships with isf partnersfrom leadership to partnership to tactical and then operational overwatch

that were embarking upon is one of simply thinning the ranks if you will in areas that are going well retaining some coalition presence there to continue to work with the iraqi security forces and these security volunteers so that theres tactical overwatch or operational overwatch if you will and retaining us troop strength in the areas where were still working hard 31 some proponents argue that this approach supports wellinformed decisionmaking and that it is more responsive than other approaches to changing circumstances on the ground since decisions are made close to the time of execution rather than long time in advance as three key observers who support this approach wrote any schedule for withdrawal will be subject to the inherent uncertainty of conflict as complex as the one in iraq 32 others argue that in the words of some commanders the approach would help avoid the danger of going too quickly in this view toohasty withdrawal unguided by conditions on the ground could allow aqi affiliates or shia renegade militias to reassert themselves and attempt to regain lost ground before iraqi security forces have sufficient capabilities to counter such efforts and before iraqi governing institutions have sufficient capacity to orchestrate and lead such responses the primary charge against this approach by those who oppose it is that conditionsbased approach is inherently openended it does not provide leverage they charge for pressing iraqi leaders to assume greater responsibility further its inherent uncertainty makes it difficult for the us military to plan to meet other global security requirements the other major school of thought the phased troo p withdrawal approach calls for establishing fixed timeline as the basis for further drawdowns advocates of this approach might call for example for the withdrawal of one brigade combat team per month alternatively they might start by naming date earlier than december 2011 by which all us combat forcesor all us forcesmust be withdrawn from iraq and working backwards from that date propose periodic preceding redeployments for some proponents of this school of thought the primary objective is simply to end the us commitment in iraq on the grounds that the mission simply should not be top us national priority timetable approach meets that objective by definition other proponents of scheduled withdrawal stress that the us troop and dollar commitments in iraq are detracting from the united states ability to prepare to meet other security challenges some point in particular to stress on the ground forcesthe army and the marine corpsand argue that nearterm drawdown would relieve that stress help guarantee the availability of forces for afghanistan and other contingencies and make it easier for the services to recruit and retain 33 31 see department of defense news briefing major general joseph fil december 17 2007 httpwwwdefenselinkmil

least in part on the view that the us troop presence in iraqand the antipathy that may be generated among the iraqi population by the presence of facto occupiercould be hindering further progress they suggest in turn that announced troop withdrawal plans could spur progress by encouraging iraqi leaders to accelerate their own efforts to assume more responsibility and make progress toward reconciliation and by urging international partners to increase their constructive involvement34 one practical advantage of the timetable option is the clarity and certainty it would provide concerning costs timelines and requirements us military planners could plan each step with reasonable fidelity us diplomats could work well in advance with neighboring countries on access needed to support the withdrawal and iraqi leaders and security forces could plan in detail how to adjust some opponents of this option suggest that its deliberateness could prove advantageous to various adversaries in iraq who might take advantage of the predictability to target us forces as they redeploy alternatively such adversaries might simply choose to lie low until us forces redeploy making them more difficult to target and leaving the bulk of the challenge for iraqis to face on their own other opponents of this option argue that its primary strategic drawback is that if executed too precipitately it could consign the iraq mission itself to failurethat iraqi institutions are simply not all ready to assume fu ll responsibility and so tooearly withdrawal of us forces from iraq could prove destabilizing and could place iraqs future in jeopardy

supporting the development of the iraqi security forces isf is critical focus of us military operations in iraq together with security and helping build civil capacity it is one of the three lines of operation of multinational corpsiraq mnci the operationallevel command under mnfi with geographic responsibility for all of ir aq the coalitions efforts to train equip and mentor the isf have always varied across the battle space of iraq in terms of organization and focus depending on the conditions on the ground the level of development of the locally based isf and the availability of coalition forces for training missions in 2008 several discernible transitions in the training mission were underway if unevenly across iraq key operational consideration is the future direction of the isf training mission including its focus its organization and its relative share of the overall us effort g22g155g138g151g156g146g157g146g152g151g561g22g142g138g150g156g561 the standard approach to training the isf has been the use of embedded transition teams that typically live and work with their host unit key point of variation over time has been the size of these teams transition teams working with the ir aqi army for example have typically included between 11 and 15 members depending on the size of the iraqi unit they embed with in practice however the numbers have variedfor example in western anbar province multinational forcewest mnfw led by us marines consis tently used larger teams with between 30 and 40 members 35 one key development over time in the view of

effectiveness of the transition teamsin part reflection of standardization and improvements in the training pipelines used by the military departments to produce the trainers36 in 2008 as the basic operational capabilities of the isf grew the use of embedded transition teams shifted toward higherlevel isf headquarters including brigades and divisions the substantive efforts of the teams also shifted from basic skills like patrolling to leadership and enablers for example teams working with the ir aqi army increased their focus on staff functions and logistics and teams working with the iraqi police increased the emphasis on specialized skills like forensics while logistics experts in the us military are wellplaced to share that expertise with iraqi army counterparts us military police mps generally do not have the requisite specialized policing skills and have thus relied on collaboration with civilian international police advisors who are in short supply g23g151g146g157g561g18g138g155g157g151g142g155g146g151g144g561 in 2008 in addition to transition teams coalition forces throughout iraq made increasing use of various forms of unit partnering in which co alition maneuver units work sidebyside with iraqi units of equal or larger size commanders on the ground stressed the value of unit partnership as an effective way to show rather than just tell isf unit leaders how they might most effectively organize their headquarters lead their troops and manage staff functions 37 where conditions permitted commanders extended unit partnering beyond the iraqi army to ministry of the interior moi forces including the iraqi police and the department of border enforcement that outreach to the moi was more common in multinational divisioncenter south of baghdad and in multinational forcewest in anbar than in multinational divisionnorth which was still actively engaged in combat operations together with isf counterparts in diyala and ninewah provinces unit partnership was not envisaged as permanent arrangementany individual unit partnership was designed to be temporary catalyst to the development of that iraqi unit should circumstances allow commanders notee that unit partnership could still be constructively used for some time since some isf units were still at early stages of maturity and the government of iraq was still in the process of adding new units to its total force g5g138g153g138g140g146g157g162g556g4g158g146g149g141g146g151g144g561 throughout 2008 coalition forces also provided substantial support to the capacitybuilding of the key security institutions of the government of iraqthe ministry of defense the ministry of the interior and the counterterrorism bureau this support led by the multinational security transition commandiraq mnstci part of mnfi included mentoring iraqi senior leaders in leadership and management skills as well as providing technical assistance to ministry personnel 36 interviews with mnfi and mnci officials and subordinate commands august 2008 in the view of many experts one issue shaping the quality of the transition teams has b een individual incentive to serve on such teams based on the degree to which promotion boards favorably regard such service some dod officials note that the incentives based on personnel rules are improving while some practitioners anecdotally that training missions tend not to be as highly regarded as more traditional combat assignments 37 interviews with mnci officials and subordinate commanders august 2008

such capacitybuilding efforts while iraqis were still receptive to receiving such training with appropriate leadership skills they argued iraqi senior leaders in the security sector could make substantially greater and more effective contributions to the development of the isf gradually reducing the need for us advice and support coalition commanders also underscored the importance of utilizing the right personnel for the mission including senior mentors with enough leadership experience and stature to carry weight with their iraqi counterparts 38

have argued that the overall focus of the us effort in iraq should shift away from combat and toward training and advising iraqi forces and the ministries that govern them in december 2007 for example retired general barry mccaffrey proposed strengthening the emphasis on isf training and massively resourcing the creating of an adequate iraqi security force 39 in september 2008 iraq watchers john nagl colin kahl and shawn brimley called for reorientation of the military mission toward advising in which embedded military advisers would provide just enough help to give iraqis what they need on the battlefield but not so much that it stymies their development and perpetuates view of western occupation40 in theory improvements in security conditions and corresponding decline in requirements for combat operations could continue to make more us forces available to play training and advisory roles for the isf even in the co ntext of further us troop drawdowns one key consideration would be making sure that those us forces tasked with training and advisory missions would have adequate resources to draw on with fewer us combat forces close by the us maneuver units that partner with iraqi units in the unit partnering model are selfsustaining but further troop drawdowns would reduc the units available for such missions in the various transition team models in turn the teams depend on nearby maneuver units for key logistics and life support they also rely on outside support to provide intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr as well as close air support cas during operations by their partner iraqi units g8g158g157g158g155g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g23g495g21g495g561g8g152g155g140g142g156g561g8g152g152g157g153g155g146g151g157g561 the new sofa includes the requirement that all us combat forces withdraw from iraqi cities villages and localities later than the time when isf assume security responsibility in the relevant province but later than june 30 2009 such withdrawals are expected to mean consolidating combat troops at large forward operating bases outside urban areas the key operational issue is what form these changes are likely to take and what impact they are likely to have on security conditions on the ground top us commanders in iraq have long argued that living where we work is what has made the counterinsurgency effort success to date this phrase refers to establishing security presence 38 interviews with mnfi and mnstci officials august 2008 for example some argue us army colonel simply has not held high enough leadership positions within his own department of defense to be an appropriate advisor to an iraqi minister 39 see general barry r mccaffrey after action report visit iraq and kuwait 511 december 2007 december

will require subtle shift in how we plan coordinate and execute missions throughout iraq and that new rules of engagement will be issued44 key issue is the impact that such measures will have on us operations in practice according to commanders on the ground the vast majority of us operations are already closely coordinated with the goi further most of those operations are already combined with iraqi forces the provincial iraqi control pic process has facilitated transition in the way us forces do business since pic arrangementswhich may vary by provincegenerally require coordination on us operations in addition in some cases the goi has agreed in advance that us forces may carry out certain categories of activities or may take action against certain targets the greatest challenge in

temporary support for the iraqi authorities in the mission of surveillance and control of iraqi air space46 the caveat is important because the capabilities of the iraqi air force are still in the very early stages of development and training in addition that training has focused first of all on skills relevant to the ongoing counterinsurgency coin fight such as moving troops and supplies and providing some isr iraqi officials and commanders on the ground aware that they still lack key coin capabilities such as sufficient isr and cas and that they do not yet have the ability to defend iraqi airspace are reportedly eager to retain the support of us air assets and us officials have suggested that it should be possible to reach agreements on shared use of air space 47 the sofa does not address parallel concern related to operational coordination iraqi coordination with us forces concerning isf operations us commanders on the ground report that the isf sometimes have informed us forces only after they have carried out local operations some commanders add that these are positive developments in terms of growing isf capabilities and initiative 48 at the same time it could be helpful for us forces to know in advance about significant isf operations for two reasons first the isf might call on us forces suddenly during such operations to provide key enablers second such operations could have an impact on us force protection article 22 of the sofa describes provisions for detainee operations one set of provisions places tight new constraints on the circumstances under which us forces may take iraqis into physical custody49 another set of provisions of even more concern to us commanders on the ground specifies how the cases of those detainees currently held by coalition forces will be further adjudicated specifically when the sofa enters into force us forces are required to provide information about all detainees held then iraq authorities will issue arrest warrants for persons who are wanted by them us forces will turn over custody of all wanted detainees and then release all remaining detainees in safe and orderly manner 50 in anticipation of more stringent new detention regime throughout 2008 mnfi carried out detainee release program releasing detainees to their homes and communities whenever possible as of late november 2008 us forces held approximately 15800 detainees in theater internment facilities after releasing more than 17500 during 2008 51 but commanders have expressed concerns about the remaining legacy population in many cases the coalition lacks releasable evidence with legal sufficiency in iraqi courts scrupulous collection of evidencesuch as photographs diagrams eyewitness accountscommon in civilian law enforcement was not always an integral part of coalition combat operations in iraq such legacy detainees could pose real security threats to the iraqi population or to the coalition some coalition officials and

freedom the balance of us civilian and military roles and responsibilities has shifted as rule the military has played the preponderant role including in nontraditional fields such as governance and reconstruction although civilian contributions have grown over time looking forward key operational question is the most effective future balance of us civilian and military effort in iraq as security conditions on the ground in iraq have improved civilian and military officials all point to increased opportunities for civilian assistance initiatives particularly capacitybuilding at all levels as one us commander argued embassy people should be out more every day now like we are 53 some provincial iraqi officials for their part appear eager to welcome additional us civilian expertise54 one future option as us troops draw down would be to increase the us civilian effort in iraq in terms of personnel and resources to support civil capacity building at the national provincial and local levels the primary constraint on possible civilian surge to follow the military surge may be the limited capacity of the department of state the us agency for international development and other civilian agencies to deploy significant numbers of personnel one consideration would be how well provincial reconstruction teams prts are able to function without substantial nearby coalition military presence good test cases for this scenario already exist in may 2008 the personnel of the prts for najaf and karbala provinces who had been operating from remote base in hillah in babil province relocated to their respective areas of operation najaf and karbala are both pic provinces with limited us military presence in najaf for example the prt including small us military team that provides them with movement is based at small forward operating base fob together with us army transition team that works with the local iraqi army battalion and small us military mayors cell that manages the installation 55 team of private security contractors from triple canopy provides static security some key steps have been taken to amplify civilian assistance efforts at the provincial level including the addition of 66 civilian subject matter experts in technical fields including agriculture and business development to work with the prts56 however us embassy officials note that it is likely that peak prt staffing levels in iraq have already been reached the embassyin response to direction from congre ssis working on prt strategic drawdown plans57 52 interviews with mnfi officials and

though military officers are usually the first to note that they lack the requisite expertise58 one key role of the us military in iraq is supporting civilianled efforts to prov ide iraqis with governance mentorship and in particular to build linkages among the national regional and local levels as mnci officials noted our job at corps is to establish the connective tissue between the center and the provinces59 in many instances while prts focus on governance at the provincial level military units with far more boots on the ground work regularly to foster governance at the district and local levels including linkages with higher levels of iraqi government60 the us military continues to provide some support for smallscale reconstruction initiatives though unevenly across iraq some commanders continue to facilitate the reopening of small businessand to use the number of reopened businesses as metric of economic progresswhile others have decided to give back that is not spend

iraqs facto exercise of sovereignty grows as the role of the united states evolves correspondingly and as further us troop drawdowns are contemplated it might be useful to confirm or update the short list of critical us national interests regarding iraq and the key strategic objectives that at minimum it is important for the united states to achieve in iraq such broad objectives might address both iraq itself and the region and might include the following elements us interests in iraqs domestic political arrangements some might argue that democratic or broadly representative and inclusive iraqi polity is essential as key to iraqs stability while others might argue that the nature of iraqs domestic political arrangements is much less important than simply unified and stable iraq us interests in iraqs role in the fight against global terrorist networks some might argue that the most important goal is simply ensuring that iraq does not serve as safe haven for terrorists others might stress the importance of active intelligencesharing with the united states still others might argue that it is in us interests that iraq couple the counterterrorism skills it is currently developing as part of its domestic counterinsurgency effort with expeditionary capabilities so that it could participate in future regional counterterrorist activities 58 interviews with multinational division

continues to wane us policy makers may wish to reassess how the us government might most effectively apply political economic and security levers to help shape iraqs transformation into stable and

addition to us strategic objectives concerns the kind of longterm relationship the united states wants to have with iraq and the kind of us presence in iraq that would be required to support such relationship on september 10 2008 in testimony before the house armed services committee secretary of defense robert gates argued that we should expect to be involved in iraq for many years to come although in changing and increasingly limited ways 62 issues for the congress regarding future us military presence in iraq could include costs and policy oversight of integrated efforts by department of state and the department of defense personnel in theory one option would be establishing permanent us military bases in iraq to support broader us policy in the region possibly on the model of those in japan south korea germany and italy this option does not appear to enjoy support from the bush administration members of congress or from the government of iraq another option would be particularly robust of fice of security cooperation osc responsible for training and mentoring iraqi security forces and building the capacity of iraqi security ministries following the usual pattern the osc would be responsible to both the us ambassador to iraq and to the commander of us central command one possible model might be the us military training mission to saudi arabia which operates on the basis of bilateral memorandum of understanding and serves to train advise and assist the saudi arabian armed forces 62 robert m gates statement before the house armed services committee september

it is not clear to what extent us iran policy factors in current and potential iranian activities in southern iraq in the context of growing potential for us military confrontations with iranian proxies in southern iraq it may be important to consider scenarios in which tacticallevel developments might escalate into strategiclevel concerns according to us and iraqi officials iraq partic ularly in the south continues to face potential threat from special groups trained by irans quds forces63 meanwhile multinational corps iraq mnci is in the process of shifting it s focus somewhat from north to south in iraq including increasing the us troop presence in southern iraq as coalition partner troops withdraw or draw down according to commanders on the ground the growing us footprint in southern iraq is not likely to be lost on iran64 in this context the us may find itself increasingly engaged in shadowboxing with iranian proxies at the tactical level in southern iraq

how military departments fulfill their title 10 responsibilities to organize man train and equiphow they make decisions about endstrength and capabilities requiredmay depend in part on lessons drawn

available for assistance to iraq only to the exte nt that the government of iraq matches such assistance on dollarfordollar basis70 more broadly in the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability appropriations act of 2007 congress established 18 benchmarks for the performance of the government of iraq and provided that further us strategy in iraq would be conditioned on the iraqi governments meeting those benchmarks71 another tool is holding oversight hearings to ask administration officials to account for the progress and results to date of policy implementation for example on september 10 2008 the house armed services committee invited secretary of defense robert gates and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff admiral michael mullen to testify at hearing entitled security and stability in afghanistan and iraq developments in us strategy and operations and the way ahead on september 23 2008 the senate armed services committee held hearing on the situation in iraq and afghanistan with secretary gates and general james cartwright vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff congress may also shape policy by establishing reporting requirements

of fy2009 comprehensive set of performance indicators and measures for progress toward military and political stability in iraq the act lists detailed reporting requirements in two areas stability and

stretching back to the 1991 gulf war and its aftermath g3g151g157g142g140g142g141g142g151g157g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g343g351g351g342g156g561 in the 1990s the united states shared with other countries concern with the iraqi governments weapons of mass destruction wmd programs iraq had demonstrated willingness to use wmd against its neighbors during the 19801988 iraniraq war and against its own citizens as it did for example against iraqi kurds in halabja in 1988 us policy after the gulf war supported the united nationsled weapons inspection regime and the economic sanctions imposed to encourage iraqs compliance with that regime before they were withdrawn in 1998 weapons inspectors located and destroyed sizable quantities of wmd in iraq us postgulf war policy also included containment initiativesno fly zonesimposed by the united states together with the united kingdom and initially france the northern fly zone operation northern watch was designed to protect the iraqi kurdish population in northern iraq and international humanitarian relief efforts there operation southern watch was designed to protect the shia arab population in southern iraq these containment measures were periodically marked by iraqi provocations including troop buildups and attempts to shoot down allied aircra ft and by allied responses including attacks on targets inside iraq 73 in december 1998 the united states and the united kingdom launched operation desert fox whose stated purpose was to degrade iraqs ability to manufacture or use wmd also during the late 1990s policy climate more conducive to aggressive action against the iraqi regime began to take shape in washington dc as some policy experts began to advocate actively fostering iraqi resistance in order to encourage regime change74 in 1998 congress 73 overall some 300000 sorties were flown in 2002 for example iraqi forces fired on coalition aircraft 500 times prompting 90 coalition air strikes against iraqi targets see suzann chapman the war before the war air force magazine february 2004 chapman cites air force general john jumper as noting in march 2003 that between june 2002 and march

for many us policy makers the september 11 2001 attacks catalyzed or heightened general concerns that wmd might fall into the hands of terrorists reflecting those concerns the first national security strategy issued by the bush administration in september 2002 highlighted the policy of preemptive or anticipatory action to forestall hostile acts by adversaries even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemys attack 76 throughout 2002 the stated position of the administration was to aggressively seek iraqi compliance with security council resolutions concerning the inspections regime while holding out the possibility of chapter vii action if iraq did not comply 77 in september 2002 addressing the general assembly president bush stated the security council resolutions will be enforced or action will be unavoidable on that occasion president bush also articulated list of conditions that iraq must meet if it wanted to avoid retaliatory action give up or destroy all wmd and longrange missiles end all support to terrorism cease persecution of its civilian population account for all missing gulf war personnel and accept liability for losses and end all illicit trade outside the oilforfood program78 on november 8 2002 following intensive negotiations among its permanent 5 members79 the security council issued resolution 1441 in it the council decided that iraq remained in material breach of its obligations that the council would afford iraq final opportunity to comply that failure to comply would constitute further material breach and that in that case iraq would face serious consequences80 this language though strong by standards was not considered by most observers to imply automaticitythat is that iraqi noncompliance would automatically trigger unauthorized response under chapter vii while the iraqi government eventually provided large quantity of written materials the administration deemed iraqi compliance to be insufficient the administration chose not to seek 75 the iraq liberation act pl 105338 october 31 1998 authorized support to iraqi democratic opposition organizationsand included provisions concerning how to identify

on march 17 2003 when president bush issued an ultimatum to saddam hussein and his sons to leave iraq within 48 hours their refusal to do so he said would result in military conflict81

to the nation it is too late for saddam hussein to remain in power in that speech he promised iraqis we will tear down the apparatus of terror the tyrant will soon be gone 83 in his march 2003 speech president bush declared that in the longer term the united states would help iraqis build new iraq that is pr osperous and free it would be an iraq as he described it that would not be at war with its neighbors and that would not abuse its own citizens84 those were the basic endstate elements typically used by war planners the us central command centcom oif campaign pla n for example described the strategic objective this way stable iraq with its territorial integrity intact and broadbased government that renounces wmd development and use and longer supports terrorism or threatens its

premise of that vision captured in the 2002 national security strategy was that the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our force92 in general that meant transitioning from military structured to deter massive cold warera armies to leaner and more agile force at issue in the oif planning debates was not only how to fight the war in iraq but alsoimplicitlyhow to organize man train and equip the force for the future for military planners the guidance to use streamlined force reflected fundamental shift away from the powell doctrine named after the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff which stressed that force if us ed should be overwhelming93 the planning effort started early just before thanksgiving 2001 president bush asked secretary rumsfeld to develop plan for regime removal in iraq and secretary rumsfeld immediately gave that assignment to the commander of us central command centcom general tommy franks 94 the planning effort for combat operations was initially very close hold involving only few key leaders and small groups of trusted planners at each level as the effort progressed the number of people involved grew but key elements of the plans remained compartmentalized such that few people had visibility on all elements of the plans95 the starting point for the planning effort was the existing on the shelf iraq war plan known as 100398 which had been developed and then refined during the 1990s that plan called for force of between 400000 and 500000 us troops including three corps or corps equivalents with long timeline for the deployment and buildup of forces beforehand when general franks briefed secretary rumsfeld on these plans in late november 2001 secretary rumsfeld reportedly asked for completely new versionwith fewer troops and faster deployment timeline96 in early 2002 general franks briefed secretary rumsfeld on the generated start plan that plan called for very early infiltration by cia teams to build relationships and gain intelligence and then the introduction of special operations fo rces particularly in northern iraq and in anbar province in the west the main conventional forces effort would

first gulf war was collection of ideas not written document other key elements included force should only be used as last resort when there is clear threat there must be strong public support for the use of force there must be clear exit strategy the powell doctrine derived in part from the weinberger doctrine named after former secretary of defense caspar weinberger powells onetime boss which had

and hit iraqs missile radar command and control and other leadership sites on the model of the gulf war98 but the early introduction of ground forcesrather than an extended exclusively air campaignwas apparently intended to take iraqi forces by surprise99 later in the spring of 2002 centcom and subordinate planners developed an alternative plan called running start which addressed the possibility that the iraqi regime might choose the wars start time through some provocation such as the use of wmd running start called for smaller overall force and shorter timeline it would still begin with infiltration by cia teams followed by the introduction of sof air attacks w ould go first and as ground forces flowed into theater the ground attacks could begin any time after the first 25 days of air attacks the ground war might begin with as few as 18000 ground forces entering iraq 100 in the summer of 2002 planners developed socalled hybrid version of these two plans101 which echoed key elements of the running start planbeginning with an air campaign and launching the ground war while other ground forces still flowed into theater specifically the plan called for presidential notification 5 days in advance 11 days to flow forces 16 days for the air campaign the start of the ground campaign as ground forces continued to flow into theater and total campaign that would last

on the day after to help bring about the strategic objective free and prosperous iraqwas not nearly as thorough as the planning for combat operations for the us military the stakes of the postwar planning efforts were very high in theory civilian agencies would have the responsibility for using political diplomatic and economic tools to help achieve the desired political endstate for iraq while the department of defense and its military forces would play only supporting role after the end of major combat operations but by far the greatest number of coalition personnel on the ground in iraq at the end of major combat would be us military forces and the us military was very likely to become the default option for any unfilled roles and any unanticipated responsibilities number of participants and observers have argued that the administration should have sent larger number of us troops to iraq to provide security in the postmajor combat period ambassador l paul bremer who served as the administrator of the coalition provisional authority cpa throughout the formal occupation of iraq leveled this criticism after departing iraq asked what he would have changed about the occupation he replied the single most important changethe one thing that would have improved the situationwould have been having more troops in iraq at the beginning and throughout 105 logical fallacy in the numberoftroops critique is that how many troops do you need is not an especially meaningful question unless what those troops will be expected to do is clarified by many accounts the oif postwar planning process did not provide commanders before the start of combat operations with clear picture of the extent of their assigned postwar responsibilities 106 103 information from v corps

would be in charge in iraq on the day after for the military decisions by the administration about who would do what would help clarify the militarys own roles and responsibilities before making such decisionsin particular what responsibilities would be carried out by iraqisthe administration cultivated iraqi contacts based on months of negotiations in conjunction with the government of the united kingdom the administration helped sponsor series of conferences of iraqi oppositionists including expatriates and some iraqisnotably iraqi kurdswho could come and go from their homes the events included major conference in london in december 2002 and followon event in salahuddin iraq in february 2003107 at these events iraqi oppositionists agreed on political statement and selfnominated leadership council but the events did not directly produce us policy decisions about postwar roles and responsibilities 108 during the same time frame the departments of state and defense were locked in debate about postwar political plans for iraq the state depa rtment supported deliberate political process including slowly building new political institutions based on the rule of law while in the meantime iraqis would serve only in advisory capacities through the second half of 2002 the state departments future of iraq project brought together iraqi oppositionists and experts in series of working groups to consider an array of potential postwar challenges while tacit goal of the project was to identify some iraqis who might serve in future leadership positions it was not designed to produce slate of leadersinwaiting 109 the project was also not designed to produce formal plans however some of the ideas it generated did reportedly help operationallevel military planners refine their efforts and the project might have had greater impact had more of its output reached the planners 110 the department of defense dodmore specifically and accurately the office of the secretary of defense osdfavored putting iraqis in charge of iraq in some form as soon as possible based loosely on the model of afghanistan real iraqi leadership with real power some officials believed might find

charge of iraq as soon as possible112 in the fall of 2002 clear decision emerged about the role of iraqis in immediate postwar iraq discussions among senior leaders apparently focu sed on the concept of usled transitional civil administration that would govern or help govern iraq however agreement was reached at that time about what authority such body would have what its responsibilities would be how long it would last or which iraqis would be involved113 in january 2003 administration thinking coalesced around broad postwar political process for iraq captured in what was universally known at the time as the megabrief the approach favored the state departments preference for deliberate process that would give iraqi post saddam political life chance to develop organically but it also acknowledged dods concern to provide visible iraqi leadershipthough very weakly empoweredas soon as possible the megabrief process would include creating seni orlevel iraqi consultative council icc to serve in an advisory capacity dismissing top iraqi leaders from the saddam era but welcoming most lowerranking officials to continue to serve creating an iraqi judicial council holding national census conducting municipal elections holding elections to constitutional convention that would draft constitution carrying out constitutional referendum and then holding national elections it was envisaged that the process would take years to complete 114 the megabrief approachwhich gained currency just as us troops were conducting final rehearsals for the warimplied that many governance tasks would need to be performed by coalition noniraqi personnel whether civilian or military for some time to come115 112 tommy franks american soldier new york regan books 2004 p393 franks reports that the

assumptions and clearly specify those assumptions at the beginning of any plans briefing for oif planners the critical policy assumptions concerned who would have which postwar roles and responsibilities oif preparations reversed the usual sequence in that military planning began long before the key policy debates let alone policy conclusions during their planning process military commanders apparently sought to elicit the policy guidance they needed by briefing their policy assumptions and hoping for response116 in december 2001 in his first oif brief to president bush general franks included as one element of the mission establish provisional iraqi government but this measure was neither confirmed nor rejected general franks wrote later that as he briefed this to the

military sought to elicit guidance about the coalitions own postwar architecture and responsibilities according to general franks the centcom war pl ans slides briefed to president bush and the

of the air and ground campaigns the planned sequence shifted in two major ways at the last minute by early 2003 the plans called for beginning with short aironly campaign followed by the ground invasion however latebreaking evidence gave rise to stronger concerns that the iraqi regime would deliberately destroy its southern oil wells so the timing of the ground forces launch was moved up ahead of the scheduled air campaign launch then even closer to launch time the cia obtained what seemed to be compelling information about saddam husseins locationat dora farms near baghdad in the early hours of march 20 just as the ultimatum expired pair of f117 fighters targeted the site that attack narrowly followed barrage of tomahawk missiles launched from ships at key leadership sites in baghdad that night coalition ground forces crossed the line of departure from the kuwaiti desert into southern iraq the following day march 21 2003 brought the largerscale shock and awe attacks on iraqi command and control and other sites from both air force and navy assets early iraqi responses included setting few oil wells on fire and firing few poorly directed missiles into kuwait most of which were successfully intercepted by patriot missiles129 g22g145g142g561g9g155g152g158g151g141g561g5g138g150g153g138g146g144g151g561 the ground campaign was led by army lieutena nt general david

130 meanwhile the 1st marine expeditionary force imef led by lieutenant general james conway was assigned the eastern route closer to the border with iran from tactical perspective for both the army and the marines this was very long projection of force over 600 kilometers from kuwait up to baghdad and more for those units that pushed further north to tikrit or to mosul those long distances reportedly strained capabilities including logistics and communications 128 some discrepancies in contemporary press coverage and later accounts are due to the eighthour time difference between washington dc where president bush issued the 48hour ultimatum on the evening of march 17 and baghdad where that ultimatum expired in the early morning of march 20 the timeline of operations described

more urban areas than the armys western route the basic strategy still called for quick drive to baghdad just across the border into iraq imef took the far southern port city of umm qasr the uk first armored division which fell under imef was tasked to take basra iraqs second largest city the uk division faced resistance from members of the paramilitary force saddam fedayeen and others still loyal to the baath party to limit casualties in the large urban area rather than enter the city immediately in full force the division used more methodical elimination of opponents combined with outreach to the population to explain their intentions imef supported the divisions use of slow and deliberate tempo after several weeks of gradual attrition the division pushed into basra on april 6 2003 the main imef force encountered some resistance as they pushed north in particular at the town of nassiriyah geographical chokepoint at nassiriyah there were number of things that seemed to hit us all

sandstorms and the saddam fedayeen put up determined resistancenot shock but surprise as ltgen conway later reflected evidence suggested that additional iraqi fighters inspired by the ambush carried out by the fedayeen came from baghdad to nassiriyah to join the fight 131 after the defeating the resistance at nassiriyah the marines pushed up to baghdad along their eastern route in the west the army faced longer distance but lesspopulated terrain v corps began combat operations with two divisions under its command the third infantry division 3id under major general buford blount and the 101 st airborne division 101st under major general david petraeus the 3id rapidly led the western charge to ba ghdad moving speedily through the south and reaching saddam international airport on april 4 the division launched its first thunder run fast armored strikeinto baghdad on april 5 and the second on april 7 the purpose of the first according to the brigade commander in charge colonel david perkins was to create as much confusion as i can inside the city the purpose of the second was to make sure in uncertain terms that people knew the city had fallen and we were in charge of it 132 the 101st followed the 3id up the western route through southern iraq clearing resistance in southern cities and allowing the 3id to move as quickly as possible soldiers from the 101st faced fighting in

resistance they encountered from the saddam fedayeen ltg wallace apparently caused some consternation at higher headquarters levels with his candid remarks to the press in late march the enemy were fighting is different from the one wed wargamed against he explained the attacks were seeing are bizarre technical vehicles with 50 calibers and every kind of weapon charging tanks and bradleys134 coupled with major sand storms these attacks posed challenges to the ground forces long supply lineslines of communicationrunning up from kuwait over hundreds of miles through southern iraq 135 in the north on march 26 2003 about 1000 soldiers from the 173rd airborne brigade part of the armys southern european task force based in italy parachuted into northern iraq they began their mission by securing an airfield so that cargo planes carrying tanks and bradleys could land once on the ground the 173 rd working closely with air and ground special operating forces and with kurdish pesh merga forces expanded the northern front of oif initial coalition plans had called for the heavy 4th infantry division 4id to open the northern front by crossing into iraq from turkey the intended primary mission was challenging iraqi regular army forces based above baghdad more subtle secondary mission was to place limits on possible kurdish ambitions to control more territory in northern iraq thus providing some reassurance to the government of turkey and discouraging it from sending turkish forces into iraq to restrain the kurds by early 2003 4id equipment was sitting on ships circling in the eastern mediterranean sea waiting for an outcome of the ongoing negotiations with the turkish government but on march 1 2003 the turkish parliament rejected proposal that would have allowed the 4id to use turkish territory g11g155g138g154g146g561g5g152g151g157g155g146g139g158g157g146g152g151g156g561g157g152g561g15g138g147g152g155g561g5g152g150g139g138g157g561 iraqi opposition fighters made very limited contribution to coalition major combat efforts before the war the office of the secretary of defense had launched an ambitious program to recruit and train up to 3000 iraqi expats to be known as the free iraqi forces training by us forces took place in taszar hungary ultimately the number of recruits and graduates was much lower than originally projected most graduates did deploy to iraq where they served with us forces primarily as interpreters or working with local communities on civil affairs projects 136 meanwhile in late march 2003 iraqi expatriate oppositionist ahmed chalabi contacted us officials with request to send group of his own fighters from northern to southern iraq to join the fight after some discussion agreement was reached and us military flight was arranged in early april chalabi and 600 fighters stepped off the plane at tallil air base in southern iraq 134 rick atkinson general longer war likely washington post march 28 2003 asked whether this suggested

2003 the statue of saddam hussein in firdos square in baghdad was toppled two days after the second 3id thunder run this ev ent signaled for many observers inside and outside iraq that the old iraqi regime had ended consistent with the war plans from generated st art onward us forces continued to flow into iraq the 4th infantry division 4id diverted from its original northern front plans had rerouted its troops and equipment to kuwait 4id forces began entering iraq on april 12 2003 the 1st armored division 1ad also began arriving in april 2003 according to the planning the 1st cavalry division 1cd was scheduled to be next in line however in april 2003 secretary rumsfeld in coordination with general franks made the decision that 1cd was not needed in iraq at that timea decision that apparently caused consternation for some ground commanders 138 as soon as it became apparent that the old regime was longer exercising control widespread looting took place in baghdad and elsewhere targets included government buildings and the former houses of regime leaders but also some private businesses and cultural institutions leaders of the iraqi national museum in baghdad reported for example that looters had taken or destroyed 170000 items of antiquity dating back thousands of years 139 looters and vandals also targeted unguarded weapons stockpiles largely abandoned by former iraqi security forces140 some observers and coalition participants suggested that the coalition simply did not have enough troops to stop all the unlawful behavior141 meanwhile us senior leadership attention had turned to iraqs political future in april the presidents special envoy for free iraqis ambassador zalmay khalilzad chaired two big tent meetings of iraqis the first was held on april 15 2003 at the ancient city of ur near tallil air base and the second was held on april 28 at the baghdad convention center participants include expatriate opposition leaders and iraqi kurds together

the unusual form of parallel letters one from us secretary of state colin powell and one from iraqi prime minister ayad allawi to the president of the security c ouncil those letters were appended to security council resolution 1546 issued on june 8 2004146 that resolution reaffirmed the authorizati on for the multinational force and extended it to the postoccupation periodon the grounds that it was at the request of the incoming interim government of iraq 147 it repeated the authorization language used in the october 2003 resolution with an important qualifier the force was now authorized to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security and stability in iraq in accordance with the letters annexed to this resolution148 the us letter spelled out the tasks the multinational force would undertake including combat operations internment securing of weapons training and equipping iraqi security forces and participating in providing humanitarian assistance civil affairs support and relief and reconstruction assistance some of the early usiraqi discussions had considered the possibility that iraqi forces might in some cases fall under the command of the multinational force149 however the resolution and the appended letters made clear that the commandandcontrol relationship between the iraqi government and the multinational force would be strictly one of coordination not command the resolution called the relationship security partnership between the sovereign government of iraq and the multinational force 150 both letters described coordination modalities to help ensure unity of effort both stated the intention to make use of coordination bodies at the national regional and local levels and noted that multinational force and iraqi officials would keep each other informed of their activities further parameters of the mnfi presence in iraq were spelled out in revised version of order 17 of the coalition provisional authority issued on june

18 provincesthe government of iraq represented by the governor has the lead responsibility for security conventional coalition forces may have little or continual presence and as rule they are required to seek iraqi approval to carry out operations the pic designation is the result of highlevel decision process based on set of criteria with input from iraqi government mnfi and us and uk officials and final decision by iraqs ministerial committee on national security which is chaired by the prime minister 159 as dod has pointed out there is clear postpic assessment process for determining the degree to which transitioned province has achieved sustainable security and the conditions necessary for continued economic growth and stability 160 security conditions on the ground vary among pic provinces for example between calm sulaymaniyah province in the north to recently restive basra province in the southso the pic designation may indicate more about security responsibilities than security conditions 158 the 2004 split of cjtf7 into higher fourstar hq and lower threestar hq was strongly recommended in order to give the commanders time to focus fulltime on

then the number has varied greatly over time in response to events on the ground such as iraqi elections and to strategiclevel decisions such as the 2007 surge the peak surge level of us troops was about 168000 in october 2007 up from relative low of 135000 troops in january 2007 just before surge forces began to arrive as of september 2008 the total number of us troops in iraq was about 145000161 the lower total compared to october 2007 reflects the redeployment from iraq without replacement of all five of the armys surge brigades the 2nd brigade combat team bct of the 82nd airborne division the 4th bct of the 1st infantry division the 3rd bct of the 3rd infantry division the 4th bct of the 2nd infantry division and the 2nd bct of the 3rd infantry division in september 2008 president bush had announced th at an additional army bct would withdraw from iraq in early 2009 without replacement in november 2008 dod announced that that unitthe 2nd bct of the 101st airborne division based in western baghdadwould redeploy about six weeks earlier than planned their depart ure leaves 14 us bcts or bctequivalents in iraq well before the surge by many accounts the demand for forces in iraq had placed some stress on both the active and reserve components the operational benefits of maintaining continuity and keeping forces in place long enough to gain understanding and develop expertise competed against institutional requirements to maintain th health of the force as whole including the ability to recruit and retain personnel an additional challenge was that prewar assumptions only very incompletely predicted the scope and scale of postwar mission requirements which meant in practice especially early in oif that individuals and units deployed without certainty bout the length of their tours us army v corps for example was not specifically given the mission before the war to serve as the post war task force headquarters let alone timeline for that commitment as the press widely reported after the end of major combat operations some members of the 3 rd infantry division 3id which had led the armys charge to baghdad publicly stated their desire to redeploy as soon as possible major general buford blount the 3id commanding general commented you know lot of my forces have been over here since september and fought great fight and are doing great work here in the city but if you ask the soldiers theyre ready to go home 162 sometimes changes in the security situation on the groundrather than anticipated political events like iraqi electionshave prompted decisions to extend deployments the earliest and possibly most dramatic example took place in april 2004 the young shiite cleric muqtada sadr and his militia the jaish almahdi mahdi army staged uprisings in cities and towns throughout shiapopulated southern iraq just as the volatile sunnipopulated city of fallujah in anbar province simmered in the wake of the gruesome murders of four

mission had been accomplished however far more frequently decisions seem to have been informed by domestic political considerations sometimes coupled with apparent pressure from extremists seeking to shape those decisions most notable was the spanish troop withdrawal catalyzed by the march 11 2004 commuter train bombings in madrid which killed nearly 200 people the attacks took place just days before scheduled spanish parliamentary elections in which the ruling party of prime minister jose maria aznar lopez who had supported oif was voted out of office the new prime minister jose luis

within the networks assigned roles range from financiers and planners of coordinated attacks to unskilled labor recruited to emplace improvised explosive devices ieds their efforts to recruit primarily young males have capitalized on iraqs widespread underemployment which can make the prospect of onetime payments appealing 172 and general disaffection spurred by perceived lack of opportunities in the new iraq the infrastructure used by aqi and its affiliates has included safe houses and lines of communication reaching especially through central and northern iraq173 the network has capitalized on iraqs porous borders in early 2008 us military commanders confirmed that the flow of foreign fighters continued from syria into iraq174 in its september 2008 quarterly report to the

tigris river valley in ninewah province176 in early 2008 some aqi elements attempted to regroup in mosul but coalition and iraqi operations pushed aqi elements out of the city and deeper into rural

attacks and using intimidation tactics which may require fewer resources and less coordination that largescale catastrophic attacks in western anbar province where significant security progress was achieved earlier than in the north commanders noteborrowing from maothat theres longer sea for the aqi fish to swim in that is popular support for aqi has so sharply diminished that they are forced to

formal occupation alsadr frequently delivered friday sermons at mosques using hardline nationalist message to condemn the coalition and its iraqi partners and to call for action against them in april 2004 his followers staged coordinated violent uprisings in cities throughout southern iraq which were put down by coalition forces while continuing to voice staunch opposition to the us force presence in iraq in august 2007 alsadr declared ceasefire to which most of jam adhered and he repeated the call in february 2008 by the summer of 2008 alsadr was reportedly making efforts to shift the focus of his base organization to social cultural and political activities at the end of july he issued statement pledging his support and that of his followers to the government of iraq if the goi would refrain from signing any security agreement with the united states he also urged his followers to refrain from any actions that would harm iraqi civilians or disrupt the provision of government services 179 meanwhile rogue elements of jamknown euphemistically as special groups or special groups criminalsdefied alsadrs august 2007 ceasefire call and continued to practice violence the office

government apparently continues to seek influence among iraqi shia through the exercise of soft power for example by continuing to foster relationships with political leaders by providing social services and through investments including purchasing power plant in the shiapopulated sadr city section of baghdad185 according to us and iraqi commanders on the grou nd the series of iraqiled military operations in southern iraq which began in basra in march 2008 had the effect of isolating some special groups members and forcing others to flee across the border into iran us and iraqi commanders note however that in iran quds forces continue to train some iraqi shia extremists including former special groups members they add that some infiltrations continue with the goal of carrying out assassinations or planting improvised explosive devices they suggest that special groups may attempt to reassert themselves in iraq with help from iran as one iraqi commander noted sadly our neighbors are not friendly some us and iraqi commanders comment that special groups reemergence might take the form of streamlined welltrained terrorist network with cellular structure operating

the struggle for the shia populated south may shape iraqs future187 the other main protagonist is the islamic supreme council in iraq isci formerly known as th supreme council for the islamic

political parties backed by militias such as fadila alislamiyah islamic virtue which is active in the major southern city and province of basra relatively new to the power struggle are the groundup voices of southern tribal leaders most of whom stayed in iraq through the saddam period unlike many iraqi shia political party leaders who spent years in iran recognizing the largely untapped potential political power of southern tribal shia in 2008 prime minister maliki sought to form consultative tribal support councils first of all in southern provinces which were supposed to articulate tribal needs to the provincial councils in at least one case babil province the governor sought to form competing provincial tribal council 188 key political markers including regionalization and provincial elections have the potential to exacerbate the contest for political power and influence in the south in april 2008 an 18month moratorium expired on the implementation of 2006 law on federalism which included provisions for the creation of regions based on on or more provinces regional status could prove important because it affects the distribution of economic resources and political power major shia groups in the south have called for various approaches to regionalization based on their popular bases of support189 iran too has reportedly expressed interest in how southern iraq might be regionally grouped as of august 2008 local political parties and organizations in basra had taken the first steps to seek regionalization of basra province by filing an initial petition the full process would include broaderbased collection of signatures and popular referendum 190 the provincial powers act passed in february 2008 and approved by the presidency council after some reluctance in march named october 1 2008 the deadline for holding provincial elections191 however in july 2008 work on new elections law prerequisite for holding provincial elections foundered

political leaders and security forces commanders in southern iraq have suggested that the elections carry the potential for violence in part because many current officeholders recognize that they may not have enough popular support to be elected others have stressed the importance of those elections as safety valve for popular opinion but suggested that postponement of several months was not likely to have malign consequences193 g16g138g157g158g155g142g561g152g143g561g21g142g140g157g138g155g146g138g151g561g24g146g152g149g142g151g140g142g561 less source than type of violence iraq has struggled for years with sectarian violence particularly along the fault lines between populations predominantly of different sectarian groups those fault lines some observers suggest are where local populations are likely to feel most vulnerable and might in some cases be most open to assurances of protection from one organized armed group or another sectarian violence skyrocketed in february 2006 following the bombing of the golden mosque in samarra one of shiite islams holiest shrines that attack prompted shia reprisals targeting sunnis and sunni mosques in number of cities aqi responded in some locations by staging series of further attacks194 the sectarianbased displacement of many iraqis from their homes and the resulting greater segregation in urban areas reduced the number of fault lines somewhat195 displacement and resettlement are dynamic issueswhile the goi does not yet have wellresourced comprehensive plan for the resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons some resettlement initiatives are underway196 in many instances the usual challenges of displacement are compounded by both sectarian and classbased differences between those who have fled and those who have moved into the abandoned homes197 g5g155g146g150g146g151g138g149g146g157g162g561 another major category of violence is opportunistic criminality practiced with view to sheer material gain rather than political or ideological goals the inchoate status of iraqs judicial system and law enforcement organizations has left room for opportunists to steal loot smuggle kidnap and extort

washington dc spent considerable time focused on the disposition of the mujahedine khalq mek formed by students in iran in the 1960s in leftist opposition to the shah and his regime the mek later stepped into opposition against what it calls the mullah regime that took power after the 1979 iranian revolution over time the mek has sought opportunistic alliances including moving its operational headquarters to iraq and making common cause with the iraqi government during the iraniraq war in the 1980s although the mek is designated foreign terrorist organization some us officials reportedly have considered the possibility of using the mek as leverage against tehran several times some members of congressreportedly some 200 in the year 2000signed letters expressing their support for the cause advocated by the mek 204 this awkward policy history was magnified by awkward events on the ground during oif major combat operations when on april 15 2003 members of the us special operations forces signed ceasefire agreement with mek leaders subsequently department of defense issued guidance through centcom to forces on the ground to effect mek surrender following series of negotiations with mek leaders the several thousand mek members were separated from their wellmaintained heavy weapons and brought under coalition control the key operational concern in the early stages was that mek noncompliance could generate largescale operational requirements effectively opening another front efforts have been underway since that time in coordination with the iraqi government and the many countries of citizenship of the mek members to determine appropriate further disposition as of fall 2008 the government of iraq had initiated steps to transition responsibility for control of the mek camp from us to iraqi security forces 205 in public statement in september 2008 minister of defense abdul qadr noted that th sovereign government of iraq should be responsible for any such group

clausewitz argued the first the supreme the most farreaching act of judgment that the statesman nd commander have to make is to establish the kind of war on which they are embarking 207 in theory how the kind of war is identified helps shape the tools selected to prosecute it in the case of oif after major combat operations it proved difficult for senior bush administration officials and military leaders to agree on what kind of war oif was turning out to be on july 7 2003 general john abizaid an arabic speaker who had served during oif major combat as the deputy commanding general of centcom replaced general tommy franks as centcom commander at his first press conference in the new role gen abizaid referred to the challenge in iraq as classical guerrillatype campaign slightly more carefully but leaving room for doubt he added i think describing it as guerrilla tactics is proper way to describe it in strictly military terms 208 the pentagon pointedly did not adopt that terminology two weeks later asked about his reluctance to use the phrase guerrilla war secretary rumsfeld noted i guess the reason i dont use the phrase guerrilla war is because there isnt one and it would be misunderstanding and miscommunication to you and to the people of the country and the world instead he argued in iraq there were five different things looters criminals remnants of the baathist regime foreign terrorists and those influenced by iran 209 in his account of that year cjtf7 commanding general ltg sanchez wrote that by july 2003 he and gen abizaid his boss had recognized

during the formal occupation of iraq from 2003 to 2004 the military command in iraq cjtf7 was responsible for security while the civilian leadership the coalition provisional authority cpa was responsible for all other governance functions 213 in the views of the cjtf7 leadership establishing security required more than killing people and breaking thingsit required simultaneous efforts to achieve popular buyin for example by rebuilding local communities and engaging iraqis in the process214 accordingly cjtf7 built its plans around four basic lines of operation or categories of effort political governance economic essential services and securitywhich differed only slightly from the categories in use in early 2008 those lines of operation were echoed in the plans of cjtf7s subordinate commands cjtf7 would lead the security line and support cpa efforts in the other areas beginning in 2003 cjtf7s basic theory of the case was that the lines of operation pursued simultaneously would be mutually reinforcing major general peter chiarelli who commanded the 1 st cavalry division in baghdad from 2004 to 2005 argued after his tour that it was not effective to try to achieve security first and then turn to the other lines of operation he wrote if we concentrated solely on establishing large security force and conducting targeted counterinsurgent combat operationsand only after that was accomplished worked toward establishing sustainable infrastructure supported by strong government developing freemarket systemwe would have waited too long 215 211

cjtf7 included combat operations focused on killing or capturing the adversary aggressive operations yielded large numbers of iraqis detained by the coalitionthe large numbers and frequent difficulties determining whether and where individuals were being held were an early and growing source of popular frustration in april 2004 the unofficial release of graphic photos of apparent detainee abuse at abu ghraib generated shock and horror among people inside and outside iraq some observers have suggested that these developments may have helped fuel the insurgency 216 cjtf7 military operations also included early counterinsurgency coin practices for population control those practices included creating gated communitiesincluding saddams home town of alawjaby fencing off town or area and strictly controlling access through the use of checkpoints and id cards to make military operations less antagonistic when possible to local residents units substituted cordon and knock approaches for the standard cordon and search 217 the security line of operation also included early partnerships with nascent iraqi security forces including mentoring as well as formal training where troop strength so permitted for example in baghdad and in mosul army military police were assigned to local police stations as facto advisors218 gen abizaids theory was that the very presence of us forces in iraq was an antibody in iraqi society219 therefore to remove the possibility that insurgents could leverage the presence of an occupation force to win popular support key goal was to move quickly to an overwatch posture doing so would require an accelerated standup of iraqi security forces that approach shared with later coin approaches the premise that us forces alone could not winthat success in the security sphere would require acting by with and through iraqis it differed sharply from later coin approaches however in terms of implications for the us forces footprint size of presence and many activities while the military command did not have the lead role for the nonsecurity lines of operation it made contributions to those efforts to address the most pressing essential services concerns the military command created task force restore iraqi electricity and task force restore iraqi oil which were later consolidated into the gulf region division

readily available discretionary funds to support smallscale projects usually initiated at the request of local community leaders in the governance field commanders needed iraqi interlocutors to provide bridges into local communities and advice concerning the most urgent reconstruction and humanitarian priorities since official iraqi agencies were longer intact and since the cpa did not yet have sufficient regional presence to help build local governments commanders helped select provincial and local councils to serve in temporary advisory capacities 220 by most accounts by the end of the year of formal occupation in june 2004 the security situation had worsenedcatalyzed in april by the simultaneous unrest in fallujah and alsadrled uprisings throughout the south many observers have suggested that none of the lines of operationwhether civilianled or militaryledwas fully implemented during the year of formal occupation due to lack of personnel and re sources in particular gen abizaids goal of diminishing the presence of us antibodies in iraq society was not realized since highly inchoate iraqi security forces training efforts led by cpa had not had time to yield results

emerging sunni arab insurgency early coalition military efforts to counter it and the complex intersection of political considerations and best military advice in operational decisionmaking 221 during major combat operations and the early part of the formal occupation the military command practiced first an economy of force approach to anbar province and then quick shuffling of responsible military units which left little opportunity to establish local relationships or build expertise222 building relationships with the population is critical in any counter insurgency and it may have been particularly important in anbar where social structure is based largely on complex and powerful tribal affiliations coalition forces in anbar during major combat were primarily limited to special

largely by sunni arabs under the old iraqi regime fallujah had enjoyed some special prerogatives and had produced number of senior leaders in iraqs various security forces many residents therefore had some reason to be concerned about their place in the postsaddam iraq on march 31 2004 four american contractors working for blackwater who were driving through fallujah were ambushed and killedand then their bodies were mutilated and hung from bridge photos of that grisly aftermath were rapidly transmitted around the world riveting the attention of leaders in baghdad washington and other coalition country capitals what followed in april 2004 was series of highestlevel deliberations in baghdad and washington concerning the appropriate response some key participants in the debates initially favored immediate overwhelming military acti on but those views were quickly tempered by concerns about the reactions that massive military actionand casualtiesmight produce several key sunni arab members of the iraqi leadership body the iraqi governing council threatened to resign in the event of an attack on fallujah 224 and some senior us officials expressed concerns about the reactions of other governments in the region and of sunni arabs elsewhere in iraq225 the administrations guidance after the initial debates was to respect the concerns of iraqi leaders and to avoid sending us military forces into fallujah what followed instead was series of negotiations by cpa and cjtf7 leaders with separate sets of fallujah community representatives some of them brokered by iraqi nationallevel political leaders and what emerged was deal initiated by imef with local retired iraqi army general and group of locally recruited fighters who formed the fallujah brigade and pledged to restore and maintain order 226 when the fallujah brigade collapsed that summer the city of fallujah had not been cleared by either the brigade or imef over the summer insurgents reportedly strengthened their hold on the city decisive military actionoperation phantom furywas launched by imef in november 2004 several factors may have shaped the timing of the operation by november the new interim iraqi government led by prime minister ayad allawi had had some time to establish its credibility perhaps enough to help quell citizens concerns in the event of largescale military action key iraqi elections were scheduled for january 2005 and eliminating hotbed of insurgency beforehand might increase voter participation and earlier in november president bush had been reelected which may have reassured some iraqi leaders that if they agreed to the military operation the us governmentand coalition forceswould be likely to continue to provide support to deal with any aftermath 224 the iraq governing council igc was critical part of the us strategy for transitioning responsibility and authority to iraqi leaders the plans articulated in the transitional administrative law approved in march 2004 called for the igc to relinquish its advisory ro to new appointed iraqi interim government to which cpa in turn would return full governing authority by june 30 2004 an igc collapse it was considered could disrupt or delay the plans 225 information from cpa and cjtf7 officials and participant observation 2004 226 information from cjtf7 and imef leaders 2004 see also bing west true glory

also readily draw key lessons from that earlier complex engagement230 in early 2005 the 3acr began their deployment preparations at home in fort carson coloradostudying coin approaches training nd exercising those approaches and learning conversational arabic later in iraq col mcmaster described the regiments mission in the classical coin lexicon of population security the whole purpose of the operation is to secure the population so that we can lift the enemys campaign of intimidation and coercion over the population and allow economic and political development to proceed here and to return to normal life231 in practice that meant taking very deliberate approach to the problem beginning with months of preparatory moves those preparatory steps included beefing up security along the syrian border to the west and targeting and eliminating enemy safe havens out in the desert they also included constructing dirt berm ringing tal afar and establishing check points to control movement in and out of the city before the launch of fullscale operations in september 2005 the regiment urged civilians to leave tal afar then 3acr cleared the city deliberatelyblock by block after the clearing operations 3acr had sufficient forces to hold the city setting up 29 patrol bases around town every few blocks 232 basing coalition forces among the population was an unusual approach at the time though common in the early days of oif by 2005 most coalition forces in iraq had been pulled back to relatively large forward operating bases fobs secure and separate from the local population that strategy was driven in part by the theory that the visible presence of coalition forcesand their weapons and their heavy vehiclescould antagonize local communities233 3acrs coin approaches also included workin g closely with their iraqi security forces counterpartsthe 3rd iraqi army division col mcmaster credited that partnership as essential to the strategy what gives us the ability to clear and hold as counterinsurgency strategy is the capability of iraqi security forces234 the key to the success in fallujah he addedand the major difference from fallujah iiwas popular support we

iraq236 in october 2005 in testimony about iraq before the senate foreign relations committee secretary of stat condoleezza rice began by stating our politicalmilitary strategy has to be clear hold and build to clear areas from insurgent control to hold them securely and to build durable national iraqi institutions237 about three weeks later in major veterans day speech president bush echoed secretary rices clear hold build language almost verbatim238 the following month november 2005 the administration issued new national strategy for victory in iraq the strategy arguedroughly consistent with the militarys longstanding lines of operationthat success required three major tracks security political and economic consistent with the basic theory of the case since 2003 these tracks were to be pursued simultaneously and would be mutually reinforcing as the strategy states progress in each of the political security and economic tracks reinforces progress in the other tracks239 the new strategy prominently adopted the clear hold build lexicon with twist clear hold build was now the prescribed set of approaches for the security track alone the political and economic tracks were also each based on trinitarian set of approaches in the security track build now referred specifically to the iraqi secu rity forces and local institutions build also appeared in the other two trackscapturing the focus on nationallevel institutions from the earlier public statements by president bush and secretary rice240 235 ibid 236 david ignatius wrote in the washington post that in 2005

tal afar operations had tested and confirmed both the clear hold build strategy and the interdependence of the three major tracks as white house fact sheet titled clear hold build stated tal afar shows how the three elements of the strategy for victory in iraqpolitical security and economic depend on and reinforce one another241

clear hold build and aimed at reducing violence and increasing security in baghdad baghdad was chosen as the focus because it was the center that everybody was fighting for the insurgents the death squads the government of iraq 242 the operation was predicated on basic counterinsurgency principlesto secure the citizens lives here in baghdad243 together forward included some 48 battalions of iraqi and coalition forcesabout 51000 troops altogether including roughly 21000 iraqi police 13000 iraqi national police 8500 iraqi army and 7200 coalition forces244 iraqi forces were in the lead supported by the coalition the effort included clearing operations as well as series of new security measures including extended curfews tighter restrictions on carrying weapons new tips hotlines more checkpoints and more police patrols245 together forward theoretically included the other major tracks of the november 2005 national strategy political and economic efforts as well as security although the coalitions primary focus was security as mnfi spokesman major general william caldwell noted in july 2006 its obviously multipronged approach but those other tracks are mostly the government of iraq side of the house246 mnfi stated publicly from the start that together forward was expected to take months not weeks for several months after the operation was launched the levels of violence in the capital rose as mg caldwell explained in october 2006 the insurgent elements the extremists are in fact punching back hard once the iraqi and coalition forces cleared an area the insurgents tried to regain that territory so the iraqi and coalition forces were constantly going back in and doing clearing operations again247 241 white house fact sheet strategy for victoryclear hold build march 20

tracks of effortsecurity political economicwere mutually reinforcing and should therefore be implemented simultaneously the new way forward agreed that all of the tracksplus new regional trackwere important but argued that security was prerequisite for progress in the other areas251 as white house summary of the results of the strategy review stated while political progress economic gains and security are all intertwined political and economic progress are unlikely absent basic level of security252 and as president bush stated in his address to the nation on this topic in january 2007 the most urgent priority for success in iraq is security253 this thinking though new as the premise for us iraq strategy was not new to practitioners on the ground as early as 2003 some us practitioners

basic security conditions that allowed iraqis to leave their homes and civilian coalition personnel to engage with local communities254 the new way forward institutionalized that view the theory of the case was that security improvements would open up space and opportunities for the iraqi government to make improvements in other areas as general david petraeus described it in march 2007 one month into his tour as the mnfi commander if security improves commerce will return and local economies will grow and at the same time the iraqi government will have the chance it needs to resolve some of the difficult issues it faces 255 by early 2008 the basic premise had met with broa d if not universal support among practitioners and observers for example in october 2007 commandant of the marine corps general james conway told thinktank audience certainly you have to have level of security before you can have governance 256 retired marine corps general james jones who led congressionally mandated review of iraqi security forces in 2007 described it differently he suggested that the relationship between two major components of politics and securitynational reconciliation and sectarian violenceis more complex its little bit of chickenandegg question the real overall conclusion is that the government of iraq is the one that has to find way to achieve political reconciliation in order to enable reduction in sectarian violence257 g21g158g155g144g142g561g8g152g155g140g142g156g561 in his january 10 2007 address to the nation president bush announced that to help implement the new way forward the united states would deploy additional military units to iraq primarily to baghdad their mission paraphrase of the clear hold build language would be to

the iraqi and coalition surge operations was population security this marked an important shift from previous years when the top imperative was transitioning responsibility to iraqis 260 the two efforts were not considered mutually exclusiveduring the surge efforts would continue to train mentor and equip iraqi security forces to prepare for transitioning increasing responsibilities to them but the relative priority of the population security and transition efforts was adjusted in early 2008 close to the height of the surge some division commanders commented that their guidance from their higher headquartersmnciwas to practice patience not to be in too much of hurry to move to an overwatch posture or to transition responsibility to iraqi security forces 261 the january 2008 mission statement of one division provides good illustration of the new prioritiespopulation security first with view to laying the groundwork for future transition the division in participation with iraqi security forces and the provincial government secures the population neutralizes insurgents and militia groups and defeats terrorists and irreconcilable extremists to establish sustainable security and set conditions for transition to tactical overwatch and iraqi security selfreliance 262 the surge aimed to provide population security not merely with greater troop strength but also by changing some of the approaches those troops used one major emphasis was population controlincluding the extensive use of concrete barriers checkpoints curfews and biometric technologies for identification including fingerprinting and retinal scans in april 2007 some key baghdad neighborhoods were entirely sealed off using these approaches prompting the use of the moniker gated co mmunities in an oped piece multinational corpsiraq commander lieutenant general ray odierno explained that the gated communities were being put up to protect the iraqi population by hindering the ability of terrorists to carry out the car bombings and suicide attacks 263 as counterinsurgency expert dave kilcullen described it once an area is cleared and secured with troops on the ground controls make it hard to infiltrate or intimidate and thus they also protect the population 264 259 see fact sheet helping iraq achieve economic and political stabilization january 8 2008 available at

at the tighter controls that gated communities brought265 by early 2008 coalition and iraqi leaders reported anecdotally that iraqi residents were pleased at the added protection the gated community measures provided them by keeping the bad guys out266 another key set of population security approaches involved troop presenceincluding not only increasing the number of troops but also changing their footprint from late in the formal occupation through 2006including operation toge ther forwardcoalition forces in iraq had been consolidated at relatively large forward operating bases fobs surge strategy called for getting troops off of the fobs and out into local communities to live and work among the population as major general james simmons iii corps and mnci deputy commanding general until february 2008 stated you have to get out and live with the people267 multinational force west leaders agreed that the key is living with the population because it makes iraqis see us as partners in the fighting and rebuilding268 as mnfi commanding general david petraeus commented in july 2008 explaining surge approaches the only way to secure population is to live with ityou cant commute to this fight269 accordingly coalition forces established scores of small combat outposts cops and joint security stations jsss in populated areas jss includes colocated units from coalition forces the iraqi police and the iraqi army each component continues to report to its own chain of command but they share spaceand information cop is coalitiononly usually manned by companyminus as of january 2008 for example multinational divisioncenter had established 53 such bases in their restive area south of baghdad senior commanders at all levels have stressed the critical role jsss and cops played during the surge general petraeus noted in march 2007 that they allowed the development of relationships with local populations 270 multinational divisionbaghdad leaders called the creation of these outposts the biggest change over time in coalition operations in iraq271 surge strategy still called on iraqi and coalition forces to clear hold build administration and coalition leaders admitted that in the pastin operation together forward in 2006insufficient forces had been available to hold an area once it was cleared the surge was designed to correct that 265 see for example

nation in earlier operations iraqi and american forces cleared many neighborhoods of terrorists and insurgents but when our forces moved on to other targets the killers retu rned this time he added well have the force levels we need to hold the areas that have been cleared272 general petraeus confirmed the approach and the contrast with past operations in march 2007 importantly iraqi and coalition forces will not just clear neighborhoods they will also hold them to facilitate the build phase of the operation 273 key outside observers agreed retired general jack keane strong surge advocate noted were going to secure the population for the first time what weve never been able to do in the past is have enough forces to stay in those neighborhoods and protect the people274 president bush announced one other major change which would make surge military operations different from those of the pastthe lifting of political restrictions on operations which had been imposed in the past by an iraqi leadership concer ned about its own fragility in the past president bush noted political and sectarian interference prevented iraqi and american forces from going into neighborhoods that are home to those fueling the sectarian violence but this time iraqi leaders had signaled that iraqi and coalition forces would have green light to enter those neighborhoods275

rogue shia militia elements including the jaish almahdi special groups baghdad was defined to include the surrounding areas or belts which had been providing bases of operation and transit points with access into the capital for both sunni and shia extremists ltg odiernos guidance to his subordinate commanders was to stop the flow of accelerants of the violence through those areas into baghdad 279 operating in the belts required shifting the foot print of coalition forces to cover all the major supply lines leading into baghdad coalition presence in many of the belt areas had previously been

division since december 2007 focused first on clearing the city and then on establishing strong presence to hold each neighborhood281 the area just south of baghdad and along the tigris river with its

military intelligence brigade headquarters based it in the desert and tasked it to coordinate intelligence fusion drawing on sources from the us marines in the west and us and iraqi sof in addition to its own assets commanders note that the approach has facilitated identifying and interdicting fighters coming across the desert toward mosul 291 meanwhile in january 2008 operations in diyala province east of baghdad had driven aqi affiliates out of major population centers into rural areas one us military commander emphasizing aqis lack of cohesive structure described them as bunch of gangs under the qaeda rubric 292 in late july 2008 isf supported by coalition forces launched operations against aqi in diyala before the operations began prime minister maliki publicly stated the intention to launch operations and as result according to us commanders many of the bad guys simply ran away 293 in the view of one us commander that approach may have pushed the problem down the road but on the other hand he added it might allow time for isf capabilities to develop further us support to the operations included conducting blocking operations to try to catch 288 see for example iraq to go

counterinsurgency coin effortproviding critical intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr capabilities and facilitating mobility particularly given the lack of mass transit of troops by ground327 importantly from an analytical perspective the role of air power in iraq has evolved over time one major shift over the course of oif has been in the kinetic use of air power defense expert anthony cordesman has pointed to its steadily more important role over time328 in november 2007 major general dave edgington then the mnfi air component coordination element acce director confirmed

in february to 171 in june 303 in july and 166 in august before dropping back to doubledigits for the rest of the year330 in january 2008 maj gen edgington explained that close air supportor oncall supportis the type of kinetic air power that has been most in demand in iraq coordinated airground operations during the first several months after the arrival of the full surge force produced the heaviest cas requirements but afterward the demand tapered off the significantly higher demand for cas he noted was less reflection of deliberate strategy to use more air power than natural result of significantly larger number of us troops working significantly more closely with iraqi counterparts and in local ne ighborhoods and getting better information that made target identification much easier as of january 2008 in shift from mid2007 the majority of weapons dropped were targeting deeply buried ieds 331 some counterinsurgency specialists have questioned the use of kinetic air power in counter insurgency operations because it risks civilian casualties that could fuel the insurgency for example kalev sepp has written these killings drive family and community members into the insurgency and create lifelong antagonisms toward the united states332 commanders stress in turn that although there is always chance of accidental civilian casualties the likelihood has greatly diminished with the development of precision capabilities further the decision cycle before weapon is dr opped includes series of decision points that give commanders the opportunity to stop an action if new and better information becomes available about civilian presence in the target area333 in his december 2007 assessment of the use of air power in iraq and afghanistan an thony cordesman concludes that considerable restraint was used in both wars334 another major shift in the use of air in oif according to us commanders has been the growing availability of greater air assetsfor example significantly more fullmotion video assets335 in 2008 us air assetsisr kinetic and mobilityproved essential to the increasingly combined coalition and iraqi operations on the ground in the

scope of the challenge has been extensive since none of iraqs prewar security forces or structures were left intact or available for duty after major combat operations us prewar planning had foreseen an immediate and practical need for law enforcement and for security more broadly after major combatparticularly since some challenges to law and order might reasonably be expected after the collapse of the old regime planning had also stressed the need for security providers to have an iraqi face to calm and reassure the iraqi people however prewar planning had erroneously assumed that iraqi local police forces would be available as needed to help provide security for the iraqi people instead in the immediate aftermath of major combat coalition forces found that civilian law enforcement bodies had effectively disappeared meanwhile military prewar planning had also assumed that iraqi military units would be available for recall and reassignment after the war as needed military plans counted on the capitulation of iraqi forces and included options for using some of those forces to guard borders or perform other tasks 337 instead on may 23 2003 the coalition provisional authority cpa issued cpa order number 2 which dissolved all iraqi military services including the army that decision foreclosed the option of unit recall to support security or reconstruction activities or to

year of formal occupation iraqi security forces training was led and primarily executed by the coalition provisional authority particularly in the earliest days the efforts were characterized by limited longterm strategic planning and by resources too limited for the scope and scale of the tasks police training began as function of the cpa ministry of the interior office initially under the leadership of former new york police commissi oner bernard kerik he was supported by skeleton staff in baghdad and by some resources from the state departments bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement affairs inl based on priorities articulated by washington the team focused initially on the capital city including rebuilding the baghdad police academy the office also launched limited callback and retraining effort for former iraqi police officers but the effort was constrained by limited resources and staffincluding very limited presence outside baghdad 340 meanwhile military units throughout iraq had recognized an immediate need for some iraqi law enforcement presence on the ground in their areas of responsibility to the frustration of some cpa officials341

of the training mission as the word transition in mnstcis name suggests the initial stated goal of mnstci and the isf training effort in general was to transition security responsibility to iraqis the sooner the iraqis were capable of providing security for themse lves the sooner us nd other coalition forces could go home352 accordingly embedded teams worked with their iraqi counterparts with view to the earliest possible independence of those iraqi units in early 2007 in keeping with the administrations new way forward strategy and the surge emphasis on population security as prerequisite for complete transition the emphasis of the training and embedding mission shifted the ultimate goal was still to transition security responsibility to iraqis but the timeline was rela xed the primary focus in the near term would be working with iraqi units to help them better provide population security working closely with us counterparts on realworld missions iraqi units would be practicing the skills they would need to operate independently353

the training and mentoring effort357 the teams vary in size composition and focus based on the needs of the iraqi forces they partner with and the specific local circumstances but the theory of the case is consistent the teams simultaneously advise teach and mentor and provide direct access to coalition capabilities such as air support artillery medical evacuation and intelligencegathering358 they also provide continual situational awareness to coalition forces about the status of the isf transition teams work with units in each of th iraqi military and police services with key operational headquarters and with the security ministries due to resource constraints coverage of iraqi units by training teams has not been onetoone in 2008 as isf capabilities grew several shifts were underway if unevenly across iraq in the focus of the embedded transition teams from basic skills to more sophisticated capabilities from lowerlevel units to higherlevel headquarters and from training to advising 359 in general the embedded advisory effort is high ly dynamicwork with any iraqi unit is expected to be temporary according to us military officials as of fall 2008 the embedded training effort was far from completedwhile many iraqi units had already graduated from the need for embedded advisors others iraqi units had just entered that form of partnership and other units were still

defense reported that as of august 2008 there were 27 border transition teams btts working with about twothirds of department of border enforcement units at battalionlevel or above and 41 national police transition teams nptts which were partnering with about 80 of national police units at battalionlevel or above for the iraqi police there were 223 of 266 required police transition teams ptts working with iraqi police at local district and provincial levels361 the police training team mission is supported by us military police brigade complemented by civilian international police advisors ipas who provide expertise in criminal investigation and police station management the ipa contracts are funded by dod and managed by the department of state as of au gust 2008 mnstci noted that about 400 ipas were deployed in iraq at academies and with some units some contemporary observers have suggestedechoing the cpa s ambassador bremerthat military forces including mps are not optimally suited to train civilian law enforcement personnel and have urged the expansion of the ipa program362 some us military officials while strongly supporting the ipa program caution that some ipas have more relevant backgrounds than othersa police officer from relatively quiet us town with 30member police force may not have the background to train and mentor big city cops preparing for counterinsurgency fight 363 approaches to police training have varied over time and by us battle space in iraq in anbar province for example multinational forcewest mnfw led by the marines decided early in the effort to triple or quadruple the normal size of the embedded ptts as one commander noted you need to be able to leave marines at the police station while others are out on patrol but by mid2008 based on analysis of 109 police stations mnfw concluded that aroundthe clock ptt presence at the level of the local station was longer necessary 364 in general by mid2008 the focus of the police training effort had shifted in many locations from basic policing to the professionalization of the force as local police mastered basic skills such as carrying out patrols ptts increasingly emphasized higherend skills including police intelligence and forensics to help with this new focus for example in summer 2008 mnfw brought in experts from the royal irish constabulary365

transition team caftt provides advisory teams to the iraqi air staff air operations center and individual squadrons for the iraqi army as of september 2008 there were 183 military transition teams mitts working with iraqi units from battalion to division level366 at the iraqi division level the standard pattern calls 15member team led by colonel or equivalent at the brigade levela 10member team led by lieutenant colonel and at the battalion levelan 11member team led by major the teams though small include wide array of specializationsincluding intelligence logistics maneuver trainers effects communications and medical expertise 367 the mittslike the pttshave varied over time and by battle space in number and composition mnfw consistently chose to use larger mittswith 30 to 40 people368 in some instances us army mitts have also been augmented to form larger teams in 2008 one major transition in the iraqi army training effort was shift of focus from basic skills to enablers mnci commanding general ltg austin made isf logistics top priority to that end mnci created logistics transition assistance teams lta ts drawing on corps assets to help jumpstart the development of iraqi army logistics capabilities in mid2008 us commanders also stressed the iraqi armys continuing need for combat enablers such as isr and the ability to call forward and adjust fires369 second major transition was shift of focus from lowerlevel to higherlevel iraqi headquarters both us army and marineled multinational divisions are shifting some of their advisory efforts to the iraqi brigade and division level focusing on leadership and staff organization370 third transition was the shift in the rhetoric of us commanders from training to advising in practice that can mean decreasing the rank of the members of the embedded us teams and assigning them liaison rather than structured training functions371 the methodology for forming the mitts and preparing them for their assignments has evolved significantly over the short duration of the program initially in the push to field trainers quickly teams were pulled together from individual volunteers and trained at seven different locations in the united states without specific standards subsequently the army consolidated training program for army navy and air force transition team members under the auspices of the 1st infantry division at ft riley kansas the program 366 department of defense measuring stability and security in iraq september 2008 p51 367 iag and other officials note that it would be difficult to streamline the teams any further given their small size and the array of expertise they include 368 interviews with mnfw officials january and august 2008 the marines argue that this approach to training helps explain the success to date of the two best iraqi army divisionsthe 1st and the 7th which were established in anbar province 369 interviews with mnci officials and subordinate commanders august 2008 370 interviews with mnci subordinate commanders august 2008 mnfw noted that as early as february or march 2008 based on the improved capabilities of the iraqi army they wanted to demitt that is withdraw their teams from the battalion and brigade level one commander said its time to take the training wheels off of everything iraqi to get them off of the driveway and on to the street 371 for example mnfw led by the marines had previously assigned colonels to lead teams embedded with iraqi divisions but dropped the seniority to lieutenant colonel

and 60 days of training followed by theater orientation at camp buehring kuwait and then by further counterinsurgency training and handson equipment training at the phoenix academy at camp taji iraq the program sent new team leaders out to the field for brief visit at the very beginning of their training at ft riley and it solicited lessons learned from transition team members both mid tour and at the end of their tours in iraq while the program of preparation improved markedly the participants were still individual volunteers who could come from any occupational specialty as one program leader commented the curriculum at ft riley includes measure of move shoot and communicate skills as refresher for all the professors and protocol specialists who volunteer372 the marine corps created separate program to prepare trainersthe marine corps training and advisory group mctag its mission is to coordinate form train and equip marine corps advisor and training teams for current and projected operations373 according to senior marine commander in iraq the individuals selected for the program are the first team with recent experience in command or in combat jobs such as battalion operations officer374 the majority of mitts in iraq are external teamsthat is they come out of the ft riley and mctag systems however to help meet demand about 20 of the mitts are taken out of hide or internalthat is their members are pulled from us units already serving in iraq375 the experiences with providing largescale training to indigenous security forces in iraq and afghanistan prompted debates within the department of the army and dod more broadly about likely future requirements to provide such training in general and more specifically the best ways to continue to source the transition team mission in iraq376 g11g21g8g561g22g155g138g146g151g146g151g144g497g561g23g151g146g157g561g18g138g155g157g151g142g155g146g151g144g561 in 2008 in addition to the work of embedded

opportunity to show not just tell377 in august 2008 one commander observed that there was greater energy from partnering than from the transition teams378 while unit partnering became much more widely institutionalized in 2008 the practice had been used by some us units in the past in 2007 fo r example in the turbulent area of mahmudiyah and yusufiyah south of baghdad colonel mike kershaw commander of the 2nd brigade of 10th mountain division tasked his entire field artillery battalion to embed with the 4th brigade of the 6th iraqi army division and its battalions the facto transition team350 soldiers staff and all of their enablerswas far more robust than mitt and had the added value of providing visible example of how us battalion is organized and functions the results in terms of iraqi operational capabilities were apparently positive near the end of the brigades tour col kershaw reported we really conduct almost operations where we do not have iraqi forces either embedded with us or where they are in the lead 379 unit partnering is most commonand the closest fitwith the iraqi army in mid2008 for example both multinational divisioncenter and multinational divisionnorth assigned brigade to partner with each iraqi army division in their respective battle spaces380 some brigades in turn such as the 1st bct of 10th mountain division in kirkuk assigned one battalion to partner with each iraqi army brigade381 as of mid2008 across iraq some us units were also partnering with units from other iraqi secur ity forcesa brigade in baghdad for example described growing partnership with the iraqi police382 however unit partnering is both time and personnelintensive and in some cases operational requirements have not permitted us forces to unitpartner with all of the isf in their battle space383 like isf training in general unit partnering is dynamic endeavorit is designed to boost the capabilities of iraqi units and at some stage of improvement units need for close partnership diminishes as of fall 2008 isf units had reache d quite varied stages of developmentsome in the views of us commanders were very proficient while others had just been formed and the government of iraq has stated the intention to form still others more so than the use of embedded teams unit partnership requires robust us forces presence and it will become more difficult to practice as us forces in iraq draw down it seems that us commanders in more widely institutionalizing unit partnerships in 2008 decided to make maximum use of time and presence remaining in iraqwhatever that might be as one senior 377 interviews with mnfi officials and subordinate commanders august 2008 378 interview with mnci subordinate commander august 2008 379 department of defense

evidence of demonstrated operational capabilities but raise some questions about some institutional capabilities and thus about how close iraqi forces and their oversight ministries are to completely independent and competent functioning over year ago one of the most comprehensive external assessments of the isf was carried out by the congressionally mandated commission on the security forces of iraq led by retired marine corps general james jones the jones commission 388 the commission benefitted from the participation of many senior leaders with years of experience in policing as well as military matters and from spending considerable time in iraq with the isf in its september 2007 report the commission concluded somewhat pessimistically that in the next 12 to 18 months there will be continued improvement in their isf readiness and capability but not the ability to operate independently 389 later that year retired general barry mccaffrey concluded that the picture had improved somewhat and that the isf were making operational contributions he wrote after the trip that while the iraqi police were mixed bag and much remains to be done in the iraqi army 387 interviews with mnstci officials august 2008 in its september 2008 report dod reported that the isf was projected to grow to between 601000 and 646000 by 201 0 see department of defense measuring stability and

required by the us troop readiness veterans care katrina recovery and iraq accountability appropriations act of 2007 public law 11028 section 1314e2a mandated dod to commission an independent private sector entit to assess three things i the readiness of the isf to assume responsibility for maintaining th territorial integrity of iraq denying international terrorists safe haven and bringing greater security to iraqs 18 provinces in the next 12 to 18 months and bringing an end to sectarian violence to achieve national reconciliation ii the training equipping command control and intelligence capabilities and logistics capacity of the isf and iii the likelihood that given the isfs record of preparedness to date following years of training and equipping by us forces the

major and independent successful role in the war390 by early 2008 us commanders on the ground in iraq were describing an operationally increasingly competent iraqi force as one leader with multiple tours in iraq noted improved isf capabilities were the single biggest difference between january 2008 and several years earlier391 operationally another leader observed the iraqis are holding their ground responsible for their own turf 392 every day at mncis battle update assessment division commanders described to the mnci commander operations carried out unilaterally or with coalition tactical overwatch by iraqi forces by fall 2008 us commanders on the ground in iraq were consistently praising the tacticallevel capabilities of their iraqi counterparts393 the department of defense argued in june 2008 that in operations in basra mosul and sadr city the isf demonstrated their capability to conduct simultaneous extensive operations in three parts of the country394 one senior commander noted they can move themselves around the battlefield395 among iraqis themselves there appeared to be range of views concerning the readiness of the isf to operate independently according to mnci iraqi operational commanders stress that they still want close partnership with us forces396 in august 2008 one iraqi army division commander asserted that the united states should maintain combat forces in iraq for another five years to work with iraqi counterparts397 in contrast according to some us officials the perception of some senior iraqi civilian officials is that the isf are ready or very nearly ready to maintain security independently at press conference in september 2008 seemingly striking middle path minister of defense abd alqadir noted that the government of iraq expects to have security force completely able to provide security to the iraqi people on its own by 2011 or the beginning of 2012 398 in the views of many coalition advisors the biggest longterm challenges faced by the iraqi security forces as whole may be institutional rather than operational these include improving ministerial capacity and effectiveness clarifying chains of command and crafting longterm integrated force modernization plans for personnel and equipment in early fall 2008 mnfi and mnstci officials stressed the critical importance of civilian ministerial capacity the practical challenges of growing and developing the iraqi force are likely to continue for many years they noted but if the right able civilian leadership is in place they will be able to make needed decisions and solve problems as they arise399 390 general barry r mccaffrey usa ret visit to iraq and kuwait 511 december 2007 after action report december 18 2007 391 communication from an mnci leader january 2008 392

security forces reflect the exigencies of the gois ongoing counterinsurgency coin efforts to help coordinate the efforts of the various isf in given geographical areas the goi created regional operations commands that report up directly to the office of the prime minister400 for some observers the prime ministers direct access to the operations commands has raised concerns about potential misuse of the isf for personal or even sectarian purposes in some cases the operations command arrangements have created tensions with provinciallevel officials who would ordinarily exercise greate r control over some provinciallevel security forces401 the arrangements have also created some tensions with parent ministries in baghdad and in particular with the interior ministry which apparently views the operations commands as modcentric402 the commands also create some practical confusion since units still rely on their parent organizations for supplies and logistical support for example baghdad is divided into two area commands karkh and rusafa under each are two iraqi army ia divisions and one national police np division each division staff includes representative of the ia nps and the iraqi police both ia and np brigades fall under both ia and np division headquarters us commanders who work closely with these iraqi units report that this iraqi experiment with jointness works well at the tactical level but becomes complicated when units turn to their respective ministries for support403 longterm force modernization planning and execution is another challenge for the isf the current force continues to train and prepare for the ongoing counterinsurgency fight against sunni and shia extremists eventually it is envisaged that the force will shift into more typical division of laborand train and equip themselves accordinglyin which mod forces focus externally and the iraqi police backed up by the national police provide domestic security for civilian and military leaders of the isf one major challenge is balancing nearterm security challenges with longterm requirements in august 2008 iraqi ground commanders were focused completely on the current fight while senior civilian ministry officials were looking out toward the future division of labor404 at press conference in september 2008 minister of defense abd alqadir speaking about the iraqi police stated that it is their job to protect the citizen and our job to protect the frontier 405 400 as rule the operations commands cover single province an exception is the samarra operations command responsible only for the city of samarra in salah ad din province which was created in the wake of the golden mosque bombing 401 in august 2008 mnfw officials noted that in anbar province both the governor and members of the provincial council were frustrated by their loss of direct influence after the anbar operations command was established mndn reported similar tensions with northe rn province governors also in august 2008after the seemingly successful operations in march of that yearthe governor of basra expressed frustration that security control had been taken away from provincial officials interviews august 2008 402 interviews with mnci officials and subordinate commanders august 2008 in august 2008 mndn for example noted that in practice the ninewah operations command definitely commanded iraqi army forces in the province but that its relationship with moi forces was less clear in baghdad since the establishment of the baghdad operations command which formally has command over interior ministry forces in baghdad us commanders have reported tensions between the boc and the moi 403 interviews with mndb officials august 2008 404 interviews with iraqi

buying equipment for future outwardlooking forceincluding tanks and fighter ai rcraft senior us advisors have expressed concerns about stillnascent iraqi abilities to effectively identify fund and contract for future requirements some add that the approach of some iraqi officials appears to be based on traditional bazaar culture in which the goal is getting the lowest price with little consideration for longterm maintenance or interoperability406 some coalition advisors have noted that one of the greatest challenges for the isf may be overcoming lingering sectarianism the isf as whole is one of the most powerful nationallevel iraqi institutions resurgence of sectarianism in the ranks could potentially turn key tools of the iraqi governmentthe capabilities of its security forcesinto potential threats to the unified whole state407 some iraqi government officials in turn have expressed concerns about the size and scope of the isf compared to other iraqi government institutions the more resources dedicated to the isf the more powerful the isf will become and the fewer resources that will be available for other government institutions one provincial governor added i fear the isf they are recruiting too many people they are big draw on the state budget and they have too much power408 g11g155g138g154g146g561g3g155g150g162g561 both the size and the overall capabilities of the iraqi army ia continue to grow the department of defense reported that as of august 1 2008 the iraqi army had 153 combat battalions conducting operations with an additional 18 battalions currently planned or in force generation409 mnstci noted that as of august 2008 altogether the ia had 12 division headquarters 49 brigades and 170 battalions410 in december 2006 the iraq study group provided very cautious overall assessment of the armys capabilities noting the iraqi army is making fitful progress toward becoming reliable and disciplined fighting force loyal to the national government411 nine months later in september 2007 the jones commission noted more positively that the iraqi army was increasingly effective at coin and increasingly reliable in general but that progress among units was uneven412 by the end of 2007 coalition commanders in iraq pointed to further improvements iraqi army operational capabilities in december 2007 major general joseph fil

good tactical decisions they are planning true operations that involve multiple forces combined operations that are frequently intelligencedriven413 in january 2008 the commanding general of multinational division north mndn noted that the four different ir aqi army divisions he partnered with were growing in size and capacity every day he commented where we cant be they can be and in many cases were conducting operations with them414 by early 2008 some ia units had also developed the ability to move themselves across iraq as part of operation phantom phoenix the 3rd brigade of the 1st iraqi army division deployed independently with less than weeks notice from anbar province in the west to diyala in the east to support combat operations in the diyala river valley415 according to mnfi leaders while not as attentiongrabbing as combat operat ions the move demonstrated different but very important set of capabilities that iraqi units will need to master to operate independently in the future416 in august 2008 us commanders noted that most of the ia units that had participated in operations in basra sadr city amarah diyala and mosul had performed very well at the tactical level417 the commanding general of multinational forcewest mnfw in anbar province using phrase common among us forces stated that the ia was not just iraqi good enough it was iraqi very good418 the list of the major developmental challenges faced by the iraqi armybuilding strong leadership cadre and developing key enablers such as logisticshas remained relatively consistent over time although commanders and advisors on the ground point to specific incremental marks of progress in each area419 like all the other iraqi security forces the iraqi army has faced the challenge of quickly developing capable leadership cadre as many us military commanders in iraq point out basic problem is that leadership abilities depend in part on experiencetheir production cannot easily be accelerated the ias leadership challenge may be more acute than that faced by the other security forces since it is both large and unlike the iraqi police nationally based service whose leaders must be able to command diverse mixes of soldiers in all regions of iraq 413 department of defense news briefing major general joseph fil december 17 2007 available at httpwwwdefenselinkmil

the iraqi security forces lacked leadership420 in september 2007 the jones commission also noted that the army was short of seasoned leadership at all levels and pointed in particular to marginal leadership at senior military and civilian positions both in the ministry of defense and in the operational commands421 in congressional testimony in january 2008 deputy assistant secretary of defense mark kimmitt indicated that the most important gap was in midlevel leadership422 noncommissioned officers and field grade officers who are required in far greater numbers than senior leaders to help redress the situation the iraqi army launched several initiatives including accelerated officer commissioning for university graduates waivers to timeingrade or timein service promotion requirements and recruitment of former army officers and non commissioned officers ncos423 it is possible that it will prove easier to generate leaders on paper than to accelerate generation of leadership qualities in practice the quality of ia leadership varies somewhat mndn noted in august 2008 that the commanding generals of the four ia divisions in their area of responsibility were very good424 one of the more impressive ia leaders according to us officials is major general oothman the commanding general of the 8th ia division headquartered in diwaniyah in qadisiyah province in august 2008 echoing us military counterinsurgency thinkingand helping institutionalize it in the iamg oothman stated todays fight is 360degree battlefield and explained that once you clear an area you have to put in iraqi police the iraqi army and coalition forces to hold it 425 on the other hand mndb officials noted that leadership selection processes varied in quality in august 2008 the newly selected commanding general of the newly formed 17th ia division was wellregarded competent brigade commandera good choice but in some other cases mndb officials noted the choices have been terriblereflections not of competence but of political connections that make the selected leaders untouchable by their military chains of command 426 another major challenge to the continued progress of the iraqi army is developing key enablers ranging from intelligence to logisticswhich are ab solutely essential to an armys ability to operate independently427 in december 2006 the iraq study group pointed out that the iraqi army lacked logistics and support to sustain their own operations428 later in september 2007 the jones commission called 420 james baker iii and lee h hamilton cochairs the iraq study group

logistics experience and expertise within the iraqi armed forces is substantial and hampers their readiness and capability429 the commission further concluded that the army would continue to rely on coalition forces for combat support and combat service supportthough the commission did not estimate for how long that reliance would continue testifying before congress in january 2008 thenmnstci commander ltg dubik agreed that the army cannot fix supply arm or fuel themselves completely enough at this point430 as of march 2008 the army was able to feed itselfa key component of life support as of june 2008 the armys maintenance backlog continued but the backlog had been stabilized and the ia had better visibility than previously on what needs to be repaired431 as of august 2008 the ia was continuing to develop nationallevel maintenance and supply system including the new national depot at taji to serve as the centerpiece for national supply and maintenance services the depot is scheduled to be completed by mid2009a target date that has slipped several times 432 in june 2008 mnci commanding general lieutenant general austin confirmed that the ia still had substantial room for improvement there are still some things that need to be done and those things include developing combat enablers that will enable them to do things like call for and adjust fires and integrate those fires into their formation support themselves logistically use their own intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance assets to create intelligence and then be able to use that intelligence to plan

ch2000 aircraft and 2 king air 350s for isr and 8 cessna 172s 3 cessna 208s 5 bell jet rangers and 10 oh 58acs for training the iraqi air force plans to have fleet of 123 aircraft by december 2009437 by any measure the iraqi air force is still fledgling institution in the early stages of recruiting training and development the effort to develop the iraqi air force in earnest began at the start of 2007 and coalition advisors note that it takes three to five years to train pilots air traffic controllers and maintenance personnellonger than it takes to train ground forces the initialand exclusivefocus of iraqi air force training was counterinsurgency including first of all battlefield mobility in september 2007 the jones commission assessed that the air force was well designed as the air component to the existing counterinsurgency effort but not for the future needs of fully capable air force438 by august 2008 mnstci noted that air force training had expanded to include kinetic air to ground attack capability and isr capabilities439 in august 2008 the iraqi air force was flying about 230 sorties per week up from about 150 sorties per week one year earlier the number had fallen slightly from peak of over 300 sorties per week in april and may of 2008 due to combination of weather sustainment challenges and the grounding of cessna 172s used for training 440 in 2008 regular air force training was augmented by realworld experience supporting iraqi army operations during the basra operations in march 2008 the iraqi air force flew 353 missions transporting personnel and cargo dropping leaflets providing information to the local population and helping provide isr 441 an open question for the future is what sort of air forcewith what capabilities personnel and equipmentthe iraqi ministry of defense will determine it needs to meet its full spectrum of security requirements in february 2008 thencommander of the coalition air force transition team air force major general robert allardice noted that like all of iraqs mod forces the iraqi air force is eventually expected to turn its attention to external threats the final stage of development would include the use of jet aircraft to defend iraqs air space he estimated that iraqis could have selfsustaining air force with that capability in about the 2011 or 2012 timeframe depending on the investments they make 442 continued 436 interviews with mnstci officials august 2008 437 interviews with mnstci august 2008 438 report of the independent commission on the security forces of iraq september 6 2007

capabilities that future externally focused iraqi air force might really need one official suggested that air defense capabilities may be more important than fighter aircraft one challenge he added is that iraqi air force senior leaders are former fighter pilots eager to have fleet of fighter aircraft443 number of senior us officials point out that most senior ministry of defense officials have an army backgroundthe minister of defense hi mself is former tanker that background officials argue together with the exigencies of the ongoing coin fight leaves them with relatively little time and attention for guiding the longterm development of their air and maritime services444 g11g155g138g154g146g561g16g138g159g162g561 like the iraqi air force the iraqi navy is still in the early stages of development as of august 31 2008 the iraqi navy included 1907 assigned personnel of 2708 authorized 445 that number includes 499 former iraqi army soldiers who joined the iraqi navy to form the 2nd iraqi navy marine battalion the small navy is based primarily in the southern port city of umm qasr and includes an operational headquarters one squadron afloat one support squadron and two battalions of marines446 the missions of the iraqi navy as whole include protecting iraqs coastline and offshore assets one of the marine battalions provides port securi ty at um qasr and az zubayr the other marine battalion provides oil platform security and conducts vessel boarding and search and seizure as of july 2008 the iraqi navy was conducting total of 42 patrols per week as of august 2008 the fleet included 15 vessels5 small patrol boats and 10 fast assault boats the iraqi navy expects to acquire an additional 21 vessels in 20092010447 in december 2008 the iraqi navy spearheaded an ea rly miltomil partnership with one of iraqs neighborsjoint patrols with counterparts from kuwait448 one challenge the iraqi navy faces according to mnstci officials is conducting the preparations required to more than double its fleetensuring that the infrastructure is in place and the proper training conducted longerterm challenge for the iraqi navy and the mod is crafting realistic and appropriate future force vision for the navy us advisors note that like the air force the navy faces the challenge of working for ministry that does not see their service as high priority and that may not be sophisticated enough to define requirements and build navy iraqi navy officials 443 interview with mnfi official august 2008 the initial in terest expressed by iraqi mod officials in f16s in summer

commando battalions as well as support units four regional commando battalions are currently in generation to be based in basra mosul diyala and asad 451 according to both us commanders in iraq and outside assessments the isof are extremely competent452 since isofs inception the selection process has reportedly been very competitive and trainingconducted by us sofhighly demanding453 in september 2007 the jones commission reported the special operations brigade is highly capable and extremely effective454 in august 2008 senior mnstci official confirmed isof is very capable and increasingly

bureau ctb the ministeria llevel body under the prime minister that sets policy although this is not an uncommon arrangement in the region one possible issue for iraqi leaders in the future will be ensuring adequate integration of the isof and iraqi conventional forces other observers have expressed concern that the isof despite its several layers of headquarters might be used by the prime minister for personal or political ends looking ahead the next practical challenges for the isof include continuing to improve its capabilities us advisors note that the isof is eager to have access

turns its focus toward external security challenges as of august 31 2008 298369 iraqi police ips were assigned of 330880 authorized at that date 196781 personnel had been trained leaving training backlog of over 100000457 the backlog could be greater since not all of those trained are necessarily still serving as ips the backlog has realworld implicationsfor example shortage of ips in august 2008 to help hold areas of diyala province that had been cleared by iraqi and coalition forces as one senior us official noted weve overwhelmed the system458 according to mnstci the goi intent is to ca tch up on the training backlog by july 2009 one approach has been to condense required training into shorter periodthe 240 hours of ip training usually take eight weeks but have been compressed into four weeks in addition recruits who already have degree in another field are offered an accelerated process 459 in terms of ip capabilities in september 2007 the jones commission concluded that the ips were improving at the local level particularly when the ips were locally recruited from relatively ethnically homogenous neighborhoods460 in december 2007 general mccaffrey similarly observed that many local units are now effectively providing security and intelligence penetration of their neighborhoods461 in early 2008 number of us military commanders in iraq described recent examples of specific operations planned and carried out in their areas of responsibility by iraqi police stressing that these capabilities to plan and act independentlyand successfullyhad emerged relatively recently commanders also stressed the importance of the visible presence of the ips at police stations and on patrol in local neighborhoods and together with iraqi army and coalition forces at joint security stations in helping provide population security462 by early fall 2008 us commanders noted that in general the ips were competent in basic skillsenough that the focus of embedded training and advisory efforts and unit partnering was shifting from basic policing skills to the professionalization of the force463 in baghdad the goi and mndb were in the process of handing over security responsibility neighborhood by neighborhood to the ips as one us commander observed in august 2008 using common coalition parlance the ips are iraqi good enough 464 457 department of state iraq weekly

recognized the importance of the ips as part of the total effort but still had some doubts about their capabilities as one ia commander observed without coordination between the ia and the ips there would be security but he added the soldiers are more effective than the police465 one longstanding concern of practitioners and observers still unresolved is infiltration of the ips in september 2007 the jones commission noted that the ips were incapable today of providing security at level sufficient to protect iraqi neighborhoods from insurgents and sectarian violence in part because they were compromised by militia and insurgent infiltration 466 in june 2008 dod stated th at militia and criminal intimidation and influences were among the serious challenges still faced by the ips467 in august 2008 us military officials confirmed that theres some terrorist and some nationalist infiltration of the ips468

initially focused on baghdad the interior ministrys plan is that the nps will regionalize eventually establishing presence in every province where they will provide backup for the ips469 dod reported in june 2008 that prime minister maliki had directed the formation of new third np division to be based in salah ad din province470 as of early fall 2008 the nps were still generally based in baghdad under the baghdad operations command the department of defense reported that as of july 31 2008 44 np battalions were operational of which 13 were judged to be capable of planning executing and sustaining operations with coalition support471 as of august 31 2008 there were 41829 national police assigned of 46707 authorized somewhat confusingly 52382 national police had been trainedthis number may include some who were removed from service or are longer serving for other reasons472 particularly in their early days the nps more consistently prompted concerns about competence corruption and sectarian bias than any other iraqi security force in june 2007 outgoing mnstci commander lieutenant general martin dempsey testified to congress that the nps were the single organization in iraq with the most sectarian influence and sectarian problems473 in september 2007 the jones commission stated flatly the national police have proven 465 interview with iraqi division

its ability to provide security the force is not viable in its current form474 outside experts suggested several possible remedies the iraq study group recommended moving the nps from the interior ministry to the ministry of defense and giving them closer supervision475 the jones commission recommended disbanding the nps altogether476 the iraqi leadership opted for different approach one step was replacing np senior leaders between late 2006 and january 2008 both of the np division commanders all 9 brigade commanders and about 18 of 28 battalion commanders were replaced477 the other major step was retrainingor rebluingboth leaders and ranks with the help of italys carabinieri under the rubric of the na to training missioniraq in early 2008 some us commanders in iraq confirmed that there had been serious problems with the nps and suggested that the leadersh ip changes and reeducation had so far produced mixed results as one brigade commander noted the national police have been terrible478 one division commander praised the work of one np brigade in solving problems in his area of responsibility while noting that another np brigade actually is the problem479 one coalition leader credits iraqi national police commander major general hussein with recognizing the challenges the nps faced and with making this remark the national police has two enemies the insurgency and our own reputation480 in august 2008 mnstci noted that the rebluing process had been accelerated by boosting capacity from 450 to 900 students at time mnstci added that the new np commander is tremendous officer481 us commanders in baghdad added that the nps were being used very much like the iraqi army forces one official added that the nps were pretty damned good482 looking ahead one

of those personnel the dbeas dod put it in december 2007is stretched thin485 the jones commission stated it more flatly in september 2007 iraqs borders are porous486 the numbers and capabilities of the dbe do not appear to have progressed substantially since that time the iraqi governments proposed way forward over three years includes constructing up to 712 border forts and annexes to establish lineofsight perimeter and increasing the use of biometric scan systems and personal information databases 487 some us officials complain that the moi does ve ry little to support the dbe and that in the words of one us commander the dbe is grossly underfunded for example in anbar province instead of giving the dbe fuel the moi provided money to buy fuel but at the long remote border the only fuel available for purchase was from the black market which cost double the market price488 both coalition advisors and outside assessments have pointed out that the dbe continues to face additional challenges from corruption in early 2008 coalition officials in iraq agreed with the assessments by the jones commission that the dbe is infiltrated by outside interests and that some members are apparently involved in crossborder smuggling489 g15g146g151g146g156g157g155g162g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g11g151g157g142g155g146g152g155g561 both coalition advisors and outside assessments have

officials is that the ministry of interior lacks sufficient capacity to process the large and growing demand for personnelto screen recruits to train them and to continue to account for them491 to address this shortcoming the ministry is expanding the capacity of its training base to include 12 new training centers and the expansion of 6 existing ones and rapidly gene rating officers through recall and training program for former army and police officers492 according to mnstci an additional pressure on the moi training system was the absorption in early 2008 of the oil police whose training to guard pipelines did not in the words of one official turn them into cops493 corruptionand the perception of corruptionmay be the even more difficult challenge for the moi to eradicate in december 2006 the iraq study group concluded flatly that the moi was corrupt in september 2007 the jones commission assessed that sectarianism and corruption are pervasive in the moi and that the ministry is widely regarded as being dysfunctional and sectarian494 in january 2008 one coalition advisor stated bluntly that the moi is filled with cardcarrying gangsters495 the moi has apparently taken some steps to battle internal corruption the department of defense reported that in 2007 the moi had opened 6652 investigations of ministry personnel of these 6159 were closed during 2007

substantial progress in both management and strategic planning499 one major future challenge for the ministry of defense is likely to be clarifying and rationalizing the chain of command as the jones commission stated in september 2007 parallel lines of direct communication to military units have been established under the control of the prime minister he is perceived by many as having created second and politically motivated chain of command 500 us military officials confirmed this assessment in august 2008 and dod noted in september 2008 that mod performance is hampered by ineffective coordination and unclear lines of authority hampering unity of command501 as of early fall 2008 iraqi army divisions re ported to the iraqi ground forces command which reported to the joint headquarters which reported in turn to the mod however some forces from both the mod and the moi fall under provincial operations commands usually led by general officer from the iraqi army which may report in practice directly to the office of the prime minister both ministries and uniformed operational headquarters according to us commanders in iraq are sometimes left out of the facto chain of command operations commands are in theory temporary measure designed to closely integrate the counterinsurgency efforts by all of the isf in given geographical area commands have been established in the provinces of baghdad basra h karbala anbar ninewah diyala and as an exception in the city of samarra 502 some us and iraqi commanders have suggested the possibility that operations commands might evolve into threestar army corps headquarters perhaps with geographic reach wider than single province503 as of early fall 2008 plans were in place for such transition further while the corps concept might be appropriate to the current internal counterinsurgency fight an exte rnally focused army would not ordinarily own battle space domestically another challenge for the mod to resolve acco rding to mnstci officials is centralized decisionmaking as of august 2008 the vast majority of decisions were channeled personally to the minister which hinders efficient functioning mnstci official noted that the premise seems to be if you dont make decision you cant get in trouble504 one further challenge according to mnstci offi cials is the mods difficulty in identifying requirements budgeting for them and obligating and spending the required funds in 2006 and 2007 goi spending on the isf exceeded spending by the iraqi security forces fund and that 499 conversations with mnfi officials january

local population and securing at least their acceptance if not their active support in iraq number of us military commanders have pointed to changes in the attitudes and behavior of the iraqi population as the most important difference between 2008 and earlier periods in december 2007 for example the outgoing commander of multinational division baghdad major general joseph fil noted i attribute great deal of the security progress to the willingness of the population to step forward nd band together against terrorist and criminal militia506 coalition and iraqi government efforts to reach out to the iraqi population have increasingly fallen under the broad semantic rubric of reconciliation as of 2008 the term is very broadly usedfrom us national strategy to congressional legislation to the names of iraqi government structures and of offices and job titles in coalition headquarters507 the term is variously used but in the broadest sense it refers to multilateral reconciliation among all subgroups and members of iraqi society except the selfdesignated truly irreconcilables and those who may have disqualified themselves by some egregious action in practice reconciliation in iraq has taken number of forms several of which discussed below have played critical roles in shaping the security climate

2003included very little tribal representation509 in summer 2003 coalition forces launched concerted outreach effort to sunni arab communities in the restive sunni triangle in central and northcentral iraq on august 7 2003 centcom commander general john abizaid convened community leaders from throughout the region to urge them to cease all tacit support for insurgents in exchange for future assistance with reconstruction needs political representation and other concerns 510 however for most of the rest of that year the very limited presence of coalition civilian experts in these provinces and limited resources for reconstruction made it difficult to fully implement the proposed bargain by early 2004 cpa established an outreach office to engage directly with both tribal leaders and leaders of other disaffected groups including some religious extremists also in early 2004 us national leadership crafted series of sunni engagement strategies that included carrots such as greater political representation economic assistance and detainee releases by 2005 coalition leaders in iraq began to pursue more direct contacts with insurgents and their supportersin coordination with and often brokered by iraqi leaders as rule those talks were reportedly based on familiar themea cessation of violent action against iraqis and the coalition in exchange for benefits that might include amnesty for some detainees and improved opportunities to participate politically or economically in iraqi society511 some critics have suggested that negotiating with known or suspected perpetrators of violence is an ethically ambiguous practice that moreover is unlikely to succeed because it depends for its success on commitments by those who have violated the rule of law coalition leaders confirm that they understand who these interlocutors are in december 2007 mnfi official major general paul newton uk officer leading the outreach effort commented do we talk to people with blood on their hands i certainly hope so there is point in us talking to people who havent512 as an mnci senior official with considerable experience in iraq described it in early 2008 you reconcile with your enemy not with your friend513 in the view of some participants and observers what may have distinguished the 2007 outreach from earlier efforts was change in the perceptions of insurgents and wouldbe insurgents about their own prospects as the mnci senior offici added you can only reconcile with an enemy when he feels sense of hopelessness514 as mnfi officials described it in 2008 at some point fatigue sets in and expediency brings them to the table 509 some members of cpa admitted that gaining complete understanding of tribal dynamics and capturing them adequately in the igc in

of prominent local tribal leaders518 the first rising in anbar took place in 2005a movement that became known as the desert protectors members of local tribes in qaim and haditha volunteered to begin working with some us special operations forces and later with the marines519 the movement that became known as the awakening developed later in anbars capital ramadi drawing on the model of the desert protectorsincluding the premise of an alliance among several key tribes the initial leading figu re of the awakening was sheikh abdul sattar buzaigh alrishawi of the albu risha tribe who was killed on september 13 2007 by roadside bomb in late 2006 he had spearheaded the signing of manifesto denouncing qaeda and pledging support to coalition forces according to mnfwest by january 2008 of the eleven sheikhs who initially stood up to challenge qaeda six were dead 520 the movement initially known as sahawa anbar when it formed around core from the albu risha tribe changed its name to sahawa iraq as more tribes joined the cause521 according to mnfwest leading sheikhs in the awakening movement describe their relationship with qaeda as blood feud the tribal leaders do not want coalition forces to stay forever they simply want help killing qaeda522

awakenings began to spread through the provinces of northcentral iraq ninewah salah ad din kirkuk at taamin and diyaladrawing on the anbar example several aspects of the northern climate may have encouraged some sunni arabs to self organize to protect their interests as in anbar there was an qaeda affiliate presence in the northcentral provinces in the wake of successful surge operations in baghdad qaeda affiliates took up residence in several parts of the region including mosul and the upper diyala river valley523 sunni arabs in northern provinces like those in anbar already had some grounds for feeling politically disenfranchised in ninewah for exampl sunni arabs who constitute about 75 of the provinces population generally did not vote in provincial elections and were thus under represented on the current provincial council524 across the north and unique to the region acco rding to multinational divisionnorth leaders facto kurdish expansion has extended across the green line

conditions on the ground and dire ct exposure to awakenings elsewhere in iraq helped generate nascent awakening movements among some tribal leaders in largely shiapopulated southern iraq these incipient initiatives shared with their sunni arab counterparts their groundup impetus based on desire for security and opportunity for their families and disinclination to be imposed on by outsiders the character of the southern movements however was distinctly different from those in north central iraq due to quite different political and religious backdrop and thus quite different targets of frustration 527 the most prominent feature of politics in southern iraq remains the power struggle between two major political groupings and the militias that back them on one hand the islamic supreme council in iraq isci formerly sciri and its badr militia and on the other hand the office of the martyr sadr led by muqtada alsadr and its militia the jaish mahdi jam schisms in the jaish almahdi in the wake of alsadrs declared ceasefire produced violent splinter groupsspecial groupsapparently acting independently of alsadr but with reported ties to iran528 mnfi leaders suggested that the southern awakening movements were motivated primarily by growing popular impatience with bot h of the leading contenders for political power in the south and in particular with their past or current iranian connections iscis badr forces were trained in iran during the iraniraq war muqtada alsadr has maintained personal ties with clerics in iran and jam special groups reportedly enjoy iranian training and support 529 g21g142g140g158g155g146g157g162g561g24g152g149g158g151g157g142g142g155g156g561g138g151g141g561g515g21g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g11g155g138g154g516g561 military commanders in

majority of sois but not all of them were sunni arabs the department of defense reported that as of march 2008 about 71500 were sunni and about 19500 shia533 most groups of soiswho typically worked in the communities they live inwere relatively homogenous but some are mixed for example in january 2008 in the area of multinational divisioncenter mixed region south of baghdad 60 of the soi groups were sunni arab 20 were shia arab and 20 were mixed 534 us commanders readily admitted that the sois include former insurgents one brigade commander commented theres doubt that some of these concerned citizens were at least tacitly participating in the insurgency before us and one division commander stated more boldly 80 of these guys are former insurgents535 other commanders noted in early 2008 that the sois included not only reformed insurgents but also some infiltrators currently affiliated with extremist groups536 isf commanders too harbored illusions about the backgrounds of many sois and they share with their us counterparts concern about current infiltration in august 2008 major general oothman the commanding general of the 8th iraqi army division expressed concern that aqi could corrupt the sois he noted that aqi had already infiltrated the sois or he added it could be the case that some sois may simply be playing both sides537 532 information from mnfi staff august 2008 533

product of carefully crafted strategy by the government of iraq or by coalition forces instead like the awakenings it began from the ground upin this case as series of ad hoc neighborhood watchlike initiatives by iraqis who selforganized and deployed to key locations in their own communities to dissuade potential troublemakers the response by coalition forces to the dynamic was also initially ad hoc as some coalition units provided volunteers in their areas with equipment or payments in kind for information or other forms of support frequently coalition forces named their new partnerswith heroicsounding names like the ghazaliyah guardians or with nfl team names mnfi leaders and commanders on the ground obser ved that sois initially came forward only after qaeda affiliates and other threats were eliminated from an area some commanders also pointed out that sois volunteered to serve once coalition forces presence had been establishedthey had to be convinced that coalition forces would actually remain in the area and not pull back to their fobs 538 g22g145g142g561g515g21g152g151g156g561g152g143g561g11g155g138g154g516g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g561 after its ad hoc beginnings the soi system was loosely standardized by coalition forces in coordination with iraqi security forces counterparts coalition forces paid the sois with funding from the commanders emergency response program cerp based on 90day renewable contracts the money was paid to single contractor often tribal sheikh or other community leader who was then responsible for paying the sois salaries and providing any uniforms vehicles or other equipment that might be required in practice most sois earned about 300 per month roughly equivalent to about twothirds of the total income of member of the iraqi police the goi reportedly agreed to continue to pay roughly the same salary as it assumes responsibility for the sois 539 soi salaries varied somewhat by region in august 2008 for example multinational division center noted that sois in their area each earned about 240 per month in some cases us units established payforperformance systems for example in kirkuk soi performance was reviewed daily if they performed well they received bonus if they did poorlysuch as the soi team that propped up scarecrow at checkpoint they were supposed to be manningtheir collective contract was docked by 2000 540 in many cases us division and brigade commanders on the ground reinforced the message that the sois work for the isf while the coalition forces paid them in other cases the understanding on the ground was that the sois work with the isf541 in practice however sois 538 information from mnfi and mnci leaders and division commanders january 2008 see also department of

security forces and facilitating employment for the rest in the public or private sector in either case the plans included getting the sois off of the cerp payroll the initial goal was july 2008552 as the goi began to assume direct responsibility for the sois in late 2008 the basic goal of integration remained in force by any measure the transition of sois into permanent jobs proceeded slowly accurately recording the data has sometimes proven difficult since the soi population has not been staticnew members were being recruited as some old members were transitioned mnfi noted that between december 2 2007 and august 16 2008 5189 sois transitioned to the iraqi police 53 sois transitioned into other iraqi security forces and 2515 sois transitioned into nonsecurity jobs during that time an additional 3547 sois qui t were killed in action went missing or were dismissed for disciplinary reasons previously in 2007 before the december 2 decision approximately 3900 concerned local citizens were hired by the iraqi police 553 for most of the sois interested in joining the is f the top choice has been the iraqi police which would allow them to continue to serve in their local communities554 an application process is in place for sois seeking to become ips but it is cumbersome after the soi declares his interest locallevel screenings are carried out by coalition forces local civilian officials local tribal sheikhs and appropriate isf representatives the review process considers among other issues an applicants background proof of residency and any special skills the applicant may have as well as the areas demographic balance formal isf requirements also include literacy physical fitness test and medical check those candidates who pass through these reviews are referred to the implementation and followup committee on national reconciliation ifcnr attached to the office of the prime minister for approval candidates approved by ifcnr are forwarded to the ministry of interior for vetting selection andif successfulthe issuing of hiring orders applications do not specifically state that candidate is soi 555 one major constraint on the incorporation of sois into the iraqi police is that the mois personnel and training systems are overloaded and cannot easily absorb large influx of new personnel another constraint is the reported continuing reluctance on the part of some moi officials to bring sois on board556 for those sois not incorporated into the isf the br oad intent is to facilitate their transition into civilian jobsideally jobs that are both sustainable and actually productive557 one major constraint remains the absence of thriving and diverse private sector so most proposals and programs to date have focused on potential state sector jobs in 2008 the coalition worked with several iraqi ministries to establish the joint technical education and reintegration program jterp which was launched in two pilot locations on 552

theater internment facilities simply to warehouse detainees those facilities effectively served as jihadist universities where detainees with extremist agendas could recruit and train followers as

that good behavior counts and can accelerate the parole date in the past some us ground commanders had expressed concerns about the practical implications of the program wondering in particular how jobs would be found for the released detainees and what would restrain them from lowlevel opportunistic criminality if full employment jobs were not found577 partly to help allay such concerns representatives of the battle space owners were included as participants in the board deliberations and decisions the release program makes use of guarantor system in which tribal sheikhs and other local leaders may vouch for and accept responsibility for the future good conduct of detainees released back to their communities578 release ceremonies are formal events and former detainees swear an oath to iraq during 2007 the detainee population grew from about 14000 at the start of the year to peak of 26000 in november due to surge operations and better incoming information from iraqi sources

governance and economics lines of operation indeed military commanders have consistently viewed them as essential counterparts to security the 2007 surge theory of the case adjusted the sequencingimproved security would now lay the groundwork for progress in governance and economicsbut all three lines of operation remained essential to longterm success the ir aqi government would have the lead role in governance and economics but the coalition including civilian and military personnel would support their efforts the key tension over time has centered on the balance of civilian and military roles and responsibilities in these areas while all practitioners agreed that civilian agencies are best placed by training and experience to lead the governance and economics lines of operation civilian efforts have been hampered by the relatively limited resources of their agencies and by delayed and limited staffing military forces with far greater numbers of boots on the ground have sometimes stepped in to spearhead these efforts and have consistently played at least supporting role 577 conversations with ground commanders january 2008 one commander asked for his views about

coordination within civilmilitary teams assigned to the provinces and coordination between those teams and their military unit counterparts early military operationallevel postwar plans called for provinciallevel governorate support teams led by state department personnel and including military civil affairs officers and representatives of the us agency for international development 580 under the coalition provisional authority those plans began to be realized with some delays and in slightly modified form the state department and some coalition partner countries provided foreign service officers to serve as governorat coordinators who were eventually supported by small civilmilitary staffs in august 2003before most provinces were staffedcpa and cjtf7 launched what became regular

as provincially based offices led by state department officials with mixed civilianmilitary staffs the term prt was borrowed from afghanistan where prts primarily militarystaffed take wide variety of forms depending in part on which coalition country leads them as of 2008 the stated purpose of the prts in iraq was as follows to assist iraqs provincial and local governments capacity to develop transparent and sustained capability to govern while supporting economic political and social development and respect for the rule of law 582 in 2007 as part of the surge the prt effort was expanded in scale on the premise that increased security would create growing opportunities for meaningful economic and governance work at the provincial level in june 2007 president bush praised the effort

be as small as four or sixperson core staff full prts may range from the streamlined staff of 16 in najaf to 53 in mosul and about 70 in kirkuk 586 while prts typically work closely with us military

othersincluding some of the smallest eprts in baghdadrely on their partner bct to support their operations in august 2008 the head of one particularly small eprt noted that his usual practice is to accompany the bct commander on his daily movements around the battle space592 in august 2008 opa confirmed that the eprts formally report up through their respective provincial prts to the office of provincial affairs at the us embassy the eprts have coordination relationship with their partner bcts for example members of one eprt noted that when they write cable they show it to the bct commander not for clearance but simply for input anecdotal evidence suggests that in so cases bct commanders request information and point out areas where eprts could help in august 2008 officials at one multinational division noted that in practice eprt members take direction from the bct commander some eprts may thus function more like bct staff section than partner organization593 the muchlarger full prts typically operate much more independently there is great variation in the type of military units prts are partnered with which range from bct that has responsibility for the same province as

partners replied with emphasis we like our eprts 594 in general military commanders in iraq have stressed the need for far more of the prts expertise and presence particularly once the security climate began to improve some commanders have asked wheres the civilian surge while some officials at mnfi put it more bluntly get state out here595 looking ahead one division commander noted in august 2008 this is window of opportunity with the lowest attack rates ever embassy people should be out more every day now like we are another senior commander on the ground suggested that eprts could become the main effortand that even as some bcts redeploy their partner eprts could remain to continue their work 596 opa officials in turn stressed in early 2008 that the current prt presence was the civilian surge597 in august 2008 us embassy officials noted that the current prt footprint would likely be the highwater mark and thatbased in part on congressional directionthe embassy had already begun prt strategic drawdown plan some embassy officials commented that in some locations the prt presence might already be too heavy and cumbersomeas one official observed with 53 people in mosul its not clear theres full days work for everyone some suggested that for the future as the number of civilian personnel diminishes it would be helpful to target prt efforts on particular areas of need such as agriculture public health and local governance capacity 598 some civilian officials have expressed concern that as us military forces in iraq draw down there might not be sufficient military resources to provide movement and force protection for prts as of mid2008 prts relied variously on military forces or private security contractors for such support the contractor teams were reportedly quite costly and should the forthcoming new sofa regime fail to provide legal immunity for contractors as expected the contractors availability and cost could change in august 2008 one division commander noted that if the 594 interviews with bct and prt officials kirkuk and with multinational division official august 2008 595 interviews with division and bct commanders and mnfi

to dedicate more military assets to directly supporting the prtsperhaps providing each one with full company599 some opa and prt officials meanwhile have expressed frustration with the military in iraq for trying to do too much governance and economic work instead of leaving those missions to far better qualified civilian experts as one civilian official expressed in early 2008 the military needs to start transitioning governance and economics to other agencies600 apparently most military commanders would agreemany have noted that they would readily transition responsibilities whenever civilians are available to receive them as one division commander noted in august 2008 we dont have thee right expertise601 many practitioners and outside observers have noted that institutional cultural differences help shape the prtmilitary relationships one civilian official in iraq commented only partly tongue in cheek that it is case of sit back and reflect versus take that hill 602 for example in 2007 one division frustrated by delays in the arrival of eprts launched campaign to recruit eprt members from its own staff and subordinate units officials of opa to which prts and eprts report viewed that initiative as stepping on their prerogatives603 other practitioners stress that individual personali ties play the key role as one civilian official commented in early 2008 its mostly about personalitiesits not something you can just fix604 some civilian and military officials have suggested that more appropriately targeted training might better prepare civilians for prt service particularly those scheduled to work closely with military units some current civilian prt members note that their predeployment visit to ft bragg and their counterinsurgency training at the phoenix academy at camp taji iraq were invaluable primarily for the exposure they provided to military culture and organization605

the sheer magnitude of ongoing interaction by coalition forces with iraqi provincial and local officials607 in baghdad for example the full baghdad prt interacts with the governor the mayor and the provincial council chair while eprts are tasked to work with the district and neighborhood level councils small eprt with responsibility for given district might work closely with that district council but due to personnel and resource constraints the eprt might have difficulty working equally closely and frequently with all of the subordinate neighborhood councils within that district military units are likely to have far more frequent interactions with iraqi officials battalion commanders meet regularly with neighborhood councils civil affairs units and other military staff work continually with local officials on essential services and other public works projects and captains and their staffs at joint security stationsand their isf counterpartsmeet often with local officials who use the jsss as community meeting sites 608 in august 2008 for example prt and bct offici als described their division of labor the bct commander engages the provincial governor battalion commanders engage the district councils and company commanders engage subdistrict councils and groups of local mukhtars the prt in turn focuses on the provincial government helping tie it more closely into the national government the prt also mentors young military officers in governance work609 central and longstanding focus of coalition governance efforts is helping iraqis achieve connectivity between the topdown national ministries and their appointed representatives for each province on one hand and the groundup provincial and local governments chosen by local populations on the other military commanders in every region have attested that provincial officials have authority overand little relationship withthe ministerially appointed representatives for their province 610 in august 2008 one division commander explained where the military can help is in building informal bridges among tribal councils the iraqi security forces and local governmentand it still needs forcing function at the national level611 as described by colonel tom james commander of the 4th bct of 3rd infantry division stationed south of baghdad in early 2008 one of the things we really focused on is linkages making sure that local governments are representative of the people and they theyre linked to higher governments so that we can process prioritize and resource the people that need things 612 607 coalition military governance efforts in 2008 are very similar to those in 2003 in 2003 faced with very limited civilian presence commanders leaned forward and worked w ith iraqis to form

fostering connectivity among the levels of government by mentoring iraqi interlocutors at ea ch level for example in one town south of baghdad community leaders were apparently frustrated because they felt disconnected from the deliberations of the nearest local council the army captain leading the jss in the city started bringing local community leaders together regularly helping them to articulate and prioritize their concerns coalition forces then connected that informal body with the iraqi officials formally chosen to represent that area that mentoring was then backed up by higher levels of the captains chain of command on their frequent visits 613 in one area of baghdad brigade commander and representatives of his subordinate units regularly reviewed the membership of all the local councils based on the units frequent interactions with them checking for vacancies for the presence of outsiders from outside given neighborhood and for roughly accurate reflec tions of the demographic balance where local councils fell short the units that regularly engaged them pointed out the concerns to them and urged improvement 614 in the views of many commanders prts and eprts are simply not robust enough to conduct the governance mission comprehensively as one division staff member framed the issue in early 2008 the division needs to help the prts help establish governance615

line of operation as in the field of governance since the earliest postmajor combat days the us military has played role in the economic reconstruction of iraq the military role in economic reconstruction has typically focused on locallevel initiatives in 2008 one economic focus for the military was neighborhood economic revitalizationusually measured in terms of the number of small shops opened the first shops to reopen in neighborhood as security improves typically included fruit and vegetable stands and shops selling convenience foods like bottles of soda to facilitate that process commanders sometimes sought local iraqi partner to serve as the primary contractor for reconstruction in neighborhood and to encourage other local entrepreneurs to come onboard616 by january 2008 in addition military commanders were tasked to keep an eye open for potential mediumsized businesses to support617 commanders have also been able to make av ailable microgrants through department of defense program which allowed them to provide fledgling iraqi businesses with startup funds 613 interviews with division brigade battalion and company commanders and participant observation january

august 2008 us embassy officials explained that imposing economic policy discipline in the regionsamong prts as well as military unitsis challenge620 this may help explain what some called the great poultry debate of 2008 in mid2008 as part of the search for sustainable economic activity some military and prt officials proposed supporting the development of domestic poultry and egg farming some argued that such business required relatively low start up costs and would provide both employment and income for local families officials at the us embassy and some civilian and military practitioners in the field countered that such efforts stood little chance of being profitableit cost 2 to buy chicken to eat from brazil while domestic iraqi chicken would cost much more than that given the costs of importing feed and cooling the chickens and their eggs one bct commander noted poultry farming is big deal for us while senior embassy official countered theres business plan 621 meanwhile military commanders have continued to make use of the commanders emergency response program cerp which provides brigade commanders with discretionary funding for wide array of projects as of mid2008 the majori ty of cerp funding was being used to support essential services and other sustained initiatives such as the sons of iraq program anecdotally in some instances cerp may have lost some of its initial flexibilityin the accounts of several bct commanders who earlier had been free to spend cerp funds at their own discretion they had recently been required to seek approval from their division headquarters to spend cerp money as of august 2008 there was formal requirement for military units to coordinate cerp spending with iraqi officials or with prt or eprt counterparts and some opa and prt officials have raised concerns about insufficient civilmilitary coordination division brigade and battalion commanders have noted that most projects nominated for cerp support are initially put forward by local iraqi officials and residents further although it is not mandated the military typically crosswalks proposed initiatives with the existing plans of local iraqi councils

the extensive use of cerp on projects either that might not be necessary or that the iraqis might be able to pay for themselves some civilian officials in baghdad shared the concern about the use of

overall attacksincluding attacks against iraqi infrastructure and government facilities bombs found and exploded small arms attacks including snipers ambushes and grenades and mortar rocket and surfacetoair attacks according to mnfi overall atta cks grew from low point in early 2004 when records begin to peak of over 1500 weekly attacks in june and july 2007 just as the final surge units arrived in iraq and operation phantom thunder was launched that gradual growth was punctuated by sharp upward spikes at key iraqi political junctures including the january 2005 elections and the october 2005 constitutional referendum and less sharply during ramadan each year after july 2007 the overall level of attacks declined sharply punctuated by spike during iraqi and coalition operations in basra and sadr city in march 2008 by december 2008 the level of attacks had fallen to close to 200 per week levels last witnessed at the beginning of 2004 627 commanders on the ground point out that low level of attacks in given geographical area does not necessarily mean that adversaries remain there it could also indicate that placesuch as arab jabour south of baghdad in late 2007was being used as sanctuary628 in turn high level of attacks is generally expected at least temporarily during major operations in an area as extremist groups attempt to push back629

number of monthly deaths peaked in late 2006at just over 1500 per month according to coalition data and about 3750 per month according to combined iraqi and coalition data mnfi reports that beginning in july and august 2007 after all the surge forces had arrived in iraq the level of civilian deaths fell sharply and then continued to decline through january 2008 decline of over 72 before rising slightly in february 2008 iraqi sources record spike in civilian deaths in late march 2008 during the military operations in basra and sadr city both coalition and combined iraqi and coalition data

further metric regularly recorded and tracked is the number of weapons caches found and cleared that number skyrocketed from 1834 in 2004 the first year of full available records to 6957 in 2007 and 8601 in 2008 as of the end of november 2008632 the cache numbers alone however tell an incomplete story first of all because the size and contents of the caches are not indicated in addition there is way to confirm the discovery success rate by comparing the number of caches found with the total number of weapons caches in iraq at any given point larger numbers of fo und caches could indicate that the problem is growingfor example that more weapons are coming into iraq larger numbers could also simply reflect more aggressiveand more successfuloperations based on better information from iraqi

use of car bombs suicide car bombs and individuals wearing suicide vests in 2007 the monthly total reached peak of about 130 in march before falling unevenly to about 40 in december 2007 mnfi noted that erecting barriers and hardening sites as well as kinetic operations against wouldbe perpetrators had helped lower the total of vehicular attacks633 after gradual rise during the first two months

before rising slightly in december the number of total ied incidents followed similar trajectory over that time period635 the incidence of ied explosions relatively level at the beginning of 2008

been achieved on the ground in iraq some debates developed concerning which factors or combination of factors had contributed or contributed most to those improvements from social science perspective the results are testablethe experiment cannot be repeated holding one or more variables constant mnfi leaders and commanders on the ground attr ibuted the improvements in the security situation not just to one or two key factors but to compendium of factors moreover commanders noted those factors were made particularly effective by their interaction effects for example coalition personnel with previous service in iraq making use of more sophisticated technologies the most fundamental factor may have been wh at former mnfi commanding general general david petraeus has called shift in the intellectual construct from an emphasis on transition quick handover to iraqisto counterins urgency coin focus on achieving population security another key coin component of that inte llectual construct was recognizing the need to separate the irreconcilables from the reconcilablesas gen petraeus observed youre not going to kill your way out of an insurgency 639 additional key factors frequently cited by commanders in iraq include targeted operations by special operations forces operations and much greater presence by conventional coalition forces operations presence and greatly improved capabilities of iraqi security forces the rejection of extremists by the awakening movements efforts by the sons of iraq and other security 637 interviews with mnci officials january and

greatly improving commanders ability to make decisions and respond in timely way new technologiesparticularly rapidly fielded counteried equipment and approacheshelped coalition forces against the adversaries deadliest weapons and saved lives 641 not only did various components of force contribute to the fight their efforts were far better integrated than they were several years ago and that integration also helps explain security improvements to date for example commanders note that the air component increased the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr assets available to ground commanders to support and inform their operations the greater ground forces presence and the better information from iraqis that it generated in turn made possible the more frequent and more effective use of air strikes commanders on the ground have noted that the increasingly sophisticated technologies available to sof have strengthened their efforts to kill or capture highvalue targets commanders have stressed however that you cant get qaeda by just using sof mnfi officials have noted that coalition forces tried the sofonly approach in ramadi for four years but it ultimately proved insufficient they add that sof is most effective when it draws on conventional forces intimate knowledge of local communities based on the close contacts conventional forces have with isf sois and local tribes then follow ing sof actions conventional forces play the essential role of holding the area with strong visible presence 642 finally as many practitioners on the ground have pointed out by the time of the surge force leaders staff commanders and troops in the field typically brought significant previous iraq experience to the mission most leaders and commanders have served at least one previous tour in iraq and their familiarity with iraqi governing st ructures basic laws and customs is markedly greater than the limited knowledge the first coalition teams brought to iraq643 leaders also point out that they have had time to absorb the lessons from their earlier tours including absorbing the 2006 coin manual that captured lessons from recent operational experience644
