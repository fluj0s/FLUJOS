report and or der it will be updated as events warrant introduction technological advances loo ming statutory deadline and the need to reclaim analog spectrum occupied by tele vision broadcasters has put digital television dtv on fast track at the same time development of digital television has necessitated balancing competing interests those of content holders and those of the consumer and technological industries reconciling these interests has led to the development of broadcast flag to comb at unauthorized redistribution of content broadcast through digita l television signals the move to protect digital content has been given urgency by the federal communicati ons commissions fcc determination that broadcast transmissions be digital by december 31 20061 what is dtv digital television dtv is new television service representing the most significant development in television technology since the advent of color television in the 1950s three major compone nts of dtv service must be present for consumers to enjoy fully realized high definition television viewing experience first digital programming must be available digital programming is content that is assembled with digital cameras and other digita l production equipment second digital programming must be delivered to the consumer via digital signal third consumershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22106crs2 2 for more information on dtv see crs report rl31260 digital television an overview by lennard kruger 3 however it should be noted that while duplicati on is fairly simple distribution especially of highend digital content can be quite time consuming for example over broadband connections while music file may take matter of minutes television shows in standard analog format take number of hours digital programs such as an hour of high definition television programming in turn may take upwards of 1015 hours to successfully download 4 fifth report at 12811 5 5 this collaboration was open to any group or individual wishing to participate with the exception of the press bpdg final report of the cochairs of the broadcast protection discussion subgroup to the copy pr otection technical working group

receiving digital television in way that accommodated competing interests has proved challenging digital content like other media can be relatively easily duplicated and distributed especially with the aid of the internet3 unlike other types of content dup lication of digital information does not degrade the original whereas the quality of vhs tape degrades after successive copies dvd may be copied almost infin itely with effect on the quality of the medium it is due to the ease and inexhaustible potential of copying digital media coupled with the proliferation of peertopeer services such as morpheus and kazaa that content providers have greeted this new technology with some trepidation the broadcast flag the broadcast flag is combination of technical specifications and federal regu lations designed to combat unauthorized redistribution of content broadcast through dig ital television dtv signals its adoption was prompted largely by the federal communications commissions fcc determination that broadcast transmissions be digital by december 31 20064 the fcc imposed transition to dtv in part to capitalize on the sharpe r images cdquality sound and wider screen angles that are available from advanced dig ital technologies but in addition to the technological impetus the fcc has also been motivated by the knowledge that broadcasters upon receiving digital spectrum allotments must relinquish their analog spectrum allotments to the fcc the analog spectrum will in turn be auctioned for other commercial and public interests content provi ders fearing widespread piracy that would endanger aftermarket sales s uch as cable rebroadcast and dvd sales urged the fcc to provide for means to protect their as sets meanwhile consumer electronics and information technologists as well as consumer rights groups came together in an effort to minimize the possible negative outcome that widescale regulation might have imposed the technical specifications behind the broadcast flag were compromise measure premised on an understanding that more restri ctive approaches such as encrypted signals created at the source of tran smission imposed economically or technologically infeasible conditions the compromise came after c onsortium of content providers consumer electronics and information technology gr oups came together forming the broadcast protection discussion group bpdg5 the result of this consortium was finalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22106crs3 5 continued available at httpwwwcptwgorgassetstext20filesbpdgbpdg20reportdoc 6 fcc in the matter of

protection has potential fo r variability for instance content provider such as cspan may decide that copy protection is necessary and would set the flag to an offposition digital content could therefore be av ailable without any restrictions to the user however broadcaster who sought to show pay perview digital content might choose to set the flag to an onposition which would disallow any fo rm of copying and could also potentially add setting to restrict the amount of time us er has to watch the program after purchase alternatively content provider may decide th at individual copying is permitted provided user views that copy on secure compliant device 8 report and order at 23561 9 report and order appendix b at 23592 report published in june 2002 which was livered to representative billy tauzin thenchairman of the house committee on energy and commerce the report suggested set of robustness and compliance rules fo r devices capable of demodulating digital television signals which woul d require that such devices protect flagged content from being recorded by unauthorized devices howe ver the flag itself would not require that all machines recognize it and would act only as means to halt unauthorized use in machines capable of detecting it in november 2003 the fcc published repor t and order in the matter of digital broadcast content protection which required all digital devices capable of receiving digital broadcast overtheair and sold after july 1 2005 to incorporate standard contentprotection technology that woul d recognize the broadcast flag and limit redistribution when the flag is recognized6 the fccs regulations apply the flag mark to all devices and receivers that are capable of receiving digital content such devices include but are not limited to televisions computers digital videorecorders such as tivo and dvd players the broadcast flag itself is optional for broadcasters allowing them to determine how much copyprotection they wish to impose on their digital broadcast content7 because the flag does not prevent the distribution of content to noncompliant devices consumer who continues to use an older television set or theoretically non compliant demodulator will still be able to receive and copy tele vision programs in non digital form in addition dig ital television sets made prior to july 1 2005 will still enjoy digital content with obstruc tion in citing its support for flagbased approach over encryption or other means the fcc noted c oncerns over the implementation costs and delays associated with other solutions8 in addition to the compliance requirements imposed on receiving devices the fcc also imposed robustness requirement that forces makers of consumer devices to ensure that circumvention is difficult the standard of care adopted by the fcc was that of an ordinary user using genera lly available tools or equipment9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22106crs4 10 47 usc 336i1 2000 11 47 usc 336b4 and

cir oct 28 2003 14 us v southwestern cable co 392 us 157 178 1968 15 as to ancillary jurisdiction see southwestern cable at 178 concerning the fccs ancillary authority congress has given the commission comprehensive mandate with expansive powers which has led the courts to conclude that the communications act of 1934 provides the commission with ancillary jurisdiction over matters that are related to the provision of radio or television service though not specifically enumer ated in the act historically the fcc has exercised its ancillary jurisdiction to promulga regulations in number of areas see southwestern cable at 173 177 us v midwest video corp 406 us 649 1972 in addition to this historic authority the fcc relies on the definition of wireradi communications which includes all incidental instrumentalities facilities apparatus and services that are used for the receipt forwarding and delivery of such tr ansmissions as basis for its authority over television receivers r eport and order at 23563fcc authority the fcc derives its regulatory authority over digital television from both direct and ancillary statutory authority digital television implementation under the telecommunications act of 1996 the telecommunications act of 1996 directed the fcc to promulgate regulations regarding the licensing of adva nced television servi ces the act defined advanced television services as televisi on services provided us ing digital or other advanced technology10 in prescribing such regulations the commission was authorized to adopt such technical and other requireme nts as may be necessa ry or appropriate to assure the quality of the signal used to provide advanced tele vision services and prescribe such other regulations as may be necessary for the protection of the public interest convenience and necessity11 pursuant to the telecommunications ac t of 1996 the fcc has issued regulations regarding spectrum allocation for digital television stations and has established timeline for the implementation of digital broadcasting by licensees12 at least one court has agreed that in regard to television digita l tuners the fcc possessed reasonable authority to act based on an unambiguous command of an act of congress13 copyright protection while copyright protection generally lies outside the scope of the fcc the commission may exercise jurisdiction over matters not explicitly provided for by statute if the exercise is reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the commissions various responsibilitie s for the regulation of television broadcasting14 the fcc has asserted that televi sion receivers generally and digital television receivers specifically fall within the scope of that authority15 under the fcc report and order pursu ant to the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction we adopt use of the flag as currently defined for redistribu tion control purposes nd establish compliance and robustness rules for devices with demodulators to ensure that they respond and give effect to the flag however the fcc initially put off deciding on permanent mechanisms for approving content protection and recording

in its report and order the fcc proposed examination of such issues at later time and established an interim certification process for currentlyproposed devices16 in addition to the need to regulate television broadcasting the fccs action arguably protects broadcasters from any unreasonable loss in advertising revenue that may result from unauthorized sharing of copyrighted digital television broadcasts however the fcc was careful to note that the scope of our decision does not reach existing copyright law and that its rulemaking established technical protection measure that did not change the underlying rights and reme dies available to copyright holders in addition this decision is not intended to alter the defenses and penalties applicable in cases of copyright infringemen t circumvention or ot her applicable laws17 possible implications of the broadcast flag while the broadcast flag is intended to prevent the indiscriminate redistribution of digital broadcast content over the internet or through similar means the goal of the flag was not to impede consumers ability to copy or use content lawfully in the home nor was the policy intended to foreclose use of the internet to send digital broadcast content where it can be adequately protected from indiscriminate redistribution18 however current technological limitations have the potentia l to hinder some activities which might normally be considered fair use under existing copyright law19 for example consumer who wished to record program to watch at later time or at different location timeshifting and spaceshifting respectively might be prevented when otherwise approved technologies do not allow for such activities or do not integrate well with one another or with older legacy vices in addition future fair or reasonable uses may be precluded by these limitations for example student would be unable to email herself copy of project with digital video content because current secure system exists for email transmission in addition some consumer electronics and information technology groups contend that the licensing terms for approving new compliant devices are limiting and may potentially stifle innovation especially with regard to computer hardware20 while the fcc in its report and order declined to establish formal guidelines for which objectivehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22106crs6 21 report and order at 23578 22 id at 2356823569 internal citation omitted 23 2005 us app lexis 7847 may 6 2005 24 id 25 id at 4criteria should be used to evaluate new c ontent protection and recording technology it has stated an intention to take up these issues in the future21 finally consumer rights and civil liber ties groups worry about the possibility that such content protections will limit the free fl ow of information and hamper the first amendment this concern is expressed most prominently regarding news or public interestbased content or works that have already entered the public domain despite suggestions raised by consumer rights gr oups the fcc has so fa r declined to adopt language to prevent content providers from using the broadcast flag on such programs largely because of the practical and lega l difficulties of deter mining which types of broadcast content merit protection from indiscriminate redistribution and which do not22 legal challenges to the broadcast flag in october of 2004 the american library association ala association of research libraries american association of law libraries aall medical libraries association and others petitioned the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit to review the fccs report and order bringing challenge on behalf of libraries librarians and educators and television viewers and computer users the petitioners as parties to the agency proceedings questioned the fccs statutory authority to establish the broadcast flag system under the communications act of 1934 on may 6 2005 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit granted the alas petition for review and reversed and vacated the commissions orde r requiring dtv reception equipment to be manufactured with the capability to prevent unauthorized redistributions of digital content23 in american library association v federal communications commission the court of appeals determined that the fcc lacked the authority to regulate apparatus that can receive television broadcasts when those apparatus are not engaged in the process of receiving broadcast transmission24 the court noted that in adopting the broadcast flag rules the commission cited specific stat utory provision giving it authority to regulate consumers use of television receiver apparatus after the completion of the broadcast transmission25 the commissions reliance on its ancillary jurisdiction under title i of the communications act of 1934 was rejected by the court the court found that while the jurisdictional grant under t itle i plainly encompasses the regulation of apparatus that can receive television broadcast content the commissions regulatory authority does not extend beyond the actual recei pt of such content by the apparatus in question the courts decisi on was limited to the resolution of the question of whether the commission had the authority to impose th broadcast flag requirements and did not address the imposition of the broadcast flag requirements in term s of copyright law
