summary the public policy interest in paternity establishment is based in part on the dramatic increase in nonmarital births the poorest demographic group in the united states consists of children in singlepar ent families in 2000 331 of all us births were to unmarried women compared to 39 in 1950 moreover in fy2000 519 of the children in the child support enfo rcement cse caseloa d which includes temporary assistance to needy families tanf and certain other welfare families and nonwelfare families who pply for cse services were born outside of marriage the percentage of cse children who were born outside of marriag varied by state ranging from 78 in kansas 4 in puerto rico to 798 in delaware the main goals of the cse program are to reduce spending on actual and potential recipients of public welfare by obtaining ongoing support from noncustodial parents and to establish paternity for ch ildren born outside of marriage so that child support can be obtained most experts now agree that use of highly reliable dna tests greatly increases the likelihood of co rrect identification of putative fathers dna tests can be used either to exclude unlikely fathers or to establish high likelihood that given man is the father with more paternities bein g established each year than children being born outside of marriage progress is being ma in reducing the number of children who do not have legally establis hed fathers nonethele ss office of child support enforcement ocse data indicate that in fy2000 paternity had been established or acknowledged fo r only about 65 of the 101 million children on the cse caseload who were born outside of marriage some proposals or programs that may increase the numbers of paternities blished include vol untary acknowledgment of paternity especially via hospitalba sed programs which increased 781 from 78129 in fy1994 to 688510 in fy2000 renewed emphasis on older children perhaps through media campaigns continued outreach to fathers ac

needing to have paternity established data from the ffice of child support enforcement ocse indicate that in 2000 the total number of children in the child support enforcement cse caseload1 who were

children in the cse caseload without legally identified father paternity establishment is not an end in itself but rather prerequisite to obtaining ongoing economic support i child support from the other noncustodial parent2 moreover in addition to fi nancial benefits establishing paternity can provide social psychological and emotional benefits to the child and in some cases the fathers medical history may be needed to give child proper care paternity is presumed if child is ceived within marriage in other words the husband is presumed to be the father of child born to his wife in cases in which the child is born outside of marriage paternity can be voluntarily acknowledged or it can be contested it would be contested in cases in which the mother does not want to establish paternity thereby forcing the father to take his case to court to assert his rights the biologi cal father does not want to pay child support and denies paternity to dela establishment of child s upport order

obtaining child support order states generally follow standard sequence of events in determining paternity states are required to have procedures which permit the establishment of the paternity of child at any time before the child reaches age 18 although federal cse law re quires states to implement certain administrative processes eg voluntary acknow ledgment to establish paternity most states use both administrative and judicial methods of paternity establishment although the court is generally the final arbiter of deciding paternity in contested cases the level of court involvement in cse paternity establishment prac tices varies some states use the courts only for the most difficult contested paternity cases others require routine judicial approval for all paternity determinations according to an hhs inspector general report 25 states primarily use quasi administrative paternity establishment procedures such as encouraging acknowledgment or other mutu parental consent ofte n following genetic testing5 quasiadministrative methods primarily rely on the actions and authority of the cse agency but also allow limited court involve ment the hhs inspector general report indicated that the following were characteristic of quasiadministrative procedures paternity establishment may occur with little or court i nvolvement the cse agency primarily determines the procedur used to determine paternity voluntary acknowledgment is binding w ithout court approval genetic tests may be order by the cse agency without court pproval default orders of paternity may be created with little or court invol vement and initial hearings and conflict resolution are conducted by the cse agency6 proponents of the quasiadministrative approach argue that it is easier for parents to unders tand and for cse worker s to facilitate and that it is quicker more routine and ss subjective than judicial procedures before the enactment of the cse prog ram and the operation of cse agencies parents who wanted to establis h paternity generally had to hire an attorney and appeal to the courts state courts still are an integral to the establishment of paternity in many states

parents completing necessary paperwork and enforcing c ourt mandates the hhs inspector general report indicated that the following were character istic of quasijudicial procedures paternity cases require court approval or are often resolved through the courts state court determines in part the procedures us ed to establish paternity voluntary acknowledgment may require court approval prior to in itiation of child support order genetic testing manda tes require court order default orders of paternity require court order and hearings and conflict resolu tion are typically conducted by the courts7 proponents of this approach contend that limited involvement of the courts does not slow down the paternity tablishment process and maintain that court action is regarded more seriously by parents and provides more solid foundation for collection of child support the inspector general report found that some states create duplicative processes involving both the courts and the cse agency that are cumbersome and cause unnecessary delays in the paternity establishment process it said this occurred in part because both state cse agencies and courts may fail to accept administrative paternity establishments as valid8 presumptive paternity for married couples it is generally the case that if child is born to married couple the wifes husband is presumed to be the babys fa ther the precept of presumed fatherhood in the case of married couple generally is cons idered to be in the best interest of the child the stability of marriages and the public ie child would be less likely to need welfare assistance9 the exception occurs when husband can prove that he is not the biological father of his wifes child by showing that he could not have had intercourse with his wife at the probabl time of conception because for example he was sterile or impotent in the military service or in jail in these types of situations in which paternity is contes ted genetic testing is usually conducted courts generally have disc ouraged paternity cases between married couples unless one of the above exceptions can be prove n for children born outside of marriage paternity must be acknow ledged or established voluntary paternity acknowledgment state experience and several studies have shown that many men will voluntarily acknowledge paternity if gi ven the opportunity when paternity is established voluntarily with the cooperati on of both parents the cost conflict and delays of contested cases can be avoided the volunt ary acknowledgment pr ocess is available at any time to any father who wants to voluntarily acknowledge paternity even if man is initially reluctant to voluntarily acknowledge parentage because he is unsure whether he actually is the father he may be willing to do so after receiving genetichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31467crs5 10 section 466a5civ of the social security act requires states to implement laws that require the state to develop and use an

procedures full faith and credit means that valid affidavit is enfo rceable where it is issued and in all other jurisdictionstest results which indicate high probability of paternity thus it has proven to be very beneficial for states to provide fathers with multiple opportunities to voluntarily acknowledge paternity federal cse law requires stat to have laws and pro cedures for simple civil process for voluntarily acknowle dging paternity under such process the state is required to ensure that the rights and responsibilities of acknowle dging paternity are explained to both parents and that due pr ocess safeguards are afforded to both parents states may choose various simp civil methods for obtaining voluntary acknowledgments the statute requires that voluntary acknowledgment procedures include hospitalbased programs that focus on the period immediately before or after the birth of child each state is required to use paternity acknowledgment affi davit that includes at minimum the current full name of mother father and child social security number of mother and father date of birth of mother father and child address of mother and father birthplace of the child brief

signature lin for mother and father and signature lines for witnesses or notaries these requirements are meant to ensure that states voluntary acknowledgments share certain common elements if ever voluntary acknowledgment contains these basic elements states will be able to legally recognize and act upon acknowledgments obtained in other states which should improve interstate case processing

agency access to copies of and identifying information on the acknowledgments if the agency is not the cse agency it may be the vital statistics agency registry of putative fath ers or some other type

establishment but can discourage lowincome father from admitting paternity especially if he does not have the financial ability to pay child support because not paying child support is equated with lacking good moral character 12 in cases in which the mother is receiving cse services regardless of whether or not she is on welfare tanf the cse agency will initiate contact with the alleged father

acknowledgment or court has issued an adjudication of paternity the national womens law center and the center on fathers have cautioned that paternity establishmen t may have legal c onsequences outside of child support in addition to having information about the direct consequences of paternity establishment both parents need to be aware that in certain circumstances establishing paternity may have legal cons equences that are unrelated to the issue of child support custody and visitation staff who are involved in voluntary paternity establishment need to be aware of these consequences and alert parents to them for example the establishment of paternity may in some states impose liability for child support on childs grandparents mother who is seeking tanf assistance while cohabiting with the father of her child may be committing under certain circumstances an act of welfare fraud establishing paternity may in some cases alert law enforcement authorities to the location of individuals who are being sought under warrant establishing paternity may subject some parents to charges of stat utory rape establishing paternity may prevent some parents from successfully adjusting their immigration status11 contested paternity in cases where paternity is not voluntar ily acknowledged the mother of child generally will make an allegation of paternity to either the court or the

agencies are required to contract with genetic testing laboratories to perform paternity tests to resolve disputed paternity of children born to unmarried parents the laboratory must perform at reasonable costs tests that are legally and medically acceptable for identifying or excluding an alleged father in support of this effort the office of child support enforcement ocse has compiled the fourth edition of the directory of genetic testing laboratories which was disseminated to states in november 2000 the purpose of the directory is to help states identify boratories which perform legally and medically acceptable genetic tests at reasonable costs 16 if for example the rate of exclusion is 95 and the alleged father cannot be excluded continuedmay be excluded as possibl biological father in which case further action against him is warranted if the putative alleged father is not excluded on the basis of the scientific test results authorities still may conclude on the basis of witnesses resemblance and other evidence that they do not have sufficient evidence to establish paternity and therefore drop the paternity allegation tests resulting in nonexclusion may serve to convince the putative father that he is in f act the father if this occurs voluntary admission often leads to formal court order when authorities believe there is enough evidence to support the mothers alle gation but the putative father continues to deny the paternity charges the case proceeds to formal adjudication of paternity in court of law using the results of the blood tests and other evidence the court or the cse agency often through an administrative process may dismiss the case or enter an order of paternity prerequisite to obtaining court order requiring noncustodial parent to pay child support genetic tests most states use one or more of seve ral scientific met hods for establishing paternity these include red blood cell antigen testing human leukocyte antigen hla testing red cell enzyme and serum protein electrophoresis and deoxyribonucleic aci d dna testing14 the 1996 welfare reform law mandates that states have and use procedures by which genetic test results can be admitted as evidence of paternity without the need fo r additional testimony or other proof of accuracy unless an objection is made for st ates to take advantage of this procedure in contested cases the test must be of type generally acknow ledged as reliable by an hhs approved accreditation body and be performed by laboratory approved by the accreditation body15 the laboratory is required to issue report accompanied by documentation that establishes the ch ain of custody of the specimens genetic tests generally ar performed on small samples of blood collected from the mother the child and

child given that questions regarding paternity essentially can be answered scientifically it is important that the verification process include available advanced scientific technology most experts now agree that use of highly reliable dna tests greatly increases the likelihood of correct identification of putative fathers dna tests can be used either to exclude unlikel fathers or to establish high likelihood that given man is the father of child dna profiling allows for direct examination of the genetic material that child inherited from its biological parents during the testing process the genetic characteristics of child are first compared to those of his or her mother the characteristics that ca nnot be found in the mother must have been inherited from the biological father if the tested man does not contain the genetic characteristics necessary to be the biological father of the child he is excluded if the dna of the tested man does contain those genetic characteristics then the man cannot be excluded and the probability that the tested man is the true biological father can be calculated one expert speaking at child support conference summed up the effectiveness of dna testing as follows the dna fingerpr inting technique promises far superior reliability than current blood grouping or human leukocyte antigen analyses the probability of an unrelated individual sharing the same pa tterns is practically zero the dna fingerprinting test developed in england in 1985 refines the favorable statistics to an even greater degree reducing the probability that two unrelated individuals will have the same dna fingerpr int to one in quadrillion17 dna testing is an improvement over ot her forms of testing because the laboratory technician can 1 use samples fro m fetuses newborns or corpses in hla testing one must wait 6 to 12 months after child is born before testing the childs immunological system 2 use samples th at are over 48 hours old 3 use smaller samples that can come from greater vari ety of body parts tissue blood and hair versus blood only and 4 achieve higher level of statistical confidence in the conclusions reached18 federal law requires

matching rate in fy2000 states in the aggregate spent 322 million on laboratory tests associated with the process of determining paternity according to 1999 hhs inspector genera l report some cse agencies practice the following procedures to eliminate or remove barriers to the effective use of genetic testing 1 collection of dna sa mples from child alleged father and mother at the local cse office thereby avoiding future delays and tr ansportation problems and 2 use of buccal swab ie cheek cells sampling instead of drawing blood thereby alleviating some clients fear of n eedles as barrier to genetic testing in addition to eliminate expense as concern fo r putative fathers us of genetic testing some states do not seek to recoup testing co sts or they allow local staff discretion to waive recoupment however few areas in the country appear to use all of these strategies20 widespread availability of inexpensive and reliable genetic tests streamlines paternity establishment by reducing the need for extensive fact finding and minimizing drawnout litigation this helps states establish support orders for more children and ensure that the obligor ie person owing child support really is the childs biological father however it also should be noted that advances in genetic testing have contributed to an unanticipated increase in disestablishment actions while most courts are

minimum level of performance below which states are not paid an incentive unless the state has improved significantly over its previous years performance one of the main reasons for mandating new

the underlying factors on wh ich collections were based thus one of the performances rewarded by the new incentive payment system is paternity establishment under the new incentive system if state had paternity establishment percentage of 80 or higher the state would be eligible for 100 of the maximum value of the incentive the maximum incentive would be based on percentage of the individual states co llections if state had paternity establishment percentage of 49 or lowe r the state would have to increase its paternity establishment percentage by at least 10 percentage points over its prior years performance in order to receive an incentive if the state made such an improvement it would be eligible for 50 of the states maximum incentive amount during the development of the new incentive system concern was expressed about the possibility that states would be financially penaliz ed for noncompliance with federal requirements at the same time they were eligible for cse incentive payments some analysts argued that the lack of an incentive payment would make states subject to double penalty if they did not improve performance it was decided that states should be eligible for incentives based on performance even if they were subject to penalties because their performance had not improved to the extent required to avoid the penalty the following rationale was cited by

biological connection other courts have not allowed husbands to raise the paternity issue at divorce especially if the husband suspected adultery and failed to act cont ending that it would not be in

submission to genetic testing the putative fathers receipt of this letter is called service of process48 many observers have concerns about th is provision of law because states and jurisdictions have broad discretion in determining what constitutes notice ie service of process some jurisdictions consider publi cation notice where notice of the proceeding is put into the newspaper as sufficient thus even in situations in which some level of notice is required federal law allows the mother or the state in welfare case to obtain determination of paternity when the man named as the father is not present for the initial hearin g or for subsequent paternity proceedings some observers argue that the practi ce of using default judgments ie judgments made in the absence of the lleged father has adversely affected many putative fathers who claim they are not the father of the child in question but for whatever reason did not show up in court to deny the allegations many observers maintain that the sta ndards governing default judgments should balance the rights of the putative father to proper notice and the opportunity to be heard before paternity is tablished and child support or der set against the right of the child to obtain determination of pa ternity and support on timely basis from father who knowingly fails to appear in court49 when 95 equals 100 federal law requires states to have procedures which create rebuttable or at the option of the state conclusive presumption of paternity upon genetic testin g results indicating threshold probability that the alleged father is the actual father of the child most states have rebuttable presumption paternity threshol d that ranges from 95999 in some states blood test results that indicate 98 or greater probability of paternity are not rebuttable which raises the possibility that 2 of the putative fathers tested may be wrongly assigned paternity and thereby wrongly saddled with an 18year financial responsibility50 where is the money going some noncustodial fathers argue that they were hoodwinked into believing that if they voluntarily acknowledged paternity any child support they paid would be helping thei r child they contend that this is not so if the childs mother is receiving tanf benefits because instead of directly benefitting their children their child support payments are used to pay the state back for welfare payments that the family is receivinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31467crs26 51 the exception occurs if the child support arre arages were collected by the state through the federal

families states are now allowed to set their own policies as of february 2002 26 states had chosen to eliminate the child support passthrough and disregard in those states none of the money paid by noncustodial parents on behalf of their ch ildren who are receiving tanf benefits goes to their children all of it goes to the state and federal governments to reimburse welfare costs this change in

paymen ts was received by tanf families once families leave the tanf rolls th ey are entitled to receive all current support paid on their behalf this was true under the fo rmer afdc program as well however current law as compared to former pre1996 law allows former cash welfare families to receive greater share of the child support arrearages collected on their behalf by giving priority to their claims over the states claim to arrearages assigned to it in certain circumstances51 custodial parents also are dissatisfied with the current child support distribution system custodial parents are frustrated because they view child support arrearages as belonging to them they argue that they had to rely on family and friends for financial assistance during periods when th noncustodial parent failed to pay child support that occurred before they went on we lfare they contend that they and not the state are entitled to any prewelfare arrearage payments that are collected on their behalf advocates point out that while promising families priority in collecting arrearages owed to them as an inducement to encourage them to move off welfare as soon as possible the states and the fe deral

of the fvo is to enable states to help victims of domestic vi olence without subjecting them to tanf rules that might unfairly penalize them or put them at further risk of abuse specifically the fvo

establishe d paternity registries thus in the event that the mother places the child up for adoption the biological father will be notified of any proceedings to terminate his parental rights if he registers his claim to paternity these paternity registries are viewed as vehicle to limit the potential disruption to children and adoptive parents while protecting the rights of biological fathers52 mothers right s and concerns historically one of the main reasons cu stodial mothers have cited for not having child support award is that they did not pursue obtaining one it is not known whether this is because they did not want any further contact with the childs father because of belief that the child was be tter off without paternal contact fear of domestic andor sexual violence an attitude that assumed that the man could not pay child support so why bother or wanting to move on to anothe r relationship without the complexity of the childs father always being in the picture women who are victims of domestic vi olence often face the conflict between the need for financial support from child support payments and the need for safety from abuse unless they choose to forego the child support payment because the risk of abuse is too great to warrant its pursuit women who are victims of domestic violence must comply with the requireme nts for cooperation with the child support enforcement process these requirements however can increase the risk of harm for the victim of domestic violence by bringing the victim and abuser into near proximity during courtroom proceedings andor angeri ng an abuser by automatic procedures such as wage withholding or drivers license suspension however if women who fear their abusers choose not to pursue child support they impair their ability to become selfsufficient by relinquishing th child support resource for themselves and their children most victims of domestic violence do not want to forego these resources and yet want to ensure their own safety and that of their children53 for the most part women in these situations have to opt out of the cse system through good cause exemptions or the 1996 welfare reform

father legally identified are irrefutable they suggest that paternity should be established regardless of the ability of the father to pay child support they argue that th role of both parents is critical in building the self esteem of their children and helping the children become selfsufficient members of the community once paternity is established legally child gains legal rights and privileges among these may be rights to inheritance rights to the fathers medical and life insurance benefits and to social security and possibly veterans benefits the child also has chance to develop relationship with the father and to develop sense of identity and connection to the other half of his or her family it also may be important for the health of the child for doctors to have knowledge of the fathers medical history it is often noted that legally establishing paternity is not the end of the story and that legally conferring fatherhood status on man does not guarantee that the man will be caring and responsible father some observers contend that good relationship can exist without the formal establishment of legal paternity and bad relationship cannot be fixed nor previous ly nonexistent feeling created simply by establishing legal paternity for some parents whose relationships are good voluntarily establishing paternity can be an affirmation of their feelings for each other and the child while for others pare nts with good relationships who may be considering marriage to each other paternity establishment may be viewed as sign of distrust and thereby inconsistent with eventual marriage for some parents and communities the fathers informal acknowle dgment identifying the child as his to his family and friends and pr oviding some financial suppor t and help may be more meaningful than legal establishment of paternity however others note that if the relationship between the parents change s eg becomes more adversarial an informal acknowledgment may not provide as reliable foundation for continuing support as formal acknowledgment th at legally establishes paternity56 moreover some analysts argue that the childs perspective and concept of family and

still collects only 17 of child support obliga tions for which it has responsibility and collects payments for only 42 of its caseloa d two reasons for the low rate of child support collections are 1 the low rate of paternity establishment in fy2000 paternity was established for only 65 of the 101 million children in the cse caseload who were born outside of marriage and 2 many fathers cannot afford to pay study based on 1997 data indicated th at 21 of noncustodial fathers were poor and thus had limited ability to provi child support to their children57 study based on 1999 data indicated that 30 of poor fathers and 72 of nonpoor fathers paid child support58 in addition to increasing fathers financial contributions cse policy may affect family formation behavior and how fathers relate to their children59 according to economic theory stronger child support enforcement may increase the cost of children for men and should make men more reluctant to have children outside of marriage in other words by raising the cost of fatherhood to unmarried men effective paternity establishment and ch ild support enforcemen t deter nonmarital births60 in contrast stronger child support enforcement may reduce the cost of children for women making them more willing to have children outside of marriage61 however according to recent evid ence once woman becomes single mother her chances of marrying anyone other than the father of her child are greatly reduced62httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31467crs30 it is also important to note that for children whose mothers and fathers both are poor particularly children w ho receive tanf benefits pa ternity establishment may not necessarily be economically beneficial because of child support distribution rules child support paid on be half of tanf families is reta ined by the state and the federal governments to reimburse them for cash welfare paid to the family nevertheless this must be balanced by th tenet that in our society parents are responsible for the financial wellbeing of their children nd regardless of where their money actually goes it is the duty of nonc ustodial parent to make child support payments although the cse program has historica lly been the policy answer to the problem of father absence because its focus until recently was exclusively on financial support it has had the practical effect of alienating ma ny lowincome fathers who are unable to meet their child support obligations ma ny observers allege that the cse programs focus on costrecovery resulted in cse culture wherein noncustodial parents genera lly were viewed negatively nonpaying noncustodial parents were viewed as lawbreakers and put ative fathers were seen as riffraff it is generally agreed that the current policie s and procedures pert aining to paternity establishment have made the process more efficient and noncombative and that the technology exists to make the finding of paternity almost infa llible some contend that the cse program needs to change its perspective regarding putative fathers and send out new message that highlights its service delivery mission so that negative perceptions about the agency will not
