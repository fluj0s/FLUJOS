in committees of the house of representatives generally resembles but does not perfectly replicate the process of amending measures on the house floor at the beginning of markup committee members often make opening statements usually not exceeding five minutes apiece the first reading of the text of the bill to be marked up can be waived either by unanimous consent or by adopting nondebatable motion the bill then is read for amendment one section at time with committee members offering their amendments to each section after it is read but before the next section is read by unanimous consent only the committee may agree to dispense with the reading of each section or to consider bill for amendment by titles or chapters instead of by sections also by unanimous consent the committee may consider the entire bill as having been read and open to amendment at any point each amendment must be read in full unless the committee waives that reading by unanimous consent committees debate amendments under the fiveminute rule committee can end the debate on an amendment by ordering the previous question on it or by agreeing to motion to close debate on it committee also can order the previous question or close debate on the entire bill once it has been read or that reading has been waived by unanimous consent however the committee can only close debate not order the previous question on individual sections titles chapters of the bill the various kinds of amendments as well as most of the other motions that are in order on the house floor are in order in committee as well committees do not actually change the texts of the bills they mark up instead committees vote on amendments that their members want to recommend that the house adopt when it considers the bill on the floor the committee concludes markup not by voting on the bill as whole but by voting on motion to order the bill reported to the house with whatever amendments the committee has approved majority of the committee must be present when this final vote occurs for all other stages of markups committees may set their own quorum requirements so long as that quorum is at least onethird of the committees membership like the speaker of the house committee chairs are responsible for maintaining order and for enforcing proper procedure either at their own initiative or by ruling on points of order that other committee members make chairs also frequently respond to questions about procedure in the form of parliamentary inquiries committee may report bill back to the house without amendment with several amendments or with an amendment in the nature of substitute that proposes an entirely different text for the bill alternatively committee may report new or clean bill on the same subject as the bill or other text that it has marked up httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30244g22g145g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142 g142g561g15g138g155g148g158g153g561g18g155g152g140g142

legislative function of standing committees in the house of representatives is to evaluate the thousands of bills and resolutions that members introduce during each congress this evaluation process typically begins with an initial screening by which the majority party leaders and staff of each committee identify the relatively small percentage of measures referred to it that may merit more consideration the committee or one of its subcommittees then usually conducts one or more days of public hearings to receive testimony about the issue and the merits of the legislation proposed to address it if the committee decides that it may want to recommend that the house take legislative action the hearings are followed by markup meetings at which committee members propose and vote on amendments to bill or the draft of bill these meetings are called markups because committee members mark up the legislation before them as they decide what amendments to propose to the house finally the committee votes to order the bill reported back to the house for consideration on the floor this report focuses on the markup stage of the legislative process in committee it discusses the selection of the text to be marked up the procedures for proposing and debating amendments to that text the voting and quorum procedures that govern markups and the final stages of ordering the markedup text reported to the house for its consideration g3g153g153g149g146g140g138g139g146g149g146g157g162g561g152g143g561g10g152g158g156g142g561g20g158g149g142g156g561 in general the markup process in house committees reflects many of the rules and practices that govern the amending process on the house floor clause 1a1a of house rule xi states in part that the rules of the house are the rules of its committees and subcommittees so far as applicable as this report will discuss this clause is somewhat ambiguous in application because there is more than one house rule governing some aspects of the floor amendment process such as the devices available to terminate debate or to preclude additional amendments from being offered clause 2a1 of rule xi also empowers each standing committee to supplement and implement clause 1a1a by adopting its own written rules which each committee does at one of its first meetings at the beginning of each congress according to clause 2a1 these committee rules may not be inconsistent with the rules of the house or with those provisions of law having the force and effect of rules of the house this statement also is ambiguous in that committee rule governing debate on amendments for example may be consistent with one house rule but inconsistent with another as this report also will discuss the house parliamentarian has given committees some helpful guidance about how these provisions should be understood and applied during the conduct of markups and other committee meetings the combined effect of these two clauses theref ore is to give the houses standing committees some clear direction about how to proceed during markups but also to give them some discretion in setting their own committee rules procedures and customary practices g24g138g155g146g138g157g146g152g151g156g561g3g150g152g151g144g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g156g561 committee markups tend to be less formal than the corresponding amending process on the house floor committees are much smaller bodies so they do not always need elaborate rules that httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30244g22g145g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142

fact more informal process sometimes contributes to efficient and collegial decision making in committee furthermore most committee markups are somewhat less constrained by rules than house floor sessions because the house parliamentarian and his assistants do not attend committee markups to advise chairs and other committee members on procedural questi ons although many committees designate majority party staff member to provide procedural advice committee chairs tend to rely much more on their own knowledge and judgment in conducting committee meetings than do the speaker and other representatives who preside over house floor sessions the rules of the house give its committees some discretion in how each of them conducts its markup meetings and committees exercise this discretion in somewhat different waysboth in the formal rules they adopt to govern their meetings and even more in the informal and unrecorded practices that different committees typically follow this report concentrates on the markup procedures that house committees are expected to employ although not all committees follow these procedures in all respects and at all times the report also discusses some informal practices and certain tactical alternatives that committee chairs and members sometimes employ however the discussion here could not possibly encompass every variation in markup procedure that may be observed in committee practices readers of this report should not be surprised if it does not accord in every respect with what they may have observed at certain markup meetings of the committees with which they are most familiar references to committees in what follows should be understood to refer to subcommittees as well unless the text specifically distinguishes between them g21g142g149g142g140g157g146g151g144g561g157g145g142g561g22g142g161g157g561 key initial decision that can shape the course and outcome of markup is the selection of the text that the committee considers essentially there are two choices first the committee may mark up the text of one of the bills that members had introduced and that the house parliamentarian acting for the speaker had referred to the committee second the committee may mark up the draft of bill that has not yet been formally introduced and referred to the committee the chair can direct the committees staff to prepare the draft of bill usually written with the assistance of attorneys in the houses office of legislative counsel that reflects the chairs policy preferences the committee then may mark up this draft bill which in its printed form may be called discussion draft or staff draft such draft is now often known informally as chairs mark this phrase originated in committee consideration of budget resolutions but now is commonly used to denote any draft that constitutes the legislative starting point from which committee chair thinks markup should begin in either case the text that committee marks up already may have been marked up by one or more of the committees subcommittees if there has been subcommittee markup the subcommittee then makes its legislative recommendations to its parent committee in turn the committee most often uses the product of the subcommittees markup as the starting point for its own markup the selection of the textor the base text or the vehicle as members sometimes call itthat the committee will mark up is important because it sets the framework within which the markup and the policy debates it inspires will take place each provision of the selected text will survive httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30244g22g145g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142 g142g561g15g138g155g148g158g153g561g18g155g152g140g142

member takes the initiative to propose an amendment to it that the committee adopts the burden is on those who would change the provisions of the base text it is up to them to devise alternatives to that text and convince majority of their committee colleagues to vote for those alternatives clearly then it is advantageous to be able to select the vehicle from among the bills that were referred to the committee or to devise the vehicle by drafting new text that very well may draw on selected provisions of the introduced bills on which the committee held hearings g22g145g142g561g5g145g138g146g155g514g156g561g3g158g157g145g152g155g146g157g162g561g146g151g561g18g155g138g140g157g146g140g142g561 almost invariably it is the committee chair who selects the text to be marked up yet there is nothing in the rules of the house that explicitly gives chairs this authority instead this power would seem to derive from the authority of committee chairs to schedule committee meetings and set the agenda for them clause 2b of house rule xi directs each committee to establish regular monthly meeting days to conduct business which can include marking up legislation committees interpret this rule as giving the chair the authority to decide what if anything the committee should consider at each of its regular meetings many committees also exercise the authority derived from clause 2b to allow their chairs to cancel regular meetings when the chair considers it appropriate to do so clause 2c1 of the same rule authorizes each standing committee chair to call additional and special committee meetings for the consideration of bill or resolution pending before the committee or for the conduct of other committee business subject to such rules as the committee may adopt again this clause is understood to low the chair to decide what measure or what other committee business will be on the agenda of each such meeting committee may adopt rule that requires the chair to give prior notice to or even consult with the ranking minority member before scheduling meeting committees rules also may require that the chair give all committee members advance notice of when the committee will meet and what matters will be on its agenda for that meeting still the authority to schedule committee meetings including markups and to select matters for consideration at those meetings rests effectively with the committee chair g20g142g140g152g158g155g156g142g561g152g143g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142g142g561g15g142g150g139g142g155g156g561 committee members have two different mechanisms they can use when they disagree with their chairs decisions about what legislation the committee will meet to mark up and when however members very rarely resort to either of these devices if committee member objects to the committee marking up matter that the chair has placed on the agenda for regular or additional committee meeting the member may ask the committee to vote on whether it wants to consider that matter to secure this vote member raises what is known as the question of consideration under clause 3 of house rule xvi which rule xi clause 1a1a makes applicable to committees when motion or proposition is entertained the question w ill the house now consider it may not be put unless demanded by member delegate or resident commissioner

measure is called up for markup at committee meeting but before debate on it actually begins any member may compel vote on the question of consideration if majority of the committee votes on this question of consideration the committee does not proceed to act on the matter in question in this way majority of committee can prevent its chair from compelling them to mark up legislation that they prefer not to consider at least at that time however the question of consideration rarely is raised and if raised it is very unlikely that the committee will block consideration of measure that the chair wishes the committee to mark up there are two primary and related reasons first in setting the committees markup agenda the chair usually is acting in support of the majority partys policy and political interests except in the most unusual cases therefore the chairs agenda decisions can be expected to enjoy the support of all or almost all of his or her fellow party members on the committee second whether in committee or on the floor control of the agenda is at the very heart of the powers and prerogatives of the majority party in the house therefore majority party members in committee are inclined to and normally are expected to support their chair on procedural votes such as votes on questions of consideration when control of the committees agenda is at stake committee members have different recourse if committee chair fails to schedule meeting to mark up legislation that majority of the committee wants to consider under clause 2c2 of rule xi any three committee members can request in writing that their chair call special meeting for specific purpose such as to mark up measure that is identified in the written request if the chair fails to call the meeting within three days and if the meeting does not take place within seven days majority of the committee may require that the committee meet for that purpose and only that purpose at designated date and time in this way majority of committee members may take control of the agenda away from their chair and require the committee to mark up measure that the chair has failed to schedule for consideration however this rule has rarely if ever been formally invoked since the house first adopted it as part of the legislative reorganization act of 1970 the reasons are not surprising in the contemporary house we would rarely expect to encounter serious and open conflicts between committee chair and many committee members of his or her own party therefore we would expect this rule to be invoked by the committees minority joined by at least few majority party members of the committee who would have to be willing to undermine their partys control over the committees agenda on the other hand the threat of invoking the clause 2c2 procedure for calling special meeting may have convinced chairs to schedule matters for markup that they would have preferred not to bring up at least at that time the combined effect of these rules and the polit ical and institutional conditions affecting their use generally is to give committee chairs effective control over what matters their committees mark up when these markups take place and precisely what text the committee considers however chairs exercise this control within limits imposed by their knowledge that chairs decisions can be overridden if he or she thwarts the will of the committees majority party members and that the continuance of each chair in that office depends on retaining the support of the entire majority partys conference or caucus in practice the minority party members of committee usually have little effective recourse when they object to what their chair has or has not scheduled for the committee to mark up

context for subsequent sections of this report that discuss the individual stages of the process as mentioned above the rules of the house of representatives are ambiguous with respect to the procedures that standing committees are to follow at markup meetings clause 1a1a of rule xi generally provides that the rules of the house are the rules of its committees and subcommittees so far as applicable italics added and clause 2a1 of the same rule directs each standing committee to adopt written rules governing its procedures that may not be inconsistent with the rules of the house italics added two problems arise in interpreting these rules first they do not provide criteria to judge whether committee rules are not inconsistent with house rules second they do not define which house rules are applicable to committees and subcommittees the houses rules make available different sets of procedures that the house uses under different circumstances to consider various bills and resolutions on the floor it would not be possible for all of these procedures to be applicable to committees at the same time by the same token it would not be possible for committees to adopt rules that avoid being inconsistent with any of these procedures the house parliamentarian provides important guidance when he notes in the commentary accompanying sec xxx of jefferson s manual that the procedures applicable in the house as in the committee of the whole generally apply to proceedings in committees of the house of representatives he also points out several exceptions to this general statement that are discussed below the phrase the house as in committee of the whole refers to distinctive set of procedures that the house may but rarely does use to consider measures on the floor these procedures are not stated in the houses standing rules but they are matter of wellestablished precedent as its name suggests the procedures applicable in the house as in committee of the whole combine elements of the procedures that apply in the house and those that are followed in committee of the whole to summarize what is discussed in more detail below when standing committee begins markup the text to be considered first is to be read in full although this reading usually can be waived by majority vote the text then is considered for amendment section by section each section is read unless the reading of one or all sections is waived by unanimous consent committee members may offer amendments to each section after it is read but before the next section is read each amendment must be in writing and is to be read before debate on it begins an amendment may be withdrawn without the need for unanimous consent on the floor unanimous consent is needed unless the committee has acted on it committee members may speak on the bill and amendments under fiveminute rule meaning that each member may speak for five minutes on each amendment unless the committee votes to bring the debate to an end there are two motions available to end debate members may vote either to close the debate or to order the previous question on 1 pending amendment or 2 the entire bill after the last section of the bill has been read or considered as read however members may move only to close the debate not to order the previous question on the pending section of the bill and all amendments

lies in the fact that ordering the previous question ends the debate and precludes additional amendments while the motion to close debate does only thatit ends the debate but it does not prevent members from offering additional nondebatable amendments that otherwise are in order it should be emphasized that the rules of the house do not specifically describe these procedures and require committees to follow them however the houses standing committees typically follow these procedures during markups unless the committee agrees otherwise by unanimous consent

the committee is expected to consider at that meeting the chair also may announce that the requisite quorum of members is present the chair begins the markup itself by announcing that the committee will proceed to the consideration of the bill resolution or draft that is scheduled for consideration the chair also may note that whatever requirements for prior notification the committees rules impose have been satisfied g8g146g155g156g157g561g20g142g138g141g146g151g144g561 the committee clerk then is to read the entire text of the bill or whatever text is being considered1 however this reading usually is waived by unanimous consent when all committee members already have had an opportunity to become familiar with the text if unanimous consent cannot be obtained committee member may move to waive the first reading of bill or resolution clause 1a1b of house rule xi provides for privileged and nondebatable motion to waive this first reading in committee or subcommittee if printed

consideration he or she may entertain opening statements on the bill and the issues it raises the chair typically makes the first statement and next recognizes the ranking minority party member the chair then recognizes other members to speak alternating between the parties members usually are recognized in the order of their seniority on the committee to the extent that the party ratio permits however chairs sometimes recognize members in the order in which they arrived at the committee meeting just as chairs sometimes follow this practice in recognizing members to question witnesses at committee hearings members normally are recognized for more than five minutes each to make their opening statements though chairs may allot more time to themselves and to their ranking minority members in principle members who have been recognized may yield to colleagues or request 1 in what follows bill is used to refer to whatever text the committee is marking up til the discussion turns

do so while making opening statements than when debating amendments house rules do not provide for opening statemen ts although they are somewhat akin to the period for general debate in committee of the whole on the house floor nor do the rules of many house committees in the absence of committee rule guaranteeing members rights to make opening statements committee chairs typically reserve the right to limit the number or length of these statements in the interest of time for example it is not unusual for chair to recognize only himself or herself and the ranking minority member and then to announce that other committee members may submit their opening statements in writing and have them included in the formal record of the committees proceedings if some members insist on actually making their opening statements the chair may accommodate them committees rarely publish the transcripts of their markup meetings so opening statements that are simply submitted for the record may receive little or attention the chairs authority to permit or restrict opening statements is somewhat clearer when these statements take place before the chair actually calls up the bill for consideration which constitutes the formal beginning of the markup before the markup formally begins there is business that is before the committee at that meeting so the chair can justify exercising more discretion in recognizing members to speak after the bill has been presented and its first reading has taken place or has been waived opening statements can be construed to be debate on the bill under the fiveminute rule which the chair is better situated to constrain if he does so with the implicit consent of the committee

been completed or dispensed with the committee begins the markup process per by entertaining debating and voting on amendments throughout this process committee members often talk about how the committee is or is not amending the bill in fact the committee is not amending the bill instead it is voting on what amendments if any the committee will recommend that the house adopt when it considers the bill on the floor 2 only the house as whole meeting as the house not in committee of the whole actually has the authority to change the text of bills that members have introduced

process in committee of the whole on the house floor in committee members offer their amendments to each section of the bill in sequence unless the committee agrees otherwise by unanimous consent the chair directs the clerk to read the first section of the bill members then may propose amendments to that section but only to that section after the committee has disposed of any and all amendments to the first section or after it has been amended in its entirety the chair directs the clerk to read the second section which then is open to amendment this process is repeated until the committee has voted on the last amendment to be offered to the 2 when committee marks up the text of what will become clean bill the committee can amend that text because it is not yet the text of bill

system of giving priority consideration to amendments submitted in advance often referred to as an amendment roster except in the most contentious markups committee members do not insist that the clerk actually read each section of the bill when the chair first calls up the bill for consideration he or she often asks unanimous consent that each section of the bill be considered as having been read there usually is objection because committee members already have been provided with copies of the bill in accordance with whatever markup notice requirements are in the committees rules one reason for requiring that each section be read is to delay the proceedings it requires unanimous consent for committee to do anything but have each section read for amendment in sequence longer and more complex bills often are divided into titles and each title is subdivided into sections the largest bills even may be divided into chapters that are subdivided into titles and then into sections in such cases the chair may ask unanimous consent that the bill be open for amendment one title or one chapter at time so that members can propose amendments to any part of the title or chapter not just to one section of it at time this arrangement normally saves some time and also allows committee members to address at the same time all aspects of each title or chapter if for example committee member has an alternative for how title of the bill deals with different dimensions of the same issue the member may offer that alternative as substitute for the entire title rather than having to amend each section of the title as it is considered when the committee begins marking up shorter bill or one to which few amendments are expected the chair may ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be considered as read and open to amendment at any point in that case members can offer their amendments to any part of the bill in any order this could be confusing when members plan to offer many amendments to long and complex bill when there are few amendments to consider however opening the bill for amendment in this way can conserve time without causing confusion committees normally agree to such unanimous consent requests especially because they usually are made by the committee chair when any member objects however motion is in order to open the bill for amendment by titles chapters or at any point by the same token it is not in order for member to move to waive the reading of any section title or chapter of bill or to move that the entire bill be considered as having been read as noted earlier house rules do make in order nondebatable motion in committee to dispense with the first reading of bill at the very beginning of the markup however this rule does not make in order motion to expedite or change the process of reading the bill for amendment g17g143g143g142g155g146g151g144g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 if full committee is marking up bill that one of its subcommittees already has marked up the chair is most likely to give priority consideration to any subcommitteeapproved amendments to each section or to whatever part of the text is open to amendment to offer additional amendments to each section the chair usually first recognizes senior member of his or her party after the committee disposes of that amendment nd any amendments to it the chair normally recognizes senior member of the minority party to offer another amendment to that section thereafter the chair typically recognizes other members to offer amendments to the section in order of their seniority alternating between members of the two parties however there is nothing in house rules that requires chairs to follow these recognition practices

over the houses floor sessions the amendments that members can offer in committee are subject to essentially the same requirements that apply to amendments offered on the house floor each amendment must be germane for example and it may not propose only to amend something that already has been amended amendments also must meet certain other requirements including those of the congressional budget process the houses rules do not explicitly prohibit members from offering amendments on matters that are not within the committees jurisdiction however such amendments are quite likely to violate the germaneness requirement and chairs have refused to entertain amendments to portions of bills that were not referred to their committees the process by which members can make points of order against amendments is discussed below the four kinds of amendments that house rule xvi clause 6 makes in order on the floor also may be offered in committee these are 1 firstdegree amendment that proposes to change the text that is being marked up 2 seconddegree perfecting amendment to that amendment 3 substitute that proposes to replace the entire text of the firstdegree amendment and 4 an amendment to the substitute the same house rule also specifies the order in which members are to vote on these amendments if two or more of them have been offered an amendment in the nature of substitutethat is an amendment that proposes to replace the entire text of the bill or resolutionis in order only at the beginning or the end of the amending process sometimes the chair or member acting at his behest offers such complete substitute immediately after the first section of the bill has been opened for amendment the reason which is discussed in the next section often is tactical and has to do with the majoritys ability to conclude the markup process when it chooses to do so each amendment must be in writing with enough copies for all committee members and often for committee staff reporters and other interested observers members usually draft their amendments in advance with the assistance of the houses office of legislative counsel they are not required to do so however and members sometimes write amendments in longhand as the markup progresses committee staff usually have blank amendment forms available but members need not use them chairs and committee staff much prefer and sometimes request that members provide copies of their amendments before the markup begins however members sometimes decide that it is in their interests not to do so as soon as any amendment is offered the clerk must read it before debate on the amendment may begin typically the sponsor of the amendment asks unanimous consent that this reading be dispensed with if there is an objection the amendment must be read in full motion is in order for the committee to dispense with the reading of an amendment members may insist that an amendment be read if they are unfamiliar with it or if they simply want to protract the proceedings in the case of an amendment in the nature of substitute the reading can be time consuming however the chair may entertain point of order against an amendment even before the amendment has been read in full g6g142g139g138g157g146g151g144g561g3g150g142g151g141g150g142g151g157g156g561 each amendment is debated under the fiveminute rule much as

member may be recognized to speak for five minutes unless the committee votes to stop the debate as discussed below members who seek recognition sometimes will move to strike the last word pro forma amendment as they do on the floor in committee markups however it usually is sufficient for member to attract the chairs attention and announce that he or she wishes to speak for or against the pending amendment or even just to speak on the amendment in principle member is to be recognized to speak more than once on the same amendment after the initial 10 minutes of debate on an amendment member may seek recognition to offer an amendment to the pending amendment in recognizing members to debate amendments chairs normally follow the conventional recognition practices alternating between majority and minority party members and giving preference to members in the order of their seniority on the committee sometimes however chairs depart from these practices in favor of giving junior members equitable opportunities to participate in most committees there are green yellow and red lights or digital clocks at the witness table facing the members to indicate whether the member speaking has time remaining the member who has been recognized for five minutes may ask unanimous consent to continue for additional time while member is speaking another member may ask that member to yield if the member who controls the time agrees his or her time continues to run while the other member is speaking for example if representative white has been recognized representative black may interrupt him and ask will the gentleman yield notice that the same rules of decorum in debate apply in committee as on the floor all statements and questions are to be addressed to the chair not directly to other committee members representative white is not required to yield and may decide not to do so if for example he has much to say or he does not expect to agree with what representative black would say or if he thinks that representative blacks request is disruptive or distracting if representative white does agree to yield to representative black representative black then speaks on representative whites time representative white may not yield to his colleague for specific period of time he only has the choice of yielding or declining to do so if representative white does yield to colleague however he may reclaim his time whenever he wants if representative black is speaking or if the two members are engaged in an exchange when the chair announces that representative whites five minutes have expired representative black may ask unanimous consent that representative white be granted an additional few minutes committees sometimes permit questions to be addressed to committee staff or executive branch officials during debates on amendments the sponsor of an amendment may withdraw it w ithout the need for unanimous consent unless the committee already has amended or agreed to it on the other hand it requires unanimous consent to modify the text of pending amendment

motion to order the previous question and 2 the motion to close debate the two motions are not in order under all circumstances and they have somewhat different effects if adopted

block amendments during debate on an amendment for example member may seek recognition to move the previous question on that amendment the committee immediately votes on the motion and if it is agreed to by majority vote the committee proceeds to vote on the amendment further debate on the amendment is in order nor can members offer any amendments to it if the committee orders the previous question on an amendment while an amendment to it already is pending the committee first votes on the amendment to the amendment and then on the firstdegree amendment the previous question may be moved on pending amendment and amendments to it or it may be moved on the entire bill if the last section of the bill has been read or if the reading of the bill has been waived by unanimous consent so that the bill is open to amendment at any point member may not move the previous question on the ction title chapter of the bill that is open for amendment this protects the rights of committee members especially minority party members to offer their amendments to each part of the bill when it becomes subject to amendment thus the majority cannot necessarily control the length of markup by ordering the previous question on the bill as whole at whatever time it chooses if the committee agrees to unanimous consent request that the bill be considered as read and open to amendment at any point majority can expedite completion of the markup by agreeing to order the previous question on the bill and any pending amendments thereto if there is such unanimous consent agreement however the previous question can be used only to force votes on each amendment that is offered until the clerk has read the last section of the bill

member may move to close the debate 1 on the pending amendment and any pending amendments to it or 2 on the section title or chapter and any pending amendments to it that is open for amendment or 3 on the entire text of the bill and any pending amendments to it but only if the reading of the bill has been completed or dispensed with so one difference between the two motions is that the committee can vote to close the debate on the pending section of the bill but it may not order the previous question on it the other difference is in the effect of the two motions the motion to close debate does only that it brings debate to an end unlike the previous question the motion to close debate does not affect the rights of members to offer additional amendments the motion to close debate may take one of three forms it may propose to close the debate immediately or at certain time or after certain period of time for additional debate when committee uses this motion to close debate immediately on section for example mo re debate is in order on the section or on amendments to it members can continue to offer additional amendments to the section and

all to explain their amendments except by unanimous consent of course because of its dual effect committee members tend to move the previous question more often than they move to close debate when both motions are in order thus members are most likely to move the previous question on pending amendment or on the bill after it has been read in full or its reading has been dispensed with on the other hand members move to close the debate on pending section of the bill because motion to order the previous question on the section is not in order

majority party in committee at disadvantage that the majority party can avoid on the floor the house frequently considers major bills on the floor under the terms of special rules recommended by the rules committee that restrict the floor amendments that members are allowed to offer by this use of special rules the majority can limit the number of amendments that members can offer on the floor and permit some specific amendments to be offered while blocking consideration of others in the process the majority party can use special rules to control how long members can spend offering and debating amendments to bills in committee of the whole during committee markups on the other hand there is equivalent to the rules committee or to special rules there is procedural device by which committee majority can vote to preclude consideration of certain amendments that comply with house rules by the same token there is motion by which committee majority can vote to conclude markup until the committee has completed the process of reading the bill for amendment to put it differently the minority members of committee can insist that bill be marked up one section at time and that each section be read then they can continue to offer their amendments to each section and request rollcall votes on the amendments the committee majority may vote to close the debate on each section after it is read but doing so does not block the minority from offering more amendments to the section the motion only precludes debate on amendments after debate on the section has been closed one way in which the majority can gain more control over how long markup lasts is through the use of an amendment in the nature of substitute the committees chair or another majority party member acting for the chair sometimes offers an amendment in the nature of substitute as soon as the first section of the bill has been read this complete substitute represents the majoritys preferred version of the bill while this substitute is pending members may not offer amendments to the bill itself except to the first section this effectively blocks the minority from insisting that the bill be read for amendment by sections and from offering amendments to each section as it is read 3 after the substitute has been read and debate on it has begun the majority can order the previous question on the substitute whenever it decides to do so if the previous question is ordered on the complete substitute the committee then votes on agreeing to it without further debate or 3 in the unlikely event that the committee eventually rejects the chairs complete substitute the clerk would be directed to read the second section of the bill an d the normal amending process would resume

the committee is likely to agree to it and that vote effectively ends the amending process by agreeing to the substitute the committee thereby amends the entire text of the bill more amendments to the bill are in order therefore because any further amendments would be subject to points of order for proposing to amend something that already has been amended in this way the majority can use an amendment in the nature of substitute to give it more control over the length of markup however there are two potential disadvantages to this approach first any member can insist that the complete substitute be read in full and this can be timeconsuming process the majority cannot waive this reading by motion second the majoritys ability to use the amendment process to its advantage is limited the majoritys amendment in the nature of substitute is firstdegree amendment to which the minority can offer seconddegree perfecting amendments when minority party member offers firstdegree amendment that the majority opposes the majority can respond by defeating it or if that seems unlikely by amending it in order to make it more palatable however when the minority offers unwelcome seconddegree perfecting amendments to the majoritys complete substitute the majority can only attempt to defeat each minority amendment because seconddegree amendments cannot be amended if the committee agrees to consider an amendment in the nature of substitute as original text or as an original question for purpose of amendment then committee members can offer amendments to it in two degrees however it requires unanimous consent to treat complete substitute in this way g15g152g157g146g152g151g156g496g561g19g158g152g155g158g150g156g496g561g138g151g141g561g24g152g157g142g156g561 g15g152g157g146g152g151g156g561 in addition to offering amendments members may propose various other motions during markups the house parliamentarian has stated in his commentary on rule xi clause 2a in the house rules and manual that committees may employ the ordinary motions which are in order in the house such as motions to adjourn table postpone to day certain postpone indefinitely and reconsider chairs also regularly assert the right to declare committee meetings in recessfor example for lunch breaks and to permit members to reach the floor in time to be recorded on quorum calls and to participate in electronically recorded votes the motions to table and reconsider deserve some comment the motion to table rarely is made to dispose of amendments during committee markups because the effect of tabling an amendment is to table or kill the bill to which the amendment was offered the motion to reconsider is offered from time to time especially when members who are losing rollcall vote on an amendment for example believe that they are going to lose that vote only because one or more committee members are absent in that case member who would prefer to vote on the losing side votes instead on the winning side doing so qualifies that member to move to reconsider the vote at some time before the markup ends if majority votes for the motion to reconsider the committee then votes anew on the amendment and may reverse the outcome alternately the committee may vote to dispose of motion to reconsider by voting to table it in principle each motion like each amendment must be in writing members usually do not enforce this requirement especially in the case of routine motions such as motions to adjourn in the case of procedurally important motion however such as motion to reconsider the vote by httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30244g22g145g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142 g142g561g15g138g155g148g158g153g561g18g155g152g140g142

to the motion may insist that it be presented in written form g19g158g152g155g158g150g156g561 there are two different quorum requirements governing committee markups clause 2h1 of house rule xi requires that majority of the committees membership must actually be present when the committee votes to order measure reported to facilitate the conduct of committee markups and other meetings however house rules do not insist that majority be present for other purposes 4 for all other votes and for other proceedings during markup most committees may set their own quorum requirement in their commit tee rules so long as that quorum is not less than onethird of the committees members rule xi clause 2h3 most committees adopt onethird quorum requirement as part of their rules it is much easier in committee than on the house floor for members to insist that quorum be present on the floor member rarely can demand the presence of quorum unless vote is taking place in committee on the other hand any member whom the chair has recognized can make point of order that quorum is not present when member makes this point of order the chair counts to determine whether in fact quorum is present the chairs count is not subject to challenge or appeal if quorum is present the chair announces that fact and business resumes if quorum is not present however the chair must initiate quorum call and the necessary quorum of members must register their presence before business can resume g24g152g157g146g151g144g561 during committee meetings like during house floor sessions questions can be decided by voice division or record votes committees like the house first take voice vote on each question the chair asks those favoring the question to call out aye and then asks those opposed to call out based on what the chair hears he or she announces that the ayes or the noes appear to have it at that point any member who disa grees with the chairs announcement can demand division vote in that case the chair asks those in favor to raise their hands until counted followed by those opposed before the chair announces the final result of either voice vote or division vote any member may request that the question be decided by call of the roll the request for rollcall vote must be supported by at least onefifth of the members present although some committees adopt rules that make it even easier to obtain roll calls in fact chair may order rollcall vote on question as courtesy to any member who requests it or even in anticipation that members will request it when rollcall vote is ordered the chair directs the clerk to call the roll the clerk first calls the names of the majority party members followed by the names of the minority party members the chair may direct the clerk to call his or her name either first or last after the clerk completes calling the roll the chair normally directs the clerk to call the names of the members who failed to vote when their names were first called the clerk then is to tally the vote and at the chairs direction report the number of members voting aye and 4 there are several other actions for which quorum cons ists of majority of the committees membership these include issuing subpoenas and releasing executive session material httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30244g22g145g142g561g5g152g150g150g146g157g157g142

tally in order to allow absent members to reach the committee room and cast their votes members sometimes have two or more committee or subcommittee meetings at the same time requiring them to leave one meeting in order to come to the other when vote is taking place chairs know that their committee members want to be recorded as having voted whenever possible so they may delay announcing the result of vote when they are informed that an absent member is on his or her way to the committee room to vote when the outcome of an important vote hangs in the balance chair may leave vote open for even longer periods of time if that is likely to allow the chairs position to prevail committees can adopt committee rule allowing the chair to postpone votes although committees typically require only onethird quorum for all but the final vote in markup committee staff do their best to make sure that all the members of their party are present to be recorded on each rollcall vote the reason lies in the houses ban on proxy voting in committee before 1995 members could leave their proxies with one of their committee colleagues to cast for them this often enabled committee chair if he or she held enough proxies to win rollcall vote even when the chairs position was opposed by majority of the members who actually were present proxy voting was prohibited in 1995 the result has been to put more of premium on maximizing attendance especially when the majority party holds only few more committee seats than the minority in those circumstances the absence of only one or two majority party members can enable the minority party to prevail on partyline vote if all the minority party members are present it is very important therefore for as many members as possible to attend markups and for the committee staff of each party to know how to contact their absent members as soon as rollcall vote begins if not before committee staffs may devise systems to keep track of where their partys members are and may rely on members legislative assistants to ensure that those members are present when they are needed to make quorum or to cast their votes

the chair participates freely in the debate unlike the speaker and other members who preside over floor sessions of the house like the speaker however the chair is responsible for maintaining order

on point of order at his or her discretion members have right to debate points of order whenever the chair has heard sufficient debate he or she rules on the point of order either sustaining or overruling it the chair bases the ruling on his or her understanding of proper procedure perhaps with the advice of senior committee staff and with the benefit of whatever debate on the point of order

office of the parliamentarian in advance of committee meeting or even by telephone during the course of the meeting 5 any committee member who disagrees with the chairs ruling may challenge it by

example that an amendment is not germane to make point of order against an amendment however committee member must be alert to make it at the proper moment point of order may be made against an amendment or any other debatable motion after it has been read or the committee has waived the reading of the amendment but before debate on it has begun once the proponent of the amendment begins to explain it point of order longer can be made against the amendment the point of order would come too late this can present problem during committee markups that are conducted rather informally as they usually are often when member offers an amendment the chair responds by directing the clerk to distribute copies of it to all the members while this is being done the member offering the amendment sometimes begins to explain it by the time the other committee members receive and review copies of the amendment it is too late to make point of order against it because debate on the amendment already has begun to avoid this problem members sometimes reserve points of order against amendments as soon as they are offered and without having yet seen them in this way an amendments sponsor may explain and defend it for five minutes while other members examine it determine whether it is subject to point of order and if so decide whether they want to make that point of order after the sponsor has relinquished the floor the member who reserved the point of order may make it or withdraw the reservation and allow the debate to continue 5 committees sometimes have requested crs staff to atte

overruled on the ground that the rules of particular committee are for that committee to interpret unless they are in direct conflict with the rules of the house or unless the house rules specifically

has the authority to actually change the text of measure that has been introduced and referred to it nor do committees vote directly on the merits of bills and resolutions the committee votes instead on the amendments that it will recommend to the house the house then considers and votes on these committee amendments when it acts on the bill itself markups may begin with an amendment in the nature of substitute being offered by or on behalf of the chair sometimes for the tactical reasons discussed above members then offer their amendments to that complete substitute rather than to the text of the underlying bill in such case the final vote the committee takes on amendments is on agreeing to the amendment in the nature of substitute as it may have been amended when the committee reports the bill back to the house the bill will be accompanied by only that one amendment in the nature of substitute even though the committee may have adopted several or even many amendments to it during the

resemble the text of hr 1 as it was introduced and referred to the committee if the committee has marked up hr 1 and agreed to several different amendments to it each amendment affecting different provision of the bill the committee may vote to order hr 1 reported with those separate amendments instead though the committee may authorize the chair to incorporate those amendments into single amendment in the nature of substitute the reason for doing so is that it is more convenient for the house when considering bill on the floor to act on single committee substitute than to act on series of discrete committee amendments the committee may agree to unanimous consent request that the committee report an amendment in the nature of substitute instead of the several amendments alternatively member may offer the amendment in the nature of substitute as the last amendment to be considered during the markup in the latter case however any committee member has the right to insist that the

the markedup bill with an amendment in the nature of substitute in eith er case all the committees proposed changes in the marked up text are incorporated into sing new text then why would committee report clean bill there are at least two reasons first if the committee has marked up staff draft discussion draft chairs mark instead of hr 1 that marked up text must be introduced and reported as bill before the house can consider it second there are instances in which the committee or its chair decides to assume complete responsibility and credit for the bill it orders reported imagine for example that the committee has marked up hr 1 in ways that the original sponsor of the bill finds unacceptable in that case the sponsor may wish to disavow further responsibility for hr 1 and so welcomes the committees decision to report clean bill instead of reporting hr 1 with committee substitute in other cases the chair may prefer clean bill in order to have his or her name most closely associated with it technically the committee must have the clean bill in its possession before it can vote to order it reported this means that at the conclusion of the markup the markedup text must be prepared as bill it must be introduced while the house is in session and the newly introduced clean bill must be numbered and referred back to the committee before the committee may act on it in practice committees sometimes shortcircuit this process if one objects immediately after the committee completes its markup it may authorize the chair to report the clean bill so long as the clean bill is introduced on that same calendar day the official records of the houses proceedings do not indicate whether the clean bill actually was introduced and referred to committee before or after the committees markup ended g17g157g145g142g155g561g24g146g142g160g156g561 immediately after the committee votes to order the bill reported the ranking minority member or another minority party member usually claims the right for all committee members to submit their own supplemental minority or dissenting views for printing as part of the committees report on the bill clause 2l of rule xi provides that if at the time of approval of measure or matter by committee other than the committee on rules member of the committee gives notice of intention to file supplemental minority or additional views for inclusion in the report to the house thereon that member shall be entitled to not less than two additional calendar days after the day of such notice excluding saturdays sundays and legal holidays except when the house is in session on such day to file such views in writing and signed by that member with the clerk of the committee

marked up and ordered reported committee can adopt motion that authorizes its chair to take the actions necessary to send the bill to conference when that time comesin other words after both houses have passed different versions of the bill or another bill on the same subject for this purpose the chair may recognize majority party member to move that pursuant to clause 1 of rule xxii the

usually agrees to unanimous consent request that the house create conference committee with the senate to negotiate compromise between their differing positions on the bill if unanimous consent cannot be secured one option is to obtain special rule from the rules committee for that purpose second alternative lies in rule xxii clause 1 motion to disagree to senate amendments to house bill or resolution and to request or agree to conference with the senate or motion to insist on house amendments to senate bill or resolution and to request or agree to conference with the senate shall be privileged in the discretion of the speaker if offered by direction of the primary committee and of all reporting committees that had initial referral of the bill or resolution italics added under the terms of this rule the committee chair can make this motion on the house floor only if the committee has adopted motion authorizing him to do so and the vote in committee on this motion requires that majority of the committee actually be present just as does the vote to order the bill reported back to the house by adopting the motion to go to conference at the same meeting at which the committee has marked up the bill and voted to order it reported the committee avoids the need to schedule another meeting and assemble majority of the committees members when the time actually arrive s perhaps months later to arrange for the conference with the senate the committee must agree to such motion with respect to each bill or resolution on which it may eventually want to go to conference committees cannot give their chair the authorization required by clause 1 of rule xxii in blanket form that applies to some or all of the bills that the committee may order reported during the course
