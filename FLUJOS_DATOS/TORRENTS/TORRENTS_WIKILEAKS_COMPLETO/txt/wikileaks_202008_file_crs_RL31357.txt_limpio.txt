numerous devices updated july 22 2002 frederick m kaiser specialist in american national government government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress federal interagency coordinative mechanisms varied types and numerous devices summary interagency coordinative mechanisms at the federal level have become more prominent and prevalent recently the office of homeland security ohs and the companion homeland security council hsc along with proposals for change are the most visible other examples not only include such wellknown entities as the national security council nsc and the socalled drug czar but also extend to multiplicity of nearly anonymous working groups and task forces some of them have short life spans while others have remained in place for long periods seven different types of interagency coordinators are described here they cross broad spectrum of categories and cover large number and wide variety of specific mechanisms and arrangements established by public law executive orders administrative directives and other legal instruments councils chaired by the president and consisting of the vice president and the heads of certain departments and agencies with the nsc hsc and the usa freedom corps council being the only three committees whose members are department and agency heads including ones connected to the nsc and to the hsc specially created offices and positions especially the offices of homeland security national drug control policy and usa freedom corps along with their directors specified agency heads and other officersnotably the director of central intelligence director of the secret service and inspectors generalwith qualified authority to enlist the assistance of organizations outside their own establishments subcabinet boards committees and councils such as those associated with inspectors general and with chief financial officers transfers of personnel and resources among new or existing entities by way of operational task forces working groups staff details and redeployments and transfers of authority between and among agencies through crossdesignation and special deputation of

deputation 32 concluding observations 32 federal interagency coordinative mechanisms varied types and numerous devices introduction federal interagency coordinative mechanisms are executive entities possessing their own statutory or other establishing authority that provide coordination in policy areas involving number of separate independent agencies1 the devices and arrangements which have proliferated and gained prominence recently range from the office of homeland security ohs to the national security council nsc the drug czar and multiplicity of joint operational task forces these entities numbering in the hundreds2 can be categorized among seven different types which vary in significant ways they raise competing rationales and objections have been established and have evolved for different reasons and in different time periods and 1 this review covers only formal entities created by public law executive order administrative directive or other specific legal authority it does not include departments and agencies even though these may have been created by statute in part to coordinate broad policy area and combine related agencies the study also excludes informal organizational arrangements such as the presidents cabinet 2 there is authoritative comprehensive count of interagency mechanisms in part because of the difficulty in locating them throughout the government and in part because of changes in their number especially for working groups and task forces over time nonetheless the total is likely is be high largely because of the sheer magnitude of crosscutting and overlapping programs and the contemporary reliance on such coordinative devices especially at the operational and working group level along these lines the comptroller general head of the general accounting office gao has noted that virtually all of the results that the federal government strives to achieve require the concerted and coordinated efforts of two or more agencies even though he emphasized coordination problems in several major policy areas us general accounting office managing for results using gpra to help congressional decisionmaking and strengthen oversight statement of david m walker comptroller general gao report tggd0095 washington gao 2000 p 19 reinforcing this perception of large number of interagency coordinators 1997 gao report listed 34 federal program areas with multiple agency involvement including border inspection food safety and student aid it is possible that mechanisms have been developed to coordinate activities among agencies in many of these areas us general accounting office managing for results using the results act to address mission fragmentation and program overlap gao report aimd 97146 washington gao 1997 substantiating the likelihood of large number of interagency mechanisms is the fact that just two agencies have produced more than 100 coordinative entities or arrangements the federal emergency management agency fema alone has formed nearly 70 interagency partnerships and each of the 17 national security council policy coordination committees can establish interagency working groups to assist it crs2 differ in terms of their jurisdiction authority responsibilities membership leadership and governmental location this report and other related crs and congressional documents3 provide information on examinations of and preliminary comparisons among federal interagency coordinative devices4 rationales and objections number of rationales for and objections to interagency coordinative mechanisms might be offered rationales the fundamental rationale for such mechanisms is to provide basis for coordination among federal entities located in different departments or agencies that share responsibilities and jurisdictions in policy area5 this need is seen as more 3 for information and analyses of relevant entities and proposals for change in selected areas see crs terrorism electronic

attorneys and us marshals service in the transportation continued crs3 important and immediate in the contemporary era than in the past6 because of changed conditions and governmental characteristics

national security and environmental quality the growth in the number of 5 continued department the coast guard and in the treasury department the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms customs service and internal revenue service besides these units other organizations have performed roles in drug interdiction efforts the military services and national guard units for example provide surveillance for law enforcement efforts assist in operations on the high seas navy support border patrol operations and enforce antinarcotics laws within their own organizations and the central intelligence

efforts to improve interagency coordination either through mergers and consolidations of units or through various coordinative devices most ambitious along these lines was the creation of new national security establishment in the aftermath of wwii and early phase of the cold war this occurred with passage of the national security act of 1947 50 usc 401 et seq resulting in several new or reconstituted agencies the department of defense which consolidated the existing military services along with the new air force the national security council the central intelligence agency and the director of central intelligence other interagency coordinative concerns both major and minor have been addressed in the past by congress and the executive as well as by private organizations see for example us congress senate committee on government operations subcommittee on reorganization and international organizations interagency coordination in environmental hazards hearings 88th cong 1st

1944 seminal study of executive organization and the possible need for reorganization and realignment was conducted by the brookings institution under the auspices of the byrd committee in 19361937 the senate panel was charged by its parent chamber with making full and complete study of all the activities of all agencies of the executive branch of government with view to determining whether the activities of any such agency conflict with or overlap the activities of any other agency and whether in the interest of simplification efficiency and economy any of such agencies should be coordinated with other agencies or abolished or the personnel thereof reduced sres 217 74th congress the result was comprehensive report of more than 500000 words covering virtually all aspects activities and agencies of the executive us congress senate select committee to investigate the executive agencies of the government investigation of executive agencies of the government senate report 1275 75th cong 1st sess washington gpo 1937 crs4 separate federal entities involved in policymaking and policy implementation the resulting overlap of jurisdiction sharing of responsibilities and fragmentation of policymaking among agencies and the establishment of new policy priorities that cross older policy lines and institutional boundaries7 the support for new coordinative mechanisms also results from the inability to achieve or delay in achieving more fundamental changes such as major reorganizations8 consequently interagency entities are at least possible if not ideal alternative to such other transformations and because creating interagency coordinative mechanisms is less difficult than completing major reorganizations the coordinative devices could be modified replaced or abolished more easily than new departments or agencies if policy priorities political demands and societal conditions change the development and implementation of public policies arguably are expected to benefit from formalized coordination mechanisms both to eliminate or limit dysfunctions and to provide support structure for enhanced effectiveness ideally these coordinating devices should help minimize or mitigate the impact of rivalry among the entities duplication of effort avoidance of responsibility and working at crosspurposes they should also help improve policy effectiveness in number of ways these include increases or suggested improvements in various areas the availability and concentration of resources for priority policies cooperation among the involved units which would be working on behalf of common purpose and at the behest of common leader integration of distinct but reinforcing responsibilities and overlapping jurisdictions among relatively autonomous agencies recognition of responsibility and credit or blame for particular activities and operations and accountability of the various components by consolidating review and reporting requirements objections objections to such devices might also be raised in several areas 7 implementation of the government performance and results act of 1993 pl 10362 107 stat 285296 among other developments has brought renewed attention to the overlap and fragmentation of the many crosscutting programs see us general accounting office using gpra to help pp 1921 managing for results barriers to interagency

and us congress senate committee on appropriations special report on the government performance and results act of 1993 srept 106347 106th cong 2nd sess washington gpo 2000 pp 9094 8 for instance proposals to create new department of homeland security dhsincorporating all or parts of numerous agencies that have relevant responsibilitieshave been on the drawing board since october 2001 even if such new establishment replacing the office of homeland security were constructed various devices and powers would be necessary to ensure coordination between the new department and continuing agencies with related responsibilities and jurisdictions proposals along this line are discussed below crs5 first interagency coordinative entities might be seen as adding another layer of bureaucracy to policy area thereby increasing costs and introducing new inefficiencies and organizational rivalries rather than reducing them the genesis of some interagency coordinative devices is the establishment of new policy priorities yet these new mandates might have only temporary appeal while the new mechanisms could survive indefinitely as corollary the coordinative device may itself become an entrenched entity thereby increasing future costs and difficulties in realigning relevant functions duties and responsibilities interagency coordinative mechanisms might also be criticized from two competing viewpoints as being too weak or too strong some entities might be faulted for not being given enough power to accomplish their purposes their extent of authority range of jurisdiction and breadth of responsibilities may not be sufficient to provide meaningful coordination and forced cooperation among number of separate agencies because of the devices establishment expectations are raised but because of its weaknesses the expectations may remain unmet this in turn could result in loss of credibility for the interagency operation and support for the policy along these same lines critics might contend that new interagency coordinative devices might function only as half measures what is needed opponents might say is more complete wideranging reorganization this could include for instance transferring related components from various departments or agencies into an existing agency or merging these interrelated entities into an entirely new agency which would consolidate responsibility for carrying out policy by contrast other interagency entities might be accused of possessing too much power thereby interfering with the responsibilities of department and agency heads for instance an interagency office with formal or informal power over the budgets and spending plans of outside units could conceivably undercut the priorities and operations of these constituent agencies and their parent agencies this action in turn could erode the effectiveness of the parent agency and reduce its responsibility for carrying out its other missions variations interagency coordinative entities lack standardization and uniformity consequently particular device is an identical match for another they differ from each other in number of ways location leadership and membership characteristics enabling authority and permanency and powers responsibilities and jurisdictions location leadership and membership significant variations exist among these units in their location leadership and membership characteristics for instance while several of these mechanisms are integral parts of an agency heads office and powers others exist independently crs6 consisting of representatives from number of agencies and headed by chairperson designated in the establishing authority the positions and level of officials that make up the memberships also differ three entities ie the nsc hsc and usa freedom corps council consist of the president and vice president along with specified agency heads while others are made up of department and agency heads along with officials from the executive office of the president in some cases others by comparison are composed of sub cabinet officials such as deputy directors deputy or assistant secretaries and senior officials from various agencies and the eop still others especially working groups and operational task forces consist of personnel from relevant agencies selected by higher echelon agency official or an interagency unit several officers including the director of central intelligence dci and the director of the secret service moreover possess authority to direct the activities and operations of other agencies and one ie the dci has express authority to review approve and change their budgets and spending plans by contrast other coordinative devices lack these explicit substantial powers instead relying on their authority to review and reportto the president congress other agencies and the publicon relevant activities and operations or in the case of working groups and task forces carrying out the policies and projects assigned by higher level officers enabling authority and permanency the devices also differ in enabling authority and permanency some are permanent entities created by public law or executive order while others such as those set up by presidential directive have been subject to change abolition or replacement still others are intended to be ad hoc temporary structures such as interagency working groups brought together by supervising unit or official through administrative directives or orders or jointly by memoranda of agreement moas or memoranda of understanding mous powers responsibilities and jurisdictions the extent of powers breadth of responsibilities and range of jurisdictions of these organizations and arrangementsderived from public laws executive orders presidential directives administrative orders or mousalso differ for some entities responsibilities are specialized affecting narrow scope of activities powers are few and qualified and jurisdictions are circumscribed for others by contrast responsibilities are expansive powers are many and jurisdictions are wide creation and evolution finally such coordinative mechanisms have been established modified over time abolished outright or merged with other units these actions have occurred in response to changes in societal conditions political needs and demands elected and appointed officials and public policy priorities as well as perceptions of the mechanisms effectiveness crs7 types of coordinative devices the combination of these characteristicsdifferent attributes establishments and evolution and rationales along with compromises to meet certain objectionshas produced variety of coordinative mechanisms and arrangements specific examples are described in the next section seven broad types are distinguished here 1 councils consisting of the president who is the chairman the vice president and specified department andor agency heads with only three in existence the national security council created by public law in 1947 and the homeland security council and the usa freedom corps council each created by executive order in 2001 and 2002 respectively 2 committees made up of department and agency heads along with in some cases officials from the executive office of the president eop including the interagency task force to monitor and combat trafficking in people the principals committees of the nsc and hsc the presidents critical infrastructure protection board and its predecessor the critical infrastructure protection group 3 specially created positions or offices with their own authority and resources to cover policy area that crosses number of separate and independent agencies eg council on environmental quality and the directors of the offices of national drug control policy of homeland security and of usa freedom corps 4 agency heads or other officers with qualified authority over other entities particularly the director of central intelligence the director of the secret service and inspectors general who can enlist the assistance of or task other organizations in carrying out specific duties and assignments 5 subcabinet boards committees and councils such as the nsc and hsc deputies committees two inspector general coordinating councils and the chief financial officers coordinating council 6 transfers of personnel resources or units among new or existing entities by setting up interagency partnerships joint operational task forces and field working groups by transferring specific units for temporary duty and by detailing and redeploying staff these are illustrated by host of arrangements and mechanisms us coast guard transfer to the navy in times of war or other emergencies use of military personnel and resources in law enforcement efforts femas multiplicity of partnerships the secret services membership in nearly 50 working groups nscs ad hoc working groups hscs policy coordination committees various antiterrorism support teams and cybersecurity operational centers and inspector general council committees as well as numerous staff details for particular operations and redeployments to meet crisis situations crs8 7 transfers of authority between and among agencies principally through the crossdesignation of agents from one agency to another with shared jurisdiction and related responsibilities such as the customs service and immigration and naturalization service for border control and through special deputation by the us marshals service for personnel without their own law enforcement authority such as criminal investigators in some offices of inspector general examples of coordinative mechanisms examples of federal

assistant and to the extent permitted by law the heads of continued crs9 office of homeland security and director the new office and its directorformally titled the assistant to the president for homeland securityhave an exceedingly high profile and visibility in light of the unique circumstances surrounding their origin and early development these include their creation following the unprecedented terrorist assaults within the united states on september 11 which resulted in an unequaled loss of life destruction of property and adverse effects on the economy within the united states in concerted singleday attack the power of the office and director is also enhanced by the overriding priority of the mission to secure the united states against terrorist attacks and threats and their lead role domestically in the war on terrorism as the president has referred to it other important features attend the office its establishment by the president who announced this initiative in an address to rare joint session of congress which was broadcast to the nation its placement in the executive office of the president eop the cabinetlevel status of its director and perhaps most important the close relationship between the first incumbent and the president12 in addition the ohs director is in position to guide the presidents homeland security advisory council and senior advisory committees be aided by its authority operating through him to acquire relevant information from executive agencies and benefit from its findings conclusions and recommendations consequently the council and its committees can be source of influence for the director even before the offices establishment significant changes in homeland security organization structure and capacity had already been advocated by several governmental commissions and the general accounting office gao as well as 11 continued executive departments and agencies shall provide the phsac with such

organizations13 although their specific proposals differed sometimes significantly these studies and recommendations laid the groundwork for new coordinative function among other functions the ohs is to coordinate the executive branchs efforts to detect prepare for prevent protect against respond to and recover from terrorist attacks within the united states14 in performing this function and attendant duties the office possesses lengthy set of responsibilities connected with coordinating the governments response to terrorism all of which cross broad spectrum of agencies wide range of programs and an array of activities the homeland security office is given some albeit limited budget review authority in consultation with the director of the office of management and budget omb and the heads of departments and agencies the chief of the homeland security office shall identify programs that contribute to the administrations strategy for homeland security and in the development of the presidents annual budget submission shall review and provide advice to the heads of the departments and agencies for such programs15 eo 13228 sec 3 along with this function the new chief is to advise omb as to the adequacy of the agency budgets and certify that the funding levels are appropriate and necessary the director however does not hold formal veto or approval powers over these budget plans does not have funds directly at his disposal to grant to agencies and cannot transfer funds among agencies all of which would require new statutory authority the ohs director moreover is not confirmed by the senate and has relatively small staff estimated to reach about 100 relying largely on details from constituent departments and agencies and because the office was created by executive order rather than by public law its jurisdiction is confined to the executive branch thereby not encompassing such organizations as the us postal service and various independent regulatory

administrations proposals affecting public policy or reorganization the chairman and ranking minority member of the senate appropriations committee inviting the director to testify before the

congress are necessary and appropriate for the homeland security related activities of the executive branch your views and insights on the policies necessary to meet these objectives for homeland security are critical to the committee and the nation16 the administration has declined to send the director president bush responding to reporters question about this matter said he doesnt have to testify hes part of my staff and thats part of the prerogative of the executive branch of government and we hold that very dear17 the director reiterated this stand which would avoid the setting of precedent that could undermine the separation of powers18 he added that he on 35 occasions and his staff an additional 100 times have met informally with legislators the director also offered to participate in public briefing in which senators and members of congress present would have the opportunity to ask questions of and of those officers charged with operational authority for homeland

1865 at the end of the civil war to conduct anticounterfeiting operations in the late 19th century the service acquired responsibility for protecting the president and since then has assumed many other protective assignments recently moreover the secret service has been charged with being the lead agency for security arrangements at special events of national significance and for developing national network of electronic crime task forces to meet these responsibilities the usss and its director have been given statutory authority to call upon other federal entities and sometimes others to assist in carrying out specific duties and assignments protective assignments the presidential protection assistance act of 1976 provides that executive departments and executive agencies shall assist the secret service in the performance of its duties by providing services equipment and facilities on temporary and reimbursable basis when requested by the director and on permanent and reimbursable basis upon advance written request of the director except that the department of defense and the coast guard shall provide such assistance on temporary basis without reimbursement when assisting the secret service in its duties directly related to the protection of the president or the vice president or other officer immediately next in order of succession to the office of the president60 although the statutory language was new at the time the ability of the secret service to secure the assistance of other agenciesparticularly when its protective duties and assignments increased markedly as in presidential election yearswas not61 in fact principal reason for the 1976 change was not lack of support from other organizations instead the immediate catalyst was the absence of adequate controls over and accountability for security arrangements and expenditures at 60 pl 94524 codified at 18 usc 3056 2000 61 even in its formative years secret service protection of the president involved other agencies and required coordination among them the assassination of president william mckinley in 1901 for instance occurred at an international exposition where he and other dignitaries were guarded by nearly 100 members of various federal including three secret service agents state and local forces afterwards security was heightened and regularized with the secret service serving as the lead agency and conducting surveillance intelligence gathering and investigations as well as bodyguard operations the service was assisted at the time principally by the post office department which tracked threatening letters and undertook advance security work at cities where the president would visit and by the washington police force which provided guards for official outings in the district and contacted local law enforcement authorities elsewhere about precautionary measures concerning presidential travel military units participated at formal ceremonies and on other special occasions as they had historically all of this was coordinated at the time in the white house by george b cortelyou president theodore roosevelts personal secretary who in effect served

agencies and that the buck stopped with the director security at special events of national significance at the end of the th 20 century the secret service was given clarified authority connected with its protective assignments and security responsibilities in the presidential threat protection act of 200063 one provision extends its statutory duties the secret service when directed by the president and under the supervision of the secretary of the treasury is to participate in the planning coordination and implementation of security operations at special events of national significance

of director of the office of national drug control policy ondcpestablished by the national narcotics leadership act of 1988is primarily one of coordinating federal state and local efforts to control illegal drug abuse and devising national strategy to carry out antidrug activities65 the informal title of drug czar is misleading however because the director has neither the extensive legal authority nor autocratic power implied in the notion of czar the post for instance lacks formal powers to assign specific tasks to agencies or direct them to carry out certain responsibilities under the antidrug strategy devised by the director furthermore the office does not hold specific statutory authority to approve or change the budgets of the agencies involved or to override their spending plans although the director is authorized to review and comment on them and in so doing may hold an informal veto or clearance power despite these limitations the director heads an office with important bases for support and coordination among the constituent agencies the office is strategically placedin the executive office of the president which provides ondcp with high visibility and an advantageous location to carry out its crossagency mandates its head is presidential appointee subject to senate confirmation thereby giving the director higher status and visibility than he or she

presidential appointees subject to senate confirmation and who head offices in the cabinet departments and larger federal agencies and the executive council on integrity and efficiency ecie consisting of the igs who are appointed by agency heads and who direct offices in the usually smaller boards foundations and government corporations73 other members of these councils include the deputy director for management of the office of management and budget who chairs both the pcie and ecie the associate deputy director for investigations of the federal bureau of investigation the controller of the office of federal financial management the director of the office of government ethics the special counsel of the office of special counsel and the deputy director of the office of personnel management among their functions the councils shall continually identify review and discuss areas of weakness and vulnerability in federal programs and operations to fraud waste and abuse and shall

five separate agencies82 femaan independent agency in the executive branch headed by director who is presidential appointee subject to senate confirmationfunds emergency programs offers technical guidance and training and deploys federal resources in times of catastrophic disaster to carry out its responsibilities and programs many of which involve cross cutting activities with other agencies fema has developed numerous cooperative agreements with other relevant agencies83 the nearly 70 resulting partnerships consist of variety of interagency task forces coordination groups centers committees and other arrangements each includes anywhere from two to 27 different agencies84 us coast guardnavy relationships another type of transferhighly unusual and rarely used authorityaffects the us coast guard and its affiliation with the navy upon declaration of war or when the president directs the coast guard shall operate as service in the navy and shall so continue until the president by executive order transfers the coast guard back to the department of transportation85 the relationship between the two maritime organizations is reversed under different statutory authority and for different purposes coast guard personnel trained in law enforcement can be assigned to naval vessels at sea in order to perform law enforcement operations86 this provision in effect authorizes navy assistance to the coast guard in its drug interdiction efforts transfers of personnel and resources another type of coordinative arrangement is manifested in the temporary transfer of personnel from one department or agency to an existing or new organization such changes usually occur through setting up task forces and working groups and through detailing and redeploying staff to other agencies these efforts are instituted under wide range of authority public laws executive orders 82 us president jimmy carter executive order 12127 of march 31 1979 based on authority granted in

are confined to specialized jurisdictions are mostly ad hoc constructions designed to meet particular assignment or duty and are usually shortterm in duration although several ie the attorney generals fugitive apprehension task forces the secret services electronic crime task forces and the fbis national infrastructure protection center have been granted longterm status by statute or other enabling authority joint operational task forces and working groups operational task forces and working groups are ad hoc constructs with narrow jurisdictions and specialized duties they bring together personnel from number of agencies with shared responsibility in policy area into new organizational arrangement task forces and working groups are designed to meet operational needs in executing policies or to provide support to other offices in carrying out their responsibilities this involves transferring personnel from different agencies that have shared responsibilities and overlapping jurisdictions for example organized crime drug enforcement task forces were established to deal with multinational or multistate organized criminal enterprises involving highlevel drug trafficking operations including money laundering87 their membership has included the us attorneys the justice department criminal and tax divisions and eight other federal agencies federal bureau of investigation drug enforcement administration us marshals service immigration and naturalization service coast guard customs service internal revenue service and bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms by comparison some coordinative task forces and working groups have achieved longterm if not permanent status and relatively broad jurisdiction as noted before the secret service electronic crime task force operating in new york for instance covers wide range of relevant criminal conduct and the number of participants in the task force is large approximately 250 members representing many federal agencies eg fbi sec and customs service state and local government entities and private businesses and organizations other illustrations noted above include interagency working groups created to assist the national security council policy coordination committees various anti terrorism emergency support teams along with strategic information and operations centers such as the national infrastructure protection center the many working groups and task forces of which the secret service is member and the numerous interagency partnerships developed by the federal emergency management agency staff details and redeployments the transfer of personnel from one agency to another either by staff details or redeployments illustrates set of still different coordinative arrangements transferring staff for particular assignment is intended in part to improve effectiveness in carrying out policy by enhancing interagency cooperation and operational capacity although usually limited

federal drug control programs on the southwest border briefing book washington ondcp 1997 p 38 crs31 duration jurisdiction and number of personnel detail is expected to add capabilities resources and expertise to an operation or project under the direction of another agency the detail might also benefit interagency coordination beyond the immediate involvement in project as staff develop contacts with counterparts in other agencies and gain experience and familiarity with other organizations their operations activities and cultures several officials notably the director of central intelligence and the director of ondcp hold permanent authority to detail staff among relevant agencies in other cases redeployments may occur in response to crisis or emergency situation in the aftermath of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks for instance personnel from offices of inspector general in various agencies and from the interior department were redeployed to the transportation department to assist with airline security matters over the past two decades moreover amendments to the posse comitatus act of 1878 18 usc 1385 which restricts the use of the military in law enforcement operations have allowed for military assistance at the request of federal law enforcement agencies this participation includes the detection monitoring and communication of movement of air and sea traffic outside the united states aerial reconnaissance interception of vessels and aircraft outside us borders and transportation of civilian law enforcement personnel88 transfers of authority final set of examples of arrangements that involve interagency coordination are crossdesignating agents and deputizing personnel to hold certain law enforcement powers crossdesignation crossdesignating agents involves the transfer of authority from one agency to personnel in another crossdesignation allows agents of one unit to perform the duties and use the authority of another agency with overlapping jurisdiction or responsibilities one illustration involves the us customs service in the treasury department and the immigration and naturalization service border patrol in the justice department each of whose agents may be authorized to carry out the duties and use the powers of the other this transfer of authority can result in inspections at ports of entry being conducted by single agency rather than both or at least in allowing one to be the primary inspector and the other the secondary it can also result in initial searches for contraband in between such ports being conducted by the border patrol instead of being shared with customs which could be called to the scene if the situation warranted for followup operations 88 18 usc 372 for military services in general and 10 usc 379 2000 ed

95964 by charles doyle and us military participation in southwest border drug control crs report 98767 by nina m serafino crs32 special deputation final interagency coordinative arrangement involves special deputation by the united states marshals service for personnel in other federal departments or agencies and from state and local governments as well as the private sector89 this power has been used historically to expand the capacity and capabilities of us marshals deputizing personnel from other federal agencies or elsewhere allows marshal to use these recruits to assist in the performance of his or her law enforcement duties on an ad hoc temporary basis and under the marshals supervision different reason for special deputation also exists to grant police powers to other federal agencies which lack them so that they can enforce laws under their jurisdiction independently for specific operation or for specified duration this design permits personnel outside the justice department criminal investigators in offices of inspector general for instance to carry firearms make arrests and execute warrants90 with these powers the recipients can conduct law enforcement operations on their own rather than relying on other federal state or local officers to do so while this kind of special deputation allows the receiving entity to operate in the field alone the recipients must have the approval of the marshals service to acquire the police powers in the first place and again later on if they want to renew the authority as an outgrowth of this the initial grant along with its use and renewal gives the marshals service opportunity to track the operations of the deputized personnel coordinate them with its own projects if they overlap and assess the performance and results concluding observations federal interagency coordinative mechanisms have become prevalent and prominent recently as means of fostering cooperation and support among government agencies they range from such wellestablished entities as the national security council to the office of homeland security and from such highly visible devices as the drug czar to nearly anonymous joint task forces and field working groups now numbering in the hundreds the devices can be categorized among seven distinct types these differ in terms of their location and membership powers and responsibilities enabling authority and permanency and establishment and evolution their contemporary growth in quantity and importance has occurred for variety of reasons among these are the expansion of federal responsibilities both foreign and domestic additions in the number and types of government organizations 89 justice department regulations for special deputation are at 28 cfr

implementing policy increases in the complexity and interrelated nature of public policies and changes in policy priorities these developments have resulted in higher incidence of shared responsibilities overlapping jurisdictions crosscutting programs and fragmentation of policy implementation among agencies interagency devices are viewed as way of overcoming these obstacles to cooperation and coordination among entities and thereby improving the effectiveness and efficiency of policy implementation this can be accomplished moreover in relatively quick and straightforward fashion by comparison to broad scale reorganizations such as mergers and transfers of separate agencies different coordinative models moreover can be adopted or adapted for different purposes and under different circumstances nonetheless some coordinative devices have aroused concerns about their impact and implications certain devices have been viewed as setting up another bureaucratic layer and potentially rival organization as being too weak to meet their mandates or alternately as being too strong thus interfering with other responsibilities of agencies under the coordinators jurisdiction finally in cases where executive orders and presidential directives govern the devices their creation and control can circumvent the legislative process and present problems for congressional oversight for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31357
