v bush that us courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges on behalf of persons detained at the us naval station in guantanamo bay cuba in connection with the war against terrorism the court overturned ruling that us court has jurisdiction to hear petitions for habeas corpus on behalf of the detainees because they are aliens detained abroad but left questions involving prisoners rights and status unanswered the 911 commission recommended common coalition approach to such detention congress enacted the detainee treatment act of 2005 dta pl 109148 to establish standards for interrogation and to deny detainees access to federal courts to file habeas petitions but allow limited appeals of status determinations and fina l decisions of military commissions congress approved the military commissions act of 2006 mca pl 109366 to authorize military commissions for the prosecution of detainees for war crimes the bush administration earlier deemed all of th detainees to be unlawful combatants who may according to administration officials be held indefinitely without trial or even if they are acquitted by military tribunal fifteen of the detainees were designated as subject to the presidents military order of november 13 2001 making them eligible for trial by military commission in answer to the rasul decision the pentagon instituted combatant status review tribunals to provide forum for detainees to challenge their status as enemy combatants the pentagon had earlier announced plan for annual reviews to determine whether detainees may be released without endangering national security the presidents decision to deny the detainees prisonerofwar pow status remains point of contention in particular with respect to members of the taliban with some arguing that it is based on an inaccurate interpretation of the geneva convention for the treatment of prisoners of war gpw which they assert requires that all combatants captured on the battlefield are entitled to be treated as pows until an independent trib unal has determined otherwise the publication of executive branch memoranda documenting the internal debate about the status of prisoners evoked additional criticism of the bush administrations legal position finally the supreme courts decision in hamdan v rumsfeld determined that persons captured in afghanistan in connection with the global war on terrorism are entitled at least to the minimum set of protections accorded by common article 3 of the 1949 geneva conventions this report provides an overview of the law of war and the historical treatment of wartime detainees in particular the us practice describes how the detainees status might affect their rights and treatment and summarizes activity of the 108 th and 109th

g343g561g4g138g140g148g144g155g152g158g151g141g561 the us supreme court decided at the end of its 20032004 term that us courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges on behalf the approximately 550 persons who were detained at the us naval station in guantanamo bay cuba in connection with the war against terrorism1 the decision overturned the holding of the court of appeals for the dc circuit which had accepted the administrations argument that us court has jurisdiction to hear petitions for habeas corpus by or on behalf of the detainees because they are aliens and are detained outside the sovereign territory of the united states2 in response to the courts ruling the department of defense dod instituted new form of tribunal at guantanamo bay to allow detainees an opportunity to contest their designation as enemy combatants similar to the planned administrative review procedure dod had announced that would review the necessity of individuals continued detention 3 congress approved the detainee treatment act of 2005 dta or grahamlevin amendment to establish standards for interrogation and to deny detainees access to federal courts to file habeas petitions but allow limited appeals of status determinations and final decisions of military commissions in the dc circuit court of appeals4 more than hundred petitions for habeas corpus were already pending in the dc circuit in the case of accused driver and bodyguard for osama bin laden salim ahmed hamdan federal judge held the petitioners ongoing trial by military commission to be illegal leading the government to suspend temporarily the operation of military tribunals the dc circuit court of ppeals overturned that decision allowing dod to restart the military commissions but the supreme court granted certiorari and reversed5 two other district judges issued contradictory opinions as to whether the detainees have any rights enforceable in federal court these decisions also have been appealed6 the administration has filed motions either to dismiss all of these petitions on the basis that the dta has curtailed the courts jurisdiction or to convert the cases to appeals subject to the strictures of that act the supreme court rejected the governments argument that the hamdan case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to the dta congress responded by passing the military commissions act of 2006 which in addition to providing explicit authority for military commissions cuts off jurisdiction to hear all habeas cases and other legal actions brought by aliens in relation to their detention as unlawful enemy combatants including such cases that are currently pending 7 1 rasul v bush 542 us 466 2004 for summary of rasul and related cases see crs report rs21884 the supreme court 2003 term

and treatment of the suspected enemy combatants at guantánamo bay has been consistent source of friction for the bush administration since it began transporting prisoners there in january 2002 after criticism from human rights organizations and many foreign governments regarding the determination that the geneva conventions of 1949 do not apply to the detainees there8 president bush shifted position with an announcement that taliban fighters are covered by the 1949 geneva conventions while qaeda fighters are not9 taliban fighters are not however treated as prisoners of war pow because they reportedly fail to meet international standards as lawful combatants10 the president had determined that qaeda remains outside the geneva conventions because it is not state and not party to the treaty11 the president proclaimed in previously secret memorandum that was issued february 7 2002 that as matter of policy the united states armed forces shall continue to treat detainees humanely and to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity in manner consistent with the principles of geneva 12 the bush administration deems all of the detain ees to be unlawful combatants who may according to administration officials be held indefinitely without trial or even despite their possible acquittal by military tribunal the 911 commission apparently finding the international discord over the treatment and status of the detainees to be harmful to the us effort to thwart terrorism recommended the development of common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists 13 after the hamdan decision was announced the department of defense issued memorandum announcing that qaeda detainees were to be considered to be covered by the protections of common article 3 and that dod regulations pertinent to detainee operations other than those pertaining to military commissions were understood to comply with common article 314 subordinate departments were requested to review directives and regulations to ensure such compliance 8 see brian knowlton powell and bush split on detainees status pplicability of geneva conventions

station in guantánamo bay cuba16 and approximately 85 detainees have been deemed eligible for transfer the supreme courts hamdan decision and congress approval of the detainee treatment act of 2005 and the military commissions act of 2006 mca may have largely resolved the issue of detainees legal status however the treatment of detainees who remain in custody c ontinues to be source of contention with human rights groups some critics contend that the amendments to the war crimes act effectively permit harsh treatment that falls below the international standard 17 the administrative proceedings implemented to review the status of detainees called the combatant status review tribunal csrt18 appear designed to satisfy the supreme courts hamdi ruling although the government has argued in court that the guantánamo detainees as aliens detained outside the territory of the united states are not entitled to any process beyond the initial screening process used to determine whether detainees should be sent to guantánamo although congress has not authorized or required csrt proceedings it has likely ratified their use by providing in the mca definition of unlawful enemy combatant that includes persons who have been determined to be such by these tribunals and by providing for the limited review of csrt determinations in federal court critics view the csrt proceedings as insufficient to satisfy hamdi which many believe applies to all detainees regardless of citizenship and place of detention 19 csrts were completed for all detainees20 and confirmed the status of 520 enemy combatants thirtyeight detainees were determined by csrts not to be enemy combatants the first round of administrative review boards arbs resulted in decisions to release 14 detainees to

qaeda and the taliban they do not expressly explain the application of the gpw to the taliban whose members would arguably seem to be eligible for pow status as members of the armed forces of afghanistan under plain reading of gpw art 4a143 but suggest the view that the four criteria in gpw art 4a2 apply to regular armed forces as matter of customary international law44 the documents also suggest that afghanistan as failed state did not have functional government with sufficient control over the territory and citizenry to enable it to field regular army45 it is unclear why under this view the conflict with the taliban would continue to qualify as an international war under gpw art 246 such that art 4 would remain relevant state practice does not appear to support the conclusion that the armed forces of states or organized rebel forces have been categorically denied eligibility for pow status on the basis that the army did not comply completely with the law of war47 indeed us practice has been to accord pow status generously to irregulars48 to support such status for irregular forces at times49 and to raise objections whenever an adversary has sought to deny us personnel pow status based on general accusation that the us forces were not in compliance with some aspect of the law of war50 the administration also asserted that the geneva conventions are obsolete when it comes to dealing with terrorists51 but that it would continue to follow the treaties principles52 43 see memorandum from office of legal counsel to alberto gonzales re status of taliban forces under

as militia rather than the armed forces of afghanistan 44 see id ambassadoratlarge for war crimes issues pi errerichard prosper confirmed this view in reviewing the new challenge of the war against terrorism we have concluded that the geneva conventions do apply to the taliban leaders who sponsored terrorism but careful analysis through the lens of the geneva convention leads us to the conclusion that the taliban detainees do not meet the legal criteria under article 4 of the convention which would have entitled them to pow status they are not under responsible command they do not conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war they do not have fixed distinctive sign recognizable from distance and they do not carry their arms openly their conduct and history of attacking civilian populations disregarding hum an life and conventional norms and promoting barbaric philosophies represents firm proof of their denied status but regardless of their

centuries of efforts to mitigate the harmful effects of war recognizing the impossibility of eliminating warfare all together nations in essence have agreed to abide by rules limiting their conduct in war in return for the enemys agreement to abide by the same rules 55 there are two branches of the law of war the older of the two branches known as hague law after the hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 prescribes the rules of engagement during combat and is based on the key principles of military necessity and proportionality56 the humanitarian side of the law known as geneva law emphasizes human rights and responsibilities including the humane and just treatment of prisoners the legality and proper justification for resortin g to war in the first place are separate legal regime principal distinction exists between the law of conduct during war jus in bello and international law regulating when going to war is justified jus ad bellum 57 parties to an armed conflict retain the same rights and obligations without regard to which party initiated hostilities and whether that conduct is justifiable under international law58 otherwise each party would routinely regard its enemy as unlawfully engaging in war and would thus feel justified in taking whatever measures might be seen as necessary to accomplish its defeat59 53 see press release white house status of detainees at

war is to have any effect in restraining the conduct of belligerents there must be both inducements for adherence to it and punishment for failure to adhere60 one incentive for parties to adhere to the rules is the promise that their members will receive humane treatment and some legal privileges at the hands of the enemy if they are captured reciprocity serves as primary motivator but is not an absolute requirement for adherence61 derogation from the rules by one party does not excuse breaches by another62 although reprisal in proportion may be permissible63 were this not the case any deviation from the letter of the law could be invoked to justify wholesale abandonment of the law of war causing the conflict to degenerate into the kind of barbarity the law of war aims to mitigate reprisals may not be taken against pows or other protected persons64 some experts argue that in keeping with the purpose of humanitarian law that is to protect civilians and reduce the needless suffering of combatants humanitarian law should be interpreted as broadly as possible in favor of individual rights and protections to include rights of irregular combatants who comply to the extent possible with the law of war under this view one falls completely outside the protection of the geneva conventions during an armed conflict others would adhere rigidly to their interpretation of the letter of the law denying rights to irregular combatants in order to deter the formation of resistance movements and to avoid legitimizing their belligerent acts proponents of this view argue the treatment of detainees not clearly covered by the conventions is entirely at the discretion of the detaining power however states dealing with insurgents and armed resistance groups have typically denied that state of war exists treating rebels as common criminals and trying them in civil court for any belligerent acts

whether an armed conflict exists and if so whether that conflict is international or noninternational the type of armed conflict depends upon the status of the parties to the conflict and the nature of the hostilities the status and rights of individuals depend in turn on the relationship of those individuals to the parties to the conflict it may also become important to determine the temporal and geographical boundaries of the armed conflictfor the most part the geneva conventions would not apply to conduct that occurred prior to the onset or after the end of the armed conflict 60 see mallison and mallison supra footnote 40 at 41 noting that the central technique for enforcing the law of war has been system of interrelated rights and duties 61 see pictet supra footnote 54 at 21 1975 it is generally admitted that the nonexecution of treaty by one party may ultimately release the other party from its obligations or justify the annulment of the treaty like contract under municipal laws this however would not apply to the geneva conventions whatever the circumstances they remain valid and are not subject to reciprocity indeed the mind absolutely rejects the idea that belligerent should for instan ce deliberately illtreat or kill prisoners because the adversary has been guilty of such crimes 62 but see levie supra footnote 49 at 31stating that commentators appear to agree that few states can actually be expected to continue to apply the provisions of the gpw in the absence of reciprocity despite the provision to that effect 63 see the handbook of humanitarian law in armed conflicts 204 dieter fleck ed 1995hereinafter handbook defining reprisals as coercive measures which would normally be contrary to international law but which are taken in retaliation by one party to conflict in order to stop the adversary from violating international law 64 see id at 206

it apply to conduct occurring on the territory of nonparty to the conflict whether the territory on which the punishable conduct occurred is considered occupied or partially occupied may also be relevant to determining the status of detainees and the law applicable to them65 the geneva conventions apply in full to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the high contracting parties even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them 66 or in any cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of high contracting party common article 3 of the geneva conventions applies to internal hostilities serious enough to amount to an armed conflict67 although the parties are encouraged to adopt voluntarily the remaining provisions with respect to each other in the case of sporadic violence involving unorganized groups and uprisings the law of war is not implicated although the law of basic human rights continues to apply the classification of an armed conflict presents few difficulties in the case of declared war between two states such conflict would clearly qualify as an international armed conflict to which the geneva conventions would apply in their entirety such conflicts have also become rare the term internal armed conflict generally describes civil war taking place within the borders of state featuring an organized rebel forc capable of controlling at least some territory internal conflicts may be more difficult to classify as such because states frequently deny that series of violent acts amounts to an armed conflict 68 classifying conflict in which foreign state intervenes in an internal armed conflict creates an even more complex puzzle some theorists consider an armed conflict to remain internal where foreign state intervenes on behalf of legitimate government to put down an insurgency whereas foreign intervention on behalf of rebel movement would internationalize the armed conflict69 under this view the war in afghanistan was an internal conflict between the taliban and northern alliance troops until us forces intervened at which point the conflict became international70 when the taliban ceded control of the government the conflict may have reverted to an internal conflict because us forces then became aligned with the government of the state others

to the official commentary of the international committee of the red cross icrc72 the conditions for an international war are satisfied whenever any difference arises leading to the use of armed force between the militaries of two states73 both the united states and afghanistan are signatories to the four geneva conventions of 1949 if the taliban was at the onset of the conflict the government of afghanistan and its soldiers were the regular armed forces it would appear that the conflict met the geneva conventions definition of an international armed conflict however only three states ever recognized the taliban as the legitimate government of afghanistan while it is not necessary for the governments of states engaging in hostilities to recognize each other 74 the rules are less clear where virtually country recognizes government75 because the use of force by private persons rather than organs of state has not traditionally constituted an act of war76 it is arguable that refusing to recognize the taliban as facto government of state would preclude the united states from prosecuting the september 11 terrorist attacks as war crimes after all it has been suggested that international terrorism might be considered to amount to armed conflict for the purposes of the law of war only if foreign government is involved77 the level of state support of terrorism required to incur state responsibility under international law is matter of debate78 denying that any state is involved in the terrorist acts that precipitated the armed conflict could call into question the united states treatment of those attacks as violations of the law of war and for treating the global war on terrorism as an international armed conflict some observers cite additional policy grounds for treating the armed conflict as international to treat it as an internal conflict could have implications for us and allied troops one would be entitled to pow status or protected person status under the third and fourth geneva conventions although common article 3 would remain in force for all parties us and coalition soldiers may be placed at risk of capture in afghanistan or elsewhere depending on how the conflict proceeds the presidents decision to apply the geneva conventions to the taliban but deny their application to qaeda as nonparty may be an implicit recognition that the armed conflict is an international one at least with respect to the taliban 72 see international committee of the red cross commentary on the geneva conventions j pictet ed 1960 hereinafter icrc

also possible to view the conflict with the taliban as separate from the conflict with qaeda79 qaeda would have to qualify as belligerent in its own right however which most observers argue it does not because an armed conflict can only exist where at least two belligerents are in opposition the present hostilities between the united states and qaeda would not seem to qualify as an armed conflict under international law80 the difficulty under this view is that it may either lend an air of legitimacy to qaeda or cast doubt on the legality of the united states military actions against qaeda81 another possibility is that the war on terrorism is forging new international law by recognizing or creating new form of armed conflict in which state is authorized to use armed force against members of paramilitary group in selfdefense outside its own territory82 not only to deflect immediate attacks but also to initiate attacks against members of the group and their leaders in order to weaken or eradicate it at least so long as force is used on the territory of consenting government or territory not under the firm control of any national government under this view the traditional nexus between the rights and the obligations of belligerents appear to be severed so that state may wage fullfledged war against persons not entitled to participate

international armed conflict have the right to intern enemy prisoners of war 83 as well as civilians who pose danger to the security of the state84 at least for the duration of hostilities85 the right

the privilege of being held as prisoner of war was not extended to brigands pirates looters and pillagers not associated with the uniformed army of any state such persons were considered common criminals acting for personal gain rather than agents of state and they could be summarily shot93 modern rules require fair criminal trial94 the first codified set of rules for the protection of prisoners of war was general orders 100 known as the lieber code adopted by the union army during the civil war95 it covered all soldiers of whatever species of arms all men who belong to the rising masse of the hostile country all those who are attached to the army for its efficiency and promote directly the object of war as well as citizens who accompany an army for whatever purpose such as sutlers editors or reporters of journals or contractors if captured 96 it was forbidden to declare that every member of legitimate levy masse spontaneous uprising of citizens in opposition to an armed

international application and clarified the rules generally expanding their coverage and increasing their protections98 the united states army field manual fm 2710 the law of land warfare is the main

of security102 the fourth geneva convention gc protects civilians who fall into the hands of the enemy providing protections similar to those afforded pows under the gpw enemy civilians that is those civilians with the nationality of the opposing belligerent state have the status of protected person under the gc as long as that state is party to the gc103 nationals of neutral or cobelligerent states within the territory of belligerent state are not entitled to the status of protected persons as long as the state of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic representation with the state in whose hands they are104 presumably these civilians would be protected through the diplomatic efforts of their home country and would not be exposed to the same vulnerabilities as are the citizens of the belligerent states themselves however common article 3 provides set of minimum standards for all persons whether or not they are protected persons 105 furthermore part ii of the gc applies universally without regard to the nationality of the civilians affected106 civilians who participate in combat unlike combatants are not acting on behalf of higher authority with whom peace can be negotiated therefore they are not immune from punishment for belligerent acts their conduct is dealt with according to the law of the criminal jurisdiction in which it occurred which could mean civil trial or trial by military tribunal convened by an occupying power the gc does not state that civili ans who engage in combat thereby lose their protection under the convention they lose their protection as civilians in the sense that they may become lawful targets for the duration of their participation in combat but their status as civilians does not change according to the convention traditionally such person might be regarded as an unlawful combatant at least if caught while committing hostile act and may be tried and punished in accordance with criminal law

war has denied the status of privileged combatant to warriors who conduct violence for private rather than public purposes or who carry out specific unprivileged acts 107 there are traditionally two types of unlawful belligerents combatants who may be authorized to fight by legitimate party to conflict but whose perfidious conduct disqualifies them from the privileges of pow and civilians who are not authorized as combatants but nevertheless participate in hos tilities but who do not thereby gain combatant status 102 gc art 42 the internment or placing in assigned residence of protected persons may be ordered only if the security of the detaining power makes it absolutely necessary 103 gc art 4 some interpret this to act as an exception to protected person status for aliens within

saboteurs and mercenaries these are persons who act on behalf of party to the conflict and probably under its orders but are nonetheless denied the status of lawful belligerents they forfeit their entitlement to combat immunity and may be tried and punished according to the law then prevailing for civilians it has also been suggested that such persons may be detain ed without trial in status other than that of prisoners of war or civilian internee but it appears that such detention was considered punitive rather than preventive in nature 108 spies and saboteurs spy is one who in disguise or under false pretenses penetrates behind enemy lines of belligerent to obtain information with the intent of communicating that information to the hostile party109 if captured in the act spy may be denied pow treatment tried and possibly executed110 however if spy rejoins the army of the hostile party as lawful combatant he is longer subject to punishment for those acts should he later fall into the hands of the enemy111 saboteurs or enemy agents who penetrate into the territory of an adversary without openly bearing arms in order to perpetrate hostile acts are subject to similar treatment112 if the acts are directed against civilian targets they will likely be termed acts of terrorism113 saboteurs retain the protection of the gc114 and are entitled to fair and regular trial before punishment may be administered115 if spies and saboteurs were to retain their entitlement to pow status belligerents could immunize those they send behind enemy lines by making them members of the armed forces thus eliminating the inherent risk in such conduct116 gc art 5 addresses the treatment of spies and saboteurs applying different standards depending upon whether the suspect is an alien in the territory of belligerent state or person in occupied territory where in the territory of party to the conflict the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the state such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present convention as would if exercised in the favour of such individual person be prejudicial to the security of such state 108 see eg william winthrop military law and precedents 783 2d ed 20001886irregular armed bodies or

members of the armed forces of party to the conflict but participate in combat for personal gain117 they may be authorized or at least encouraged to fight by party to the conflict but their allegiance to the authorizing party is conditioned on payment rather than obedience and loyalty118 it is seen as questionable whether mercenaries can serve as valid agents of party to the conflict or are rather mere contract killers especially considering they could just as easily switch sides to accept better offer may be operating in pursuit of different objectives from those of the party to the conflict

however merely having nationality other than that of the party on whose side soldier fights does not automatically make that soldier mercenary121 it has been suggested that nonafghan members of the taliban and qaeda might be mercenaries and disqualified from pow privileges on that basis122 based on press reports and pentagon statements about the detainees there is little to suggest that their motives stem from personal material gain rather than belief that they are serving higher power it appears to be generally recognized that the fighters do not believe themselves to be serving afghanistan as country but are serving either the taliban or qaeda perhaps both for ideological reasons the united states has made it clear that it is not fighting against the afghan people but instead considers the taliban and qaeda to be the enemies since both groups are considered to be parties to the conflict and their conduct serves as justification for the united states combat operations in afghanistan the label of mercenary does not appear appropriate for the groups as whole although some of the individual fighters may prove to be mercenaries

belligerent acts that might well be conducted lawfully by combatants with proper authorization of the state they act on their own albeit perhaps for patriotic or id eological reasons because they do not answer to any higher command they are not valid agents of party to the conflict and cannot always be expected to lay down their arms when hostilities between parties cease civilians who engage in combat lose their protected status and may become lawful targets for so long as they continue to fight they do not enjoy immunity under the law of war for their violent conduct and can be tried and punished under civil law for their belligerent acts they may also be interned without trial under gc art 5 but they do not lose their protected status as civilians under the gc 123 civilians who owe loyalty to the detaining power might so find themselves charged with treason or aiding the enemy it would seem that the taliban and qaeda do not exactly fit the second definition of unlawful combatants either again it appears they are considered to be parties to the conflict who may lawfully be treated as military targets whether or not they are directly participating in the immediate hostilities if every taliban or qaeda fighter is considered civilian participating in an armed conflict without authorization who can be tried for ordinary acts of combat then the question might be

of organized groups of irregular fighters that do not as whole meet the criteria to be treated as prisoners of war125 these groups typically employ unorthodox guerrilla tactics emphasizing stealth and surprise126 and have received somewhat uneven treatment at the hands of states127 in some conflicts irregulars who could not prove their affiliation to an official military were summarily shot as franctireurs 128 the lack of international consensus with regard to the treatment of insurgents and partisans contributed to the international impetus to codify the law of war but has not been resolved and remains source of contention among states parties to the resulting treaties129 guerrilla tactics do not appear to be in and of themselves violative of international law130 it could be argued that conventional style warfare conducted by irregular soldiers is worse under this view members of irregular armies who carry out ordinarily lawful belligerent acts or who have not personally carried out any hostile acts while not necessarily entitled to pow privileges would not be punishable as unlawful combatants like pows they would be subject to internment at the hands of the state without necessarily being charged with crime their detention would be based on membership in the irregular army rather than citizenship and suspicion of criminal activity the issue remains what set of rules applies to them some argue that in the very least common article 3 applies as well as other international human rights law others argue that neither peacetime civil law nor the law of war applies essentially leaving them outside the law altogether g11g151g157g142g155g153g155g142g157g138g157g146g152g151g561g152g143g561g9g18g25g561g3g155g157g146g140g149g142g561g346g561 assuming the

party132 need not necessarily satisfy the four criteria in order for their members to be entitled to pow status under the gpw art 4a2 however members of regular armed forces may be denied pow rights if they are caught as spies or saboteurs behind enemy lines133 under this view taliban soldiers captured on the battlefield in afghanistan were at least presumptively lawful combatants entitled to pow status qaeda was not claimed as the armed forces of afghanistan therefore its members would have been entitled to pow status only if it formed part of the armed forces of afghanistan it belonged to the taliban and met the four criteria in gpw art 4a2 or it were considered an authority not recognized by the united states but nevertheless party to the conflict if the taliban were not the armed forces of afghanistan it would seem that such determination would have rendered the conflict noninternational from the outset in which case gpw art 4 was entirely irrelevant however if the conflict is considered to have been international notwithstanding the status of the taliban then presumably the following analysis would have applied to the taliban as well

to conflict for the purposes of article 4a1 the determination may be made in accordan ce with the national laws of the state party to the conflict 134 the language may have been included in order to ensure that members of the united states national guard for example are protected135 however in the case of states with less developed military organizations including newly emerging states or new governments the determination may not be as clear if some qa eda combat units were officially incorporated into the taliban army members of those units could argue that they are entitled to pow status136

even if qaeda was never part of the armed forces of afghanistan its members could qualify as pows if qaeda belonged to party to the conflict and it met the criteria under gpw art 4a2 presumably belonging to party would be less exacting standard than forming part ofits armed forces it may be that informal and even temporary cooperation between the militia or volunteer group and regular troops suffices to bring militia members under the protection of combatant status 137 the inclusion of the phrase organized resistance groups complicates the 132 gpw art 4a3 133 see levie supra footnote 49

g344g343g561interpretation the phrase was apparently included to address resistance movements of the type that sprang up in many occupied territories during world war ii138 if militia is fighting on behalf of governmentinexile the question arises as to whether that government is still party to the conflict to which resistance group might validly belong139 if party to an international armed conflict claims partisan group or authorizes it to engage in combat there may be insufficient proof that the group is covered an israeli court confronted the question when members of the popular front for the liberation of palestine plfp sought to overturn criminal convictions for acts they committed in the west bank by claiming pow status 140 the court upheld the civil convictions holding that since government with which israel was then at war claimed responsibility for the actions of the plfp its members were not entitled to be treated as pows because the occupied territory of the west bank previously belonged to jordan signatory of the gpw th plfp could only belong to party if it belonged to jordan since the group was illegal in jordan the court reasoned its members were not protected as pows 141 on the other hand governments are not always willing to acknowledge their support of irregular armed groups meaning partisan group may have to establish facto relationship through other means142 united states officials have argued that the taliban and qaeda are intimately connected143 that connection is arguably what makes the taliban responsible for the terrorist acts of qaeda and thus subject to military action for that reason it may be counterproductive for united states officials to take the position that qaeda never belonged to the taliban for the purposes of

roots in the earliest expressions of the laws of war beginning with the brussels declaration146 and continuing nearly unchanged in the hague convention respecting the laws and customs of war on land of 1907147 and are repeated in the gpw however this may be more reflection of nations inability to agree on better formula than an indication of the solidity of their foundation 148 the criteria may reflect the customs of war as they existed among the european countries who signed the original treaties but were not viewed at the time as universal149 the criteria originated as compromise between states with strong standing armies and weaker states whose defense might depend on armed citizens150 the only real effect of the enumeration of the criteria at the hague convention was to prohibit ill treatment of those who do not meet them 151 historically the most important consideration given to pow status has been whether there is evidence that they serve government or political entity that exercises authority over them152 for example the united states practice as early as 1900 during the philippine insurrection following the spanishamerican war was to accord prisoner of war status to members of the insurgent army recognized by the philippine governme nt who complied in general with the four 144 see levie supra footnote 49 at 3637 commenting that the lack of criteria under article 4a1 does not mean that mere membership in the regular armed forces will automati cally entitle an individual who is captured to pow status if his conduct prior to and at the time of capture have not met these requirements however the examples he lists have to do with individual spies and saboteurs that is individual soldiers who pose as civilians to conduct hostile activities behind enemy lines it is arguably different matter to apply the standards to regular armies as whole 145 see treatise supra footnote 125 at 8687 predicting nations would be unlikely to adopt definitions that might foreclose future options and noting that prior practice was relatively useless as precedent consisting of collection of varying and conflicting policy decisions made on an ad hoc basis 146 see levie

g344g345g561conditions153 members of guerrilla bands not part of the regular forces were punished severely for acts of violence similar policy was adopted by the british during the south african war although the first inclination was to declare that inasmuch as the newly annexed orange river colony was british territory inhabitants who took up arms were to be treated as rebels154 foreign jurists and some prominent british statesman objected to the policy as monstrous proclamation absolutely opposed to the first principles of international law and history155 new proclamation was issued to declare that only thos inhabitants who had not been continuous part of the fighting would be treated as rebels british forces punished as marauders those who carried out acts of hostility who did not belong to an organized body authorized by recognized government156 on the other hand toward the end of the mexican war in 1847 united states forces changed from more tolerant policy toward irregulars to one of utmost severity by that time warfare by bands of guerrillas sanctioned by the late mexican government had become the primary means of resistance once the war degenerated to the point where the guerrillas more resembled murderers and highway robbers than soldiers the us secretary of war directed general winfield scott to adopt policy of less forbearance than had hitherto been observed157 in 1870 during the franco prussian war the german commanders refused to treat any irregular fighters as lawful combatants even those who possessed papers proving their affiliation with the government158 in 1914 when the german army invaded belgium it refused to recognize the citizen defense of yet unoccupied territories as valid peoples war qualifying for belligerent status because the belgian government did not adequately organize the forces and failed to supply the civilian fighters with proper distinguishing emblems159 it was fundamental part of the law of war that only combatants authorized to fight on behalf of state party to conflict were allowed to participate in the hostilities it has never been permitted to wage war against civilians160 civilians could become lawful military objectives only if and for so long as they took up arms against belligerent the four criteria are meant to ensure that only persons authorized to fight on behalf of higher authority who is responsible for their conduct will participate excluding civilians as both combatants and targets supporters of granting pow status to taliban soldiers have argued that the text of the conventions should be read literally that the four criteria are listed only under the subparagraph for volunteer groups and militias not forming part of the regular army of state indicates that there is similar test for those whose status as members of state military force is not in doubt others however have argued that regular soldiers must already meet those criteria under 153 see id at 576

international law and the drafters of the gpw felt it would be superfluous to list the criteria with regard to regular armies article 1 of the 1907 hague convention could be read to apply the four criteria to all military forces however inasmuch as that article states that not only the rights but the laws and duties of war as well apply only to the parties it lists such an interpretation could lead to the conclusion that regular armies could evade their obligations under the law of war simply by not fulfilling the four conditions

according to us military doctrine the responsible command element is fulfilled if the commander of the corps is commissioned officer of the armed forces or is person of position and authority or if the members of the militia or volunteer corps are provided with documents badges or other means of identi fication to show that they are officers noncommissioned officers or soldiers so that there may be doubt that they are not persons acting on their own responsibility state recognition however is not essential and an organization may be formed spontaneously and elect its own officers 161 the key to the first element is that the subject is acting on behalf of and on the command of higher authority the secretary of defense has suggested that the taliban never fulfilled this requirement because they were not organized in military units as such with identifiable chains of command indeed qaeda forces made up portions of their forces162 however in response to reporter who asked whether it was not clear that the taliban were operating as cohesive unit pointing to previous reports that the us military had successfully attacked command and control elements secretary rumsfeld responded that while such case could be made for the first command element it would be difficult to argue the taliban ever met all four criteria suggesting that the first element may not be critical to the determination possible drawback to setting high standard of conventional military organization to determine whether the taliban or qaeda ever met the responsible command element is that it could contradict the justification for targeting them at all if it had been the case that the taliban had insufficient command and control of its forces to distinguish its forces from lawless mob it would have been unlikely that those forces could have posed significant threat especially outside of afghanistan

according to fm 2710 the requirement for fixed distinctive sign is satisfied by the wearing of military uniform but less than the complete uniform w ill suffice helmet or headdress which would make the silhouette of the individual readily distinguishable from that of an ordinary civilian would satisfy this requirement it is also desirable that the individual member of the militia or volunteer corps wear badge or brassard permanently affixed to his clothing it is not necessary to inform the enemy of the distinctive sign although it may be desirable to do so in order to avoid misunderstanding 163 161 fm 2710 supra footnote 38 64a 162 see rumsfeld press conference supra footnote 10 163 fm 2710 supra footnote 38 at 64b

distinctive despite the fact that the same language gave rise to disputes as it was interpreted in earlier treaties164 presumably the requirement for sign to be fixed was meant to prevent fighters from removing them easily but it is unlikely the requirement was meant to remain in force even when military operations were ongoing165 similarly there is nothing to explain how great distance must be before the distinction need longer be discernible thods of locating and of camouflaging military targets including soldiers make it questionable whether the standards are the same today as they were when the original conventions were drafted if such standards ever existed the purpose for requiring combatants to distinguish themselves from civilians is to protect civilians from being targeted combatants who are unable to distinguish enemy combatants from civilians might resort to firing upon all human beings in the area of operations there may be other reasons for enforcing the obligation to identify oneself as combatant that serve tactical purposes rather than purely humanitarian ends requiring irregulars to display mark aids the opposing army in targeting them and also impedes the irregulars ability to effect surprise attack 166 the use of different uniforms to distinguish the forces also helps leaders identify their own troops during combat and to distinguish friendly from enemy soldiers167 it has also been suggested that the requirement to wear uniform is remnant of long outdated forms of warfare in which closely ranked armies opposed each other across open fields168 modern army uniforms are designed to make the wearer difficult to distinguish from the surrounding foliage from any distance it has been pointed out that the requirement for irregulars is not more stringent than the standard set by regular armies169 although the lack of uniform can be detrimental to soldier who falls into the hands of the enemy170 it has not been the case historically that all fighters lacking uniform or some other identifying mark have been denied prisoner status171 according to fm 2710 the lack of uniform brings the following result members of the armed forces of party to the conflict and members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces lose their right to be treated as prisoners of war whenever they deliberately conceal their status in order to pass behind the military lines of the enemy for the purpose of gathering military information or for the purpose of waging 164 see levie supra footnote 49 at 47 165 see mallison and mallison supra

clothes or the uniform of the enemy are examples of concealment of the status of member of the armed forces172 for combatant to engage in hostilities while disguising his identity in order to deceive the enemy thus could amount to perfidious c onduct in violation of the law of war173 guerrillas and terrorists therefore lose any claim they might have to protected status if they place the civilian populace at risk however soldier not engaging in hostilities probably has not committed violation by using civilian disguise merely to evade detection by the enemy174 soldiers who belong to armies that do not wear full uniforms are not necessarily engaging in perfidious conduct as long as they bear arms openly and do not hide their belligerent status175 secretary of defense rumsfeld has suggested that the taliban never fulfilled the requirement because they did not wear distinctive signs insignias symbols or uniforms to the contrary far from seeking to distinguish themselves from the civilian population of afghanistan they sought to blend in with civilian noncombatants hiding in mosques and populated areas 176 critics of the defense departments position point out that neither the taliban nor the northern alliance had ever worn uniforms or any distinctive sign other than the black turban reportedly worn by members of the taliban and distinctive headscarves worn by members of the northern alliance 177 the failure to wear what western commanders might regard as proper military dress may be more matter of custom than perfidy since most of the handtohand combat was conducted by the northern alliance with us forces supplying intelligence and fire support from the air or at great distance the critics argue the pentagons position that the lack of uniforms makes unlawful combatants of the taliban force is less persuasive178 the very success of the armed forces in quickly routing the enemy with virtually us casualties may also make the argument somewhat more difficult to sustain fina lly critics have pointed out that us special forces troops have been known to operate occasionally in civilian dress or even to use the uniform of the enemy for the purpose of infiltrating enemy territory179 172 fm 2710 supra footnote 38 at 74 emphasis added 173 perfidious conduct refers to an act that invites the conf idence of an adversary to lead him to believe that he

sign to prevent perfidious conduct in violation of the law of war fm 2710 describes this requirement in the negative it is not satisfied by the carrying of weapons concealed about the person or if the individuals hide their weapons on the approach of the enemy the icrc notes the distinction between carrying arms openly and carrying them visibly or ostensibly stating the provision is intended to guarantee the loyalty of the fighting sic it is not an attempt to prescribe that handgrenade or revolver must be carried at belt or shoulder rather than in pocket or under coat180 the paramount concern is that the enemy must be able to recognize partisans as combatants in the same way as members of regular armed forces whatever their weapons181 it is unclear whether arms must be carried in the open at all times or only during the conduct of actual hostilities since surprise attacks are not per unlawful it seems that ordinary ruses of war that involve camouflage or the concealing of arms to hide preparation for battle would be permissible while perfidious attacks carried out with weapons disguised as harmless equipment might not be allowed it may also be valid to question whether the requirement is the same during offensive operations for both the attacker and the attacked to impose the same requirements on those who suddenly find themselves in battle denying pow status on the basis that particular combatant had weapon concealed somewhere or was not at the time in uniform would seem to give the attacker clear advantage and even greater incentive to launch surprise attacks against an unprepared enemy

according to fm 2710 this condition is fulfilled if most of the members of the body observe the laws and customs of war notwithstanding the fact that the individual member concerned may have committed war crime members of militias and volunteer corps should be especially warned against employment of treachery denial of quarters maltreatment of prisoners of war wounded and dead improper conduct toward flags of truce pillage and unnecessary violence and destruction the icrc interprets the condition similarly partisans are required to respect the geneva conventions to the fullest extent possible in particular they must conform to international agreements such as those which prohibit the use of certain weapons gas in all their operations they must be guided by the moral criteria which in the absence of written provisions must direct the conscience of man in launching attacks they must not cause violence and suffering disproportionate to the military 180 see icrc commentary supra

attack civilians or disarmed persons and must in all their operations respect the principles of honour and loyalty as they expect their enemies to do 182 the condition is said to be vital to the recognition of irregular fighters because states cannot be expected to adhere to the law of war to fight an enemy that is not likewise bound however the somewhat lenient stance just quoted reflects the fact that the concept of the laws and customs of war is rather vague and subject to variation as the forms of war evolve183 the imprecision of the condition could lead to its abuse relatively minor violation of the law of war could be used as pretext to deny pow status to an entire army which would arguably give the members of an irregular army little incentive to follow any of the rules if adherence to particular rule is outside their capability184 one of the unresolved issues then is whether the criteria apply to each soldier as an individual or to the army as whole in other words does the violation of rule by one soldier result in the failure to qualify for pow status for the rest of the group even though some members might scrupulously follow all of the rules can individual soldiers still qualify for pow status even though their leaders do not strictly enforce the rules over all subordinates member of regular force does not lose his right to be treated as pow by violating the law of war so it might seem inconsistent to give members of irregular group s who might otherwise qualify harsher treatment however capturing power is probably inclined to insist that each individual detainee meet all four conditions before receiving treatment as pow 185 with regard to whether regular army forfeits the right to have its members treated as pows by failing to follow the laws of war us practice has been to comply with the conventions even when the opposing side of conflict does not the united states treated north korean and chinese prisoners as pows during the armed conflict in korea despite the near total disregard of its provisions on the part of the communists186 the united states also treated north vietnamese and some vietcong prisoners as pows despite north vietnams denial that the gpw applied at all187 along with its threatened policy of treating downed us airmen as not eligible for pow status and trying them as war criminals 182 see id 183 see id 184 see mallison and mallison supra footnote 40 at 60 suggesting that it is better to have irregu lars adhere as much as possible rather than not at all 185 see levie supra footnote 49 at 4445 emphasizing that most capturing powers will deny the benefits and safeguards of the convention to any such individual who is in any manner delinquent in compliance it must also be emphasized that if an individual is found to have failed to meet the four conditions this may make him an unprivileged combatant but it does not place him at the complete mercy of his captor to do with as the captor arbitrarily determines he is still entitled to the general protection of the law of war which means that he may not be subjected to inhuman treatment such as torture and he is entitled to be tried before penal sanctions are imposed 186 see id at 30 noting that none of the parties had yet acceded to the treaties but all had agreed to be bound by their humanitarian principles 187 see id

combatants and are not entitled to pow status some critics argue and one federal court has agreed that even if most of the detainees fail to meet the criteria for pow status declaration by the

to compel the institution of such tribunal the provision is new to the 1949 gpw and was inserted at the request of the icrc 189 prior to the inclusion of this language summary decisions were often made by soldiers of relatively low rank on the battlefield leading to instances where captive could be presumed unlawful and executed on the spot with any investigation to follow190 under the 1949 gpw combatants are presumed to be entitled to pow status unless formally declared otherwise191 the united states has in the past interpreted this language as requiring an individual assessment of status before privileges can be denied192 any individual who claims pow status is entitled to an adjudication of that st atus an individual who has not committed belligerent act and thus claims to be an innocent civilian arguably has the right to have that claim adjudicated the conflict in vietnam with its high frequency of irregular warfare brought about the first implementation of written procedures for art 5 tribunals193 the united states military assistance command macv first issued directive pertaining to the determination of pow status in 1966 194 under the macv directive the captured north vietnamese army and vietcong fighters were accorded pow status upon capture195 for prisoners who were not obviously entitled to pow status tribunal of three or more officers was convened to determine their status196 irregulars were divided into three groups guerrillas selfdefense force and secret selfdefense force members of these groups could qualify for pow status if

victims protocol i221 the united states has previously taken the view that many of its provisions have attained the status of customary international law222 common article 3 does not itself provide authority to detain individuals suspected of being combatants or of presenting security risk to the detaining state nor does it differentiate between lawful and unlawful combatants rather it states that the application of its provisions has effect on the legal status of the nonstate party or parties to the conflict in other words the recognition that common article 3 applies to conflict does not constitute recognition of belligerency on the part of state and state may therefore prosecute insurgents for treason and other offenses against its laws without according them combatant immunity 223 on the other hand under customary international law the laws of war are not implicated unless conflict constitutes belligerencythat is an armed conflict between two belligerents224 if party to the conflict does not qualify as belligerent under international law detention and prosecution of its members are carried out according to domestic law which in turn must comply with common article 3 and applicable human rights obligations of the state thus it appears that human rights treaties are more relevant with respect to internal armed conflicts than they are in cases of international armed conflict225 protocol i to the geneva conventions provides that any person who has taken part in hostilities who is not entitled to prisonerofwar status and who does not benefit from more favourable treatment in accordance with the fourth convention shall have the right at all times to the protection of article 75 of this protocol226 article 75 of protocol i provides in part continued fundamental

have received determination of their status that roughly corresponds to what they would receive from competent tribunal under gpw art 5 critics of the policy respond that the us position regarding the inapplicability of the geneva conventions could be invoked as precedent to defend the poor human rights practices of other regimes and it could lead to harsh treatment of us service members who fall into enemy hands during this or ny future conflict under the critics view if the administration can accomplish its goals by applying the gpw criteria in article 4 to determine by means of competent tribunal which of the detainees is entitled to pow status the foreign policy and humanitarian benefits would be worth the cost the perceived implications of granting pow status appear to have played role in the decision making process with administration officials emphasizing the detrimental impact of treating the detainees as pows on the us ability to fight the war against terror some of the

however there is prohibition against the detaining power asking for more information230 it is forbidden to use mental or physical coercion to extract information from prisoners231 but tactics such as trickery or promises of improved living conditions are not foreclosed232 article 17 of gpw provides that prisone rs of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened insulted or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind torture is not permitted in the case of any detainee regardless of that persons status233 similar language was contained in the 1929 geneva

british military court convicted several german luftwaffe officers of improperly interrogating british pows236 at special interrogation camp where it was charged the officers used excessive heating of cells in order to induce prisoners to give war information of kind they were not bound by the c onvention to disclose the charges also alleged the officers had threatened prisoners that their failure to provide sufficient answers could be seen by the gestapo as evidence that the prisoners were saboteurs237 the military court expressed its agreement with the defenses position that interrogation was not unlawful under the geneva convention then in force that obtaining information by trick was likewise not unlawful and that interrogation of wounded prisoner was not itself unlawful without evidence that met hods used amounted to physical or mental ill treatment238 it appears to be common practice for militaries to interrogate prisoners as soon as possible after capture to exploit their knowledge concerning tactical positions and plans239 there is express right to counsel during such interrogation however the case may be different where the information sought is of the type that could incriminate the prisoner personally for any crime240 the gpw forbids the use of coercion to induc pow to admit guilt and pows who are accused of crimes have the right to counsel241 it may thus be

however there is an exception for prisoners who are charged with or have been convicted of an indictable crime281 there is also case law suggesting the obligation to repatriate is not automatic and immediate the 9th circuit declined to grant freedom to pow captured in italy during the second world war who sought release partly on the grounds that hostilities had ceased282 the court noted that peace treaty had yet been negotiated between italy and the united states and was not swayed by the fact that italy had by that time changed sides it appears to have remained international state practice to provide for repatriation of prisoners of war by express agreement 283 interned civilians must also be released as soon as the reasons which necessitated their internment longer exist284 which will occur as soon as possible after the close of hostilities285 there is an exception for internees against whom penal proceedings are pending or who have been convicted and sentenced for nondisciplinary offenses286 these internees may be detained until the close of such proceedings and if circumstances require until the completion of the penalty287a study by the international

warrisk hazard303 however prisoners of war are covered under the jurisdiction of the uniform code of military justice ucmj304 the administration has asserted that the war on terror is new kind of conflict requiring new set of rules and definitions it has been observed that the nature of the hostilities and us objectives borrow some characteristics from the realm of law enforcement and others from model based on conventional war consequently the role of congress might be seen as particularly important in providing definition and set of boundaries to shape how such war is to be fought courts have not been receptive to the argument that the president has the inherent authority to determine how to pursue the war against terrorism however congresss enactment of the detainee treatment act and the military commissions act by restricting the guantanamo bay detainees access to us courts may limit the opportunity for any judicial testing of whether executive actions comply with congressional authorization g343g342g350g157g145g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g561 several measures were introduced during the 108th congress to address the detention of persons detained in connection with the war on terrorism legislation to authorize the president to convene military tribunals under certain circumstances was not enacted however the national defense authorization act for fy2005 pl 108375 october 28 2004 nda provided measures to ensure the proper treatment of all prisoners held in connection with the war on terrorism including the prisoners in military custody at guantanamo bay 305 the nda emphasizes that the policy of the united states is to ensure that detainee in its custody is subjected to torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment and to promptly investigate and prosecute instances of abuse to ensure that us personnel understand the applicable standards to accord detainees whose status is in doubt the protection for prisoners of war under the geneva conventions and to expeditiously process and if appropriate prosecute detainees in the custody of the united states including those in the custody of the united states armed forces at guantanamo bay cuba sec 1091 it also requires the military to implement within 150 days of the passage of the act policy to ensure detainees are treated in accordance with the obligations set forth in section 1091 sec 1092 and to submit copies of regulations to congress along with report setting forth st eps taken to implement section 1092 sec 1093 the nda also requires dod to submit an annual report giving notice of any investigation into any violation of laws regarding the treatment of detainees aggregate data relating to the detention operations of the department of defense including how many persons are held and in what status and how many have been transferred to the jurisdiction of other countries the nda does not address the treatment of persons in custody of the cia 301 10 usc

in addition the national defense authorization act of 2006 pl 109163 requires the secretary of defense to establish uniform policy with respect to the role of military medical and behavioral science personnel in the interrogation of detainees which was to be reported to the congressional defense committees by march 1 2006 705 the house of representatives passed language in its foreign relations

interrogation of persons in the custody of the department of defense 308 and expressly bans cruel inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees in the custody of any us agency309 the prohibited treatment is defined as that which would violate the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendments to the us constitution as the senate has interpreted cruel inhuman or degrading treatment banned by the convention against torture310 the provision does not create cause of action for detainees to ask court for relief based on inconsistent treatment and it divests the courts of jurisdiction to hear challenges by those detained at guantanamo bay based on their treatment or living conditions 311 it also provides legal defense to us officers and agents who may be sued or prosecuted based on their treatment or interrogation of detainees312 this language appears to have been added as compromise because the administration reportedly sought to have the central intelligence agency excepted from the prohibition on cruel inhuman and degrading treatment on the grounds that the president needs m aximum flexibility in dealing with the global war on terrorism 313 306 department of defense emergency

also includes modified version of the graham amendment samdt 2516 to s 1042 the grahamlevin amendment314 which requires the defense department to submit to the armed services and judiciary committees the procedural rules for determining detainees status315 the amendment neither authorizes nor requires formal status determination but it does require that certain congressional committees be notified 30 days prior to the implementation of any changes to the rules as initially adopted by the senate the amendment would have required these procedural rules to preclude evidence determined by the board or tribunal to have been obtained by undue coercion however the conferees modified the language so that the tribunal or board must assess to the extent practicable whether any statement derived from or relating to such detainee was obtained as result of coercion and the probative value if any of any such statement the dta also eliminates the federal courts statutory jurisdiction over habeas claims by aliens detained at guantanamo bay316 but provides for limited appeals of status determinations made pursuant to the dod procedures for combatant status review tribunals csrts317 the supreme court interpreted the act to find that at least some habeas corpus claims pending on the day of enactment were not affected318 the dc circuit court of appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to hear appeals of any status determination made by designated civilian official but the review is limited to consideration of whether the determination was made consistently with applicable dod procedures including whether it is supported by the preponderance of the evidence but allowing rebuttable presumption in favor of the government the procedural rule regarding the use of evidence obtained through undue coercion applies prospectively only so that detainees who have already been determined by csrts to be enemy combatants may not base an appeal on the failure to comply with that procedure detainees may also appeal status determinations on the basis that to the extent the constitution and laws of the united states are applicable whether the use of such standards and procedures to make the determination is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states jurisdiction ceases if the detainee is transferred from dod custody

the date of enactment which relate to any aspect of the detention transfer treatment trial or conditions of detention of an alien detained by the united states since september 11 2001 section 5 of the mca specifically precludes the application of the geneva conventions to habeas or other civil proceedings 321 the mca sets forth detailed definitions of crimes that constitute grave breaches of common article 3322 in addition the act provides that the president shall have the authority to interpret the meaning of the geneva conventions323 the intended effect of this provision is somewhat unclear although the president generally has role in the negotiation implementation and domestic enforcement of treaty obligations324 this power does not generally extend to interpreting treaty obligations role more traditionally associated with courts325 instead the language appears to be intended to establish the authority of the president within the executive branch to issue interpretative regulations by executive order326 although the president and the department of defense have traditionally exercised such authority without specific legislation
