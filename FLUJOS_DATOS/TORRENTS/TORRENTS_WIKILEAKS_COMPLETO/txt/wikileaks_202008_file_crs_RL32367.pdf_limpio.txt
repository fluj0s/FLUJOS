requirement established by the budget enforcement act of 1990 which proposed that any new direct spending or decr ease in revenues for fiscal year must be fully offset with additional revenue or entitlement savings elsewhere originally enacted for fiscal years 1991 through 1995 paygo rules were extended twice and expired at the end of fy2002use of qualified mortgage bonds to finance residences for veterans without regard to first time homebuyer requirement analysis several tax provisions expired in 2005 we re retroactively ex tended in late 2006 through 2007 and are now expired again ma ny of the provisions had been extended at least twice since their original ex piration date among the extenders one provision was 20 years old another was 10 ears old and nine other provisions had been in existence for five years or more the durability of the extenders suggests they may be more than temporary in nature the analysis of temporary tax provisions is complex involving the examination of issues of policymaking and economics tax incentives are designed to alter the behavior of those who are the intended be neficiaries economic analysis provides framework to examine the success of tem porary tax provisions in achieving their intended outcomes extenders as temporary tax provisions the extenders are recurring legislative issue because of their tem porary nature each time an extenders expiration approaches congress faces the choice to extend the tax provision redesign it allow it to expire or make it permanent provision in the tax code the reason for their temporary yet normally extended character may be in part tax revenue temporary extensions have lower shortrun reve nue costs than permanent law although the ostensible lack of pe rmanence often masks the longterm costs associated with the provisions temporar tax provisions are often extended for one or two years at the most and at the time of extension the costs appear small enough to warrant nominal offsets as re quired under the payasyougo rule1 t increasingly the provisions have been exte nded for five and 10 years and have long term revenue losses similar to other permanent parts of the tax code extenders like all tax benefits affect revenue estimation as well budget estimates are required to be made assuming current law proceeds uninterrupted as result revenue projections are made assuming temporary tax provisions expire according to current law thus if temporary provisions are frequently extended automatically revenue projec tions may be inaccurate an example that illustrates this point is when tax writers are looking for revenue offsets to balance tax cuts in the 108th congress legislation hr 6 pr oposed several incentives for energy production some of the cost of those incen tives was intended to be offset by 10 billion increase in expected tax revenue for 2009 through 2014 from an ethanol taxhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32367crs5 2 martin vaughan gop support unclear for thomas tax bill congress daily am edition httpnationaljournalcompubscongressdailycredit set to expire in 2008 if the credit is extended rather than allowed to expire the revenue projection for those years is overstated2 it might also be argued that the tempor ary nature of the provisions is useful quite apart from revenue c onsiderations the temporary nature of expiring provisions allows policymakers to evaluate their effectiveness and allow for reassessment of their value on regular basis in theory extenders that fail to accomplish their purpose could be allowed to expire yet only one extender corporate deduction for group legal services provided to employees has been allowed to expire in the past 25 years that provision expired in 1993 if provisions are thought to be ineff ective policy alternative to allowing temporary provisions to expire is to re design them as an example congress replaced the targeted jobs tax credit which was enacted in 1978 with the work opportunity tax credit in the small bu siness job protection act of 1996 pl 104 188 the temporary credit was in itially effective for one ear and then reauthorized by the taxpayer relief act of 1997 pl 10534 which also modified the credit by shortening the eligibility time changing th subsidy rate and adding new group to the eligible population the extenders were not originally enacted at the same time many originated in one of the tax bills enacted during the late 1990s and so in th mid 1980s while their origins differ the provisions have increasingly been considered as group several of the extenders that expi red in 2005 had been most recently extended by the working families tax relief act of 2004 pl 108311 some of those temporary provisions were the work oppor tunity tax credit wotc the welfare towork tax credit wwtc the credit for holders of qualified zone academy bonds the deduction for capital investment in oil and gas produced from marginal wells and the cover over of tax on distilled spirits from puerto rico and the us virgin islands of those provisions si x had been extended by the tax relief extension act of 1999 trea pl 106170 three of the six temporary provisions had been originally enacted by the taxp ayer relief act of 1997 tra pl 10534 the three provisions were the welfaretowork tax credit wwtc the credit for holders of qualified zone academy bonds and the deduction for capital investment in oil and gas produced from marginal wells each extender is unique and addresses separate topic in the tax code consideration of them as group may ignor some of the stre ngths and weaknesses specific to individual provisions ideally the purpose of each expiring provision should be clear as well as th appropriateness of using the tax code to subsidize the targeted objective as opposed to direct subsidy additionally the benefits of the provisions should be examined to deter mine if they outweigh the costs of the provisions and to ensure that forgoing the tax revenue from the activity is justified relative to other policy goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32367crs6 3 market failure occurs when the marginal be nefit of an action does not equal the marginal cost for example polluting forms of energy pr oduction cause social costs that are not taken into account by the producer hence there is an argument for taxing this type of energy or alternatively subsidiz ing less polluting firmstreating permanent provisions as temporary also leads to uncertainty for government and taxpayer planning and causes in some cases significant impacts when taxpayers are uncertain whether temporary provisions will be extended they may have difficulty making reliable and effective business plans an example of government uncertainty involves state empl oyment agencies that certify the workers who qualify for the work opportunity ta x credit and the welfaretowork tax credit if those credits are not extended the state certification workers would need to be reassigned to other tasks if the credits are reinstated the states would then have to reassign the workers second time those workers would also face backlog of pending certifications created during the lapse of the temporary provision extenders as tax benefits temporary tax benefits are form of federal subsidy that treats eligible activities favorably compared to others and channels economic resources into qua lified uses extenders in fluence how economic actors behave and how the economys resources ar employed like all tax benefits economic theory suggests every extender can be evaluated by looking at the impact on economic efficiency equity and simp licity temporary tax provisions may be efficient and effective in accomplishing th eir intended purpose though not equitable alternatively an extender may be equitable but not efficient policymakers may have to choose the economic objectives that ma tter most doing so on casebycase basis for extenders may prove to be the be st option to achieve the desired results efficiency extenders often provide subsidie s to encourage more activity than would otherwise be undertaken accordin g to economic theory in most cases an economy best satisfies the wants and needs of its participants if markets operate free from distortions by taxes and other factors market failures however may occur in some instances and economic efficien cy may actually be improved by tax distortions3 thus the ability of extenders to improve economic welfare depends on whether or not the extender is remedying market failure according to theory an extender lowers efficiency if it distorts be havior in the absence of market failure an extender is also considered effective to the degree that it stimulates the desired activity better than direct subsidy direct spending programs are often more successful at targeting resources than indirect subsidies made through the tax system fairness tax is considered to be fair when it contributes to socially desirable distribution of the tax burden tax benefits such as the extenders can result in individuals with similar incomes and ex penses paying differing amounts of tax depending on whether they engage in taxsubsidized activities this differential treatment is deviation from the standard of horizontal equity which requires that people in equal positions s hould be treated equally another component of fairne ss in taxation is vertical equity which requires that tax burdens be distributed fairly among people with different abilities to pay mosthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32367crs7 extenders benefit those who have sufficien t income to pay tax those individuals without sufficient income to pay tax do not have the opportunity to benefit from extenders the disproportiona benefit of tax expend itures to individuals with higher incomes reduces the progressivity of the tax system which is often viewed as reduction in equity an example of the effect tax benefit can have on vertical equity violation can be seen by identifying two individual teachers who have both incurred 250 in classroomrelated expenses nd are eligible to claim th abovetheline deduction for expenses yet the tax benefit to the two differs if they are in different tax brackets teacher with lower income who may be in the 15 income tax bracket receives deduction with value of 3750 while another teacher in the 31 bracket receives deduction value of 7750 thus the higher income taxpayer with presumably greater ability to pay taxes r eceives greater benefit than the lower income taxpayer simplicity extenders contribute to the comp lexity of the ta x code and raise the cost of administering the tax system those costs which can be difficult to isolate and measure are rarely included in the costbenefit analysis of temporary tax provisions the complexity of the tax code adds to the time cost of taxpayers in either learning how to claim various incen tives and doing so or an increased direct cost of paying tax prof essionals to perform the service for the taxpayer temporary tax credits some of the temporary provi sions scheduled to expire are tax credits which are incentives that when claimed reduce the taxpayers income tax liability in general tax credit is more valuable than simila r tax deduction tax credit reduces the tax paid
