western hemisphere countries supply the united states with 50 of its imported crude oil three countries in the hemispherecanada mexico and venezuelaaccount for the lions share other significant oil producers in the region include ecuador colombia brazil trinidad and tobago and argentina in terms of proven oil reserves the western hemisphere has about 24 of reserves worldwide after canada venezuela has the second largest amount of proven oil reserves in the hemisphere almost 87 billion barrels but this does not include as much as 270 billion barrels of extraheavy and bitumen deposits from the orinoco belt if these deposits became recoverable venezuelas proven reserves would exceed those of saudi arabia in terms of natural gas the united states has the largest amount of proven reserves in the hemisphere about 39 followed by venezuela almost 31 canada trinidad and tobago and bolivia also have sizeable reserves almost all of the gas imported by pipeline into the united states comes from canada while trinidad and tobago accounted for about 58 of us liquified natural gas imports in 2007 while oil and gas producers such as venezuela mexico argentina bolivia colombia ecuador and trinidad and tobago are net energy exporters most other latin american and caribbean nations are net energy importers moreover with the exception of trinidad and tobago most caribbean and central american nations are highly dependent on energy imports high oil prices have spurred the rise of resource nationalism in several latin american energy producing countries which has raised concerns about access to energy resources and political interference with the level of energy production and investment in the region such nationalism is often fueled by poverty and appears to be strongest in countries where people believe that they are not benefitting from the exploitation of their countries natural resources yet many analysts assert that such nationalism is logical outcome of higher energy prices and is similar to the actions by energyproducing countri around the world that want to capture more of the profit from their natural resources this report examines latin americas current political environment and its apparent effect on energy production in the region it also discusses efforts to help many latin american and caribbean countries dependent on energy imports including

states is the top oil consumer in the world consuming some 207 million barrels of oil per day mbd in 2006 according to department of energy statistics with net oil imports accounting for 123 mbd or almost 60 of the total2 western hemisphere countries supplied the united states with about 46 of total crude oil and petroleum product imports and almost 50 of us crude oil imports in 2007 three countries in the hemispherecanada mexico and venezuelaaccount for the lions share of us crude oil imports from the region while other latin american and caribbean countries account for the balance other significant oil producers in the region include ecuador brazil colombia trinidad and tobago and argentina see table 1 in terms of proven oil reserves the western hemisphere has some 321 billion barrels about 24 of reserves worldwide canada leads the pack with almost 179 billion barrels with over 95 of its oil extracted from albertas tar sands which is replacing output from aging conventional fields venezuela is second in the hemisphere with 87 billion barrels of proven oil reserves this figure does not however include as much as 270 billion barrels of extraheavy and bitumen deposits from the orinoco belt in central venezuela though proven oil reserves will likely amount to more than 20 of this amount once the deposits are certified as recoverable 3 other countries with significant oil reserves include the united states with about 21 billion barrels brazil and mexico with about 12 billion barrels ea ch and ecuador with almost 5 billion barrels of reserves cuba also potentially has almost 5 billion barrels of reserves in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico but these are still not proven see table 2 western hemisphere nations including the united states produced about 172 million barrels of oil per day mpd in 2007 amounting to almost 24 of worldwide production the top producers were the united states 51 mpd mexico 31 mpd venezuela almost 24 mpd and canada 26 mpd oil production in number of countries declined in 2007 including in venezuela where the government has asserted majority control over projects with foreign oil company participation and in mexico where production and reserves have been falling for the last several years largely because of depletion of the cantarell oil field in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico in several other countries however such as canada and brazil oil production has been increasing the outlook appears good for brazil to increase its oil reserves and production substantially see table 3 the united states is the top consumer of natural gas in the world with about 231 trillion cubic feet tcf consumed in 2007 and net gas imports of about 38 tcf or almost 16 of total us natural gas consumption canada accounted for the almost all of the 38 tcf in natural gas imported by pipeline in 2007 while small amount was imported from mexico trinidad tobago accounted for 05 tcf in us liquified natural gas lng imports in 2007 about 58 of total us lng imports while other lng supp liers included egypt nigeria and algeria 4 1 statistics in this section are drawn from worldwide look at reserves and production oil gas

countries natural resources yet many analysts assert that such nationalism is logical outcome of higher energy prices and closely follows the actions taken by energyproducing countries around the world that want to capture more of the profit from their natural resources7 the populist government of hugo chávez in oilrich venezuela has asserted firmer state control over the staterun oil company petróleos venezuela pdvsa steering more of its proceeds to fund the governments infrastructure projects and social programs and asserting government control over foreign investment in the petroleum sector in venezuela the government of evo morales in bolivia has fulfilled his campaign pledge of nationalizing the significant natural gas sector calling for foreign companies to be partn ers not owners of the countrys gas resources ecuador has moved to capture more of the windfall profits from foreign oil companies operating in the country and in may 2006 terminated the contract of occidental petroleum after long dispute over whether the company had broken laws in selling some of its oildrilling rights in ecuador to canadian firm in peru which is poised to become significant exporter of natural gas the 2006 electoral victory of former president alan garcía over ollanta humala an admirer of hugo chávez eased international concerns about the future development of perus energy sector in mexico the main energy issue is how to deal with declining oil reserves and insufficient funds for maintenance and exploration and whether mexico will open its statecontrolled oil production to private and foreign investment because of rising resource nationalism foreign oil companies in number of latin american countries are having to pay more to do business in terms of increased taxes and royalties some observers fear that this could slow foreign investment in the regions energy sectors which is already hindered by political and social instability in some countries others contend that foreign companies will continue to invest where there is likelihood of profit 8 some energyproducing countries in the region such as brazil and colombia continue to follow capitalist model for energy investment that allows foreign companies to own and operate energy concessions nevertheless across the region there is continuing underinvestment in energy infrastructure with some analysts maintaining that many countries are at risk for widespread electricity shortages9 in the case of colombia the situation has been exacerbated by long civil conflict that makes resource exploitation difficult and costly there has been some concern about the potential for heightened competition for latin american energy resources from countries like china and india which are seeking new sources for their growing energy needs the chinese government has been acquiring interests in exploration and production abroad including in latin america ch ina and venezuela have signed series of energyrelated agreements since 2005 including joint ventures for oil and gas exploration in venezuela and to increase venezuelas supply of oil to china the staterun china petrochemical corporation

not send one more drop of oil to the us if the united states or its lackeys in venezuela try new coup fail to recognize the elections or try to overthrow the oil industry many observers believe chávezs threats have been merely part of his rhetoric that is designed to bolster his domestic political support venezuelas ambassador to the united states asserted in july 2006 that oilcutoff comments by venezuelan officials including president chávez only reflect what would be venezuelas response against aggression initiated by the us government24 once again in february 2008 president chávez once again threatened to stop oil exports to the united states this time if exxonmobil was successful in freezing billions in venezuela oil assets in dispute over compensation for its orinoco oil investments state department officials played down the threat pointing out that chávez has made the same threat in the past but has never cut oil25 week later on february 17 chávez said that he would only stop sending oil if the united states attacked venezuela26 because of these comments however some observers have raised questions about the reliability of venezuela as major supplier of foreign oil there are also concerns that venezuela is looking to develop china as replacement market although venezuelan officials maintain that they are only attempting to diversify venezuelas oil markets energy analysts maintain that there are two major difficulties with venezuela substantially increasing its exports to china first chinas limited capability to refine venezuelas heavy crude oil and second high freight costs because of the large distance between the two countries 27 nevertheless pdvsa announced in may 2006 that it would buy 18 oil tankers from china that would help venezuela increase its oil exports to asia the us energy information administration eia estimates that venezuelas oil exports to china grew from 39000 bpd in 2005 to 80000 bpd in 2006 low compared to venezuelas oil exports to the united states which amounted to 141 million bpd in 2006 according to the eia the us market will likely remain venezuelas most important market for the foreseeable future 28 in june 2006 the government accountability office gao issued report requested by senate foreign relations committee chairman richard lugar on the issue of potential venezuelan oil supply disruption the gao report concluded that sudden loss of all or most venezuelan oil from the world market could raise world prices up to 11 per barrel and decrease us gross domestic product by about 23 billion it also concluded that if venezuela does not maintain or expand its current level of oil production then the world oil market may become even tighter than it is now putting pressures on both the level and volatility of energy prices 29 energy analysts maintain however that venezuela which is dependent on the us oil market would plunge into economic chaos if it ceased oil shipments to the united states

billions of dollars in foreign direct investment fdi to better exploit its natural gas reserves bolivias chronic instability combined with president evo morales decision to nationalize the gas industry in may 2006 have negatively impacted fdi in the countrys oil and gas sectors lack of investment in exploration has meant that bolivia has been unable to fulfill its increasing domestic demand for gas and meet its supply commitments to argentina and brazil the bolivian government expects recent investment pledges from several stateowned energy companies to boost production by 2009 32 the gradual realization that bolivia has neither the technological nor financial capacity to exploit its natural gas reserves on its own has forced president morales to moderate the terms under which he carries out the nationalization of his countrys hydrocarbons industry33 morales sudden nationalization move significantly raised energy costs for neighboring argentina and brazil and increased tax and

in 2007 flex fuel vehicles accounted for some 86 of new vehicles sold in brazil 39 brazils experience with ethanol has not come without its share of problems however for instance brazil has at times had to import large amounts of ethanol when its sugarcane crop has been damaged by drought or simply fallen short of rising demand in addition critics say the expansion of sugarcane production has occurred in areas previously used for cattle ranching and soybean production displacing some farmers into the amazon rainforest finally human rights groups argue that the increasing demand for sugarcane has put undue pressure on the peasants forced to harvest the sugar under ex tremely difficult working conditions 40 the primary weakness in brazils energy sector has been the countrys overreliance on natural gas from neighboring bolivia some 50 of the gas used in brazil flows from bolivia both petrobras and the brazilian government seemed surprised when the bolivian government nationalized that countrys natural gas industry in may 200641 in response petrobras halted all new investments in bolivia and dramatically sped up efforts to exploit brazilian natural gas supplies which appears to be working in brazils favor in february 2008 petrobras announced the discovery of natural gas field in the santos basin of brazil that could be as large as the oil field it discovered nearby in the fall of 2007 as result while petrobras is continuing to make limited investments in bolivias gas industry in order to ensure that brazils shortterm natural gas needs are met those investments may be scaled back over the medium to long term 42 36 for additional information see crs report rl33456 brazilus relations by clare ribando seelke and alessandra durand and crs report

campaign felipe calderón called for limited opening of pemex to allow it to negotiate freely with private companies while his leftist rival andrés manuel lópez obrador opposed any opening of pemex to private interests given the closeness of the race with calderón defeating obrador by less than quarter million votes energy reform was not at the top of president calderóns agenda especially given the sensitive nature of the issue among mexicans after more than year in office on april 8 2008 president calderón proposed to the mexican congress some limited measures to allow pemex to contract out to foreign companies to help with exploration and allow private companies to build and operate refineries pipelines and storage facilities the proposal which was dubbed light reform by industry analysts prompted strong political opposition from the leftist opposition led by andrés manuel lópez obrador that has literally blockaded mexicos congress paralyzing its work lópez obrador has vowed to continue the blockade until the spring session ends on april 30 2008 49 some analysts maintain that since the proposal does not include any proposals for profit sharing even if it was approved it

account the energy capacities and goals of hemispheric nations when developing us energy policies and to under stand that us energy security will be lacking if other countries in the hemisphere are lacking energy security 58 many policy analysts also look to the potential role that foreign lowcost sugarcane producers can play in us energy security if the producers can export sugarbased fuel ethanol to the united states without facing stiff tariffs the council of the americas usbased busin ess organization representing over 200 us companies invested in latin america issued report in 2005

control in the energy sectors of several latin american countriesespecially venezuela and ecuadorthat will likely thwart investment increase inefficiencies and hamper efforts to increase supplies and production in mexico the report notes that the current regulatory environment and laws prohibiting foreign investment in the energy sector have dampened prospects for increasing oil reserves the report asserts that pending any favorable changes to the investment climate prospects for longterm energy production in venezuela ecuador and mexico are at risk while countries that have opened their energy sectors to foreign investment like trinidad and tobago will see increased reserves and production 60 an april 2007 study by the interamerican development bank blueprint for green energy in the

transport as well as the economic development of rural sectors in the region beyond brazil which has been the leader in ethanol development and production the study also highlighted several other countries with great potential for biofuels development guatemala and jamaica with ethanol production from sugar colombia with biodiesel production from palm oil and chile with secondgeneration

hemisphere benefits and impediments that examines the current state of energy cooperation among the hemispheres oil and gas producers and the opportunities for greater cooperation the study concludes that hemispheric energy cooperation would benefit from among other things greater harmonization of regulatory frameworks improved infrastructure such as new pipelines and lng facilities greater attention to the environmental effects of energy operations the avoidance of populist measures that provide widespread subsidization of energy consumption and recognition by the united states that its own energy independence is not viable without taking into account the needs of other countries in the hemisphere
