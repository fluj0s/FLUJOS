to encourage companies to undertake cooperative rd arrangements and to expand the opportunities available for research various laws have created an environment conducive to joint ventures between government and industry or between industry and universities as well as among companies beginning in 1980 with the passage of legislation mandating the transfer of technology from government laboratories and permitting certain contractors to retain title to inventions made under federal funding and continuing today in laws designed to make additional alterations 1 national institute of standards and technology technology and economic growth implications for federal policy by gregory tassey october 1995 612 crs2 to policies regarding governmentowned intellectual property there has been congressional interest in facilitating innovation through collaborative rd as cooperative efforts have expanded various questions have been raised regarding the outcome of these ventures among the concerns are issues associated with the dispensation of certain intellectual property rights when federal funding is involved what has been the effect of implementation of the legislative mandate are current government policies generating the intended results in facilitating joint activities or are there additional consequences that might need to be addressed the information provided in this report is intended to offer background for congressional debates over incentives to collaborative research patent reform legislation and other bills associated with assignment of patents and licenses resulting from federally supported rd cooperative rd collaboration in research and development permits work to be done which is too expensive for one company to fund or of marginal value for any given firm as new technologies are generated and their impact more widespread it has become ever more resourceintensive for industry to perform rd concurrently shortened product cycles have led to expanded demands for new technology and higher costs for technology development as reflected in the average 89 yearly increase in real terms in company support for such work between 1994 and 19982 the rising expense of research and development has been juxtaposed with increasing international competition and shareholder demands for shortterm returns companies have developed alternative means of acquiring new technologies while controlling the requisite costs various firms have increased efforts to tap outside sources for the research underlying their products particularly basic research for example over 90 of life science companies in the united states have had cooperative relationship with universities3 basic research is typically performed with little certainty that it will produce results in the future cooperative ventures permit businesses to develop critical mass of human technical and financial resources external alliances allow access to innovations without the expense and risks of generating them independently such arrangements also let large firms reduce losses if collaboration does not work by terminating the joint activity rather than altering inhouse research with its attendant large fixed costs4 joint ventures allow for rd that crosses traditional boundaries of expertise and experience such projects make use of existing and support development of new 2 national

ideas expertise and knowhow are combined facilitating mix that may lead to more creativity and invention it appears that merging technological knowledge and skills from different companies improves the innovation process5 in addition it has been argued that for certain industries the more extensive firms emphasis on external sources of technical knowledge the greater its total factor productivity growth6 it should be noted however that joint ventures are not always successful due in part to cultural differences between companies or organizations as well as managerial and financial issues or conflicting goals and objectives in addition to joint projects among companies industryuniversity cooperation in rd provides another important means to facilitate technological innovation universities educate and train the scientists engineers and managers employed by companies traditionally much of the basic research integral to certain technological advancements is performed in academia such institutions generally undertake fundamental research as part of the educational process without concerns associated with producing for the marketplace the risks attached to work in this setting are fewer than those in industry where companies must earn profits companies are increasingly looking to the academic community for research assistance prior to world war ii industry was the primary source of funding for basic research in academia this financial support helped shape priorities and build relationships after the war the federal government supplanted industry as the major financial contributor and became the principal determinant of the type and direction of the research performed in academic institutions thus the connection between the university and industrial communities was broken however in the past 15 years this break has been bridged for all the reasons discussed above industry funding for university rd has expanded substantially between 1980 and 1998 there was an increase of 285 in real terms between 1990 and 1998 the growth was 35 in real terms7 study by edwin mansfield of the wharton school of business demonstrated that over 10 of the new products and processes introduced in the 8 industries explored could not have been developed without substantial delay in the absence of recent academic research8 the federal government represents another source of expertise knowledge technology and advanced research facilities for industry in certain cases the government laboratories have scientists and engineers with experience and skills as well as equipment not available elsewhere the government also has vested interest in technology development it does not have the mandate or resources to manufacture goods but has stake in the

software the private sector is more advanced in technologies important to the national defense and welfare of this country interaction with industry offers federal scientists and engineers valuable information to be used within the government rd enterprise legislative foundation for cooperative rd of major significance to the evolution of cooperative rd was the enactment of pl 96517 amendments to the patent and trademark act commonly referred to as the bayhdole act after its two main sponsors9 this law was designed to utilize the ownership of inventions arising out of governmentsponsored research and development to facilitate the commercialization of new technologies through collaboration among the research community small business and industry it permits contractor performing research for the federal government to retain title to any subject invention arising from that work if the contractor is small business university or other nonprofit institution except under exceptional circumstances when it is determined by the agency that restriction or elimination of the right to retain title to any subject invention will better promote the policy and objectives of the law10 the institution must commit to commercialization within predetermined agreed upon time frame as stated in the house report to accompany the bill the legislation establishes presumption that ownership of all patent rights in government funded research will vest in any contractor who is nonprofit research institution or small business11 certain rights are reserved for the government to protect the publics interests the government retains nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable paidup license to practice or have practices for or on behalf of the united states any subject invention throughout the world marchin rights enable the federal agency to require the contractor to grant nonexclusive partially exclusive or exclusive license in any field of use to responsible applicant or applicants with due compensation or to grant license itself under certain circumstances the special situation necessary to trigger marchin rights involves determination that the contractor has not made efforts to commercialize within an agreed upon time frame or that the action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the contractor 12 9 for

authorized to withhold public disclosure of information for reasonable time until patent application can be made this supplements existing patent law 35 usc 205 that prohibits the patent and trademark office from releasing information associated with patent until it is issued licensing by any contractor retaining title under this act is restricted to companies that will manufacture substantially within the united states initially universities were limited in the time they could grant exclusive licenses to large companies for patents derived from governmentsponsored rd 5 of the then 17 years of the patent this restriction however was lifted by pl 98620 the trademark clarification act of 1984 according to senate report 98662 extending the time frame for licensing to large firms is particularly important with technologies such as pharmaceuticals where long development times and major investments are usually required prior to commercialization13 in february 1983 memorandum concerning the vesting of title to inventions made under federal funding president reagan ordered all agencies to treat as allowable by law all contractors regardless of size as prescribed in pl 96517 this however does not have legislative basis pl 98620 noted above further amended bayhdole by loosening the time limitations for both disclosure of an invention to the government agency and for the amount of time provided within which to elect to take title nonprofit institutions were subsequently permitted to assign title rights to another organization eg one that markets technology and governmentowned contractoroperated laboratories primarily those of the department of energy run by nonprofits were permitted to retain title to inventions made in the facility with the exception of those dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons development in addition the federal technology transfer act pl 99 502 allows firms regardless of size to be awarded patents generated under cooperative research and development agreement crada with federal laboratory bayhdole also addressed licensing of governmentowned inventions among the objectives of the legislation was the use of the patent system to promote the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported research or development and to ensure that the government obtains sufficient rights in federally supported inventions to meet the needs of the government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions 14 title 35 usc section 209 circumscribes the licencing of these type of inventions it permits federal agencies to offer non exclusive exclusive or partially exclusive licenses under certain conditions and with specific rights retained by the government including the right to terminate the license if commercialization is not pursued as provided in the business plan or if the government needs the license for public use small businesses are given preference and licensees must agree that any products embodying the invention or produced through the use of the invention will be manufactured substantially in the united states 13 senate committee on the judiciary report to

amended created institutional mechanisms by which federal agencies and their laboratories can move technology to the private sector as well as integrate industrial expertise into the federal rd enterprise additional incentives are contained in the federal technology transfer act pl 99502 and the defense authorization act of 1990 pl 101189 which allow government laboratories to enter into cooperative rd agreements cradas with universities and industry in pursuing joint efforts the laboratory may accept funds personnel services and property from the collaborating party and may provide personnel services and property but not funds to the other organization the work performed must be consistent with the laboratorys mission preference for cooperative ventures is given to small businesses companies which will manufacture in the united states or foreign firms from countries that permit american companies to enter into similar arrangements to date over 5000 cradas have been signed including nasa space act agreements15 the research and experimentation tax credit originally mandated by the 1981 economic recovery tax act pl 9734 and extended several times through june 30 2004 allows 20 credit for increases in firms qualified research costs above the average expenditures for the previous 3 tax years qualified costs include in house expenditures such as wages for researchers materials and payments for use of equipment 65 of corporate grants towards basic research at universities and other relevant institutions and 65 of payments for contract research it is applicable to 75 of companys tax liability small startup firms also are eligible investments in rd are often costly long term and risky to encourage increased private sector activity various legislative initiatives have been enacted to facilitate joint ventures among government business and academia it is argued that collaborative rd reduces risks and costs and permits work to be performed that crosses traditional boundaries of expertise and experience this is the intent of the national cooperative research act pl 98462 which clarifies the antitrust laws as they relate to joint research and eliminates treble damage awards for those ventures found in violation if prior disclosure to the government has been made these changes came in response to industrys reluctance to enter into cooperative efforts because of the threat of antitrust prosecution according to the department of justice almost 750 joint research ventures have been filed since passage of this legislation the success of this law in stimulating collaborative work precipitated the enactment of the national cooperative production amendments act of 1993 pl 10342 the legislation extends the provisions of the national cooperative research act to joint manufacturing ventures with certain reservations concerning location and ownership of the participating enterprises 15 for more information

foster collaborative work address the dispensation of patents arising from federal funding because of their role in providing an economic incentive for companies to pursue further development and commercialization of the results of rd studies have shown that research funding only accounts for approximately 25 of the costs associated with bringing new product or process to market patent ownership is seen as means to encourage the additional and often substantial investment necessary to create new goods and services for the marketplace in an academic setting the possession of title to inventions can provide motivation for the university to license the technology to the private sector for commercialization in anticipation of royalty payments the patent system was created by article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution to encourage new discoveries and their reduction to practice commonly known as innovation the grant of patent provides the inventor with means to capture returns to his invention through exclusive rights on its practice for 20 years from date of filing this is intended to encourage those investments necessary to further develop an idea and generate marketable technology at the same time the process of obtaining patent places the concept on which it is based in the public domain in return for monopoly right to specific applications of the knowledge generated the inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent as disclosure system the patent can and often does stimulate other firms or individuals to invent around existing patents to provide for parallel technical developments or meet similar and expanded demands in the marketplace16 the utility of patents to companies varies among industrial sectors an assessment of the aircraft and semiconductor industries found that patents were not the most successful mechanism for capturing the benefits of investments instead lead time and the strength of the learning curve were determined to be more important17 in contrast patents are perceived as critical in the drug and chemical industries that may reflect the nature of rd performed in those sectors where the resulting patents are more detailed in their claims and therefore easier to defend18 the degree to which industry perceives patents as effective is positively correlated with the increase in duplication costs and time associated with patents19 in certain industries patents significantly raise the costs incurred by nonpatent holders wishing 16 for more information see crs report 97599 patents and innovation

pharmaceutical sector 30 for major new chemical products and 25 for typical chemical goods and are thus viewed as important however in other industries patents have much smaller impact on the costs associated with imitation eg in the 715 range for electronics and are considered less successful in protecting resource investments20 despite questions as to their efficacy firms continue to patent their inventions the number of domestic patents granted to us inventors is growing21 this activity appears to be the result of additional perceived benefits including royalty payments delays to imitators and the ability to use patents as bargaining tools to meet alternative priorities of the firm22 the low expiration rate of high technology patents relative to patents on less sophisticated technologies may indicate the value that companies assign to such protection even in industries where the life cycle of inventions is short23 the research environment the considerable growth in joint ventures in industry over the past 10 15 years has been influenced by various factors the numerous mergers and acquisitions that took place in the business world during the latter 1980s led to restructuring that produced consolidations and laboratory closings and forced companies to look elsewhere for research24 the increased collaboration brought on by these factors has been accompanied by increased industry spending on rd as noted previously such measures were accompanied by the congressional legislation described above partnerships also are result of todays complex technologies intense competition and information overload that have required new approaches beyond the funding of scientists to pursue their own interests25 many companies now only support inhouse rd designed to augment the core businesses of the firm this is reflected in the shift in corporate strategies from basic to applied research and from corporate toward divisionlevel lineofbusiness research26 the

competitive position development of more new products or business lines and better operations or technology of the fastest growing us firms nearly twothirds are involved in strategic partnerships30 have partnered in the past three years firms that partner invest in more new product development have less new products although the ones that emerge are big winners grow larger than others in terms of employee size and gross revenues demonstrate higher productivity rate and experience explosive growth31 from the work undertaken by pricewaterhousecoopers it appears that collaborative growth firms are spending more on new product development while focusing more on bigger winners and on innovation and are not reluctant to go outside their organization to work with others in the development of their innovative new products increasingly industry is looking toward academia for the research necessary for product development there has been significant growth in industrial support of university rd according to figures provided by the national science foundation the private sector has funded an increasing percentage of the total amount of rd performed in academia since the early 1960s throughout most of the later 1960s and 1970s the business community was the source of 3 of total research and development performed in universities by the mid 1980s this had risen to 6 and in the

association of university technology managers shows that the commercialization of academic research in 1998 generated 335 billion in economic activity and resulted in 280000 jobs and the creation of 364 new companies this is direct result of the bayhdole act issues and opportunities as cooperative research and development between the federal government and the private sector becomes increasingly ubiquitous intellectual property issues continue to be explored the interrelationships between patents and collaborative rd are circular and complex laws addressing ownership of patents resulting from federally funded rd have facilitated collaborative ventures at the same time that increased joint activities have augmented the importance of patent ownership the expanding number and scope of cooperative efforts have given rise to new issues and opportunities since proprietary technology advantage is key business strategy39 there are ongoing concerns over the dissemination of patents arising from research and development supported by the federal government there are many benefits associated with the use of intellectual property to facilitate joint rd federal agencies and major research universities have acknowledged that the patent provisions of the bayhdole act have had positive impact on collaboration between academia and industry and on the commercialization of new technologies40 perhaps even more significantly dr bernadine healy former director of the national institutes of health argues that bayhdole is responsible for the development and growth of the biotechnology sector41 an industry that was in its infancy 20 years ago biotechnology now is in the forefront of national technological progress this was achieved to great extent by both the expansion of cooperative efforts among government industry and academia and by the intellectual property protection provided under the bayhdole act congressional legislation has provided certain mandates and direction however implementation of these laws has led to new questions as to their impact and any unintended effects for example the recently enacted technology transfer commercialization act pl 106404 addresses ongoing issues associated with the assignment of patents and licenses resulting from federally supported rd as established under stevensonwydler and bayhdole this law makes alterations in established practice to decrease the time delays associated with obtaining an exclusive or partially exclusive licence under pl 96517 previously agencies were required to publicize the

period to 15 days in recognition of the ability of the internet to offer widespread notification and the necessity of time constraints faced by industry in commercialization activities certain rights are retained by the government in addition the bill allows licenses for existing governmentowned inventions to be included in cradas the successful implementation of the legislative mandate to transfer technology has led to expanded use of cradas and to questions involving individual arrangements under this collaborative mechanism in march 1997 consortium of us semiconductor companies called the euv llc led by intel and including motorola and advanced micro devices signed cooperative research and development agreement with three department of energy laboratories to develop commercial applications for semiconductor manufacturing technology known as extreme ultraviolet euv lithography however concerns associated with this crada soon were voiced opposition arose over the participation of foreign equipment suppliers in applying the results of the collaborative work critics argued that the potential for providing foreign firms access to technology developments originating in federal laboratories would be detrimental to american companies and hurt national economic security interests proponents maintained that the law had been followed and the requirements for us manufacture and existing export control regulations are sufficient to address concerns over foreign companies in addition they assert since the consortium is funding the work in the federal laboratories it should have the right to seek out and use the best manufacturing technology sources42 similarly as successful collaborations have been established between the government and companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors questions are emerging as to the appropriateness of this relationship given the vast commercial potential of the results the particular nature of healthrelated rd and the substantial federal investment in this area have caused uncertainty over federal support of joint ventures in this arena many experts agree that closer cooperation can augment funding sources increase technology transfer stimulate additional innovation lead to new products and processes and expand markets yet others point out that collaboration may provide an increased opportunity for unfair advantages excessive private sector profits at the expense of the public conflicts of interest redirection of research and less openness in sharing of scientific discovery concerns also have been raised over whether or not industryuniversity collaboration alters the direction of academic research affects the results of the work andor interferes with the dissemination of knowledge the various laws facilitating cooperative rd have the potential for generating conflicts of interest within the context of partnerships companies and universities are anxious to secure strong intellectual property position to protect their financial and resource investments adding to the possibility of competing claims differing objectives may come into play 42 for detailed discussion see crs report 9881 cooperative research and development agreements and semiconductor technology issues involving the doeintel crada by wendy h schacht and glenn j mcloughlin crs13 in industryuniversity collaborations while academia promotes the free flow of information in learning environment firms typically prefer to delay publication of rd results to provide the lead time sufficient to capitalize on an idea research conducted by david blumenthal and his colleagues at the health policy research and development unit massachusetts general hospital found that over 60 of companies that financed academic research had received patents products or sales as result of cooperative work43 the majority of firms surveyed 82 require that academic researchers keep information confidential to allow time to file patent approximately onehalf of the companies surveyed reported that agreements with universities included requirements to keep information confidential beyond the time necessary to file for patent question therefore arises whether or not intellectual property considerations adversely affect the conduct of research at universities additional work by blumenthal et noted that 28 of university scientists engaged in life science research had received industry support comparing the activities of professors funded by companies with those who were not the results demonstrated that faculty members with industrial research support are at least as productive academically as those without such support and are more productive commercially however faculty members who have research relationships with industry are more likely to restrict their communication with colleagues and high levels of industrial support may be associated with less academic activity without evidence of proportional increases in commercial productivity44 it appears that collaborative work augments commercial productivity among some of the nations most distinguished academic investigators while not compromising their academic efforts45 faculty members with research funding from industry had more peerreviewed articles published and participated in more administrative activities at the university however there are risks that need to be considered the data indicate that investigators with industrial support are at least twice as likely to engage in trade secrecy or to withhold research results from colleagues as are investigators without such support those faculty members with primarily industry support over twothirds of their funding were less academically productive and the articles they authored were considered less significant as discussed throughout this paper collaborative research and development activities have had significant positive effect on
