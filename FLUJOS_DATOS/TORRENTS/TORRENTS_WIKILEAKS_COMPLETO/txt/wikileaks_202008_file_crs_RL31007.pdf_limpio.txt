issues corps of engineers funding for the corps civil works program has often been contentious issue between the administration and congress with final appropriations typically providing more funding than requested by the administration regardless of which political party controls the white house and congress for fy2001 for example congress added 480 million 12 to the 408 billion requested by the clinton administration similarly the fy2002 bill as passed the house would have funded the corps at almost 15 more than requested by the bush administration and the final bill appropriated slightly more than that proposed corps reforms the corps has come under increasing criticism over the way it evaluates and undertakes its projects some have called for major agency reforms others have called for review of corps programs and policies the 106th congress in passing the water resources development act wrda of 2000 pl 106541 section 216 directed the corps to contract with the national academy of sciences to study the feasibility of establishing an independent reviewhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31007crs4 panel for corps project studies further legislation proposing changes to the project development and authorization process was introduced in the 107th congress the house appropriations committee acknowledged the ongoing criticisms in its report accompanying hr 2311 and noted its belief that study of navigation improvements on the upper mississipp i river and illinois waterway was poorly managed by the corps the house appropriations committee also commented on the accusations that corps officials were improperly trying to expand the civil works program the report states the committee finds this criticism to be somewhat absurd the senate appropriations committee also acknowledged recent criticisms of the corps and stated it is satisfied that the corps has responded professionally to the issues raised both committees note that the corps has backlog of approximately 40 billion in projects for more information see crs report rl30928 army corps of engineers reform issues for the 107th congress auburn dam study section 103 of hr 2311 as reported from the house appropriations committee would have directed the corps to include an alternatives analysis of multipurpose auburn dam as part of its american river watershed longterm study however as part of the rule adopted for consideration of the bill on the house floor the provision was dropped congress has repeatedly debated complex measures to increase flood protection along the american river in california in large part to protect the city of sacramento proposals have included strengthening existing levees and flood warning systems changing the operation of an existing dam on the river and building large new multipurpose dam near auburn debates over the auburn dam and other water supply proposals for the area have been particularly contentious most recently during consideration of the water resources development act of 1999 environmentalists generally oppose construction of high dam at or near the auburn site while others interested in developing water supplies for the area have continued to support multipurpose auburn dam others weighing in on the debate have advocated strengthening levees and taking other measures to increase flood protection for the city of sacramento in lieu of building large multipurpose dam missouri river water flows after extended debate in both the house and the senate section 116 of the final bill included senate language that prohibits the use of funds to accelerate the schedule to finalize the record of decision for the revision of the missouri river master water control manual and any associated changes to the missouri river annual operating plan the provision was temporary compromise of an ongoing issue that had led president clinton to veto the previous years energy and water development appropriations bill the central issue behind the revision of the manual is how to operate dams along the missouri river their operation determines the timing of water releases which affect competing uses of the river such as barge traffic threatened and endangered species protection and upstream recreation in november 2000 the us fish and wildlife service fws issued biological opinion pursuant to the endangered species act which recommended altering dam operations to provide higher springtime water releases to benefit the pallid sturgeon this change is also believed by some to benefit other threatened and endangered species affected by current damhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31007crs5 operations the corps has issued draft implementation plan and is currently evaluating the effects of the proposed spring rise on other missouri river water users the corps is scheduled to release the new master manual earlier than 2003 the housepassed version of hr 2311 prohibited using funds to revise the manual if such revision provides for an increase in the springtime water release program during the spring heavy rainfall and snow melt period in the states that have rivers draining into the missouri river below the gavins point dam opponents of the house provision claimed it threatened to stop all work on the manual the senate version contained milder prohibition against accelerating the process during senate floor debate both sides agreed to an amendment to allow the corps to consider alternatives for species recovery other than the much debated spring rise recommended in the fws biological opinion the amended provision also directed the corps to consider the views of other federal and nonfederal agencies and individuals to ensure that other congressionally authorized purposes are maintained this language was included in section 116 of the final bill everglades implementation of comprehensive everglades restoration plan cerp was authorized in the water resources development act of 2000 title vi funding for cerp activities as well as other everglades restorati on projects is included in both the annual energy and water development appropriations act for the corps and in the annual department of the

vote samdt 1018 vote 238 the final bill included 30 million in the water and related resources account for projects supporting the goals of calfed however it did not fund the calfed program per the

the department of energy is major participant in activities to combat terrorism largely because of its role in producing and maintaining nuclear weapons capability according to ombs august 2001 report to congress see the online version at httpwwwwhitehousegovomblegislativensd_annual_report2001pdf the fy2002 request included 7925 million for these activities of which 307 million was concerned with weapons of mass destruction wmd in this case nuclear weapons this compared with 710 million appropriated for fy2001 324 million of it for wmd defense these funds are distributed among several activities listed in table 6 above the omb report does not specify how much is attributed to individual activities the major portion of this funding is for physical security of does facilities and the increase in requested funding would be directed to this activity 691 million requested for fy2002 compared to 594 million appropriated for fy2001 other doe activities identified by omb as combating terrorism include preparing for and responding to terrorist acts 47 million appropriated for fy2001 45 million requested for fy2002 and research and development 68 million appropriated for fy2001 56 million requested for fy2002 in its report filed october 30 h rept 107258 the conference committee said it expected new security requirements that arise because of the september 11 attacks to be addressed within the 40 billion emergency supplemental appropriation or to be included in the fy2003 budget submission the committee also directed the secretaries of the army energy and interior each to submit report to the appropriations committees by february 15 2002 identifying all known physical security requirements that have surfaced since the attacks and the degree to which they have been funded additional funding for does antiterrorist activities was included in hr 3338 the fy2002 defense appropriations and emergency supplemental appropriations bill passed by both house and senate on december 20 118 million was added to does weapons program accounts to increase security at nuclear weapons complex facilities and 226 million went to the nonproliferation and national security programs see below renewable energy in may 2001 the bush administration issued its revised fy2002 budget request for renewable energy programs at doe despite growing need for clean and affordable energy it proposed to cut renewable energy funding from 3757 million in fy2001 to 2767 million excluding funding for programs under the office of science decrease of 990 million 26 below the fy2001 level the final bill provided 396 million for renewable energy programs 120 million more than the request and 20 million or 5 above the fy2001 level for the technology programs the administration requested 368 million less for photovoltaics 195 million less for wind 131 million less for geothermal andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31007crs12 118 million less for concentrating solar power also for the support and implementation programs it eliminated the renewable energy program for american indians and cut 25 million from the international renewable energy program the house appropriations committee in reporting out hr 2311 reversed some of the cuts proposed by the administration the committees report language said the request has clear rationale to explain the selective budget cuts and apparent coordination with the national energy policy report at the same time the report cited 2000 study by the national academy of public administration that found an absence of clear goals priorities work program and milestones the committee report also stressed that doe technology programs are designed for long term energy solutions not immediate relief to the energy crisis which is better addressed by incentives other than appropriations the house bill provided 3768 million for renewable energy which is 1002 million 36 above the request and essentially level with the fy2001 appropriation relative to the fy2001 appropriation however the house bill included significant cuts in some individual programs under technology programs there were cuts of 59 million for concentrating solar power and 20 million for small hydro 91 million cut for support and implementation programs included reductions of 66 million to eliminate the renewable energy program for american indians 20 million for international renewables and 1 million for program support these funding reductions were offset by proposed increases of 60 million for photovoltaics and 80 million for electricstorage which included 40 million for the transmission reliability program and 29 million for the superconductivity program in reporting out s 1171 the senate appropriations committee noted that although the administrations national energy policy report recognized the importance of renewables the administrations budget even as amended it provided inadequate resources to accomplish these goals thus the committee recommended and the senate approved 435 million which is 1583 million more than the request and 582 million more than the house recommendation relative to the house recommendation the senate bill had 118 million less for photovoltaics and 15 million less for departmental energy management however it also included 120 million more for biomass power 110 million

surplus facilities the bush administration requested 2231 million for fy2002 35 million below the fy2001 appropriation the housepassed bill provided 2241 million while the senate approved 2641 million the enacted measure provides 2501 million about 10 million below the fy2001 level but more than 25 million above the request the bush administration requested 181 million for fy2002 for the nuclear energy research initiative neri program to support innovative nuclear energy research projects only about half the fy2001 level the final fy2002 energy and water development appropriations bill provides 32 million for this program the new nuclear energy technologies program would have been reduced in the administration request from 75 million in fy2001 to 45 million in fy2002 the enacted

below the fy2001 appropriation but the final energy and water bill increases the program to 7 million the doe budget justification contends that federally funded nuclear power research will help ensure the future availability of the only proven largescale power source that has unlimited potential to provide reliable electricity without producing environmentally damaging air emissions however environmental groups and other members of the green scissors campaign have targeted does nuclear rd for elimination contending that the highly dangerous radioactive waste that results from nuclear power eliminates it as an acceptable alternative1 controversy has also been generated by the electrometallurgical treatment of doe spent fuel process in which metal fuel is melted and highly radioactive isotopes are electrochemically separated from uranium and plutonium doe decided in september 2000 that such treatment would be the best way to render sodiumhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31007crs14 bonded spent fuel particularly from the closed experimental breeder reactor ii ebrii in idaho safe for longterm storage and disposal doe requested 158 million for the treatment program in fy2002 plus 100 million for further development of the process the 258 million total request for the two programs funded under nuclear facilities management represents boost of about 1 million over fy2001 the housepassed bill further increased the programs to 261 million the senate approved the requested funding level and the enacted bill adopted the higher house level opponents of electrometallurgical treatment contend that it is unnecessary and that the process could be used for separating plutonium to make nuclear weapons they note that the process uses much of the same technology and equipment developed for the plutoniumfueled integral fast reactor or advanced liquid metal reactor which was canceled by congress in 1993 partly because of concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation funding was requested for doe program established by congress last year called advanced accelerator applications aaa which received an appropriation of 68 million in fy2001 through the office of nuclear energy and the office of defense programs the primary purposes of the aaa program are to study the use of powerful particle accelerators for producing tritium for nuclear weapons and for transmuting longlived radioactive waste into shorterlived isotopes the house passed bill would have provided new funding for the program but the senate approved total of 70 million 55 million under other defense activities and 15 million to close out the accelerator production of tritium apt program the enacted bill provides 50 million for the aaa program including 45 million for research on spent fuel treatment in nevada funding was provided for apt the bills conferees directed doe to prepare report by may 2002 on nuclear waste transmutation options doe requested 384 million to shut down the fast flux test facility fftf at hanford washington the same as the fy2001 funding level fftf sodium cooled research reactor originally designed to support the commercial breeder reactor program has not operated since 1992 and had been maintained in standby condition the clinton administration had considered restarting the reactor for nuclear research and medical isotope production but decided in january 2001 to permanently shut it down the bush administration budget request appeared to concur with that decision however after the budget was issued energy secretary abraham suspended does final decision on closing fftf until late july 2001 to allow time for further study abraham announced further review of the medical isotope production option on august 1 2001 the housepassed bill included the funding initially requested for closing the facility the senate also provided the full funding request but directed doe to give the house and senate appropriations panels report after the latest fftf review was completed the enacted bill also provides the full funding request but the conferees specified that the money be used only for fftf shutdown activities until 90 days after receipt of the secretarys recommendations for alternative actions at fftf and the approval of those recommended alternative actions by the house and senate

directed doe to ensure that the nanoscience centers be selected on competitive peer review basis the senate approved funding to meet the full request for thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31007crs16 centers and expressed its strong support for the program the final bill included 3 million to begin engineering and design for these three nanoscience centers doe also requested level funding for the advanced scientific computing and networking initiative announced last year that are housed in the advanced scientific computing research ascr program the house and senate bill provided the full request for the advanced scientific computing program the final bill however reduced this amount by 5 million below the request in the report accompanying the final bill congress expressed its support for the scientific discovery through advanced computing program it also urged doe to ensure maximum involvement of the academic community in the ascr program the house directed doe to provide rationale linking the programs within the office of science and the nations energy needs it stated that doe does not seem to have clear plan or policy making that connection and that there was little coordination between the office of science and the doe energy resource rd programs neither the senate or the final bill however contained this language the house also directed doe to prepare an

appropriated for fy2002 compared to 5006 2 million appropriated for fy2001 appropriations conferees stated that the fy2002 appropriation was actually 4009 million above the request while the request included 2711 million for program direction activities the final legislation transferred that funding to the office of the nnsa administrator effectively reducing the weapons activities request to

senate appropriations committee reported s 1171 on july 12 with 60629 million for weapons activities energy and water subcommittee chairman harry reid said the bills funding was huge increase but necessary to get the nnsaprograms back on track the committees report srept 10739 noted such concerns as the long time before new components for aging weapons can be certified an unacceptable decline in the physical plants and the lack of progress toward establishing an enduring production complex the senate passed the bill on july 19 without amending the weapons activities section nnsa manages

w80 cruise missile warhead and engineering on the w76 warhead for trident missiles to extend the warheads life upgrade certain components and refurbish elements of the nuclear explosive package conferees expressed concern that the administrations nuclear posture review which was nearing completion when the conference bill was passed could result in funds spent by nnsa in early fy2002 being wasted effort accordingly the conferees instructed nnsa to minimize use of fy2002 weapons activities funds for weaponunique investments they expressed particular concern about refurbishing the w80 warhead given that dod had not budgeted any funds to extend the life of the airlaunched cruise missile which carries the w80 and accordingly required advance approval by the armed services and appropriations committees for using fy2002 funds for longterm life extension of that warhead campaigns these are focused scientific and engineering efforts that seek to develop and maintain special capabilities and tools needed for continued certification of the stockpile in the absence of underground nuclear testing for fy2002 there are 17 campaigns with requests ranging from 13 million to

weapons components and predict defects resulting from aging advanced design and production technologies 755 million vs 757 million which seeks to improve individual manufacturing processes integrate product information and develop the ability to fabricate complex parts in small lots and tritium readiness 1969 million vs 1670 million which is developing means of using commercial light water reactor to produce tritium an isotope of hydrogen that is key ingredient in nuclear weapons nuclear weapons stewardship rd below offers details on key rd programs including some funded by campaigns one campaign that has attracted much congressional interest and the greatest increase above the fy2002 request 1285 million requested 2190 million appropriated is pit manufacturing and certification pits are the fissile cores of nuclear warheads that trigger the thermonuclear secondary stage the united states has been unable to produce pits for use in stockpiled weapons since 1989 when doe suspended pit production at rocky flats plant co as result the united states has been unable to make allnew nuclear warheads of existing or advanced new designs the campaign supports two pit projects installation of lowcapacity pit product ion facility and supporting rd at alamos national laboratory and planning for highercapacity pit facility rd procurement and construction costs for the two projects might total some 5 billion over two decades the appropriated amount includes 2130 million which nnsa told congress in september 2001 was the projected fy2002 cost for the program 20 million for pit activities not specifically supporting the w88 warhead for the trident ii missile and 40 million for preconceptual design activities for the highercapacity pit facility in earlier action on this issue the house appropriations committee recommended the requested amount for fy2002 but asserted that doe cannot show that it has viable plan to manufacture and certify pits on the schedule dictated by national security needs criticized the project as years behind schedule and hundreds of millions of dollars over the original cost estimate and stated that it will judge nnsas success on how well the pit project succeeds the senate appropriations committee recommended increasing funding by 1092 million to 2377 million the committee sought to fully fund all relevant activities viewing the current schedule which would not certify pit for use in the stockpile until fy2009 as unacceptable readiness in technical base and facilities rtbf this program provides infrastructure and operations at the nuclear weapons complex sites the request included eight categories by far the largest was operations of facilities 8304 million requested 8978 million appropriated other large categories include program readiness which supports activities occurring at multiple sites or in multiple programs 1881 million requested 1920 million appropriated material recycle and recovery 1013 million 903 million appropriated and construction 14470 million requested 15531 million appropriated specific rtbf items in the final legislation include an additional 250 million for pantex plant an

years level except advanced computing which would receive 9 million less than fy2001 for fy2002 increased activity is expected on assessment and certification of selected weapons within the stockpile funding for advanced radiography is scheduled to decline because of the completion of the dual axis radiographic hydrodynamic test darht facility at alamos under the advanced scientific computing activity efforts are expected to focus on developing the 30 teraops supercomputer at alamos national lab and the visual interactive environment for weapon simulation strategy that would permit researchers realtime visualization of the output of asc computers under rbtf funding added by congress for fy2001 in support of pulsed power and microelectronics research at sandia national laboratory

than 200000 would be provided to wapa to conduct technical analysis of the costs and feasibility of transmission expansion methods and technologies bpa receives annual appropriat ion but funds some of its activities from permanent borrowing authority currently 375 billion for fy2002 bpa plans to borrow 3745 million to be used for transmission system construction system replacement energy resources fish and wildlife and capital equipment programs bpa also requested an additional 2 billion in permanent borrowing authority to address critical infrastructure needs the senate bill included the additional 2 billion for the permanent authority but the house appropriations committee said it did not have enough information to approve the increase increase in permanent borrowing authority was included in the final bill beginning with fy2001 the pmas were authorized to use power revenues from their customers to fund power purchases to supplement federal generation previously under the purchase power and wheeling program ppw the pmas used appropriated funds for these purchases one probable reason for the change was that the money appropriated to the pmas under ppw was repaid to the treasury rather than to doe this meant that the ppw appropriation was fully scored against the caps on discretionary domestic spending with which doe must comply the house and senate continued to favor this approach for fy2002 federal energy regulatory commission ferc the appropriations provisions for ferc are generally not controversial since the agency receives in fees the entire cost of operations in the version of hr 2311 reported out by the house appropriations committee however was provision prohibiting ferc from using funds to authorize construction of the gulfstream natural gas project which would pipe natural gas from the gulf of mexico from mobile to florida when the bill came up on the floor of the house june 28 an amendment by representative davis of florida to strike the prohibiting language was defeated by vote of 210 to 213 the provision does not appear in s 1171 as reported by the appropriati ons committee july 12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31007crs25 title iv

the nuclear waste fund and excludes the nrc inspector generals office key policy issues independent agencies nuclear regulatory commission the nuclear regulatory commission nrc requested total budget of 5131 million for fy2002 including 62 million for the nrc inspector generals office the funding request provided an increase of 258 million from fy2001 including boost of nearly 700000 for the inspector generals office major activities conducted by nrc include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors licensing of nuclear waste facilities and oversight of nuclear materials users the housepassed bill added 10 million to the nrc budget request to help cover the anticipated costs of reviewing new reactor designs and applications for early site permits for potential new reactors according to the house appropriations committee report industry has recently indicated intent to submit at least one early site permit application in fiscal year 2002 and several firms have already initiatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31007crs26 preliminary discussions with the nrc regarding new reactor designs following the house action the senate also provided 10 million increase from the budget request to cover the costs of new license reviews design certifications and site permits the enacted energy and water bill provides the 5169 million approved by both houses the house approved nrcs requested increase for the nrc inspector generals office but the senate voted to hold the office to the fy2001 level of 55 million the final bill includes the higher house figure bringing total nrc funding to 5231 million the house and senate appropriations committees sharply criticized nrc in 1998 for allegedly failing to overhaul its regulatory system in line with improvements in nuclear industry safety the committees contended among other problems that nrcs regional offices were inconsistent with one another that nrc was inappropriately interfering with nuclear plant management and that numerous nrc review processes were outdated and unnecessary but the panels praised nrc for changing its regulatory process during the fy2000 budget cycle and have continued supporting the agencys regulatory initiatives on the other hand industry critics have raised concerns that nrcs new procedures may result in relaxed safety oversight for most of the past decade nrcs budget has been offset 100 by fees on nuclear power plants and other licensed activities including the doe nuclear waste program the nuclear power industry had long contended that the fee structure required nuclear reactor owners to pay for number of nrc programs such as foreign nuclear safety efforts from which they did not directly benefit to account for that concern the fy2001 energy and water appropriations bill included an nrc proposal to phase down the agencys fee recovery to 90 during the subsequent 5 years two percentage points per year as result 96 of the fy2002 nrc appropriation minus 237 million transferred from the nuclear waste fund to pay for licensing activities involving the proposed yucca mountain nevada nuclear waste repository is to be offset by fees on licensees however the bill approved by the senate would have required that fees cover only half of the 10 million added to the nrc request to pay for reviews of new licenses permits and certifications the energy and water conferees did not go along with the senate position so the enacted bill requires that fees recover 96 of the additional 10 million as with the rest of the nrc budget for
