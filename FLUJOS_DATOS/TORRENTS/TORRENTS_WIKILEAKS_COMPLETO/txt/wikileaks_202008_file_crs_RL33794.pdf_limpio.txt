disclosure requirements summary the disclosure by professional lobby ists and commercial lobbying firms of expenditures or payments for grassroots lobbying campaigns continues to be an issue of importance to reformers both inside and outside of congress legislative proposals such as s 1 110th congress and hr 4682 109th congress had originally sought to extend public reporting requirements for some paid activities intended to stimulate grassroots lobbying the l obbying nd ethics reform legislation eventually enacted into law in 2007 the honest leadership and open government act of 2007 pl 11081121 stat 735 s 1 110th congress did not however include grassroots lobbyin g disclosure requirements as to the constitutionality of requiring ch disclosures it should be noted that the activities involved in lobbying in cluding the stimulation of grassroots lobbying clearly implicate and involve fr eedoms protected by the first amendment including speech associational rights and the right to petition the government the courts have long found however that some burden on these fundamental rights may be tolerated when law promotes significant governmental interests when the burdens on such activities are at the most indirect such as in disclosure laws and when the statute is drawn with enough pr ecision so that correlation exists between the information required to be disclosed nd the achievement of the interests asserted as the laws justification under such sta ndards the courts have upheld against facial first amendment challenges required disclosures in the areas of lobbying activities and campaign financing to promote the interests of preventing corruption and limiting the undue influences of monied and pow erful interests as well as preventing merely the appearance of such influence in basic governmental and democratic processes the apparent trend in more r ecent judicial decisions seems to allow the legislatures some leeway in determining which activities are relevant to the goals of preserving the integrity of for example their own legislative process and so to include also in required disclosures some activities that are more on the periphery and not necessarily themselves directly invol ved in such process but are intended to result in direct contacts and to significantly influence legislator in both state and federal courts state provisions that reach indirect or grassroots lobbying have increasingly b een upheld against facial constitutional challenges courts have recognized the gr owth of importance of these efforts in the legislative process and the increased need for legislators and others to be able to identify and assess pressures on legislators under the analysis applied in these cases it would appear that federal statute that requires only disclosure and reporting and does not prohibit activity and that reaches only those who are compensated to engage in certain amount of the covered activ ity would appear to fit within those types of provisions upheld in past cases when th statute is narrowly drafted to exclude groups organizations and citizens who do more than advocate analyze and discuss public policy even with the probability of such crafted statute withstanding facial challenge the law might still be subject to an as applied challenge if par ticular group could show r easonable probability that the disclosures required would result in harassment or reprisals against membershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33794contents background 1 constitutional protection of l obbying and advocacy

have been additionally made to report certain efforts to stimu late grassroots lobbying for clients or employers over certain amount4 secondly certain tities which were compensated over threshold

introduced nor the similar house version from the 109th congress hr 4682 109th congress would have changed the definition of lobbyist who must register under lda that is lobbyist to be covered must have still made more than one direct lobbying contact which expressly excludes solicitations to stimula grassroots lobbying6 the only additional registrants under these ty pes of provisions would have

that debate on public issues should be uninhibited robust and wide open13 and has in the past explained that expression on public issues has always rested on the highest rung of the hi erarchy of first amendment values14 the supreme court has therefore found that any regulations imposed by congress on such lobbying and advocacy activities may not unduly burden the exercise of participants first amendment rights15 even when federal regulation on public policy advocacy i nvolved merely disclosure and reporting requirement and not restriction which directly limits or prohibits advocacy activities such regu lation underwent rigorous constitutional scrutiny16 since as characterized by the supreme court in buckley v valeo the court has recognized the deterrent effects on the exercise

ones is undeniably enhanced by group association and that based upon the first amendment rights of freedom of speech petition and assembly the constitution guarantees the freedom to engage in association for the advancem ent of beliefs and ideas the court noted the chilling effect that certain state actions such as requiring the disclosure of membership lists may have upon th exercise of those rights19 there has additionally been recognized constitutional protection for as well as longstanding tradition in our country of anonymous political speech and pamphleteering in mcintyre v ohio elections commission 20 the supreme court overturned state statute requiring that the author of pamphlet or political document place his or her name and hom address on the document when the material was distributed in relation to an upcoming electionreferendum on taxes the court found that the purpose of the identification law in ohio was to prevent fraud and libel in campaign literature and to provide information to the voter but that requiring the author to put his or her name and address on the literature was inherently chilling did not provide for most voters generally useful information and did not sufficiently promote the governmental interests asserted as its justification21 governmental interest in lobbying disclosures the supreme court has thus recognized the potential threat of the chilling of first amendment rights in disclosure statutes which require identifications of those responsible for issueoriented advocacy nd persuasion concerning public policy and political issues however it has been noted as general principle that although first amendment rights are fundamental they are not in their nature absolute22 and the federal courts have increas ingly upheld statutory regulation in the area of lobbyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33794crs6 23 as early as 1853 the supreme court noted for example the problem of rich contingency contracts to lobbyists and refused to enforce any such agreement which is inconsistent with sound morals or public policy or which tends to corrupt or contaminate by improper influences the inte grity of our social or political institutions legislators s hould act from high consideration of public duty public policy and sound morality do therefore imperatively requi re that courts should put the stamp of disapprobation on every act and pronounce vo id every contract the ultimate or probable tendency of which would be to lly the purity or mislead the judgments of those to whom the high trust of legislation is confided bribes in the shape of high continge nt compensation must necessarily lead to the use of improper means and the exercise of undue influence their necessary consequence is the demoralization of the agent who covenants for them he is soon brought to believe that any means which w ill produce so beneficial result to himself are proper means and that share of these profits may have the same effect of quickening the perceptions and warming the ze of influential or careless members in favor of his bill marshall v baltimore ohio rr 57 us 16 how 314 333334 1853and campaign disclosures against facial challenges when on balance the governmental interest asserted in the regulation is significant when possible limitations on first amendment rights are only indirect as in disclosure statutes and where the statute in question is drawn with sufficient precision so as to promote and be relevant to the interests asserted as the statutes justification the governments asserted interests in preserving the integrity of fundamental governmental processes such as the legislative process and protecting such proceedings from corruption and undue influences from those who are paid specifically to influence them has been long recognized as significant important and compelling governmental interest23 these interests of promoting and protecting the integrity of governmental processe s from corruption and undue influences of shedding light on the workings of govern ment and in preserving the confidence of the public in the integrity and basic fairness of our democratic institutions are the interests that have informed the decisi ons permitting in the field of lobbying regulation as well as in some areas of campaign finance regulation required disclosures reporting and identifications which out of the cont ext of professional lobbying or campaign finance might otherwise be problematic from first amendment prospective thus the s upreme court has upheld the

1961governmental interest invol ved in requiring the reports and disclosure from those who engage in lobbying as that term wa s defined by the court the court stated presentday legislative complexities are such that individual members of congress cannot be expected to explore the myriad pressures to which they are regularly subjected yet full realization of the american ideal of government by elected representatives depends to small extent on their ability to properly evaluate such pressures otherwise the voice of the people may all too easily be drowned out by the voice of special interest groups seeking favored treatment while masquerading as proponents of the public weal this is the evil which the lobbying act was designed to help prevent toward that end congress has not sought to prohibit these pressures it has merely provided for modicum of info rmation from those who for hire attempt to influence legislation or who collect or spend funds for that purpose it wants only to know who is being hired who is putting up the money and how much it acted in the same spirit and for similar purpose in passing the federal corrupt practices act to maintain the integrity of basic governmental process see burroughs and cannon v united states 290 us 534 545 under these circumstances we believe that congress at least within the bounds of the act as we have construed it is not constitutionally forbidden to require the disclosure of lobbying activities to do so would be to deny congress in large measure the power of selfprotection and here congress has used that power in manner restricted to its appropriate end we conclude that the registration and reporting sections of the act as applied to persons defined in 307 those covered by the act do not offend the first amendment24 the supreme court in buckley and in mcconnell looking at campaign finance regulations recognized not only the significant governmental interest of assuring purity in elections but also ultimately the interest in mitigating the potential affect and undue influence of monied intere sts on the legislative process the court in buckley finding that disclosure requirement s generally appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of unwarranted influence and corruption concerning basic gove rnmental processes25 noted that governmental interests such as these may outweigh the possible chilling effect of disclosure statutes on first amendment rights the strict test established by alabama is necessary because compelled disclosure has the potential for substantially infring ing the exercise of first amendment rights but we have acknowledged that there are governmental interests sufficiently important to outweigh the po ssibility of infringement particularly when the free functioning of our national institutions is involved26 the prevention of both actual undue influence and the appearance of the undue influence of large monied

cashforvotes corruption to curbing undue influence on an officeholders judgment and th appearances of such influences27 with respect to contribution limitations the court reiterated its position our cases have made clear that the prevention of corruption or its appearance constitutes sufficiently important interest to justify political contribution limits28 in addition to the general federal lobbying disclosure laws there is currently federal law in force that is commonly known as fara the foreign agents registration act similar to th general federal lobbying w this law rather than prohibiting lobbying or information or propaganda campaigns for or on behalf of foreign interests instead re quires registrations and disclo sures by agents of foreign interests who engage in political or propaganda activities in the united states on behalf of such foreign in terests and also requires labeling of certain material distributed in the united states on be half of those foreign principals29 fara has been upheld against constitutional challe nges based on first amendment freedoms because the courts f ound that the law does not prohibit speech or expression but rather merely requires information from those engaging in such activities on behalf of foreign interests in united states v peace information center 30 the federal district court noted specifically that the law neither limits nor interferes with freedom of speech nor does it regulate expression of ideas or preclude the making of any utterances rather the court found that the act merely requires persons carrying on certain activities to identify themselves by filing registration statement31 similarly the labeling and identifying of publicly distributed material under fara was challenged on first amendment grounds in case concerning the distribution of films about acid rain pr oduced by the canadian film board and distributed in the united states in meese v keene 32 the labeling and public

expre ssion and that the law was not intended to prohibit edit or restrain the distribution of advocacy materials33 rather the court believed that the labeling requirement added to the information that the public receives rather than suppressing any information or expression to the contrary congress simply required the disseminators of such material to make additional disclosures that would be tter enable the public to evaluate the import of the propaganda the statute does not prohibit appellee from advising his audience that the films have not been officially censured in any way by compelling some disclosure of inform ation and permitting more the acts approach recognizes that the best re medy for misleading or inaccurate speech contained within material subject to the act is fair truthful and accurate speech34 finally as to governmental interests generally in required disclosures for activities in this subject area it is informative to note that the governmental interest asserted in the 1995 political leafle ting labeling case in ohio mcintyre v ohio elections commission was to prevent fraud and libel and not the deterrence of corruption or the appearance of corrup tion or undue influence upon governmental processes in mcintyre while overturning ohios labeling provision on leaflets which were intended to prevent fraud nd libel the court distinguished the lobbying and campaign disclosure cases and ex pressly indicated that contrary to the fraud and libel interest the interests of deterring corruption or the appearance of corruption of governmental processes was compelling enough interest to justify disclosure of for example lobbying activities35 disclosure of direct vs indirect lobbying it has been argued that in both the harriss and the buckley cases the supreme court made specific distinction that on the one hand provided significant leeway to the government to require reporting nd disclosures from those directly involved in or impacting the governmental processe s being protected as opposed to regulating those who are more on the periphery of the targeted activities and so do not directly impact influence or communicate with candidates lawmakers or public officials36 in harriss the supreme court found that the lobbying stat ute as the court interpreted it sought the disclosure of direct pressures upon congress 37

harriss supra at 625seeking to propagandize the general public38 similarly in buckley v valeo the court had upheld disclosure provisions on independent expenditures by narrowing their application to groups that engage in express advocacy in relation to candidates and who are thus more dir ectly and intimately involved in the electoral process rather than merely applying to inde pendent groups engaged purely in issue discussion39 and who thus have only tangentia l or peripheral imp act or connection to the electoral process candidates and public officials in the lower court case in buckley v valeo 40 the united states court of ppeals overturned former 2 usc 437a disclosure provision concerning i ndependent expenditures and that part of the decision was not appealed to supreme court41 the court of appeals stated there the supreme court has indicated quite plainly that groups seeking only to advance discussion of public issues or to influence public opinion cannot be equated to groups whose relation to political processes is direct and intimate in united states v rumely 345 us 41 1953 the court upheld resolution authorizing house committee to inquire into lobbying activities after construing it narrowly to apply only to representations made directly to congress and not to indirect efforts to influence legisl ation by changing the climate of public opinion42 in the context of lobbying disclosure pr ovisions as in the case of the campaign disclosure provisions reviewed in the buckley case the overbreadth doctrine43 may arguably counsel that the activities which are subject to disclosure requirements be carefully defined to exclude required disclosures relating to activities of individuals or groups that do more than discuss i ssues of public intere st or activities by groups engaged purely in issue discussion disclosure and reporting requirements which sweep within their scope the activ ities by issue oriented or advocacy groups who do more than publicly discuss anal yze or advocate positions on public issues might arguably be too remote and not have substantial connection to the governmental interest in lobbyin g regulation recognized in the harriss case that is the revelation of direct pressures and influences upon congress in order to maintain the integrity of basic governmental process44 for example in united states v rumely supra the supreme court in upholdi ng resolution authorizing ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33794crs11 45 345 us at 46 46 347 us 620 emphasis addedhouse committee to investigate into lobby ing activities which the court narrowly defined stated the following surely it cannot be denied that giving the scope to the resolution for which the government contends that is deriving from it the power to inquire into all efforts of private individuals to in fluence public opinion through books and periodicals however remote the radiati ons of influence which they may exert upon the ultimate legislative process raises doubts of constitutionality in view of the prohibition of the first amendment45 it does not appear that these standard s would however necessarily bar congress from requiring the disclosure of informa tion from groups or persons compensated to influence the legislative process and who attempt to do so through either direct or indirect grassroots lobbying activities nd communications in the first instance it should be emphasized that wh ile the supreme court case of united states v harriss was ostensibly decision that f ound permissible required disclosures of direct lobbying activities the supreme court in narrowly interpreting the provisions of the 1946 lobbying act expre ssly explained that the lobbying statute sought the disclosure of direct pressures upon congress exerted by the lobbyists themselves or through their hirelings or through an artificially stimulated letter campaign the supreme court in harriss stated as in united states v rumely 345 us 41 47 which involved the interpretation of similar language we believe this language should be construed to refer only to lobbying in its commonly accepted sense to direct communication with members of congress on pending or proposed federal legislation the legislative history of the act makes clear that at th very least congress sought disclosure of such direct pressures exerted by th lobbyists themselves or through their hirelings or through an artificially stimulated letter campaign 46 it is thus significant that the supreme court in harriss included artificially stimulated letter campaigns as among the direct pressures on congress that the lobbying law of 1946 could regu late by way of disclosures the kinds of grassroots activities which the various proposed bills seek to include in disclosures would

disclosures of such activities within campaign context while certainly valid in the past has become less relevant in more recent case law the supreme court in mcconnell v fec allowed certain limita tions on as well as disclosures about issue advocacy adver tisements in what were defined as electioneering communications when such communications regardless of any express advocacy of the election or defeat of clearly identified candidate occur within particular time frame near an election48 the court in mcconnell expressly denied that in the context of campaigns distinction between such communications is constitutionally based but rather was mandated in the past only by statutory construction plain reading of buckley makes clear that the expenditure advocacy limitation in both the expenditure and the disclosure contexts was the product of statutory inte rpretation rather than constitutional command49 furthermore the court found nor are we persuaded independent of our precedents that the first am endment erects rigid barrier between express advocacy and socalled issue advocacy50 the court in mcconnell thus upheld the disclosure requirement even for so called issue advocacy as opposed to the ex press advocacy of the election or defeat of an identified candidate when those issue ads ran in certain time frame before an election for federal office thus finding in effect that such groups do have enough of direct and intimate relation to the po litical process to justify disclosing the required information regarding their activities the supreme court in mcconnell cited with

tive processes appear to attempt to balance competing interests in such way as to promote societal value of increasing the opportunity effectiveness and thus the encouragement fo r participation in the democratic process by ordinary citizens visavis the more wealthy or organized special interests the decisions have thus in effect sought to reduce the perceived monopoly that wealthy individuals and monied interests might have in gaining the ear or access to public officials thus leaving room for and encouraging ordinary citizens to participate and have an impact on public policy in harriss

government pac allowed certain restrictions and disclosure of particular advocacy activitie s so as not to discourage others participation in government take away congress authority to regulate the appearance of undue influence and the cyn ical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in the democratic process53 in the ohio case dealing with identification labeling on political leaflets and pamphlets mcintyre v ohio elections commission the supreme court invalidated state law requiring the placi ng of the authors name and address on political pamphlets where it expressly noted that the plaintiffs activity was not coordinated with any public official ca ndidate or their organized supporters in an election but rather was independent activity pursued by mrs mcintyre54 similar in nature and analogous to the activities of volunteers in campaign which need not be disclosed or counted as campaig n contributions under campaign finance law55 these interests and values of citizen participation may arguably be consonant with the grassroots lobbying proposals under c onsideration since such proposals would not encompass and thus not require disclosu re of any activity by an individual for himself or herself nor would it reach any activity by those who are merely volunteershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33794crs14

that disclosure provisions generally appear to be the least restrictive means of curbing the evils of unwarranted influence and corruption concer ning governmental processes56 the court did note that the balance might be tipped in favor of nondisclosure where an organization may show that disclosure would result in harassment or threats of reprisal to contributors or members such that firs t amendment rights of association and expression would seriously be infringed by the disclosures the court in buckley stated there could well be case similar to those before the court in alabama and bates where the threat to the exercise of first amendment rights is so serious and the state interest furthered by disc losure so insubstantial that the acts requirements cannot be constitutionally applied but appellant in this case has tendered record evidence of the sort proffered in alabama57 as to the evidence which may be necessary to be shown by minor political party to exclude such group from the disc losure requirements of the campaign act the court in buckley stated the evidence offered need show only re asonable probability that the compelled disclosure of partys contributors names will subject them to threats harassment or reprisals from either governme nt officials or private parties the proof may include for example specific evidence of past or present harassment of members due to their associational ties or of harassment directed against the organization itself pattern of threat s or specific manifestations of public hostility may be sufficient58 thus although broad facial attacks on provi sions of law dealing with such things as lobbying and political campaigns where the law merely requi res disclosures and reporting of activities and the amount of expenditure s concerning such activities would face significant hurdle because of the recognized important and vital interest of the government in assuring the integrity of these processes59

not foreclose possible future challenges to particular app lications of that requirement60 judicial decisions and state grassroots lobbying disclosure the clear trend in federal case law concerning constitutional challenges to lobbying statutes in the states has been to uphold against facial challenges provisions of state law which require the disclosure of indirect lobbying campaigns which involve grassroots lobbying of the nature generally covered in the legislative proposals discussed while at least one state court has f ound disclosures of indirect grassroots lobbying to be beyond the permissible regu latory arm of the government concerning disclosures required by the word ing of voteradopted referendum61 the indication from more recent state court cases is that the courts will uphold statutory requirements for grassroots lobbying activities that is those activities that urge or direct others to make direct communications or contacts with public officials that are part of general regulatory scheme to identify pressures and influences on the government and its officials and to increase citizen confidence in the integrity of governmental institutions and processes the supreme court of the state of washington in 1974 for example upheld very detailed lobbying disclosure provisions of state law concerning grassroots lobbying activities in young americans for freedom inc v gorton 62 although the court there narrowly construed the act so that an organization engaged in such lobbying campaign need not disclose its membercontributor list63 the court found that some disclosureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33794crs16 63 continued p2d at 191 64 522 p2d at 192 the section of the re vised code of washington was 4217200 entitled grass roots lobbying campaigns and

sponsor of such program if such person has expended over the threshold amounts designated must register and report certain items including the names and addresses of all persons contributing to the campaign and the amount contributed by each contributor rcw 42172002c to avoid the constitutional infirmities noted the supreme court of washington narrowly construed the section in question to apply only to funds expended by the organization concerning specific campaign directed at specific piece of pending or proposed legislation and to require the disc losure only of those persons who had either contributed directly to that specific campaign or who had earmarked funds for that specific campaign such an interpretation woul d eliminate the necessity for disclosure of an organizations

were necessary to fill possible loopholes in lobbying regulation to strike down this portion of the in itiative would leave loophole for indirect lobbying without allowing or provid ing the public with information and knowledge re the sponsorship of the lobbying and its financial magnitude thus it seems abundantly clear and we are convinced that the right of the public to be informed is paramount to any inconvenience that reporting under section 20 rcw 4217200 may cause respondent64 the supreme court of vermont in 1995 in kimbell v hooper upheld the provisions of vermont st atute which required among other items reporting of indirect contacts to influence legislators65 the court there found that this scheme of disclosures and reporting was within the legislatures power to require as measure to increase the info rmation available about the confidence in and to assure the integrity of the basic legislative and governmental processes and that the supreme court precedents had not ruled out required disc losures in lobbying laws of indirect pressures on public officials provisions that reach indirect lobbying activities beyond the parameters found in rumely and harriss are not as plaintiffs would urge necessarily unconstitutional in fact the court intimated in these cases that congress could require more stringent reporting properly evaluating the governmental process and the influence lobbyists bring to bear upon it implicates indire ct as well as direct communications and activities needed to get the message across66httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33794crs17 67

proceeding by state agency69 the plaintiffs principal contention was that the statute was an ove rbroad intrusion into protected first amendment conduct because it swept within its scope not only direct contact with government officials in order to influence legislation but also could be interpreted to cover any action which could concei vably impact upon governmental action such as any discussion of the merits of any governmental action that may ultimately affect or influence such action and as such chills public discussions or communications in order to avoid the di sclosure provisions of the lobby law70 the court found however that the law may per missibly cover both direct lobbying and indirect grassroots lobbying activities nd construed the language of the law narrowly to that end so as to exclude c overage of broader range of pure issue discussion or public advocacy activities if the foregoing plaintiffs argument of the laws coverage constituted realistic appraisal of the scope of the new york lobby law this court would agree with plaintiffs that it should be st ruck down as overbroad however since this court believes that the legislation when put in its proper context was never meant to and in practice never will reach such activities the court declines to invalidate the law for overbreadth in that regard at the outset the court notes that harriss did not hold that only direct contact with government officials could be regulated by disclosure law the court held that indirect lobbying in the forms of campaigns to exhort the public to send letters and telegrams to public fficials could be included within the definition of lobbying activities united states v harriss supra at 621 n1071httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33794crs18 72 761 f2d 509 8th cir 1985

letters to all of its own members in minnesota approximately 54000 persons urging them to contact their legislators to support particular state legislation the court f ound that the disclosure of the sources of pressures on legislators through such gr assroots lobbying campa igns an artificially stimulated letter campaign to be in similar manner as the supreme court in harriss compelling interest and that the potential and incidental burden on first amendment rights in statute that prohi bits activity but requires only disclosure is similarly to the case in buckley v valeo subordinate to the publics interest in disclosure74 the fact that the original letters were only written to and between members within voluntary association di d not in the courts opinion change the outcome when persons engage in an extensive letterwriting campaign for the purpose of influencing specific legislation the state s interest is the same whether or not those persons are members of an associa tion the

league of professional lobbyists v meggs 75 the united states court of appeals for the 11th circuit in 1996 similarly upheld against first amendment challenges florida lobbying disclosure statute which required reporting not only of direct facetoface lobbying but also included indirect lobbying activities such as media campaigns within its scope the court there citing the interests of the government in providing information to the public and to officeholders about the various pressures and influences on the gislative performances of public officials recognized by the supreme court in both harriss and buckley v valeo said the league concedes as it must that the state has articulated legitimate interests and these interests continue to apply when the pressures to be evaluated by voters and government offi cials are indirect ra ther than direct in fact the government interest in providing the means to evaluate these pressures may in some ways be stronger when the pressures are indirect because they are harder to identify without th aid of disclosure requirements harriss appears to have acknowledged as much when even reading the statute narrowlyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33794crs19 76 87 f3d at 460461to apply only to direct communication it nonetheless defined direct communication to include artificially stimulated letter campaigns76 in both state and federal courts provisions which reach indirect or grassroots lobbying that is efforts to persuade urge or c onvince members of the public or members of ones organizati on to make direct communications and contacts with public officials on particular issue have been upheld against facial constitutional challenges the courts ve noted that the supreme court in 1954 expressly upheld required lobbying disclo sures relating to direct pressures on legislators by lobbying groups themselves by their hirelings or through their artificially s timulated tter campaigns additionally the courts have seemed to recognize the growth of importance of ch grassroots lobbying efforts in the legislative process and the increased need for legislators and others to be able to identify and assess the pressures on legislators being stimulated and financed by interest groups by such methods under the analysis applied in these cases it would appear that federal statute which requi res only disclosure nd reporting and does not prohibit any activity and which reaches only those who are compensated to engage in certain amount of the covere d activity leaving volunteer organizations volunteers and individuals who engage in such activities on their own accord out of the coverage and sweep of the provisions would appear to fit within those types of provisions which have been upheld in judici decisions when th statute is drafted in such manner so as not to be suscep tible to an overly broad sweep bringing in groups organizations and other citizens w ho do more than advocate analyze and discuss public policy issues ndor legislation even with the probability of such crafted disclosure statute withstanding facial challenge the law could still at some point be subject to an as applied cha llenge if particular group or organization could show reasonable probability that the disclosures required would result in harassment or reprisals against it or its member or contributors
