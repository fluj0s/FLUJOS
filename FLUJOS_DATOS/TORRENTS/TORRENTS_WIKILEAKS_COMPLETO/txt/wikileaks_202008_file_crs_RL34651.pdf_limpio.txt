betw een minors usually within the school context while laws that address cyberstalking exist at both the federal and state levels the question of how to handle situations that do not involve credible

fine legislators have traditionally enacted laws prohibiting child pornography child luring and child sexual exploitation however internet harassment potentially causes emotional harm to its victims as opposed to the physical harm inflicted by the aforementioned activities in addressing these concerns legislators strive to maintain balance between enacting statutes broa d enough to cover unde sirable behavior while simultaneously narrow enough to pr event infringement upon an individuals right to express oneself under the first amendment the first amendment protects certain fo rms of speech but this protection is limited within the school environment while school adminis trators have more flexibility in disciplining children whose speech disrupts the learning environment this flexibility does not cover all forms of internet harassment as internet harassment is relatively ne w phenomenon courts are just beginning to determine the constitutionality and scope of these school

enacted laws dealing with child pornography child luring and child xual exploitation however given its immediacy anonymity and accessibility the inte rnet offers forum through social networking sites2 for harassment and other social ills committed against minors the internets nuances present new challenges for federal and state legislators and law enforcement personnel responsible for defi ning and prosecuting criminal use this is especially true with the relatively new crime of internet harassment the term internet harassment usually encompasses cyberstalking cyberharassment andor cyberbullying these activities when committed against minors may cause emotional harm recent highp rofile cases involving teen suicides demonstrate the potentially severe consequences of this emotional harm as such legislators are faced with determining how to handle the problem various laws not specific to minors g overn traditional crimes such as stalking and harassment which generally include threat of harm these laws generally criminalize unlawful conduct that fails to ri to the level of assault or battery3 recognizing that the internet can be used to stalk or harass individuals congress and some states

harassment of childre n while these policy considerations are noteworthy this report focuses on the applicable constitutional constraints legislators may consider in drafting legislation in this area background congressional authority to legislate internet activities generally states assert jurisdiction over law enforcement authority within their borders however congress may legislate in the state law enforcement arena under certain constitutionally permissible circumstances for example article i section 8 clause 4 of the united states constitution authorizes congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states there are three categories of activities subject to cong ressional regulati on under the commerce clause congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce4 or persons or things in interstate commer ce although threat may come only from intrastate activities5 finally congress may regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce6 as the internet is an instrumentality of interstate commerce congress has the power to enact ppropriate legislation pursuant to this authority congress has enacted laws designed to protect children selected federal internet laws congress has enacted several statutes desi gned to address protection of children on the internet these statutes run the ga mut from establishing new crimes ie use of interstate facilitie s to transmit information about minor7 to expanding the scope of existing crimes ie child luring in addition congress has enacted laws designed to curtail both the downloading of ina ppropriate content by children and the uploading of impermissible pers onal information from

imprisonment of five years child luring in addition to the aforementione d protections federal and state legislators have enacted seve ral criminal provisions designed to punish internet users who hurt minors physically some laws that traditionally protect children such as those used to combat child pornography21 and luring have been expanded to apply to situations where an individual uses the internet to facilitate the crimes for example child luring consists of an adult knowingly and inte ntionally inducing child by means of computer to engage in sexual intercourse or sexual conduct22 majority of states have laws that specifically prohibit electronic luring or solicitation of minors by computer for the purpose of inducing them to engage in illegal sexual conduct23 on the federal level child luring is covered by 18 usc 2422b which prohibits the use of any fa cility or means of interstate commerce to knowingly persuade induce entice or co erce minor to engage in criminal sexualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34651crs5 24 18 usc 2422b states that whoever using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce or within the special maritim and territorial jurisdiction of the united states knowingly persuades induc entices or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charge d with criminal offense or attempts to do so shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than ten years or for life 25 stalking usually refers to harassing or threat ening behavior that is engaged in repeatedly california was the first state to criminalize stalking due to several highprofile cases including the 1982 attempted murder of actress theresa saldana the 1988 massacre by richard farley and the 1989 murder of actress rebecca schaeffer other states passed stalking statutes sometimes with varying na mes such as criminal harassment or criminal menace physical stalking can include fo llowing someone appearing at persons home or job making harassing telephone calls leaving written messages andor objects and vandalizing ones property activity or prostitution or to attempt to do so24 violators of 18 usc 2422b face punishment of fine and min imum imprisonment of 10 years or life internet harassment internet harassment is new phenomenon that presents challenge for law enforcement legislators educators and parents the term internet harassment lacks uniform definition but usually encompasse s cyberstalking cyberharassment andor cyberbullying it is worth noting that most cyberstalking andor cyberharassment statutes cover both adult and minor victims if one were to categorize these activities based on danger or greatest potential rm cyberstalking would be the most dangerous followed by cyberharassment and then cyberbullying generally cyberstalking includes credible threat of harm while the other two do not cyberharassment andor cy berbullying may cause embarrassment annoyance or humiliation to the victim some individuals use the terms cyberharassment and cyberbullying interchangeably while others reserve the term cyberbullying to describe harassment betw een minors usually within the school context in criminal context these activities are predicated on perpetrators desire to inflict emotional harm usually in the form of humiliation or embarrassment legislators are faced with several questions in tackling this problem as it pertains to minors when if ever should indivi duals be criminally liable for causing humiliation or embarrassment to another should new laws be created to cover such action or is it sufficient to amend existing laws cyberstalking cyberstalking refers to the use of internet email or other electronic communications to stalk another person25 cyberstalker may send repeated threatening or harassing messages or cyberstalker can urge other internet usershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34651crs6 26 these states are alabama alaska arizona california connecticut delaware hawaii illinois indiana maine massachusetts chigan new hampshire new york oklahoma and wyoming arkansas and maryland have enacted statutes that cover harassment via electronic communications outside their stalking statutes st ate laws that do not include specific references to electronic communicati on may still apply to individuals who threaten or harass others online but the addition of specific language might make the laws easier to enforce 27 cal penal code 6469 28 under california law electronic communi cation device includes telephones cellular phones computers video recorders fax machines and pagersinto harassing or threatening victim by utilizing internet bulletin boards or chat rooms for example cyberstalker may post controversial or enticing message on board under the victims name address phone number or email address resulting in the victim receiving subsequent unwanted res ponses each message whether from the actual cyberstalker or others may have the intended effect on the victim even though the cyberstalkers effort tends to be minimal due to the lack of direct contact between the cyberstalker and the victim it is sometimes difficult for law enforcement to identify locate arrest and s ubsequently prosecute the offender the anonymity of the internet also pr ovides new opportunities for cyberstalkers cyberstalkers true identity can be cealed by using different internet service providers isps andor by adopting multiple screen names anonymity leaves the cyberstalker in somewhat advantageous position unbeknownst to the target the perpetrator could be in anot her state around the corner or in the next cubicle at work the perpetrator could be former friend or lover total stranger met in chat room or simply teenager playing practical joke state and local law enforcement agencies are sometimes hampered by jurisdictional limitations cyberstalker located in different city or state than the victim may present more of challenge for local authorities investigating an incident even if law enforcement agency is willing to pursue case across state lines it may be difficult to obtain assistance from outo fstate agencies when conduct has been limited to harassing email messages without the occu rrence of actual violence several states have laws that explicitly include electronic forms of communication within stalking or harassment laws26 for example california legislators amended the state stalking law to expressly include stalking via the internet27 under california law person commits stalking if he or she willfully maliciously and repeatedly follows or harasses another pe rson and makes credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety or the safety of his or her immediate family the term credible threat includes threats that are 1 performed through the use of an electronic communication device 2 implied by pa ttern of conduct or combination of verbal written or electronically communicated statements28 table 2 provides list of states that have enacted cyberstalking statutes federal laws designed to combat cyberstalking exist for example 18 usc 2261a prohibits an individual from usin g the mail any interactive

foreign commerce to engage in course of conduct that causes substantial emotional distress to that person or places that person in reasonable fear of death however th is statute is inapplicable in situations where both the victim and perpetrator are in the same state or tribal jurisdiction29 while this law was amended in 2006 to in clude interactive co mputer service courts have not addressed the terms scope and applicability to the internet or instances of cyberstalking that cause substantial emotional distress30 in addition 18 usc 875 makes it cr ime punishable by up to five years imprisonment to transmit any communication in interstate or foreign commerce containing threat to injure another pe rson section 875c gene rally applies to any communication actually transmitted in interstate or foreign commerce31 this statute has been used primarily agains t threats conveyed via telephone32 however the law has been expanded to prosecute cyberstalkers for example in united states v kammersell 33 the court found that the term tra nsmits in interstate commerce as it applied to the offense of making threatening communication encompassed the alleged conduct of sending threatening ssage via the internet despite the fact that the defendant and victim resided in the same state the message had been sent from the defendants computer in riverd ale utah processed through the isps message server in virginia and then transferred to the victims computer in downtown ogden utah few miles from the defendants computer thus 18 usc 875 has been expanded to cover threats transmitted via the internet however threat must be one that reasonable person would take as serious expression of an intention to in flict bodily harm and would perceive such expression as communicated to effect some change or achieve some goal through intimidation34 in united states v alkhavaz 35 the court found that electronic mail messages between the defendant and another individual ex pressing sexual interest in violence against thirdparty women and girls did not constitute communications containing threat instead the court concluded the communications were attempts to foster friendship based on shared sexual fantasies36 one could argue that one of the limita tions of 18 usc 875c is its inapplicability to situation where an i ndividual engages in pattern of conduct intended to harass or nnoy another absent some threat also it is unclearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34651crs8 37 47 usc 223 was passed in 1934 when the telephone was at the cu tting edge of communication

courts have found the preinternet lephone harassment statute constitutional but concluded that it cannot be interpreted to include political or public discourse see united states v popa 187 f3d 672 dc

encouraging others to harass or annoy the individual it would appear that in some of these situations defendant may be prosecuted under the federal telephone hara ssment statute 47 usc 22337 cyberharassment while cyberstalking laws exist at both the federal and state levels they are generally inapplicable in situations referred to as cyberharassment andor cyberbullying depending upon the jurisdiction38 federal telephone harassment statute39 under federal law some instances of cyberharassment may be prosecuted under 47 usc 223 which carries punishment of fine andor imprisonment40 one provision of this statute makes it crime punishable by up to tw years in prison to use telephone or telecommunications device41 to annoy abuse harass or threaten any person at dialed number42 in 2006 congress expanded the definition of telecommunications device to include email communications ho wever the statute still requires that perpetrator remain anonymous43 although this statute covers both threats and harassment it applies only to direct communication between perpetrator and victim as such it would be inapplicable in situation where person harasses another person by posting messages on pub lic bulletin board or in chat room encouraging others to harass or annoy nother individual in addition it is worth noting that although the statute has been found constitutional that determination was made before the statute was amended in united states v bowker 44 the defendant made more than 100 anonym ous phone calls to televi sion news reporter during ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34651crs9 45

and constitutionally proscribable conduct 48 id 49 iowa code 70871 50 va code 182 15271sevenmonth period many calls were threatening and sexual in nature45 the bowker court reasoned that 223a1 c was not overbroad because the focus of the telephone harassment statute is not simply nnoying telephonic communications it also prohib its abusive threatening or harassing communications thus the thrust of th statute is to prohibit communications intended to instill fear in the victim not to provoke discussion about political issues of the day46 the court noted that while 223a 1c could have unconstitutional applications that fact does not warrant facial invalidation47 the court concluded that bowkers speech was not constitutionally protected because he called his victim predominately if not exclusively for the purpose of invading her privacy and communicating express and implie d threats of bodily harm48 courts have yet to address this statute as it applies to internet harassment state cyberharassment statutes examples of cyberharassment include sending threatening or harassing email messages and instant messages to another individual posting highly offensive and or hurtful blog tries about certain individuals or creating entire web pages for the sole purpose of tormenting and humiliating another individual generally cyberharassment differs from cyberstalking in that credible threat is not involved cyberharassment statutes vary by jurisdiction some are incorporated in general harassment st atutes while others are separate statutes for example the iowa harassment statute provides that person commits harassment when with intent to intimidate annoy or alarm another person the person does any of the following 1 communicates with another by telephone telegraph writing or via electronic communication without legitimate purpose and in manner likely to cause the other person annoyance or harm 49 virginias harassment by computer statute states if any person

classified as felony vams 565090directed specifically at students or school personnel and is malic iously intended for the purpose of disrupting school and has high likelihood of succeeding in that purpose56 however it should be noted that some of these policies are limited in their application57 for example in washington the school district harassment prevention policies are applicable only to

refined the tinker rationale as it applies to verbal expression or pure speech in bethel school district 403 v fraser 94 the court ruled that school officials had the authority to discipline student for violating school rules by delivering lewd speech at school assembly in fraser high school student gave nominating speech on classm ates behalf during an official school wide assembly for student government ections in this speech the student used sexual i nnuendos reaction to the speech was mixed some students yelled and simulated sexual acts while other student s and teachers were offended the student was suspended for three days and prohibite d from speaking at graduation in deciding this case the court shifted focus from the students rights articulated in tinker but instead emphasized the schools duty to incu lcate habits and manners of civility and teach students the boundaries of so cially appropriate behavior95 in addition the court noted the importance of protecting minors from vulgar lewd or indecent language96 as such the court concluded that the nomination speech had disruptive effect on the education process and that it was up to school officials to determine what manner of speech in the classroom or in school assemb ly is appropriate97 while it is undisputed that the first amendment does not protect offensive speech while on school grounds courts are less clear when the speech occurs off school premises for example in js v bethlehem area school district 98 an 8th grader created website that contained derogatory remarks regarding math teacher and principal99 most

the website caused at the school102 the student argued that hi s website was protected speech in reviewing the case the pennsylvania supreme court decided two issues 1 whether the students speech constituted true threat and 2 whether the tinker and fraser standards permit school district to discipline student for offcampus speech in addressing the true threat issu the court determined that although the website was in extremely poor taste it was not true thr eat specifically the court stated that we believe that the we bsite taken as whole was sophomoric crude highly offensive and perhaps guided attempt at humor or parody however it did not reflect serious expressi on of intent to inflict harm as the site focused primarily on the teachers physi cal appearance utilizing cartoons hand drawings and reference to adolph hitler103 the court then addressed whether first amendment jurisprudence permitted the school to discipline student for offcampus speech it dismissed the argument that the website was offcampus speech beyond th schools jurisdiction specifically the court stated that we find there is sufficient nexus between the website and the school campus to consider the speech as occurring oncampus104 the court made this determination because the student d accessed the site at school showed it to fellow student and informed other students about the site105 the court then reasoned that school officials c ould punish the student under the tinker or fraser standard106 under the fraser standard because the speech on the website was vulgar and highly offensive107 and

after his class had been informed of zerotolerance policy regarding threats the student also nt messages with the objectionable icon to approximately 15 other student s but not to any school personnel another student informed and provided the english teacher with copy of the icon the english teacher forwarded the information to the high school and middle school principals as well as to law

the icon was true threat instead the court applied the tinker standard and concluded that even though the icons creation and trans mission had occurred off campus it was reasonably foreseeable that school officials would find out about the icon and that it would materially and substa ntially disrupt the work and discipline of the school113 thus the appellate court concluded that the first

viewing the site the principal suspende d the student due to the schools policy regarding absenteeism the suspension resulted in the student failing all his classes117 in reviewing the students suspension th court determined that the evidence presented did not establish that beussink had been disciplined because of the fear of disruption or interference with school discipline but rather because the principal had been upset by the websites content thus the court concluded that the website did not materially and subs tantially interfere with school discipline as tinker requires118 as such the court granted preliminary injunction against the school district in layshock v hermitage school district 119 the court held that students speech right had been violated when the sc hool district failed to demonstrate nexus between the students parody of the prin cipal and substantia l disruption of the school environment the student created the parody profile of his principal on myspace by using his grandmothers home computer this parody profile displayed the principals picture which layshock d copied from the schools website the template for the profile llowed users to fill in background information and include answers to specific questions the student answered the questions with what were alleged to be objectionable answers for ex ample in response to question regarding alcohol use the profile read big keg be hind my desk the pr ofile also referred to the principal as big steroid freak and reflected that the principal was too drunk to remember his birthday120 the principal subsequen tly discovered another parody profile created by another student apparently there we re at least three parody profiles evidence was presented that indicated that other students had viewed layshocks parody prof ile during school hours in an attempt to curtail the creation of parody profiles the school officials sought to block students access to myspace the principal contacted myspace directly and succeeded in having the profiles disabled121 students joked and talked about the parody profile s while in school teachers interviewed students to determine the profiles creator

the school district faile d to demonstrate which parody profile caused the alleged disruption as there were three other profiles available on myspace during the same time frame in ddition the court noted that the school district had failed to demonstrate that th alleged disruption wa s due to layshocks parody and not the administrat ors reactions furthermore the court determined that the actual disruption had been rather min imal as classes were cancelled widespread disorder occurred there was violence or student disciplinary action as such the court concluded that the sc hool administrator

fortune tellers elena had relied on previously jury subsequently convicted the defendant on one count of harassment the defendant challenged the constitutionality of the harassment statute the statute

sending of electronic comm unications that annoy or alarm are unconstitutionally vague also the court noted that the terms harass abuse torment and embarrass are susceptible to uncertainties of meaning137 in addition the court determined that the statut fails to establish clear standard for whose sensibilities must be offended138 the aforementioned principles are also applicable in the school setting for example in flaherty v keystone oaks school district 139 the court held that the breadth of student handbook po licies pertaining to disc ipline and technology

or affiliated with the school district one of the messages stated that one of the opposing players mothers was bad teacher140 when school administrators were informed of the postings th student faced disciplinary action in granting summary judgment the c ourt found the school policies overbroad for several reasons first the polices were not referred to or incorporated in the student handb ook in add ition the policy authorizes discipline where students expression that is abusive offending hara ssing or inappropriate interferes with the educational program of the schools the court concluded that the policy did not comply with the tinker requirement that such disciplin should be reserved for those circumstances that cause substantial disrupti on to school operations141 the court noted that even if it did not find the policy overbroad it would find the student handbook policies unc onstitutionally vague as the terms abuse offend harassment and inappropria were not defined in any significant manner in addition the court found the policies not only vague in definition but also in application the court noted that school pe rsonnel had varying inte rpretations of the policies as such the court concluded that the policies were vague enough to result in arbitrary enforcement therefore th court concluded th at the student handbook policies did not provide the student with adequate warn ing of proscribed conduct conclusion with the proliferation of potential uses and abuses of the internet the crime of internet harassment presents challenges for law enforcement personnel legislators educators and parents these challenges are exacerbated by lack of uniformity in defining the terms cyberharassment and cy berbullying in addition jurisdictional limits and the anonymity of the internet sometimes make it difficult for law enforcement personnel to identify locate arrest and prosecute alleged offenders while states generally assert jurisdiction over law enforcement authority within their borders congress may legislate pursu ant to the commerce clause internet activities or congress may elect to adopt waitandsee approach monitoring state internet harassmentrelated activities and the types of behavior prosecuted legislators and school administrators continue to grapple with ways of combating cyberbullying in light of recent highprofile teen suicides while maintaining the free flow of informati on and opinion on the internet as internet harassment may cause its victims emoti onal harm as opposed to physical harm legislators must determine wh at level if any of hara ssment should be criminalized while traditional harassment statutes may provide some guidance in draftinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34651crs24 legislation andor school polic ies it is important to diffe rentiate between the oneto one communication of telephone or email communication and the onetomany communication of posting on public website in drafting legislation or school policies legislator s and school administrators must consider the constitutional constraints of the first and fourteenth amendments statutes and school policies must be narrow enough not to infringe upon protected speech in addition such restrictions must provide adequate noti ce of what activities constitute internet harassm ent while school administrators arguably have more leeway in
