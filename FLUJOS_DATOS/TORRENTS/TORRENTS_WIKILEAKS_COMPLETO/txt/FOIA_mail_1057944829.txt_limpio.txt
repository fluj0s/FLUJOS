from tim osborn tosbornueaacuk to tom crowley tcrowleydukeedu subject re fwd re fwd re climate research date fri jul 11 133349 2003 hi tom im not sure what format to try if ascii doesnt work for you ive attached the same ones again in case it was just some random reason that corrupted the files if this doesnt work then please suggest format i should try the name i have is yamal not yarnal yamal is coastwards northward of the polar urals and is at lower elevation than the polar urals record the latitudelongitude i have for it is 675 n 70 hope that helps tim at 2140 07072003 you wrote hi tim thanks for sending the data unfortunately i cannot open it can you send it in some other format tom ps what is the location of the yarnal site hi tom sorry for not replying sooner its been hectic week or two the new mann and jones 2000year series i dont actually have it appears in figure 1 of our eos piece of course but scott rutherford generated that figure i generated figure 2 for eos and that has the yamal tornetrask western us and western greenland o18 stack in it so i have these data and they are attached in the following files western us and western greenland are in file mann12proxdat i didnt have time to extract just these two series from the full file so the file contains 11 others series too please do not use the others because im not sure whether i am free to distribute them or not i just havent time to extract the 2 you want im sure i can trust you not to use anything that i shouldnt have sent the top of the file lists the 13 series and the startend years these are in the same order as the 13 columns of data that then follow the first column is simply year ad so you should be able to find westgrpfisherdat and wustreesdat the other files are tornadrcs and yamalrcs which are rcsstandardised treering width series i would really strongly suggest that you contact keith briffa about exactly what these series are and what the primary reference to them should be the reason is that there are multiple version of tornetrask and yamal series and the differences are certainly not insignificant im not sure what the units of any of these series are so i would suggest you normalise them in some way or do your own calibration hope that helps cheers tim at 1628 30062003 you wrote tim would it be possible to obtain the time series listed below plus the west greenland composite see below tom xsieve cmu sieve 22 xsender f028popueaacuk date fri 20 jun 2003 081057 0100 to tom crowley tcrowleydukeedu from phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd re climate research cc tosbornueaacuk xvirusscanned by amavisdmilter duke university 1httpamavisorg tom im off tomorrow to ncdc and then onto iugg so away 3 weeks in all ive asked tim whos ccd on this reply to send you what he can you also said sometime ago you would send your new long series and your latest nh average can you do this sometime mike and i are making progress on rog when we get back we will be working on the figures i realise you may want to add something once tim sends you the series so if i and mike can get something by july 10 that would be great we will be sending whole or part drafts of the rog piece around we have most of the text but we need the figures for people to look at as well so you might get draft in september have good few weeks cheers phil at 1233 190603 0400 you wrote phil would it be possible to obtain the yamal tornetrask and w us series you illustrate in the eos article i too am putting together slightly different long composite and would like to include these records would it also be possible to obtain the 2000 year northern hemisphere series is that 3090n summer whatever we have extended our forcing time series back to before 1 ad and would like to compare with some longer data thanks and regards tom dear all keith and i have discussed the email below i dont want to start discussion of it and i dont want you sending it around to anyone else but it serves as warning as to where the debate might go should the eos piece come out i think it might help tom w if you are still going to write direct response to cr some of freitas views are interestingnoveloff the wall to say the least i am glad that he doesnt consider himself paleoclimatologist the statement about the lia having the lowest temperatures since the lgm the paleo people hes talked to didnt seem to mention the yd 82k or the 423k events only the holocene optimum there are also some snipes at cru and our funding but were ignoring these here also mike comes in for some stick so stay cool mike youre married man now so lets keep this amongst ourselves i have learned one thing this is that the reviewer who said they were too busy was ray i have been saying this to loads of papers recently something tomw can vouch for it is clear from the differences between cr and the ere piece that the other 4 reviewers did not say much so negative review was likely to be partly ignored and the article would still have come out i say this as this might come out if things get nasty freitas will not say to hans von storch or to clare goodess who the 4 reviewers were i believe his paleoclimatologist is likely to be anthony fowler who does dendro at auckland cheers phil xsender f037popueaacuk xmailer qualcomm windows eudora version 51 date wed 18 jun 2003 092922 0100 to

considerable amount of my time on this matter and had my integrity attacked in the process i want to emphasize that the people leading this attack are hardly impartial observers mike himself refers to politics and political incitement involved both hulme and goodess are from the climate research unit of uea that is not particularly well known for impartial views on the climate change debate the cru has large stake in climate change research funding as i understand it pays the salaries of most of its staff i understand too the journalist david appell was leaked information to fuel public attack i do not know the source mike hulme refers to the number of papers i have processed for cr that have been authored by scientists who are well known for their opposition to the notion that humans are significantly altering global climate how many can he say he has processed i suspect the answer is nil does this mean he is biased towards scientists who are well known for their support for the notion that humans are significantly altering global climate mike hulme quite clearly has an axe or two to grind and it seems political agenda but attacks on of this sort challenge my professional integrity not only as cr editor but also as an academic and scientist mike hulme should know that i have never accepted any research money for climate change research none from any side or lobby or interest group or government or industry so i have pipers to pay this matter has gone too far the critics show lack of moral imagination and the cramer affair is dragged up over an over again people quickly forget that cramer like hulme and goodess now was attacking larry kalkstein and for approving manuscripts in hulmes words authored by scientists who are well known for their opposition to the notion that humans are significantly altering global climate i would like to remind those who continually drag up the cramer affair that cramer himself was not unequivocal in his condemnation of balling et als manuscript the one cramer refereed and now says i should have not had published and what started all this off in fact he did not even recommend that it be rejected he stated in his review my review of the manuscript is mainly with the conclusions of the work for technical assessment i do not myself have sufficient experience with time series analysis of the kind presented by the authors he goes on to recommend revise and resubmit for additional review this is exactly what i did but i did not send it back to him after resubmission for the very reason that he himself confessed to ignorance about the analytical method used am i to trundle all this out over and over again because of criticism from lobbyist scientists who are paraphrasing hulme well known for their support for the notion that humans are significantly altering global climate the criticisms of soon and baliunas 2003 cr article raised by mike hume in his 16 june 2003 email to you was not raised by the any of the four referees i used but is curiously similar to points raided by david appell keep in mind that referees used were selected in consultation with paleoclimatologist five referees were selected based on the guidance i received all are reputable paleoclimatologists respected for their expertise in reconstruction of past climates none none at all were from what hans and clare have referred to as the other side or what hulme refers to as people well known for their opposition to the notion that humans are significantly altering global climate one of the five referees turned down the request to review explaining he was busy and would not have the time the remaining four referees sent their detailed comments to none suggested the manuscript should be rejected sb were asked to respond to referees comments and make extensive alterations accordingly this was done i am paleoclimatolgist far from it but have collected opinions from other paleoclimatologists on the sb paper i summarise them here what i take from the sb paper is an attempt to assess climate data lost from sight in the mann proxies for example the raising on lowering of glacier equilibrium lines was the origin of the little ice age as concept and still seems to be highly important proxy even if little difficult to precisely quantify using much larger number of proxy indicators than mann did sb inquired whether there was globally detectable 50year period of unusual cold in the lia and similarly warm era in the mwp further they asked if these indicators in general would indicate that any similar period in the 20th century was warmer than any other era sb did not purport to do independent interpretation of climate time series either through 50year filters or otherwise they merely adopt the conclusions of the cited authors and make scorecard it seems pretty evident to that temperatures in the lia were the lowest since the lgm there are lots of peerreviewed paleoarticles which assert the existence of lia frankly i have difficulty understanding this particular quibble some sort of averaging is necessary to establish the slower trends and that sort of averaging is used by every single study they average to bring out the item of their interest million year average would do little to enlighten as would detailed daily readings the period must be chosen to eliminate as much of the noise as possible without degrading the longerterm signals significantly as i read the sb paper it was relatively arbitrary choice and why shouldnt it be it was only chosen to suppress spurious signals and expose the slower drift that is inherent in nature anyone that has seen curves of the last 2 million years must recognize that an averaging of some sort has taken place it is not often however that the quibble is about the choice of numbers of years or the exact methodology those are chosen simply to expose supposedly useful data which is otherwise hidden from view let ask mike this question can he give an example of any dataset where the sb characterization of the source author is incorrect i am not vouching for them merely asking sb say that they rely on the original characterizations not that they are making their own i dont see problem priori on relying on characterizations of others or in the present circumstances of presenting literature review while sb is literature review so is this section of ipcc tar except that the sb review is more thorough the mann et multiproxy reconstruction of past temperatures has many problems and these have been well documented by sb and others my reading of the ipcc tar leads to the conclusion that mann et has been used as the basis for number of assertions 1 over the past millennium at least for the nh the temperature has not varied significantly except for the europeannorth atlantic sector and hence the climate system has little internal variability this statement is supported by an analysis of model behaviour which also shows little internal variability in climate models 2 recent global warming as inferred from instrument records is large and unusual in the context of the mann et temperature reconstruction from multi proxies 3 because of the previous limited variability and the recent warming that cannot be explained by known natural forcing volcanic activity and solar insolation changes human activity is the likely cause of the recent global change in this context ipcc mounts powerful case but the case rests on two main foundations the past climate has shown little variability and the climate models reflect the internal variability of the climate system if either or both are shown to be weak or fallacious then the ipcc case is weakened or fails sb have examined the premise that the globally integrated temperature has hardly varied over the past millennium prior to the instrumental record i agree it is not rocket science that they have performed they have looked at the evidence provided by researchers to see if the trend of the temperature record of the europeannorth atlantic sector which is not disputed by ipcc is reflected in individual records from other parts of the globe their three questions how objective is their assessment from purely statistical viewpoint the work can be criticised but if you took purely statistical approach you probably would not have sufficient data to reach an unambiguous conclusion or you could try statistical fiddles to combine the data and end up with erroneous results under the guise of statistical significance sb have looked at the data and reached the conclusion that probably the temperature record from other parts of the globe follows the same pattern as that of the europeannorth atlantic sector of the individual proxy records that i have seen i would agree that this is the case i certainly have not found significant regions of the nh that were cold during the medieval period and warm during the little ice age period that are necessary offsets of the europeannorth atlantic sector necessary to reach hemispherically flat pattern as derived by mann et sb have put forward sufficient evidence to challenge the mann et analysis outcome and seriously weaken the ipcc assertions based on mann et paleo reconstruction of temperatures and the global pattern over the past millennium and longer remains fertile field for research it suggests that the climate system is such that major temporal variation as is universally recognised for the europeannorth atlantic region would be reflected globally and sb have given support to this view it is my belief that the sb work is sincere endeavour to find out whether mwp and lia were worldwide phenomena the historical evidence beyond tree ring widths is convincing in my opinion the concept of little ice age is certainly used practically by all holocene paleo climatologists who work on oblivious to manns disproof of its existence paleoclimatologists tell that for debating purposes they are more inclined to draw attention to the holocene optimum about 6000 bp as an undisputed example of climate about 12 deg c warmer than at present and to ponder the entry and exit from the younger dryas as an example of abrupt climate change than to get too excited about the medieval warm period which seems very attenuated version however the little ice age seems valid enough as paleoclimatic concept north american geologists repeatedly assert that the 19th century was the coldest century in north america since the lgm to that extent showing temperature increase since then is not unlike mutual fund salesmen showing expected rate of return from market bottom not precisely false but rather in the realm of sleightof hand regards chris prof phil jones climatic research unit
