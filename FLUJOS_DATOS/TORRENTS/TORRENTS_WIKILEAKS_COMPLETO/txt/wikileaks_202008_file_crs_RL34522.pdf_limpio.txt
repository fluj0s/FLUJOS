british india bangladesh gained its i ndependence from pakistan in 1971 following civil war that included military intervention by india whereas the partition of british india into india and pakistan was the result of religious division between hindus and muslims the partition of pakistan that created bangladesh was more the result of ethnic division and the desire fo r self expression by bengalis from east pakistan this double partition was challenge to the rationale for pakistan and points to the national component of bengali identity rather than to the religious component that has played an increasingly important role in ba ngladesh politics and identity in recent years14 bangladeshi politics have been characterized by bitter struggle between the bangladesh national party bnp and the

militarys position in society and avoid retaliation by disaffected politicians the extent to which there is uniform support for this objective within the armed forces is unclear general ahmeds term as chief of staff of the armed forces of bangladesh has been extended to june 2009 there has been discussion of proposed na tional security council nsc this has caused concern that the militarys role in

lead to further division41 it is thought by some observers that general ahmed is inte rested in becoming president there is also speculation that he and others in the military favor reform that would

political parties ve an islamist political age nda and are thought to have ties to radical extremists48 because of the near even electoral balance between the bnp and the in the pre2007 political environment the islamist politi cal parties ji and ioj in particular enjoyed political influence disproportionate to their support among the bangladeshi electorate the current split within the bnp appears to be creating more multiparty system in which islamist political parties may not enjoy the same degree of influence some analysts believe the parties abilities to be political queen makers may be less obvious with more potential political factions and parties islamists rioted in dhaka in april 2008 to protest draft law that would give equal inheritance rights to women this triggered
