region in 2007 the united nations reports there were about 225 million hivpositive persons in frica which has nearly 12 of the worlds population but about 68 of the globa l total of infected persons the adult rate of infection in africa in late 2005 was 61 compared with 1 worldwide but had dropped to 5 by 2007 compared to 8 worldwide nine southern african countries have infection rates above 10 in 2007 35 of all people living globally with hiv lived in southern africa where 32 of all global new hiv infections and aids deaths occurred about 90 of infect ed children globally live in africa where about 61 of infected adults are wome n as many as 30 million africans may have died of aids since 1982 including 16 million who died in 2007 accounting for about 76 of global aids deaths in 2007 ai ds has surpassed malaria as the leading cause of death in africa it kills many more africans than does war experts attribute the severity of afri cas aids epidemic to poverty lack of female empowerment high ra tes of male worker migrati on and other factors many national health systems ar illequipped for prevention diagnosis and treatment aids causes severe socioeconomic cons equences eg declines in economic productivity due to sharp drops in life exp ectancy and the loss of skilled workers it also devastates family structures there are about 114 million african aids orphans many of whom lack access to ad equate nutrition and social services private organizations and the governme nts of donor and african nations have responded by supporting diverse efforts to prevent and reduce the rate of new infections and by trying to abate damage done by aids to families societies and economies the adequacy of this res ponse is much debated an estimated 13 million africa aids patients receiving antiret roviral arv drug treatment in late 2005 up from 150000 in mid2004 an estimated 48 million africans needed such therapy in late 2005 us and other in itiatives are reportedly sharply

that typically destroys or impairs the immune system and is acquired through infection by strains of the human immunodeficiency virus commonly known as hiv the two acronyms are often joined to form the compound term hivaids 4 unaids the joint united nations program on hivaids helps coordinate the aidsrelated efforts of ten and multilateral program and donor agencies in over 80 countries worldwide the unaids secretariat is headquartered in geneva switzerland 5 these totals reflect rough estimates of total numbers of deaths and were compiled by aggregating the total numbers of deaths reported for all years since 1982 based on data reported in various published unaids and world health organization who sources list available from the author this method may not be statistically or methodologically sound in part because statistical and data collec tion methods have changed over time or varied from study to study many statisticians har bor doubts about the reliability of death and infection rate data collected during the early years of the epidemic unaids does not regularly publish aggregate historical regional mortality figures for africa for similar reasons and because not all countries have author ized the release of data covering all yearscharacteristics of the african epidemic2 overview subsaharan africa africa hereafter has been far more severely affected by hivaids3 than any other world region in december 2007 the joint united nations program on hivaids unaids4 released an update on the global aids epidemic it reported that in 2007 there were between 209 million and 243 million hivpositive adults and children in africa including 17 million newly infected during the year africa has near ly 12 of the worlds population but about 68 of the global total of infected persons in 2007 about 16 million adults and children were estimated to ve died of aids comprising about 76 of global aids deaths in 2007 down from 2006 estimate of about 21 million deaths when african aids deaths made up about 72 of gl obal aids deaths aggregate estimates of deaths caused by aids suggest that many as 30 million africans may have died of aids since 1982 at the start of the epide mic including those who perished in 20075 unaids has projected that between 2000 and 2020 55 million africans will likely have lost their lives to aids which is the primary cause of death in africa it causes more deaths than malaria in african adults and kills many times more people than africas armed conflicts prevalence multiple health survey data show that the countries with the highest hivaids prevalence or infection rates globally are in africa the adult rate of infection in africa in late 2005 was 61 compared with 1 worldwide but had dropped to 5 by 2007 compared to 8 wo

of demographic hiv statistics unaids regularly factors new research assumptions and modeling methodologies into its estimates which are largely based on national data these data vary in quality due to countries disparate data collection capacities and the availability of resources to conduct surveys as result of such factors unaids has periodically revised some of its prevalence estimates in recent years some researchers have asserted that improved data collection and statistical models have shown that unaids may have overestimated infection rates in number of countries unaids appears to have concurred with such concerns in some instances in 2007 unaids published revised regional and global aids demographic data which included downward revisions of some prevalence estimates these revisions were attributable to the availability of data from an increasing number of national populationbased surveys and improved sentinel surveillance use of representa tional population subgroups lik pregnant women as surrogate for projections among the general population and other methodological factors for some african countries it also provided information on national hiv prevalence rates

adult hiv infection rate or prevalence has begun to stabiliz or decline moderately in recent years having peaked around year 2000 as both th total adult and infected populations have increased stabilization means that numbers dying approximate the numbers of newly infected and that ne t infections are thus halted or nearly curbed hiv has become endemic in many countries at minimum it will affect several future generations there have been declines in kenya zimbabwe and urban areas in some countries prevalence had been increasing in southern frica in recent years apart from zimbabwe and

social factors but place pr imary blame on the regions poverty which has deprived africa of effective systems of health info rmation health education and health care as result africans suffer from high rates of untreated sexuallytransmitted infections other than aids increasing their susceptibility to hiv african health systems often have limited capabilities for aids prevention work and hiv counseling and testing are difficult for many africans to obtain until very recently aids treatment was generally available only to elites poverty forces large numbers of african men to migrate long distances in search of work and while away from home they may have multiple sex partners increasing their risk of infection some of thes partners may be women who engage in commercial or transactional sex becau of poverty whic h makes them highly vulnerable to infection migrant workers ma carry the infection back to their wiveshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33584crs8 13 see eg human rights watch hrw dose

port drivers are also seen as key agents in the spread of hiv women and girls are dispropor tionately affected by ai ds in africa according to unaids officials and pub lications among other sour ces contraction of hiv by girls from older men is significant factor contributing to higher rates of infection among young women than in young men while older men are more likely than young men to be hivpositive girls in impoverished contexts often view relationships with older men as vital opportunities for achie ving financial material and social security according to survey s in many african countries large numbers of young women lack comprehens ive knowledge of hiv transmission many believe that female infection rates would be lower if womens rights were more widely respected in africa and if women exercised more political and socio economic power human rights watch hrw and other organizations have reported that domestic violence targeting wo men in some african countries has made these women more vulnerable to hiv infection in part by depriving them of the power to negotiate condom use13 for this reason some policy advocates see need for greater support for fidelity campaigns primarily aimed at african men women also lack or have weak property rights in many african countries making their homes or property vulnerable to seizure by relatives when women suffer the loss of their spouses due to aids social and economic consequences aids is having severe negative social and economic consequences in africa and these effects are expected to continue for many years as suggested by january 2000 central intelligence agency nationa l intelligence estimate on the infectious disease threats at least some of the hardesthit countries initially in africa and later in other regions will f ace demographic catastrophe as hivaids and associated diseases reduce human life expectancy dramatically and kill up to quarter of their populations over the period of this estimate14

working in africa and african governments have res ponded to the aids epidemic primarily by attempting to reduce the number of new hiv infections through prevention programs and to some degree by trying to amelio rate the damage done by aids to families societies and economies third response treatment of aids sufferers with antiretroviral drugs arvs that can result in longterm survival is increasing rapidly in some african contexts as treatment and drug distribution efforts expand but arvs remain inaccessible to the vast major ity of those in need of them in africa see below aids treatment issues antiaids programs and projects typica lly provide information on how hiv is spread and on how it can be avoided throug h the media posters lectures and skits some success has been claimed for these effo rts in persuading youth to delay the age of sexual debut and to remain faithful to single partner the bush administration advocates an expansion of prevention programs focusing on abstinence until marriage and marital faithfulness as effective means of slowing the spread of hiv although some critics maintain that this may be unrealistic in social environments characterized by poverty and lack of ducation some also question whether such approaches can benefit poor married women in africa who have little power to refuse the sexual demands of their husbands whether infected or not or in some cases to control their extramarital activities they are also often unable to refuse spousal decisions to take more than one wife given that polygamous marriage is common and deeply embedded in many frican societies in january 2006 first lady laura bush defended abstinence appro aches saying that she had always been little bit irritated by critic ism of abstinence because
