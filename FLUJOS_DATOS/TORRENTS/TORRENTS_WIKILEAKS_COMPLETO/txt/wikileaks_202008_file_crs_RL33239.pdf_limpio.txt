to section 215 that are in the senate bill account of whether and when section 215 aut hority has been used to request these categories of sensitive information minimization procedures not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of the act the attorney gene ral is required to promulgate specific minimization standards that apply to the collection and dissemination of information obtained through the use of the section 215 authority13 these procedures are intended to limit the retention and re gulate the dissemin ation of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting us persons consistent with the need of the united states to obtain produce and disseminate foreign intelligence information14 federal authorities are directed to observe these minimization procedures regarding the use or disclosu re of information received under 215 order furthermore they may not use or disc lose such information except for lawful purposes15 finally section 106g of the conf erence bill clarifies that otherwise privileged information does not lose its privileged character simply because it was acquired through 215 order application requirements current law only require s that an application for 215 order state that the requested records are sought for an authorized investigation the conference bill amends 50 usc 1861b2 to clarify that such an application must include statement of facts demonstrating that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the tangib things sought are relevant to an authorized or preliminary investigation to protect against international terrorism or espionage or to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning us person section 106b2a of the conference bill so provides that cer tain tangible items are presumptively relevant to an investigation if the applications statement of facts shows that the items sought pertain to foreign power or an agent of foreign power the activities of

accountability for the validity of warrant first the amendment allows the issu ance of socalled blank warrants by which the parties required to respond to the order need not be listed on the face of

than specifically identifies the target of surveillance critics of the patriot act question wh ether this kind of john doe wiretap authority may be recipe for abuse38 department of justice official in testimony before congress re sponded to this criticism it is critical however to keep in mind that the governments descri ption of the target must be sufficiently specific to convince the fisa court that th ere is probable cause to believe that the target is foreign power or agent of foreign power39 section 206 of the patriot act also permits general command for the assistance of third parties for example common carriers and internet service providers for the installation and use of these multipoint wiretaps where the target of the surveillance has taken steps to thwart the identification

data mining activities of the department of justice the conference bill does not define patternbased nor does the conference reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33239crs23 98 the want of definition may be significant because the terms are not hermetically sealed legal concepts see eg safeguarding privacy in the fight against terrorism report of the technology and privacy advisory committee 45 march 2004data mining includes patternbased searches these might involve developing models of what terrorist behavior might look like and then examining data bases for similar patterns this is similar to commercial data mining techniques busin esses develop pattern of attributes or behaviors that their good customers have in comm on and then search databases to find people meeting those patterns but potentially far more powerful given the range of data to which the government has access and the capacity of data mining to eliminate the need to aggregate data before searching them as we use the term data mining may also include subjectbased searches which look for inform ation about specific individual or links to known terrorist suspects this has long b een basic tool of criminal investigators everywhere start with known suspects and w ith proper authorization in many cases warrant or subpoena look for informati on about them and the people with whom they interact however the power of data mining technology and the range of data to which the government has access have contributed to blurring the line between subject and pattern based searches the broader the search criteria and the more people other than actual terrorist who will be identified by those cr iteria the more patternlike these searches become even when subjectbased search starts with known suspect it can be transformed into patternbased search as inve stigators target individuals for investigation solely because of their connection with the suspect the more tenuous the connection the more like patternbased search it becomes searches that lack specific focus on identified suspects do pose greater risk for us persons and should be subject to greater scrutiny and accountability discuss the

the sentencing guidelines on november 1 1987 the maximum penalty available would be lif imprisonment under the presentencing guidelines structure even prisoners senten ced to life imprisonment were eligible for parole hearing after serving only ten years while there is split in the circuit courts of appeals as to whether sentencing judge ca n impose sentence that could avert the 10year parole hearing requirement the current position of the bureau of prisons is that prisoner is eligible for parole hearing after serving ten years of life sentence even if parole is denied on that first occasion such prisoners ar eligible to have regularly scheduled parole hearings every two years thereafter moreover in addition to parole eligibility after ten years the old sentencing and parole laws incorporated presumption that even persons sentenced to life imprisonment would be released after more than 30 years in the context of the individuals responsi ble for the hijacking incidents described above most of th perpetrators were olde r than in their twentie s when they committed their crimes the imposition of preguidelines sentence of life imprisonment for these defendants means that many if not all of them could be expect to be released from prison well within their lifetime given the grav ity of these offenses coupled with the longstanding congressional intent to have d eath penalty available for the offense of air piracy resulting in death such result would be at odds with the clear directive of congress hrept 109333 at 101 2005after the 1974 fix but before the 1994

to establishi ng appropriate physical procedural and personnel security for seaports it is important that us criminal law adequately reflect the seriousness of the ffense hrept 109333 at 103 2005 but critics might point out the section does not deal with all unauthorized access only access accomplished by fraud and even if the seriousness of such unauthorized access to seaport restricted areas with criminal intent might warrant imprisonment for up to 10 years there is nothing in conference or commission reports to explain the necessity for the comparable penalty increase for the other forms

conference report the coast guard maintains over 50000 navigati onal aids on more than 25000 miles of waterways these aids are inviting targets for terrorists hrept 109333 at 103 2005 there may also be some question why the new section is necessary if 18 usc 2291a3 as proposed in section 306 of the conference bill is enacted since that subsection states whoever knowingly damages destroys or disables any aid to navigation shall be imprisoned not more than 20 years see also proposed 18 usc 2291a4whoever knowin gly interferes by force or violence with the operation of any aid to navigati on if such action is likely to endanger the safety of any ve ssel in navigation section 305 transporting dangerous materials or terrorists like section 306 of the house bill before it section 305 of the conference bill establishes two other fede ral terrorismrelated trans portation offenses one for transporting dangerous ma terials and the other for transporting terrorists transporting dange rous materials it is federal crime to possess biological agents chemi cal weapons atomic weapons and nuclear material each punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life122 and although the penalties vary it is likewise federal crime to commit any federal crime of terrorism123 morever it is federal crime to provide material support including transportation for commission of various rrorist crimes or for the benefit of designated terrorist organization 18 usc 2339a 2339b or to transport explosives in interstate or foreign commerce with the knowledge they are intended to be used in injure an individual or damage property 18 usc 844 d most of these offenses condemn attempts and conspiracies to commit them and accomplices and coconspirators incur comparable liability in any event124 section 305 establishes new federal offense whic h prohibits transporting explosives biological agen ts chemical weapons radio active or nuclear material knowing it is intended for use to commit fe deral crime of terro rism aboard vessel in the united states in waters subject to us jurisdiction on the high seas or aboard vessel of the united states proposed 18 usc 2283 the crime is punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life and may be punishable by death if death results from commission of the offense idhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33239crs34 125 for example destruction of aircraft or vi olence at international airports in violation of 18 usc 32 and 73 respectively are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years unless death results and the same penalties apply to computer fraud and abuse violations considered federal crimes of terro rism 18 usc 1030a5 c4 aiding and abetting carries the same penalties as the underlying offense 18 usc 2 126 the offenses include 18 usc 2271 cons piracy to destroy vessels 2272 destruction of vessel by owner 2273 destruction of ve ssel by nonowner 2274 destruction or misuse of vessel by person in charge 2275 firing or tampering with vessel 2276 breaking and entering vessel 2277 explosives or dangerous weapons aboard vessels 2278 explosives on vessels carrying steerage passengers 2279 boarding vessels

material support incl uding transportation for the commission of terrorist offense or for the benefit of foreign designated terrorist organization 18 usc 2339a 2339b such offenses are only punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years the same perceived defect may appear to some in the penalties for aiding and abetting commission of the various federal crimes of terrorism and in the penalties available for committing many of them125 section 305 creates new federal offe nse proposed 18 usc 2284 punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life for transporting an individual knowing he intends to commit or is fleei ng from the commission of federal crime of terrorism unlike the new 18 usc 2282ac created in section 304 neither of the section 305 offenses have an explicit ex ception for official activities of course even though facially the new section 2284 forbids transportation terrorists for purposes of extradition or prisoner transfer it would never likely be read or applied to prevent or punish such activity section 306 interference with maritime navigation chapter 111 of title 18 of the united states code relates to shipping and by and large outlaws violence in various forms committed against vessels within us jurisdiction126 other sections of the code pros cribe the use of fire explosives or violence with sufficient breath of protect shipping

first it has exceptions for lawful repair and salvage operations and for the lawful transportation of hazardous waste pr oposed 18 usc 2291b second in the manner of 18 usc 1993 attacks on ma ss

the anonymity low cost efficiency and access to underdeveloped regions the united states has take steps to combat thehawala networks by requiring all money transmitters informal or form to register as money service businesses under current federal law financial transaction constitutes money laundering offense only if the funds in volved in the transaction represent the proceeds of some criminal offense there is some uncertainty however as to whether the proceeds element is satisfied with re gard to each transaction in money laundering scheme that involves two or more transactions conducted in parallel only one of which directly makes use of the proceeds from unlawful activity for example consider the following transaction sends drug proceeds to b who deposits the money in bank account 1 simultaneously or subsequently b takes an equal amount of money from bank account 2 and sends it to or to person designated by the first transaction from to b clearly satisfies the proceeds element of the money laundering statute but there is some question as to whether the second transaction the one that in volves only funds withdrawn form bank account 2 does so as well the question has become

civil forfeiture is authorized and allows the government to combine criminal conviction and criminal forfeiture as consolidated proceedingsection 410 uniform procedures for criminal forfeitures the conference bill contains an amendment to 28 usc 2461c for which there is explanation in the conference report nor does the amendment appear in either the two versions of hr 3199 sent to conference nor does the amendment appear to have been included in ot her legislative proposals and thus has not heretofore been the beneficiary of examination in committee or on the floor the change is captioned uniform procedures for criminal forfeitures but it is not facially apparent precisely how the procedures for various criminal forfeitures are disparate or how the amendment makes them more uniform part of the difficulty flows from the fact that both the secti on 2461c and the conference bill amendment are somewhat cryptic nevertheless it seems crafted to make default procedure into an exclusive procedure in its present form 28 usc 2461c states if forfeiture of property is authorized in connection with violation of an act of congress and any person is charged in an indictment or information with such violation but specific stat utory provision is made for criminal forfeiture upon conviction the government may include the forfeiture in the indictment or information in accordance with the fede ral rules of criminal procedure and upon conviction the court shall order the fo rfeiture of the property in accordance with the procedures set forth in secti on 413 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 853 other than subs ection d of that section the conference bill amends th section 2461c to read if person is charged in criminal case with violation of an act of congress for which the civil or criminal forfeiture of property is authorized the government may include notice of the forfe iture in the indictment or information pursuant to the federal rules of criminal procedure if the defendant is convicted of the offense giving rise to the forfeiture the court shall order the forfeiture of the property as part of the sentence in the criminal case pursuant to the federal rules of criminal procedure and section 3554 of title 18 united states code the procedures in secti on 413 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 853 apply to all stages of cr iminal forfeiture proceeding except that subsection d of such section applies only in cases in which the defendant is convicted of violation of such act proposed 18 usc 2461c casual reading of the section 2461c mig ht suggest that it only applies in the case of criminal forfeiture statute which fails to indicate what procedure should be used to accomplish confiscation in fact as the conference am endment states more clearly section 2461c allows for c onfiscation under its criminal forfeiture procedures where civil forfeiture is authorized by statute but criminal forfeiture otherwise is not143 on its face however it does not allow the government to merge every civil forfeiture with the criminal prosecution of the property owner in itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33239crs47 144 18 usc 2461cif forfeiture of pr

there is other criminal forfeiture counterpart for the civil forfeiture144 under the conference bill the distinction longer exists moreover since section 2461c speaks of treating civil forfeitures as criminal forfeitures after conviction some courts have held th at pretrial freeze orders available in other criminal forfeiture cas may not be invoked in the case of section 2461c gap filler145 it is unclear whether th conferees intended the bill change this result as well on one hand th language of convic tion still remains on the other hand the description of the role of 21 usc 853 which authorizes pre trial restraining orders may signal different result the current language is fairly clear the procedures of section 853 co into play after conviction upon conviction the court shall or der the forfeiture of the property in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 413 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 853 28 usc 2461c the statement in the conference bill is less conclusive the procedures in section 413 of the controlled substances act 21 usc 853 apply to all stages of criminal forfeitu re proceeding proposed 28 usc 2461c the change in language suggests that

problems between the justice department and the intelligence community in our classified report we describe one such problem that cannot be discussed in our unclassified report we believe that

interstate or foreign commerce167 nor is there any dispute congress enjoys such authority if the second jurisdiction predicate is satisfied ie the offense involves defrauding the united states168

benefits of current employees or annuitants that existed on the day before the effective date of this act 171 the united states secret service shall be maintained as distinct entity within the
