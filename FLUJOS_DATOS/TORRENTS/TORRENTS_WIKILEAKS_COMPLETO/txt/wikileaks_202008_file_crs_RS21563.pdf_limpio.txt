biodiesel biofuels are generally more expensive than g asoline diesel fuel and other petroleum based counterparts however growing body of environmental regulations and energy securityprovisions have evolved since th clean air act amendments of 1990 that have created economic opportunities for producer s and users of biofuels and biofuel feedstocks in addition supporters mainta in that biodiesel major biofuel offers several environmental and health benefits over petroleumbased diesel fuel recent provisions in the 2002 us farm bill pl 107171 offer some incentives for production of biodiesel in

updated as needed introduction statistics suggest significant us marke t potential for biodiesel in 2001 total us diesel fuel use was estimated at 395 billion gallons including 332 billion of onroad highway use 34 billion of farm use 25 billion of offroad use and 346 million of military use1biodiesel can substitute directly for petroleumbased diesel fuel with generally engine modification2an estimated 343 million gallons of biodiesel were produced in the united states in 2001 from an industryprojected biodiesel production capacity of between 60 and 80 million gallons per year3currently then biodiesel accounts for less than 01 of diesel fuel consumption in to the united stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21563crs2 4flash point measures the temperature to which fuel must be heated so that

agricultural feedstocks aka energy crops including soybeans sunflowers canola peanuts corn cottonseed and animal fats such as tallow yello w grease used restaurant deepfry grease and lard unlike fossilfuels which have f ixed resource base that declines with use agricultural feedstocks may be produced anew every year health safety and environmental benefits proponents of biodiesel contend that it offers several health and environmental benefits relative to petroleumbased diesel biodegradable less carbon monoxide co and sulfur oxides so2 emissions less odor less particulate or soot emissions in some engines and safer handling due to higher flash point4 in addition biodiesel use may reduce co2a greenhouse gas oral and dermal toxicity ozone precursors and mutagenic and carci nogenic compounds associated with diesel exhaust5from their perspective increased substitution of biodiesel for petroleumbased diesel fuel may offer the broader public greater access to cleaner air and water safer fuels and lower risk of cancer respiratory and other health problems associated with air and water pollution ozone depletion and climate change energy security effect widely touted virtue of increased production and use of renewable agriculturebased biofuels is ss dependence on foreign sources for petroleum and potential improvements in the us trade balance farm income effect growing demand for biodiesel and other biofuel products increases the demand for their feedstocks veg etable oils and animal fats and offers the potential for higher prices and incomes for t he farmers and ranchers that produce those feedstocks recent studies offer evidence in s upport of the assertions in 2001 fapri completed study of the effects of increas ed use of both biodiesel and ethanol6in the

biodiesel and ethanol include biodiesel use increases to 320 million gallons up from 343 million gallons in 2001 and requires an additional 2 billion pounds of soybean oil by 2010 soybean oil prices increase gradually to about 14 over baseline levels by 2010 due to the increased demand for biodiesel the increased crush demand for soybeans to p roduce oil for biodiesel results in lower average ending stocks and higher soybean prices through 2010 livestock and poultry sectors are only modestly affected as higher corn prices due to larger ethanol demand are partially offset by lower prices for key feedstuffs that are by products of biofuels soybean meal nd corn gluten feed and gluten meal farm crop cash receipts exceed baseline levels by 38 billion by 2010 higher farm prices result in

through may of 2003 the price difference includes federal and state taxes as well as marketing margin in the absence of any tax exemptions both petroleum and biofuelbased sources are subject to the same taxes and marketing margins these price data indicate that biodiesel is not competitive with petroleumbased diesel at current market prices either its production c osts must drop substantially or petroleum prices must nearly double before it becomes ec onomical alternately some combination of federal andor state subsidies such as fuel tax exemptions or some type of federal andor state regulation such as renewable fuel mandate could provide greater economic incentive for biodiesel fuels while the potential positive consequences of these government policy options are outlined in the fapri study there are also potential negative consequences including market distortions and economic inefficiencies associated with any market price intervention10increased budgetary outlay by government to finance subsidy must either add to the deficit or take funding away from another program and increased fuel costs to consumers in response to biofuels rfs also there is negative feedback

will in turn raise the cost of producing the biodiesel performance and environmental issues biodiesels especially those made from highly saturated feedstocks may cause coldweather engine problems although blending can help alleviate this problem b iodiesels often emit higher levels of nitrous oxide regulated emission11finally fuel oxidation happens more quickly with biodiesel fuel thereby reducing its storage life ge netic engineering research has been proposed or is underway intended to allevi ate many of these problems other concerns some environmentalists argue against government intervention in the biofuels area because they claim that other energy sources such as solar or geothermal offer cleaner more bountiful alternatives some in the petroleum industry argue that technological advances such as in seismog raphy drilling and extraction continue to expand the fossilfuel resource base which r emains far cheaper and more accessible than biofuel supplies some
