divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30720the us defense industrial base trends and current issues summary the end of the cold war precipitated one of the greatest reductions in us defense spending since the final months of world war ii the department of defense dod and us defense industry have struggled coming to terms with smaller defense budgets and illdefined threats to us security cold wars end also transformed the defense business environment marking the rapid worldwide globalization of economics and trade and changes in dod policy toward the industry itself technological change especially visible in the information processing and telecommunications industries has forced convergence between civilian and military research and applications shrinking defense budgets worldwide have forced producers into heightened competition these factors compelled dod to reassess its halfcentury relationship with the us defense industrial base as result dod policy has changed in two major ways first because the lead in some stateoftheart product lines had passed from defense to the commercial sector of the economy dod reformed the way it buys equipment second dod sought to reform structural aspects of the defense industrial base itself instead of continuing to support excess production capacity across the board dod focused on preserving defenseunique manufacturing capabilities allowing other us defense firms to more freely respond to conventional market forces congress has traditionally protected economically vulnerable parts of the defense industry that are critical to us national security but global changes in the economic and defense environments pose new issues first continued mergers and acquisitions in the us defense industry raise questions about maintaining competition some maintain that surviving firms have emerged healthier and more competitive but others worry about the potential loss of technological innovation and price competition from fewer companies second defense acquisition reform has encouraged military use of commercial products in military systems proponents of this cite the advantages of rapid access to new technologies for dod and the adoption of efficient business practices while others question the inappropriateness of some products to military applications and the ability of dod to cope with the speed of obsolescence for commercial products third globalization has increased crossborder flows of information and the availability of technology that could be used for military purposes the result has been pressure for the united states to ease defenserelated technology transfer restrictions which could increase exports of us system s and help the us defense supplier base critics of this logic however worry about the extra vigilance needed to prevent the unauthorized transfe r of us defense technology potentially increasing us vulnerabilities and fourth some us defense firms find it difficult to recruit and retain qualified designers and technical managers presaging potential problems some analysts note downturn in the number of recent us science and engineering graduates and see strong competition for their talents from commercial hightechnology firms as ominous but others observe that perceived shortfalls seem concentrated in only some specialities such as armored vehicle design while other specialty requirements such as computer systems design appear able to fill their requirementshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30720contents introduction 1 background 1 structure of the defense industrial base 1 factors shaping the

challenge s shrunken domestic market for their specialized military products reduce d defense budgets among us allies in europe and asia and increased competition in export sales from overseas firms the resulting us defense industrial base was smaller in some ways more economically more vulnerable and more dependent on commercial technologies new challenges have evolved which will have to be addressed as congress and the executive branch ponder future us defense policy decisions such as developing new us military capabilities this report briefly describes the us defense industrial base its structure and evolution and examines challenges and potential issues for congress to consider issue areas include competition in defense contracting the role of commercial technologies and foreign participation in us defense programs and the ability of us defense firms to recruit and retain sufficient numbers of technical workers this report focuses primarily on the privatesector us firms that design and produce weapons equipment and other items for the department of defense dod it does not cover other elements of the nations defense technological and industrial infrastructure such as governmentoperated laboratories and repair depots and universityaffiliated research and development organizations background structure of the defense industrial base todays defense industry is multifac eted and complex sector of the national economy employing more than 23 million workers in hundreds of firms of all sizes elements of the us defense industry exist in every state and include many joint ventures with foreign defense companies especially those based in allied countries the structure of the us defense industrial base can be imagined as collection of firms placed in matrix of three dimensions function product and ownership as depicted in figure 1 in the first dimension function enterprises are categorized as prime contractors subcontractors and suppliers prime contractors also known as primes deal directly with dod and hold primary responsibility for product fabrication and overallhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30720crs2 adapted from jacques s gansler the defense industry cambridge mit press 1980 p 3 figure 1management in programs where more than one company is involved subcontractors under obligation to the primes create some portion of the final product such as an electronics suite for ship or the engines for an aircraft suppliers provide lowertier parts or processed materials to sub and prime contractors traditionally this lowest layer of business was referred to as the dualuse sector because much of its product line could be used for both defense and nondefense purposes in recent years though significant number of the components provided by subcontractors for use in military products has been made to commercial offtheshelfcots specifications these are also considered dualuse the second dimension product indicates the separate industrial sectors aerospace ships armaments etc within which firms operate any individual enterprise may conduct business in several sectors but each sector retains its own very specific characteristics for example aircraft and ships are built individually but uniforms and rifles are assembled by mass production processes while electronics manufacturers fund more research and development than do boot and shoe makers the third dimension ownership shows production facilities in private hands in the public domain or in some mixture of the two arsenals used for the final assembly of munitions are publicly owned and operated by government employees significant portion of the facilities and production equipment used to manufacture military aircraft are governmentowned but staffed by private corporations all us new construction shipyards used for building warships are privately owned and operated dod funding of the industria l base is concentrated in three of the defense budgets appropriations titles these are operation and maintenance om fuel ship operations training equipment maintenance and overhauls etc procurement acquisition of weapons and components communications equipment munitions modernizations and upgrade kits and research development test and evaluation rdte development and testing of equipment prototypes technology demonstration devices and basic research for potential

resulted in 178 and 163 billion in revenue or 698 and 280 of their annual totals2 factors shaping the defense industrial base until the end of the korean war the united states had distinct identifiable defense industrial base industry organized itself around civilian needs mobilized to meet war or crisis and demobilized afterward reconverti ng to the manufacture of civilian products the onset of the cold war changed this with the soviet union and its satellites presenting constant threat to the united states and its allies us defense spending remained at considerably higher level than in previous times of peace and portion of the us industry consequently found itself permanently organized around meeting dod needs as result many firms gravitated toward dod as their principal or even sole customer and an identifiable us defense industrial base began to emerge the end of the cold war in 1991 led to significant reduction in defense spending as whole and an even more significant reduction in the procurement portion of dods budget these developments together with reductions in defense budgets among allies in europe and asia increased competition in export sales from oversea s firms and other economic and technological changes have prompted changes in the us defense industrial base in several areas including the following consolidation diversification commercialization teaming arrangements globalization and the availability of skilled technical workers each of these is discussed below declining defense spending levels defense spending during the cold war though high was inconsistent see figure 2 of the budget titles considered here expenditures on defense research and development rtde and in support of operations and maintenance om generally rose in real terms each year peaking late in the reagan administration procurement spendi ng weapon purchases communications gear munitions spare parts etc fluctuated widely hitting highs and lows at irregular intervals market prospects for us weapons manufacturers mirrored these changes rising in the early 1960s and again during the vietnam war even after the postvietnam fall in procurement spending continuing

options for congress by gary j paglianochanging dod policy during 1993 thendeputy defense secretary william perry addressed gathering of busin ess executives at what has become known as the last supper he told them that the defense budget could longer support unused production capacity and that dod would not hamper but would monitor any corporate mergers or acquisitions they felt it advantageous to make however he went on to say and later outlined with greater clarity that dod would protect and the department continues to protect domestic facilities possessing what he termed defenseunique industrial capabilities such as the construction of nuclear submarines or the production of heavy armored vehicles3 rapid vertical buyout of parts suppliers and subcontractors by primes and horizontal mergers between primes consolidation began among us firms some of the most prominent names in the defense business soon disappeared by 1995 for example ford aerospace the defense division of unisys and the fort worth division of general dynamics builders of the f16 fighter had been absorbed by loral two years later loral became part of lockheed martin which itself was the product of fouryear series of 17 individual corporate mergers boeing acquired fellow defense giants rockwell in 1996 and mcdonnell douglas in 1997 in 1998 litton industries capped its own series of

department of defense 1999 p 1corporate consolid ations both vertical and horizontal are expected to continue4 although their effects are always difficult to assess further reduction of the number of producers in the defense base raises question s about the continued viability of technological innovation and price competition us military forces are the worlds most technologically advanced and future force structure s assume continual integration of rapidly evolving weapon and command and control system technology as move to expand the pool of potential bidders on defense projects reduce costs and gain access to the latest technologies dod began to reform its acquisition practices during the mid1990s central to this reform have been the adoption of commercial rather than military specifications in some product designs the adoption of some commerciallike acquisition practices and the reduction of regulatory barriers to commercial firms attempting to enter the defense market5 even with acquisition reform there are some sectors within the industrial base where lowest acceptable limit on numbers of firms competing may have been reached and dod appears to be rethinking its policy of encouragement to mergers and acquisitions for example the department cited competition concerns in 1997 when it did not permit lockheed martin to complete proposed 112 billion buyout of northrop grumman and for the same reason it is currently reviewing the proposed purchase of lockheed martins aerospace electronics division by bae systems north america6 effects of economic globalization an additional postcold war phenomenon affecting us defense is economic globalizationthe integration of national and regional economies that were previously separated by political economic or cultural boundaries7 globalization has been accelerated in the 1990s by advances in computers the advent of the internet and other developments in information and telecommunication technologies central to this is the information revolution which has helped to precipitate and sustain the postcold war reduction of physical and political obstacles between communities the effect of globalization on the us defense industrial base has been twofold first faced with reduced level of defense spending many defense firms havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30720crs7 8ibid pp vvi 9in the 106th congress this body was renamed the house committee on armed servicesbroadened their focus to include more comme rcial orientation those companies which have remained within the traditional defense sector have begun to bring commerciallydeveloped technologies into military applicat ions have expanded the number of joint ventures and strategic partnerships in which they have engaged with their european counterparts and have increased their reliance on commercial sector business and defense exports second the revolution in information technology it has resulted in an increased emphasis on capabilityamplifying information integration products such as telecommunications and computerbased systems the worldwide proliferation of computers and the ease with which data can pass between them has greatly expanded the quantity and the types of information available to virtually anyone equipped with modem and mouse much unclassified government information and almost any commercial product such as reasonably detailed satellite imagery is readily obtainable from any internetconnected computer indeed the kind of technology upon which dod is building its future information centric warfare cannot be kept from potential adversaries precisely because it is largely commercial in nature and accessible from anywher on the globe recent defense science board task force report stated that from longterm strategic standpoint globali zations most significant manifestation is the irresistible leveling effect it is having on the international military technological environment in which dod must compete the technology dod anticipates being able to leverage most to maintain militar dominance is that which the united states is least capable of denying its potential competitors access to commercial technology is virtually universal and its exploitation for both civil and military ends is largely unconstrained indeed owing to the proliferation of military technology the commercialization of former militaryspecific technology and the increasing reliance of militaries worldwide on commerciallydeveloped technology and the general diffusion of technology and knowhow the majority of militarily useful technology is or eventually will be available commercially andor from nonus defense companies 8 emphasis in the original congressional action in recent years congress in recent years has enacted legislation in respo nse to some of the previously mentioned developments affecting the us defense industrial base these actions have included stepssuch as annual decisions to keep certain defense manufacturing lines warmintended in large part to protect defense sectors or firms that were deemed economically vulnerable the discussion below provides few examples of some of these actions during the 104th 105th and 106th congresses 104th congress during the 104th congress the house committee on national security hnsc9 pressed dod to request increased authorization on

levels proposed by the clinton administration for tactical aircraft ships small arms and precision guided munitions the senate committee on armed services sasc expressed strong interest in forcing the army to utilize multiyear contracts for the purchase of tracked combat vehicles and in maintaining competition through the judicious allocation of funds for submarine and warship construction11

programming and budgeting process in the department of defense12 105th congress legislation passed during the 105th congress funded purchases above those requested by dod in order to as the sasc put it support the industrial base until endstate requirements can be identified after the 1997 quadrennial defense review process is complete13 and to guide the preservation of production capacity in specific programs such as the b2 spirit heavy bomber hnsc urged the secretary of the army to identify and evaluate processes and economical practices that would enable federal arsenals to remain viable and critical components of the defense industrial base and in the matter of ship overhaul and repair directed the secretary of the navy to apply less than 50 of any additional funding above the budget request to the private sector 14 sasc indicated its dissatisfaction with several aspects of the various servi ces procurement plans and devoted considerable attention to the continued domestic manufacture of small arms ammunition to increasing the production of army helicopters and to the rapidity of corporate mergers within the defense sector15 106th congress the 106th congress took steps

potential congressional concern continued corpo rate consolidation commercialization of defense technology globalization of the defense industry and perceived technical manpower shortage industry consolidation horizontal consolidation among wellknown and economically important prime contractors has been perhaps the most visible postcold war industry development mergers and acquisitions have yielded fewer and larger companies to which dod can turn for the equipment it needs for example today there are but five us companies able to construct navy surface warships three military airframe manufacturers and two builders of tracked combat vehicles where eight eight and three companies respectively existed in 199019 vertical consolidation between the primes and their subcontractors and suppliers has been less evident and its impact is more difficult to assess20 nevertheless the decrease in the number of companies combined with the recent practice of bundling numerous defense contracts into fewer larger offerings has generated concerns about the health of the lower tier of the defense industry21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30720crs10 21continued bundling found to undermine

summer 1999 pp 421487although proponents of continued consolidation maintain that the surviving firms will emerge healthier and more competitive against each other and foreign defense firms critics focus their concerns on issues of technological innovation and price competition some analysts view continued corporate acquisitions as economically inevitable22 and have suggested several methods by which both innovation and competition might be preserved in an environment where few companies or even single source remain23 among suggestions offered are requiring that prime contractors compete contracts to their subtier suppliers and use opensystem non proprietary architectures to permit wider competition taking measures to encourage commercial firms to enter the defense market promoting the use of alternative ie softkill informationbased etc technologies competing missions rather than platforms ie using unmanned vehicles instead of manned or opening competition to foreign suppliers commercialization of defense technology commercialization of the defense industrial base reflects convergence of military and civilian technologies in research and in application in some fields most visibly in information systems and teleco mmunications the cutting edge of technological advancement lies in the commercial sector the federal share of the total us investment in research and development has shrunk steadily over the last several decades this is in part due to steep rise in funding from private sources and concurrent decline in federal dollars see figure 4 with the most advanced technology in many fields now residing in the commercial sector dod has become more willing to rely on nondefense industry to supply its needshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30720crs11 24office of

practices and the ability of dod to purchase new products in significantly reduced time the defense science board has indicated that there are probable benefits to dod in cost and capability which are available in at least six product areas including information systems communications air and sea lift logisti cs spacebased surveillance and highefficiency ground transportation24 some critics of the move to commercialize more of the defense acquisition process cite examples of high modification costs and delivery delays when dod program managers have failed to appreciate gaps between military requirements and cots equipment capabilities they also point out that commercial products are not appropriate to all military applications and that it is possible that forcing commercial products into military niche s can be inappropriate expensive and may result in modification of the military requirement rather than improvement to the commercial equipment itself25 others see systematic aversion on the part of some dod acquisition managers and prime contractors to the use of commercial components this is due in part to perception that machines built to civilian specifications may fail under extreme test or operational conditions increasing cost and potentially placing larger programs athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30720crs12 26bryan bender dod in search for cots despite mixed results janes

civilian market moves rapidly especially in the information technology and telecommunications fields some critics fear that vital equipment could go out of production and may not be available in quantity when needed27 moreover new versions of commercial products and components may not be backward compatible and able to operate with existing equipment globalization the globalization of industry translates into the lowering of barriers to trade financial movement and access to information companies with global outlook seek opportunity for acquisitions and markets with little regard for national boundaries in the defense industry this trend can raise concerns regarding the transfer of sensitive technology and of foreign corporate control those who support more globalized defense industry particularly in transatlantic relationships point out that the reduction of controls on the transfer of defenserelated technology can help increase exports of us products to friends and allies such relaxation can increase the number of individual units sold offsetting to some degree the postcold war shrinkage in domestic defense procurement make the equipment used by different national military establishments interoperable enhancing the ability of us forces to operate in conjunction with foreign units increase the scope of work in which us industry engages and effectively counter competitive sales of equivalent foreign technology in addition globalized industries foster crossborder collaboration on projects can spread the financial risk of new system development and production and can assist in gaining us access to foreign technology those who criticize the easing of technology export restrictions cite the need to prevent unauthorized transfer of us defense technology28 critics also maintain that any reliance on globalized production carries with it the danger of being unable to maintain adequate supply of materiel and comp onents during times of crisis or heightened need defense companies are acutely aware of government sensitivity to the sharing of militarilyuseful technology across national borders statements by industry executive s in both the

94transnational joint ventures and business alliances while satisfying governments that critical information is not being compromised29 shortage of technical personnel finally some defense companies appear to be facing current and projected shortages of junior and middlelevel scientists and engineers within the more sophisticated and complex programs30 several causes seem to contribute to the shortfall in the military aircraft industry for exam ple there are relatively few aerospace engineers in the 4049 year age bracket reflecting the industrys downturn during the 1970s likewise an insufficient number of recent engineering and science graduates aged 2530 are employed in defense reflecting both the drawdown in defense budgets during the ten years prior to 1998 and the intense compensation competition for skilled personnel coming from computer and internet companies this shortfall is felt to be especially acute in the electrical software and systems engineering disciplines where competition with commercial firms is the most severe an additional challenge for defense companies is the fact that many advanced students master and doctoral candidates in us engineering schools are foreign nationals who are less likely than us citizens to be able to work in fields requiring access to classified information according to toplevel managers critical factor in the recruitment and retention of highquality personnel is the industrys ability to maintain vitality and vibrancy in technically challenging programs during the 1940s 1950s and 1960 s jet aircraft ships and advanced ground vehicles were at the forefront of technology and young engineers saw rewarding futures in their design and construction today relatively few defenserelated programs are focused on building platforms the greater emphasis lies in electronics and systems integration the bulk of industry complaints about personnel shortfalls seem concentrated in the platform industries particularly airframe manufacturers while programs stressing information technology appear to be better able to recruit new talent for example raytheon defense company with heavy focus on electronics and it has hired 3000 engineers during the last 18 months with 70 of those offered positions accepting them31 northrop grumman defense firm which is shifting its efforts away from aircraft manufacture and

vitality aviation week and space technology april 24 2000 p 24electronics and it appears to face recruiting and retention challenges in product lines tied to platforms but not in those areas where young people see future32 for those firms that are having difficulty staffing problems among middle and seniorlevel engineers and program managers pose challenges different in quality but similar in effect in the aerospace industry for example some of the larger defense corporations will soon face the retirement of large number of technical managers who entered their careers during the late 1950s and the 1960s one major pentagon program managed by large defense contractor is noted by an observer as expecting more than 80 of its engineering staff to retire before the end of september of 200233 the scarcity of midcareer engineers already noted means that an insufficient number of experienced managers is available to fill the ranks of the retiring analysts note that of those who are available for promotion into program management few have worked on enough major systems develop ment projects to develop the same breadth of experience as those they will replace
