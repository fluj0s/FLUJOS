major changes in the last several decades organizational changes within the industry to enhance economic efficiency have resulted in larger confined production facilities that often are geographically concentrated these changes in turn have given rise to concerns over the manageme nt of animal wastes and potential impacts on environmental quality federal environmental law does not regulate all agricultural activities but certain large animal feeding operations afos where animals are housed and raised in confinement are subject to regulation the issue of applicability of these laws to livestock and poultry operations especially the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the superfund law and the emergency planning and community righttoknow act epcrahas been controversial and recently has drawn congressional attention both superfund and epcra have reporting requirements that are triggered when specified quantities of certain substances are released to the environment in addition superfund authorizes federal cleanup of releases of hazardous substances pollutants or contaminants and imposes strict liability for cleanup and injuries to natural resources from releases of hazardous substances superfund and epcra include citizen suit provisions that have been used to sue poultry producers and swine operations for violations of those laws in two cases environmental advocates claimed that afo operators had failed to report ammonia emissions in violation of superfund and epcra in both cases federal courts supported broad interpretation of key terms defining applicability of the laws reporting requirements three other cases not dealing with reporting violations also have attracted attention in part because of questions of whether animal wastes contain hazardous substances that can create cleanup and natural resource damage liability under superfund two of these cases were settled the third brought by the oklahoma attorney general against poultry operations in arkansas is pending these lawsuits testing the applicability of superfund and epcra to poultry and livestock operations have led to congressional interest in these issues in the 110 th congress legislation was introduced that would have amended cercla to clarify that manure is not hazardous substance pollutant or contaminant under that act and that the laws notification requirements would not apply to releases of manure hr 1398 and s 807 proponents argue that congress did not intend that either of these laws apply to agriculture and that enforcement and regulatory mechanisms under other laws are adequate to address environmental releases from animal agriculture opponents respond that enacting an exemption would severely hamper the ability of government and citizens to know about and respond to releases of hazardous substances caused by an animal agriculture operation in december 2008 epa issued rule to exempt animal waste

sector of agriculture has undergone major changes in the last several decades fact that has drawn the attention of policymakers and the public in particular organizational changes within the industry to enhance economic efficiency have resulted in larger confined production facilities that often are geographically concentrated1 increased facility size and regional concentration of livestock and poultry operations have in turn given rise to concerns over the management of animal wastes from these facilities and potential impacts on environmental quality public health and welfare animal manure can be and frequently is used beneficially on farms to fertilize crops and add or restore nutrients to soil however animal waste if not properly managed can adversely impact water quality through surface runoff and erosion direct discharges to surface waters spills and other dryweather discharges and leaching into soil and ground it can also result in emission to the air of particles and gases such as ammonia hydrogen sulfide and volatile organic chemicals according to the us department of agricultu re usda in 1997 66000 operations had farm level excess nitrogen an imbalance between the quantity of manure nutrients produced on the farm and assimilative capacity of the soil on that farm and 89000 had farmlevel excess phosphorus 2 usda believes that where manure nutrients exceed the assimilative capacity of region the potential is high for runoff leaching of nutrients and other environmental problems geographically areas with excess farmlevel nutrients correspond to areas with increasing numbers of confined animals federal environmental law does not regulate all agricultural activities some laws specifically exempt agriculture from regulatory provisions and others are structured so that farms escape most if not all of the regulatory impact sti ll certain large animal feeding operations afos where animals are kept and raised in confinement are subject to environmental regulation the primary regulatory focus on environmental impacts has been on protecting water resources and has occurred under the clean water act in addition facilities that emit large quantities of air pollutants may be regulated under the clean air act some livestock operations also may be subject to requirements of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the superfund law nd the emergency planning and community right toknow act epcra 3 the issue of applicability of these laws to livestock and poultry operationsespecially cercla

liability act the superfund law 42 usc 96019675 and the em ergency planning and community rightto know act 42 usc 1100111050 have reporting requirements that are triggered when specified quantities of certain substances are released to the environment 4 both laws which are administered by the environmental protection agency epa utilize information disclosure in order to increase the information available to government and citizens about the sources and magnitude of chemical releases to the environment in addition to reporting requirements cercla includes provisions authorizing federal cleanup of releases of hazardous substances pollutants or contaminants that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare section 104 and imposing strict liability for cleanup and damages for injury to destruction of or loss of natural resources resulting from releases of hazardous substances section 107 at issue today is how the reporting requirements and other provisions of these laws apply to poultry and livestock operations superfund authorizes programs to remediate uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous waste sites and assigns liability for the associated costs of cleanup section 103a of cercla requires that the person in charge of facility as defined in section 1019 that releases reportable quantity of certain hazardous substances must provide notification of the release to the national response center epcra establishes requirements for emergency planning and notification for storage and release of hazardous and toxic chemicals section 304a1 of epcra requires the owner or operator of facility as defined in section 3294 to report to state and local authorities any releases greater than the reportable quantity of substances deemed hazardous under superfund or extremely hazardous under epcra under superfund the rm release section 10122 includes discharges of substances to water and land and emissions to the air from spilling leaking pumping pouring emitting emptying discharging injection escaping leaching dumping or disposing into the environment under epcra the term release section 3298 includes emitting any hazardous chemical or extremely hazardous substance into the environment superfund excludes the normal application of fertilizer from the definition of release and epcra excludes from the definition of hazardous chemicals any substance that is used in routine agricultural operations or is fertilizer held for sale by retailer to the ultimate customer the cercla definition of hazardous substance section 10114 triggers reporting under both laws among the reportable substances that may be released by livestock facilities are hydrogen sulfide ammonia and phosphorus the reportable quantity rq for both hydrogen sulfide and ammonia is 100 pounds per day or 183 tons per year the rq for phosphorus is 1 pound per day section 109 of superfund and section 325 of epcra authorize epa to assess 4 for

in two separate cases the first involved the nations second largest pork producer premium standard farms psf and continental grain company in november 2001 epa and the department of justice announced an agreement resolving numerous claims against psf concerning principally the clean water act but also the clean air act superfund and epcra more recently in september 2006 the department announced settlement of claims against seaboard foodsa large pork producer with more than 200 farms in oklahoma kansas texas and coloradoand pic usa the former owner and operator of several oklahoma farms now operated by seaboard like the earlier psf case the government had brought complaints for violations of several environmental laws including failure to comply with the release reporting requirements of cercla and epcra both superfund and epcra include citizen suit provisions that have been used to sue poultry producers and swine operations for violations of the laws section 310 of cercla and section 326 of epcra in two cases environmental advocat claimed that afo operators had failed to report ammonia emissions putting them in vi olation of superfund and epcra in both cases federal courts supported broad interpretation of key terms defining applicability of the laws reporting requirements in the first of these cases federal district court in oklahoma initially ruled in 2002 that farms individual barns lagoons and land application areas are separate facilities for purposes of cercla reporting requirements rather than aggregating multiple emissions of pollutants across the entire site this court held that superfunds reporting requirements would only apply if emissions for each individual facility exceed 100 pounds per day however the district courts ruling was reversed on appeal sierra club v seaboard farms inc 387 f3d 1167 10 th cir 2004 the court of appeals ruled that the whole farm site is the proper entity to be assessed for purposes of cercla reporting and determining if emissions of covered hazardous substances meet minimum thresholds in the second case federal district court in kentucky similarly ruled in 2003 that the term facility should be interpreted broadly to include facilities operated together for single purpose at one site and that the whole farm site is the proper entity to be assessed for purposes of the superfund and epcra reporting requirements sierra club v tyson foods inc 299 fsupp 2d 693 wd ky 2003 while superfund provides that continuous release is subject to reduced reporting requirements and epcra provides an exemption for reporting releases when the covered substance is used in routine agricultural operations or is used on other farms for fertilizer the court found that these exemptions did not apply to the facts of this case the ruling was not appealed epa was not party in either of these lawsuits the us court of appeals for the 10 th circuit invited epa to file an amicus brief in the seaboard farms case in order to clarify the governments position on the issues but epa declined to do so within the time frame specified by the court

reporting violations also have drawn attention in part because they raised the question of whether animal wastes that contain phosphorus are hazardous substances that can create cleanup and natural resource injury liability under superfund5 animal wastes typically contain low vels of phosphorus and animal wastes are beneficially used as fertilizer on farms over the long term however the application of animal waste fertilizers may result in phosphorus buildup in soils which may be released to watersheds through surface runoff in 2003 federal court in oklahoma held that phosphorus contained in poultry litter in the form of phosphate is hazardous substance under superfund and thus could subject poultry litter releases to provisions of that law city of tulsa v tyson foods inc 258 f supp 2d 1263 nd okla 2003 this ruling was later vacated as part of settlement agreement but some observers believe that the courts reasoning may still be persuasive with other courts the second case city of waco v schouten wd tex w04 ca118 filed april 29 2004 was brought by the city against 14 dairies alleging various causes of action based on disposal of wastes from t hose operations it was resolved by settlement agreement early in 2006 6 the third case state of oklahoma v tyson foods inc nd okla 405cv00329 filed june 13 2005 is still pending this suit brought by the oklahoma attorney general asserts various claims based on the disposal of waste from 14 poultry operations in the illinois river watershed the state principally seeks its past and present response costs and natural resource injuries under cercla due to release of wastes from these facilities the net result of these lawsuits is growing concern by the agriculture community that other legal actions will be brought and that the courts will continue to hold that the superfund and epcra reporting requirements and other provisions apply to whole farm sites thus potentially exposing more of these operations to enforcement under federal law g20g142g153g152g155g157g146g151g144g561g7g161g142g150g153g157g146g152g151g561 in 2005 group of poultry producers petitioned epa for an exemption from epcra and cercla emergency notification requirements for releases of ammonia arguing that such releases from poultry growing operations pose little or risk to public health while reporting imposes an undue burden on the regulated community and government responders 7 in 2007 epa formed an internal workgroup to review informa tion on animal waste as it relates to cercla and to possible exemptions from emissions reporting and in february epa administrator stephen johnson told congressional committees that the agency would propose rule to exempt routine animal waste air releases from emergency notification requirements 5 unlike the citizen suit cases discussed above these lawsuits do not address what is facility for purposes of determining whether release has occurred epa also is not party in any of these cases 6 in july 2008 federal appeals court ruled in another case that animal waste discharges cannot be challenged under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra if the discharges are already regulated under clean water act cwa permit rcra establishes regulatory scheme for the treatment disposal and storage of hazardous and solid wastes the court ruled that rcra does not apply to any activity or substance that is subject to the cwa coon v willet dairy 073454cv ca 2 july 30 2008 7 in 1998 epa granted an administrative exemption from release reporting requirements for certain radionuclide releases epa cited authority in cercla sections 102a 103 and 115 for granting administrative reporting exemptions where releases of hazardous substances that pose little or risk or to which federal response is infeasible or inappropriate see 63 federal register 13461 march 19 1998

industry petition8 the proposal would exempt releases of hazardous substa nces to the air typically during digestion or decomposition from animal waste at farms from the notification requirements of cercla and epcra the exemption would apply to releases to the air from manure digestive emissions and urea including animal waste mixed with bedding compost and other specified materials farm is defined in the proposal as an agricultural operation from which 1000 or more of agricultural products are sold annually the same definition used by the department of agriculture epa explained that the rule is justified because of the resource burden to industry of complying with reporting requirements since the agency cannot foresee situation where response action would be taken as result of notification of releases of hazardous substances from animal waste at farms 9 the proposal drew significant public response during the comment period while the proposed exemption pleased many agriculture industry groups who seek waiver or other means to limit possible liability under cercla and epcra environmental advocates and other stakeholders opposed the exemption saying that emissions from an imal wastes are not trivial or benign critics noted that the epa proposal would exempt releases of ammonia as originally requested in the industry petition plus hydrogen sulfide and all other hazardous chemicals such as nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds released from animal waste some argued that an exemption is premature since epa is moving forward with research on emissions levels which could be undermined by regulatory exemption see crs report rl32947 air quality issues and animal agriculture ep s air compliance agreement state air quality officials opposed blanket regulatory or legislative exemptions and they recommended that if the agency considers any action it should only be narrow exemption such as one based on size threshold for farms 10 in december 2008 epa finalized the cerclaepcra administrative reporting exemption with some modifications to the original proposal11 the final rule exempts hazardous substance releases that are emitted to the air from animal waste at farms from the notification requirement of cercla as proposed the final rule relieves all livestock operations of all size not just poultry farms from cerclas requirement to report hazardous substance releases to the air to federal officials in addition the final rule provides partial exemption for such releases from epcras requirement to report releases to state and local emergency officials partially responding to public comments the final rule continues to apply epcras reporting requirement to large animal feeding operations those that are subject to permitting requirements under the clean water act 12 but exempts smaller facilities number of groups criticized the final rule again raising concern about the toxicity of chemicals such as ammonia and hydrogen sulfide that are emitted from animal waste facilities and arguing the cercla and epcra do not authorize administrative exemptions for specific industries coalition of environmental advocates 8 us

cir 091017 january 15 2009 in september 2008 the government accountability office gao issued report evaluating epas activities to regulate air emissions and water discharges from animal feeding operations gao found that epa is unable to assess the extent to which pollution from feedlots may be impairing human health and the environment because it lacks data on the amount of pollutants that cafos are releasing to the air and water gao recommended that epa develop comprehensive national inventory of cwapermitted cafos and accelerate its efforts to develop protocols for measuring and quantifying air contaminants from animal feedlots gao noted that epa has been criticized because its current air emissions monitoring activities are limited in scope and sample size and may not produce sufficient information to shape future regulation moreover gao questioned the basis for the cerclaepcra exemption that epa proposed in 2007 it is unclear how epa made this determination when it has not yet completed its data collection effort and does not yet know the extent to which animal feeding operations are emitting these pollutants 13

to congressional interest in these issues in march 2004 number of senators wrote to the epa administrator to ask the agency to clarify the reporting requirements of the two laws so as to limit their impact on poultry operations the senators letter said that because of unclear regulations and lack of scientific information about emissions poultry and livestock producers are uncertain about the laws requirements and are vulnerable to enforcement actions 14 in report language accompanying epas fy2006 appropriations the house appropriations committee urged epa to address the issues the committee continues to be concerned that unclear regulations conflicting court decisions and inadequate scientific information are creating confusion about the extent to which reporting requirements in cercla and epcra cover emissions from poultry dairy or livestock operations producers want to meet their environmental obligations but need clarification from the environmental protection agency on whether these laws apply to their operations the committee believes that an expeditious resolution of this matter is warranted 15 also in 2004 some in congress considered proposing legislation that would amend the definition of release in superfund section 10122 42 usc 960122 to clarify that the reporting requirements do not apply to releases from biological processes in agricultural operations and to amend epcra to exclude releases of hazardous ch emicals produced through biological processes in routine agricultural operations for some time there were indications that an amendment 13 us

on fy2005 consolidated appropriations legislation but this did not occur16 some members sought to amend the fy2006 agricu lture appropriations bill hr 2744 with provision exempting releases of livestock manure from cercla and epcra the proposal was promoted by senate conferees on the bill but it was not accepted by house conferees proponents including senator larry craig contende d that the proposed language was consistent with current law because in their view cercl and epcra were never intended to apply to agriculture environmentalists objected to the language arguing that it could prevent public health authorities from responding to hazardous substance releases from afos would block citizen suits against agriculture companies for violations of reporting requirements and would create an exemption from superfund liability for natural resource injuries that might result from large manure spill epa s congressional affairs office released an unofficial analysis criticizing the bill it argued that by eliminating federal liability for manure releases under superfund and epcra the provision could interfere with epa s air compliance agreement because companies would have much less incentive to participate in the agreement the agreement is plan that epa announced in january 2005 to collect air quality monitoring data on animal agriculture emissions17 the house and senate gave final approval to hr 2744 in november 2005 pl 10997 without the language that senate conferees had proposed also in november 2005 legislation was introduced that would amend cercla to clarify that manure is not hazardous substance pollutant or contaminant under that act and that cerclas notification requirements would not apply to rele ases of manure hr 4341 the bill was similar to the legislative language that senator craig had proposed to conferees as provision of the fy2006 agriculture appropriations bill with broa d definition of manure that includes for example bedding commingled with animal waste hr 4341 was introduced the same day that house energy and commerce subcommittee held hearing on animal agriculture and superfund the subcommittee on environment and hazardous materials heard from agriculture industry w itnesses who urged congress to provide policy direction on the issue that has developed as result of recent and potential litigation other witnesses testified that the reporting and notification requirements of superfund and epcra provide safety net for making information on releases available to government and citizens and that other environmental laws such as the clean air act cannot function in that manner an epa witness said that the agency was at the time considering ways to reduce the paperwork burdens for large afos to report their emissions resulting in the december 2007 proposed regulatory exemption discussed above related legislation was introduced in the senate s 3681 similar legislation was introduced in the 110 th congress hr 1398 and s 807 but further action occurred on any of these bills during consideration of farm bill legislation in 2007 hr 2419 the house agriculture committee approved an amendment

not included in the final legislation pl 110246 some members of congress have been critical of epa s proposal to exempt routine animal waste air releases from cercla and epcras reporting requirements questioning the potential for harmful environmental and enforcement impacts of the proposal18 at september 24 2008 hearing where gaos recent report was discussed see page several house energy and commerce subcommittee members said that they are skeptical of the epa s authority for blanket exemption others suggested that an ex emption for small farms whose emissions are unlikely to cause environmental harm would make sense epa and usda witnesses supported the proposal saying that the air release waiver would only affect reporting meant for emergency response situations but would not affect requirements to report emissions of hazardous substances from other farm sources or releases of hazardous substances from manure into soil ground water or surface water g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 supporters and opponents of the 109th congress and 110th congress legislation raised number of arguments for and against the proposals for example proponents of the exemption proposed in these bills representing the agriculture industry especially livestock and poultry producers say that animal manure has been safely used as fertilizer and soil amendment by many cultures all over the world for centuries and thus should not be considered hazardous substance opponentsincluding environmental activists public health advocates and state and local governmentsagree that when properly managed manure has beneficial uses superfunds reporting and cost recovery requirements do not threaten responsible operators who manage manure as valuable fertilizer they say however these groups say that when improperly managed and in the massive amounts produced at todays large feedlot operations animal waste can release number of polluting substances to the environment releases to surface water groundwater and the atmosphere may include nutrients organic matter solids pathogens volatile compounds particulate matter antibiotics pesticides hormones gases that are associated with climate change carbon dioxide and methane and odor proponents of the legislation argue that neither superfund nor epcra was intended by congress to apply to agriculture and that the pending legislation would simply clarify congressional intent cercla exempts normal application of fertilizer from the definition of release and also exempts releases of naturally occurring organic substances animal waste arguably was intended to be covered by these existing exemptions they say opponents respond that there is little firm evidence either way on this point as there is limited legislative history concerning this language the exemption for normal application of fertilizer enacted in cercla in 1980 applies to application of fertilizer on crops or cropland for beneficial use but does not mean dumping or disposal of larger amounts or concentrations than are beneficial to crops 19 18 letter from reps john dingell albert wynn hilda solis to stephen l johnson

application of fertilizer and the only court decision so far addressing this issue the vacated 2003 city of tulsa case discussed above held that neither plaintiffs nor defendants in that case had presented evidence sufficient for factbased determination of what constitutes normal application opponents of the legislation also argue that animal manure consists of number of substances that are nutritional and pharmaceutical elements of the feed provided to animals trace elements antibiotics nutrients and releases are the result of inadequate waste disposal not naturally occurring substances and activities proponents argue that enforcement and regulatory mechanisms exist under the clean water act cwa and other mediaspecific statutes such as the clean air act caa making it unnecessary to rely on superfund or epcra for enforcement or remediation in particular both the clean water act and clean air act require that regulated facilities obtain permits that authorize discharges or emissions of pollutants enforcement of permit requirements has been an important tool for government and citizens to address environmental concerns of animal agriculture activities opponents respond that enforcement under superfund fills critical gaps in these other environmental laws because not all pollutants are covered by other laws for example releases of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are listed under cercla but are not currently regulated as hazardous pollutants under the caa clean water act afo permits primarily address discharges of nutrients but not other components of manure waste eg trace elements metals pesticides pathogens moreover neither of these laws provides for recovery of costs for responding to or remediating releases nor for natural resource inju ries opponents also argue that while federally permitted releases are exempt from cerclas reporting requirements cwa and caa permit requirements apply only to facilities that meet specified regulatory thresholds for example cwa permit rules apply to about 14000 large afos less than 6 of all afos in the united states 20 finally proponents of the legislation argue that if animal manure is considered to be hazardous substance under superfund farm operations both large and small potentially could be exposed to costly liabilities and penalties opponents note that the purpose of release reporting is to keep federal state and local entities informed and to alert appropriate first responders of emergencies that might necessitate response such as release of hazardous chemicals that could endanger public health in community the exemption proposed in pending legislation they point out would apply not only to cercla and epcra reporting requirements but also to other provisions such as superfunds authority for federal cleanup of releases cleanup liability and liability for natural resource injuries according to states and some other interest groups liability which arises when manure is applied in amounts that exceed what is beneficial to support crops is necessary to bring about improvements in waste handling practices of large afos enacting an exemption would severely hamper the ability of government to appropriately respond to releases of hazardous substances and pollution caused by an animal agriculture operation they argue on the issue of penalties opponents note that penalties are not available under superfund for removal or remedial actions except for failure to comply w ith information gathering and access related to response action 20 us environmental protection agency national
