policy resources science and industry division joe richardson specialist in domestic social policy domestic social policy division summary httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22859 us food prices rose 4 in 2007 and are expected to gain 35 to 45 in 2008 higher farm commodity prices and energy costs are the leading factors behind higher food prices farm commodity prices have surged because 1 demand for corn for ethanol is competing with food and feed for acreage 2 global food grain and oilseed supplies are low due to poor harvests 3 rising incomes in large rapidly emerging economies have changed eating habits and 4 the weak dollar has increased us exports in addition higher energy costs increase transportation processing and retail costs although the cost of commodities such as corn or wheat are small part of the final retail price of most food products they have risen enough to have an impact on retail prices generally price changes at the farm level have diminished impact on retail prices especially for highly processed products the impact of higher food prices on us households varies according to income lowerincome households spend greater portion of their income on food and feel price hikes more acutely than highincome families higher food costs impact domestic food assistance efforts in numerous ways depending on whether benefits are indexed enrollments are limited or additional funds are made available higher food and transportation costs also reduce the impact of us contributions of food aid under current budget constraints introduction us food prices are increasing according to usda the consumer price index cpi for all food increased 4 in 2007 the largest annual jump since 1990 in 2008 crs2 this trend is expected to continue the all food cpi is forecast to increase 35 to 451 this rapid inflation follows an extended period of stable food prices from 1987 through 2007 food prices increased an average of 27 per year excluding the drought years of 1989 and 19902 during 2005 and 2006 food prices rose 24 this report examines the cause of food price increases and evaluates their impacts on us consumers key factors behind higher commodity prices robust domestic demand corn soybean and wheat prices all reached 10year highs during the 20062007 crop year high prices for corn reflected increased use for ethanol 22 of the 2007 crop and strong exports high corn prices in turn encouraged growers to move acres from wheat and soybeans into corn contributing to tight supplies and higher prices for those crops us farm prices in 2007 for corn are estimated at 375 to 400 per bushel compared with 200 in 2005 soybean prices are estimated at 1000 to 1080 per bushel up from 566 in 2005 and wheat prices are estimated at 650 to 680 per bushel up from 342 in 20053 global stocks are at low levels globally stocks of corn wheat and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22859 soybeans are at historically low levels drought in australia and eastern europe and poor weather in canada western europe and the ukraine have reduced available quantities with world stocks for wheat at 30year low4 buyers are turning to the us for supplies global consumption patterns are changing higher incomes are boosting demand for processed foods and meat in countries such as india and china these shifts require more feed grains and edible oil even in lowincome countries of subsaharan africa asia and latin america the vegetable oil share of diets has risen as processed food consumption rises in china consumption of meats other livestock products and fruits has increased while consumption of grainbased foods such as bread has slipped5 improving food distribution systems are altering chinese food preferences by introducing nonlocal foods in india per capita consumption of grains has fallen while that of animal products edible oils vegetables and fruits has increased6 better food distribution systems are altering chinese food preferences by introducing nonlocal foods

february 2008 crs3 weak dollar boosts demand for us exports as the dollar depreciates against foreign currencies us exports become more competitive boosting demand and prices according to the us department of agricultures usdas economic research service ers the dollar adjusted for relative inflation rates is expected to depreciate 7 against the euro 6 against the chinese yuan and 8 against the brazilian real in 20087 the exchange rate is an important determinant of agricultural trade the depreciation of the us dollar since 2002 has helped improve us agricultural export performance how do higher commodity prices impact consumers as commodity prices rise food prices follow but to lesser extent on average about 20 cents of each dollar spent on food is the farm share the retail cost less the valueadded after the product leaves the farm and moves along the marketing chain to the retail outlet8 in less processed foods the farm component of the final product is larger and changes in the farm price have greater impact at the retail level for instance eggs and fresh fruits and vegetables undergo minimal processing after they leave the farm they are consumed in essentially their original form the retail value of such products httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22859 tends to have large farm component and changes at the farm level have greater impact on the consumer on the other hand in highly processed products such as breakfast cereal the corn wheat or rice used is completely transformed and the final product bears little resemblance to the original commodity an 18ounce box of corn flakes contained about 33 cents worth of corn in 20069 higher corn prices in 2007 increased the corn share to 49 cents this is small part of the retail value of box of corn flakes most of the retail price represents packaging processing advertising transportation profit and other costs energy costs energy costs affect all levels of the food production sector recent record crude oil prices in excess of 110 per barrel affect costs throughout the marketing chain10 producers spend more for fertilizer for which natural gas is major input crop drying and transportation raising production costs at the processing wholesale and retail levels the cost of transportation and operating packing houses manufacturing plants and retail stores has increased some of these costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices in addition high petroleum prices increase the competitiveness of ethanol further boosting demand for corn 7 usdaers outlook for us agricultural trade february

leibtag february 2008 10 west texas intermediate wti crude oil price traded at cushing ok reached 110 per barrel for the first time on march 13 2008 crs4 food price changes vary by food type meat poultry dairy and eggs the cpi for all meats advanced 33 during 200711 beef increased 44 pork 2 broilers 52 and eggs 292 and dairy products advanced 74 in 2007 the farm share of these products is large compared with other foods so changes at the farm level are passed to greater extent to the consumer in many cases higher feed and energy costs were behind these increases strong export demand spurred by the weak dollar and reduced flocks played role in the price hikes for poultry and eggs the cpi for meats is forecast to increase by 15 to 25 in 2008 compared with other food categories these highvalue items also account for large share 111 of the average consumers food budget fruits and vegetables prices for fruits and vegetables gained 38 in 2007 and are forecast to increase 3 to 4 in 2008 production shortfalls affected some varieties especially bananas the largest by volume supplies of oranges were strong offsetting other declines energy costs were large factor in higher fruit and vegetable price increases fruits and vegetables account for 84 cents of the consumer food dollar httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22859 cereals and bakery products the cpi for these items advanced 44 in 2007 and is projected to rise 65 to 75 next year tight global wheat supplies and acreage reductions to promote ethanol production have caused spike in wheat prices however shifts in wheat prices have relatively small impact on grocery store prices because the farm share of these products is small prices for these product are affected more by marketing factors such as transportation labor and energy costs than the cost of basic inputs oilseeds and related products low stocks and strong export demand for soybeans are reflected in the cpi for these products which gained 29 in 2007 while much of this category is supplied by soybeans substitutes exist and will help moderate increases in 2008 the cpi is set to rise 7 to 8 due to continued strong export demand from countries where changing diets require more vegetable oil impact on lowincome households although us consumers generally spend smaller share of their income on food compared with many other countries that share varies widely across income levels overall us households spend 126 of their income on food12 so changes in the price of food have to be large to affect their total budget however the picture is vastly different for lowincome households in 2006 households with incomes in the lowest reported income category spent 171 of their income on food households with incomes greater than 70000 spent 113 of their income on food when food prices rise families with lower incomes feel the pinch more acutely since food expenditures make up larger share of their total expenditures also higherincome families can shift food 11

expenditures has significant impact on purchasing power for lowincome families federal spending for domestic food assistance programs food price inflation increases spending on domestic assistance efforts increasing prices encourage those who are eligible but not participating to enroll increasing prices translate directly into benefit payments and permeal subsidies for entitlement programs in which benefits are indexed to foodprice inflation eg food stamps school meal programs increasing prices place pressure on appropriators to provide more funding to support caseloads for discretionary programs like the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program food stamps the food stamp program is the largest of the federally supported domestic food assistance programs its benefits are indexed annually for changes in the cost of usdas least costly food plan the thrifty food plan tfp for number of years and well into 2006 annual increases in the tfp typically ranged between 15 and httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22859 25 with few exceptions however starting in late 2006 food prices as reflected in the cost of items in the tfp began to increase at faster rate the last benefit increase effective october 2007 was 46 as result the average monthly benefit will be 6 per person higher in fy2008 the impact of benefit increases on food stamp costs also depends on participation for fy2008 the benefit increase noted above combined with estimated growth in enrollment yields likely 2 billion cost attributable to adjustments for food price increases out of total spending of 367 billion about double the 1 billion that would have occurred based on pre2007 price increases costs are expected to increase even more in fy2009 child nutrition federal payments for lunches and breakfasts served to children in participating school meal programs are the second largest federal commitment to domestic food assistance about 11 billion per year these permeal subsidies now ranging as high as 283 meal including the value of usda commodity donations are indexed every july to foodprice changes reflected in the food away from home component of the cpi over the 12month period ending each may indexed maximum subsidy rates those paid for the majority of school meals that are served free or at reduced price to children from lowerincome families have increased by some 25 cents meal between the 20052006 school year and the current 20072008 school year the annual increase in subsidies has gone from 29 for the 20052006 school year to 33 for the 20072008 school year increasing federal support by about 300 million above spending if earlier food price increases had prevailed according to ers this trend is expected to continue into fy2009 the wic program unlike food stamps and child nutrition programs the wic program is discretionary spending depends on annual appropriations based largely on estimates of participation and the cost of the food packages that are purchased with wic vouchers the value of benefits is not indexed per rather wic vouchers are redeemable at whatever the participating retailer charges for the items covered by the crs6 vouchers which differ according to the type of recipient eg pregnant mother infant child as result the cost of wic vouchers reflect food price changes without the time lag built into other nutrition programs like food stamps just as important wic vouchers are highly specific as to the food items they cover and have relatively heavy emphasis on certain types of food dairy items and infant formula being major component in recent years the cost of wic food vouchers has varied great deal largely because of changes in dairyrelated food prices the average perparticipant monthly cost of vouchers has ranged from 3480 in fy2002 to 3915 in fy2007 however the annual percentage increase has been very small for some years 1 or less for fy2003 fy2005 and fy2006 and more substantial for other years 66 for fy2004 and 56 for fy2007 most recently monthly perparticipant wic food costs averaged 4250 for the first three months of fy2008 given this significant volatility it is difficult to produce specific estimates of the effect of food price inflation on wic program costs however the ers forecasts of increases in egg and dairy product prices in the 2 to 4 range in 2008 indicate that relatively high wic food costs are likely in the near term foreign food aid httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22859 higher commodity and food prices reduce our ability to provide food aid to other countries without additional appropriations food aid usually takes the form of basic food grains such as wheat sorghum and corn and vegetable oil commodities critical to developingcountry diets since there is very little value added for these commodities shifts in prices translate directly into higher prices for foodinsecure countries or reduced food aid contributions per dollar spent also higher energy costs have increased shipping costs for both food purchases and food aid unlike some domestic nutrition programs foreign food aid is not adjusted to account for changing costs after long period of declining food costs developing countries are facing increased food import bills for some countries as high as 25 in 200713 the us agency for international development usaid has indicated that rising food and fuel prices would result in significant reduction in emergency food aid according to press reports in march 2008 usaid expects 200 million shortfall in funding to meet emergency food aid needs for fy2008 congress appropriated 12 billion for pl 480 food aid the same as fy2007 for fy2009 the presidents budget again requested 12 billion in six out of ten years since 1999 supplemental funding for pl 480 title ii food aid has been appropriated last year the world food program wfp estimated it would need 29 billion to cover 2008 food aid needs recent commodity energy and food cost increases have boosted this estimate to 34 billion according to the wfp the current price increases force the worlds poorest people to spend larger proportion of their income on food 13 usdaers rising
