briefing of review auditors lecture given on 14 october 1965 and this is briefing of review auditors 14 october 1965 the whole situation boils down to this is there are three data which i have not been able to teach orgs or tech or anybody else there are three data they dont know these data as key data these data dont have any eitherors or qualifications or there are other cases do you see there are three data that are just smashers as far as cases and so forth are concerned our concern is with one of these which is the second one but what im going togiving you your briefingthat ill tell you what these three data are that we just cant really seem to get acrossthat i dont have any luck getting across at all so the reason why im talking to you is in review then you will run into these three data all the time because they wont have gotten across in tech the tech division wont have gotten it across or the rest of the org or supervisors wont have gotten them dont you see or ethics doesnt get them dont you see and they dont get these three data see and the first one is that high ta equals overrun and that there isnt any other reason for high ta there arent 192 different reasons for high ta theres just one its overrun and thats the only the only reason you have high ta from review standpoint then you have to find out whats overrun do you see from review standpoint all right covering this then high ta always equals overrun and equals nothing else and is the problem of review to find out how and what was overrun the review auditors problem is to find out what and how all right therefore raw meat walks in off the street and hes got ta at 50 and hes never been audited and he has never been anywhere near buddhism mysticism anything else well youve got your work cut out do you see ill plead with you this isnt any reason to throw away the datum do you follow because the easy way out is you say well we cant find out whats overrun so lets just throw away the datum well now thats what the hgc auditor did thats what the field auditor did that is what ethics did and that is what the course supervisor did they all threw away the datum and theyre looking now for mysterious reasons why the ta is high and therefore in view of the fact that theyre all looking for it as review auditor for heavens sake dont you do it too do you see because then we cant repair the case and nothing patches up now youre going to find some interesting things when you get into this youll see theres ta sitting at 50 all right its an overrun youre liable to get into some case and find out the fellow went into christianity and had big datum in christianity and went release when he was six years old in sunday school and then he kept on studying religion do you follow its overrun you got it now this bird took up health course and he walked out there and he just was walking five miles every morning and he was getting up and he was doing sittingup exercises and he was terrific hed been an invalid and he used this therapy and there he is boy and he gets into terrible shape and his ta is stuck at 50 and you want to figure out why its an overrun well he just did one too many pushups do you follow he didnt knock off the regimen when he was winning you get the idea ordinarily i would say there was some kind of treatment or wisdom back of it which he then went beyond release because dont think were so special that just because somebody is in scientology then life all behaves differently we in scientology and so forth progress because we parallel what life is doing and we know more about it than people out in life dont you see but that doesnt mean the phenomena of scientology doesnt happen elsewhere it does all the time it isnt specialized to scientology now i should imagine these poor blokes in practically every therapy from aesculapian the witch doctor the juju anybody under the sun has run across the overrunrelease phenomena can you grab that as datum so we look on these things as all failed technologies and we dont know what the original technology waslet point that out to youbecause it got alterised and they all went the route that we almost went and ill call to your attention that we almost went the route we almost did fifteen years we were overrunning state of keyedout clear we called it originally clear then we called it keyedout clear and now were calling it release because there was such thing as clear and the funny part of it is all the original works talk about pure clear if you want to listen to the congress of 19i think it was 57 58 and so forthts talking about pure clear that were making today do you see but there was this intermediate stage and people would hit this and that was the stage i was hitting with people as early as 1947 you see and it made release and it made an apparency of this other state so the state had its harmonics dont you see so the state is approached gradually clear is somebody who hasnt got bank if you release somebody of the bank then he behaves like somebody who doesnt have bank do you follow but the only way you could guarantee his total behavior that way forever would be to have bank at all and then there wouldnt be any bank to get away from and thats of course clearing do you follow that so therefore nobody else has made one of these things dont worry about that clear thats highly specialized as far as were concerned but these states of release is what youre handling in review and theyre the ones that are going to give you trouble and the key datum of the whole thing is that high ta equals an overrun it isnt necessarily what was being run at the time the ta went high and there you also come cropper the guy is running pr pr 5 and the ta suddenly flies up and sticks at 50 and the auditor cant do anything well bend your wits around to the complication that you may have restimulated an overrun communication release do you follow and the guy drops straight back into the lockup in the bank which he hadwhich was an overrun communication release do you follow he might have gone back into that and existence might not be flat isnt that interesting the likelihood of this occurring is very slight but its still possibility do you see that the ta is not high on what is currently being run the ta might be high on rudiments question now iflets say the guy was problems release hed been problems release for many many years and somebody asked him problems question in the rudiments all of sudden his ta goes up and sticks and then they go on running the power process and the ta is up and stuck and nothing is moving with the case and then this looks like an awful bungle so now what you have to find out is what was overrun you see so your question is always asking on this first item what was overrun and believe if the auditor in the hgc did not solve it or the field auditor didnt solve it and so forth then it is always true that what they were repairing is not what was wrong if you try to fix the loudspeaker of radio set when it is the mains plug thats broken just to get corny about it you cant of course fix the radio set so if somebody kept on working on this and working on this and working on this and it wasnt solving it then realize please that that wasnt what was wrong so theyve got the wrong overrun if theyre trying to get ta downinvariably and inevitably so if you look back through the persons folder and you find out theyve been working on rehabilitation of former release and the ta was high and ta and theyve been working on the rehabilitation of former release and the ta is high and so forth dont discard the datum that high ta equals overrun the guy is rehabilitating the wrong release its just theyve never spotted the right release now we had one case here actually that for about five months was driving us all around the bend and we were trying to rehabilitate former release on this person we tried to rehabilitate him in 1950 1952 1958 were trying to rehabilitate time after time former releasethetan exterior we worked and worked and worked on these things dont you see having an awful time it happened in 1965 there was the auditor right there and that case did not resolve because in the rehabilitation of the former release they had the wrong release they were trying to rehabilitate and it was highly improbable that the case had had former releases of the states and at the times they were trying to rehabilitate them do you follow and the case had sat there and given tremendous lot of end words to her auditor ive forgotten exactly when it was it was less than year ago wasnt it male voice yeah and had given whole bunch of end words and had gone fourth stage release male voice the first pc in the saint hill hgc first pc in the saint hill hgc and gone fourth stage release do you see the gag here now the first tendency is to throw away the datum that high ta equals overrun because you see youre trying to find the overrun and you dont find the overrun so you throw the datum away and say the ta must be high from something else do you follow you just havent located the right overrun you see the ta could be held up with half dozen different overruns but it would be held up with the one its held up with it wouldnt be held up with one of the others that could have held it up do you understand it is the one that it is so all youve got to doall you got to dois find the right overrun and the ta will come down and the case will go release again and the rehabilitation technique which youve got will do it providing you have the right overrun now for instance i rehabilitated what we were then calling first stage release i rehabilitated this release i got momentary floating needle that was good enough for i wasnt going to push it any further and i just came off of it right like that but i noticed that when i came off of it the needle stopped floating well i didnt want to push my luck i didnt push my luck because in the first place this case was going to be further audited you see on higher grades so i just had the case declared and got away from it and i started pushing the case along some other line of power processing and i didnt get anyplace and quite incidentally and almost by accident i noted the fact that the case had been fourth stage release and found it and down came the ta and so forth and the case was very very arc broken about solo auditing on end words too very arc broken about the whole thing couldnt find any more end words that would read she got very upset i mean the bank blew and that was it as far as she was concerned she was out of itreleaseshe couldnt go back into it again and so forth actually the ta had come down and floated while she was looking through dictionaries and i dug it all back up and refloated it and that was that do you follow so your job in review is definitely if you got high ta dont come off of the concept high ta equals an overrun you just find out the right when and the right what and down itll comecrash and every time weve had trouble is when we havent put this into action do you understand male voice very well you got it audience yes so thats not datum then that you run away from theres high ta thats an overrun where is the overrun what was overrun and the sky is the limit it could be anything do you follow you can get wilder than scat if youve got somebody that hasnt been audited very much and hes got high ta youre whaaaw the skys the limit what was he doing that released him thats the question something youll find out what it is now i havent found whole track former release overrun stuck ta ill just give you that as little beneficial datum i havent found one now you notice i havent told you it doesnt exist i havent found somebody that because he was member of the planet builders eightyou get the ideaeight trillion years agohe obviously was release theni havent found his ta stuck up because of that whole track release do you understand i dont say it cant exist but i do say i havent found it ive found them all in this lifetime so far got it male voice thank you for that all right you got that one real good is there anything misunderstood about it any question about it hm audience nope female voice yeah i have question yes female voice that exact thing happened with this morning well you overran something but it probably wasnt what you were running female voice do you follow female voice yes all right now lets take number two and this is the main thing i want to talk to you about rolly coaster equals suppressive person in that persons vicinity in other words rolly coasterpts if person rolly coasters its pts pts is connection with suppressive ill give you the exact mechanics of it ill let you sort them out on your own time and thats postulatcounterpostulate is the anatomy of problem and this belongs in actual fact at grade i and its just this postulate counterpostulate postulate versus postulate that is the definition and the anatomy of problem and there is other definition to problem there can be several counterpostulates there can be several going out like this but that makes several problems the central problem is always postulatecounterpostulate so the guy has had purpose in life and somebody has suppressed it or guy has had purpose over twentyfourhour period and somebody suppressed that purpose in other words his purpose was his postulate the other person saying he couldnt do it was the counterpostulate do you follow so that is simply the anatomy of problem and it belongs at grade i and there is other reason for rolly coaster this is the other data im giving you there just is other datum people dont rolly coaster because they got into an engram people dont rolly coaster because the auditor misread the action people dont rolly coaster because his father was methodist and has been dead since birth do you understand so dont as review auditor ever fall for two seconds for any other reason for rolly coaster than postulatecounter postulate there isnt any other reason now sp is version of this its version of problem and is specialized kind of problem and that is what causes the rolly coaster the individual has run into postulatecounterpostulate since his last improvement which makes him potential trouble source potential trouble source means the case is going to go up and fall down and hes trouble source because hes going to get upset hes trouble source because hes going to make trouble and hes trouble for the auditor and hes trouble for us and hes trouble for himself and so forth and he really does make trouble thats very carefully named the sp isnt making trouble see hes just poisoning the whole universe you know but it isnthe isnt making trouble hes just going squash do you see anybody says anything to himsquash you see its the pts who makes the trouble do you see this now this is the whole backbone of ethics and there isnt anything more to ethics than thethis basic purpose of ethics is ethics exists to get tech in if you ever see ethics being put in that throws tech out then ethics is being used in suppressive fashion now the only way that you could use ethics suppressively is use it in such way that it threw tech out because the purpose of ethics is to put tech in if youve got ethics you can get tech in you carry on ethics long enough to get tech in and thats all the longer you carry it but in the process of getting tech in you very often will run into rolly coasterand that is case worsens after it improves as easily as that the case did all right in yesterdays session comes to this session falls on his head thats rolly coaster and theres other cause for it see than postulatecounterpostulate youll see process come out and an hcob come out on process that will be called search and discovery and search and discovery is just to find the purposesto find the suppressions the person has had in life and one of the broad ways of finding it unfortunately will make problems release in minutes you say what has been your main purpose in life thank you very much who opposed it thank you very much and in large percentage of cases problems release do you understand itd be an interesting percentage on which this would occur of course the person doesnt know about problemsthey arent cleaned up about problems worth nickelbut theyll go release on the subject of problems and theyll stay released and now you try to run problems on them and youre going to get high ta do you see theyve solved all their problems the way you solve problem is to find the source of the counter postulate you find the source of the counterpostulate thats the way to solve problem now man gets solutions to problems in other words he leaves the counterpostulate and his own postulate in place not knowing the definition of problem and then solves the resulting collision as in dialectic materialism you want to read that some day thats very interesting its the anatomy of problem gone mad any idea is the product of two forces is the backbone of it its quite interesting its theits current philosophy but in actual fact thats based on problem two forces going together make squash so therefore thats it now if you want to really solve problem and see it solve in the physical universe and have an awful lot of fun with it then you had certainly better look over the whole perimeter of counterpostulates what is the source of the problem and if you hit it rightif youve got problem with joe jinks and hes in toronto canadaif you hit it right dont be surprised if you get phone call from joe jinks telling you the problem is all solved it happens routinely and constantly and i had to run down what process was it that was causing this phenomena because we ran into the problem very often wed run problems of comparable magnitude on pc in an hgc or an acc or something like this and the next thing you know their longlost husband or something that theyd had such awful problems with is very sweetness and light do you follow you see the problem evaporated but the funny part of it is in the physical universe itll also evaporate for the other person sometimes so thats quite interesting and thats very interesting for you to know that in connection with ethics because when you see that the disconnection or the handle or disconnect causes an enormous problem for the person or for the other person from whom they are disconnecting you have invariably found the wrong person now ethics the policy letter that moved them over to suppressives must be located by reviewand thats where youre coming in and thats why im talking to you were not permitting ethics anymore to locate suppressive persons theyre going to be located by review auditors in regular session do you see that because ethics just flubs it too often theyre not equipped for auditing and so forth theyre interested in justice and that sort of thing and they dont go ahead with it and do good job of it so therefore anybody walking into ethics who is pts who has rolly coastered and so forth is sent to review and that is the route actually an hgc auditor should send directly to review and then review sends to ethics ethics has to have some notation of this thats the only reason they go to ethics after review do you see because when theyre sent towhen somebody says well this person is pts and so forth you could send them directly dont you see over to ethics and then to review in all cases but i know very well that if one of your examiners was to find pts and know very well that that examiner would inevitably and invariably send that person directly to review wouldnt send them to ethics why review is closer do you see so after the person has been found to rolly coaster and then review cleans up the sp why they can go over to ethics and get statement of handle or declare dont you see but its all cleaned up theyre not any longertheyre not even vaguely worried about it do you see now thats the way its going to be handled and thats the change of route so therefore im briefing you and the reason why ive called you in is just to give you this datum and just tell you that although around you will hear occasionally there are other reasons for rolly coaster thats for the birds thats not true there are other reasons for rolly coaster than pts and pts is the manifestation of postulatecounter postulate now you notice that i havent said how long you know the person didnt have to be pts for two and half years before he became up to reviews attentioni mean up to the attention of ethics he might have only been pts for twenty minutes and its very interesting that you can overrun person who is trying to tell you hes already gone release and the person becomes pts whos the suppressive audience the auditor isnt that interesting of course the suppressiveits merely suppressive action you dont declare the auditor suppressive person do you follow you dont have to then go through the endless action of the pc must separate from the auditor and disconnect and thats lot of balderdash isnt it but still the mechanics are there rolly coasterpts well just who where how what and thats your job in review now you can use listing you can list the persons purposes what purpose of yours has been thwarted i mean unfortunately in handling this youre going to have some releases on your hands but watch it get them declared when they occur thats grade i release now dont let somebody shake you off of this datum that rolly coaster is pts and the definition of pts is connected to suppressive person or action see person or action guy can inadvertently suppress something youre driving down the road and somebody steps out in front of your carbelieve when you hit him you suppressed him you certainly didnt intend to and that doesnt make you suppressive person do you follow so just looking at this from straight technical mechanics and so forth rolly coasterpts now if that pts is not handled the person does become then trouble source and ptsvery well named you overrun somebody oh boy youre going to have trouble theyre going to make trouble theres going to be all kinds of trouble whats your main consideration then in handling anybody sent to you from ethics or from the hgc in the review your main consideration is promptly and immediately this person has been up against suppressive action or person and dont go nutty and try to do arc breaks on him and sympathize with how badly theyve been hit nothing like that all youve got to do is find the suppressive person now the person may only have been suppressive for five minutes or the person might have been suppressive for lifetime but you find the right one and instantly the good indicators will come in and watch it because youre liable to make release right at that moment now also watch it that by getting off the sp you rehabilitate the state of release which was being overrun you see now the person came in to you with high ta and all of sudden you recognize the person is pts also do you follow person felt better now feels worse well your action is to locate the suppressive action or person of course but you might have the high ta because the person has had an overrun on process but its still suppressive action see completely aside from rehabilitating the process what have you got now suppressive person is not somebody with horns its person who has had counterpostulate to the pc you are handling but suppressive person who is routinely suppressive in life invalidative of scientology and trying to keep people from getting well and that sort of thing is social menace now hes the problem of ethics your problem in review is to find him and if its just momentary suppression and so forth you dont go declaring somebody suppressive because he accidentally overran the pc and the pc says i feel good now and i dont want to answer any more auditing commands well youd better answer this next auditing command well i dont want to answer any more auditing commands well youd better answer this next auditing command the person will now behave to some degree on the basis of pts you not only have got an overrun release or something of that sort is lurking around there but you in addition to that have pts do you follow so both of those actions would have to be handled but please please dont let somebody shake this datum for you because when they cant find the sp by any means then they will drop the datum do you see they drop the datum huh they say well all right it was because he ate bananas last night well im afraid that somebody in auditing wouldnt rolly coaster if he just ate some bad bananas last night hes not roller coastering in auditing so he doesnt feel so well this morning well he knows damn well what did it if he wanted toif you wanted to be an absolute perfectionist on this you could say well who insisted you eat the bananas dont you see and probably at that moment why his tummyache would go snap but that sort of thing is too minor were talking about real honest togod rolly coaster see the person was doing fine in theaudited in london doing fine appears here doing badly oh boy thats rolly coaster he signs all over the wall thats rolly coaster dont you see did all right last week isnt doing well this week well thats rolly coaster and always there is suppressive action or personinvariably inevitably and reviews job then when somebody sends to review pts is to find that now review also as i told you might find also an overrunmay find two things while looking for one and the only mistake you can make is two things being present find the wrong one and say the person is now okay when the other one still has to be handled see youd handle both of them if two things are wrong youd handle both thingsif the person has had an overrun and is also pts from some other courseor source now youll notice that whenever you tell person the right suppressive thats like locating indicating the bypassed charge it isnt the same as an arc break dont get it tangled with an arc break because an arc break is only cycles of communication thats another animal and you cant handle these things but the funny part of it is the same technology will locate and indicate the suppressivesource of the suppressionlocate what it is get the pc to look it over indicate what it is you should get good indicators and you should get them right now and your meter ought to blow down and its unmistakable and now if the person again rolly coasters dont say we didnt find the right suppressive theres another one thats all its that simple you gotyou did this and the good indicators all came in the person felt fine for three days and all of sudden rolly coasters again and you have the person back on your hands dont let anybody berate you and you john as qual sec dont let anybody start berating qual for not having found the right suppressive do you see this person was infested you see just find it you say aw poophoophoo wuffiwuff nothing bahbahbah there was just another suppressive to be found thats all and go ahead and do so if you found all the suppressive persons and actions in persons lifetime you would have problems release and sometimes as i said to you and all too often the problems release will occur while youre looking for it and after that youre up the creek arent you how now are you going to handle this when the person gets into another pts situation well dont let it worry you because hes release on the subject and he wont unless he goes home and starts selfauditing it now let give you another little point on overrun herejust point in question so forth you know you have auditors around who selfaudit and that person can be released and then theyre so anxious to get to the next grade of release that they dicker around and tinker around with whatever theyre doing and then they think that was good command the auditor was running and then they overrun it they actually will give themselves repetitive auditing commands im calling that to your attention and it is source of overrun which is all too often overlooked there can be in trained scientologist another auditor present the pc as an auditor auditing himself hes liable to go homearc breaks oh gee i felt so wonderful after aunt molly and so forth and he hasnt quite blown it all dont you see and he sits down and he says let see was there anything else that aunt molly invalidated about oh yes that and somebody else invalidated about now its going to run for very short distance and then his ta is going to go high and hes going to have high ta do you see that its hidden source of an overrun all right but this rolly coaster suppressive ptp of long duration is the one which gives ethics the most trouble and its being handed over as an auditing proposition to review and one of the reasons its being handed over is ive solved the technology of it and there isnt anything more to the technology of it than ive just given you and you can fancy this up any way you please you can run fifty dozen different processes to solve the same thing you could tailormake all kinds of onetwothrees and that sort of thing but its just postulatecounterpostulate its just an effort to act versus an effort tonot to act its this you see its just postulatecounterpostulate you spot the source of the counterpostulate and that will be the end of the problem and thats the piece of technology thats just come up and i think youll admit thats terits so plainly stated that youre sure i have said it before and i havent said it in that two connected words all right now the other thing has nothing much to do with those two but it is the source of the overt and the source of the overt is that formula whereby when something is misunderstood person will then individuate from it and then he will commit overt acts against it and that is the cycle theres longer cycle than that youll find it in bulletins its already been covered but this is the third datum which is key topflight senior datum that is most commonly overlooked confusion or argumentation upset or stupidity comes from misunderstood word misunderstood earlier than the one the person is talking about the word that is misunderstood is always earlier than the one the person is nattering about thats always the case and thats part of the original study materials but its just uniformly missed student is having hard time out here arguing with the supervisoryip yap yap yap yap yap yap yap yap the supervisor will just stand there and argue about what the student is arguing about theyll go on arguing and arguing and arguing and they bring them over and come into review and cramming and so forth and they go on arguing arguing arguingoh bull this is terrible because in the first place how did the supervisor not know this other part of the datum its always earlier than the one theyre arguing about if theyre arguing about point in paragraph two that the student cant understand then the missing point is in paragraph one always and the student will never argue about paragraph one and hell always argue about paragraph two do you see that and the misunderstood word is in paragraph one do you follow all right if halfway through course theyre very upset and they cant understand their material and theyre being very very stupid then there was something in the very early part of the course that theyre not discussing at all and this is always the case the person never spots what theyve misunderstood so any confusion stupidity or upset from the level of training always comes from word misunderstood or misunderstood thing prior to the one the person insists on talking about its always prior to the one the guy is talking about and to talk to him about what he is talking about is just waste of time and as review auditor you get this every once in while you gethave to do an assist on student of some kind or another and hell say well and youll say well what didnt you understand ill show you how to do this wrong what didnt you understand oh why i didnt understanduhi just couldnt understand about engrams they justjustoh theyre very upsetting i couldnt understand anything about them well was there some word in the connection with engrams that you didnt know flunk flunk flunk flunk you get it the auditor is saying what word connected with engrams didnt you understand or the auditor says well he didnt get the definition of engrams do you see this is just flunk flunk flunk flunk guy doesnt know what he misunderstood its before he went into engrams and you say all right now the pat question if you want to solve this snap right like that is just before you got into engrams what was there that you collided with that you didnt dig oh oh that locks i just didnt understand what lock was or whatwhatwhat is this thing called picture all of sudden bingbang now he understands it and thats all there is to it do you follow and the magic of the whole thing is spotting the earlier misunderstood thing from the one he is talking about and that is implicit in the study materials themselves but is the key major point and is the solution to it and is the one which is consistently missed in tech its missed in ethics its missed all over the organization its missed in checkouts its just missed in rash and when the guy has missed all the way across the boards he inevitably will wind up sooner or later in review to get this handled or to get handled some way or another because he will get routed down there now he very often will get routed there from cramming see cramming will get fed up with this guy and send him over for some auditing dont you see now thats all you do with him now you can run the form 26 june on him and you can do lot of other things but this is the one you do with him this is the key datum this is senior to everything else that you can do now these first two ive given you rank this way the first one ranks as exclusively an auditing activityhigh ta equals overrun the second one rolly coaster and suppressive and so forththat is really exclusively an environmental difficulty do you understand and it can occasionally incur in auditing youll err when you think it always occurs in auditing but thats really environmental dont you see and this next one is on the subject of comprehension of scientology materials and thats where they relate and they are the key datum to each one of these activities in other words high ta equals overrun that is the key datum of auditing because thats the one that can wreck all auditing so therefore it obviously is the boss datum and the second one this can wreck guys whole life pts and if thats not discovered and so forth and thats the key datum that regulates the environment and this third one is the one that regulates his comprehension not only of scientology but of existence see thats the key datum that regulates his iq and that is the boss datum that is the top dog right there thats the one way up on top and its so easy to get it wrong it is just so simple to get this wrong oh the reason the guy is arguing with is misunderstood word thats wrong that is totally improper statement and it wont lead to resolution of the problem do you understand thats false datum there is misunderstood word in what the guy is arguing with about and that is false from the standpoint of review auditor that has not sufficient truth to resolve the situation thats wrong the correct datum is there is something misunderstood just before what hes talking about thats the correct datum and thats the one that leads to resolution of the situation guys talking about steam engines well i just never dug any steam engines steam engawblah ifs terrible subject i just hate steam engines and so forth never could understand anything about them im always having accidents with them and so forth even though i own the bo railroad ah yeah steam engines and so forth well an auditor whod say to him at that moment what word have you misunderstood about steam engines just has missed the whole boat thats why the datum wont work female voice sure if that was the problem it would resolve yes the guys trying to understand steam engines he isnt confused about steam engines just before you got into steam engines what did you misunderstand what did you find incomprehensible just before you got into steam engines what were you in just before you got into steam engines lets take it on terribly broad basis see what were you in just before you got into steam engines history and youll find out that his misunderstanding comes into the basis of politics and railroads after that you see is secondary subject that has to do with the political expansion of continents or something and hes all hung up in the subject of politics and he doesnt think people ought to drive other people off continents or something see its that wild so he moves into this whole field of steam engines and he doesnt understand anything about steam engines steam engines were the source and cause of lot of things he doesnt comprehendanything about it theres an allied subject he was in just before he got there do you follow im giving you ridiculously broad example do you understand so this auditor out here hes saying i just dont understand anything hell keep saying mind mind now what do you mean by mind i mean its this boy on course see what do you mean by mind i dont understand anything about mind all right his supervisor stands there and defines mind for him and goes into all kinds of gesticulations and explanations and graphs on the board about honesttopete he could do this probably for the next century without ever getting his point across you got it he could go on and on and on just before you got upset about minds what were you into what were you studying just before you got to that point about minds thats the right question oh i dont remember oh yes i do yes yes iii do yes there is something therereligion and hell be hung up on completely different subject and hes never spotted it and youve got to actually take his wits and back him up on the time track do you understand so that your review auditor action is always realizing that the remainder of the org possibly has not got this one straight that its the earlier one if theres anything wrong with guys study then this is the thing that is wrong they have not backed it up one theyre arguing about bulletin three when its bulletin two see theyre arguing about paragraph seven when its paragraph six its alwaystheyre arguing about the one after when the fault is the one before you got that and your review action then becomes unstabilized to the degree that you dont find misdefinition in what he is studying you dont find the misdefinition in what he is studying and therefore you think his stupidity comes from some end word or something you see youll change your mind youll think the study datum is gone youll start looking elsewhere for the reason why well the magic is all connected in if it doesnt resolve on what you ask him its before what you ask him its the one hes arguing about and telling you all about that he didnt understand and so forth then he didnt dig something just ahead of it and as review auditor when you get this boy from cramming or from course or something like this you must back it up well hes saying the authese instructors these supervisors they just wont listen to and i keep telling them and telling them and telling them that i just cant understand an emeter what were you studying with regard to emeters well i was studying the emeter book of emeters all right now is there something in the very early portion of that book this is possible but not too probableis there something in the very early portion of that book you didnt dig well clean up couple see its like unburdening the time track well theres all right is there something just before you got into meters is there something before you got into emeters you could find possibly that its the word essentials he didnt understand essentialsyou know emeter essentials its that early in the book but the probability is its something that predates emeters it predates his study of meters and therefore youve got to follow that down whatever it is itll read on your meter do you know that you can date it before you find it you can say all right youre having an awful time learning emeters youve been checked out on 850 gaes on the subject of emeters here in your last three weeks of auditing his ethics file is thick with these things all right now ill give you the wrong question what dont you understand about emeters wrong question wont lead to resolution itll lead to an argument itll lead to some tiny partial result it has magic connected with it you say the right question the date of the misunderstanding thats got you upset about emeters 1964 1963 is it before 1960 is it after 1960 you could do it as crazy as this all of sudden you get read and that was 1962 he says well i wasnt even in scientology all right what were you in well i sold books in bookstore and youll find dictionary fell on his foot or something of the sort and at the moment that it fell on his foot he was looking up meters or he was looking up electronic devices or he was once an electrical enginehe wanted to be an electrical engineer when he was child and hed forgotten all about this but his parents wouldnt permit him to be an electrical engineer now he doesnt understand about anything electrical has nothing to do with meters do you find that and you can plow around this way but for heavens sakes dont plow around on what the pc is arguing with and thats my whole message the absolutely fixed datum here is its always misunderstood word and it is always prior to the one the pc is arguing about and if youve got that boy can you handle cases on review basis on stupid students whoosh whoosh whooshtheres nothing to it it just rolls off pocketa pocketapocketa guy walks in so on there isnt anything else by the way wrong with student see thats how senior the datum is if you use this datum youll find the other things wrong with the student just fall away theyre all apparencies theyre all locks on what this is you see you can find lot of things wrong with student you could find lot of arguments hes having you can find lot of upsets hes having you can find injustices you can find all sorts of wild things and so forth but if he isnt making progress in his studies then the thing is wrong with his studies isnt it you dont handle his environment so that he can handle his studies better let give you that as datum ive been so knocked out and dragged down and so forth casewise and otherwise and otherwises dont you see that i couldnt see two feet away and the funny part of it is i could always work on technology you normally find in existence the thing the person is having trouble with will resolve if you find out what caused it and if it doesnt resolve then you havent found out what caused it but this datum about study itdont buy any guff off the student dont buy any bunch of different solutions let him get them off let him get off some arc breaks acknowledge him locate and indicate the bypassed charge of somebody who wouldnt listen to him about his not understanding things or i dont care what you dobut realize pleasemake him happy for surebut realize please that youre justthat youre just flicking at the froth on the beer youre not taking any drinks of beer you can do all the things you want to you can putter around for hours you can make him feel pretty good you can get him into good communication with you all this sort of thing and so forth and then you jolly well better find out what he misunderstood before what he said he misunderstood you say what have you misunderstood about all this and the guy says well i dont understand buttercakes and you say well thats good dont ever make the fatal mistake of saying what dont you understand about buttercakes if hes got buttercakes pinpointed that easy he doesnt misunderstand buttercakes its cooks its something just ahead of buttercakes and your right auditing question is all right well just before you got into the subject of buttercakes and so forth what were you into guy says thats new thought see hell give you the basic on the chain dont you see well i dont care how far down you follow the basic on the chain after all review auditing is paid auditing follow it down to the year izzard but dont follow it into the r6 bank got it i dont care how many study points you cure up with this bird but remember you are handling fringes on end words and that sort of thing i dont care how many points you relieve i dont care if you clean up his kindergarten you understand its almost deliberate antiq and he says its bwell dont arc break himsay oh yes cheerily cheerily yeah oh yeah good im glad you dont understand buttercake but now give him all right just before you got into buttercake what was it oh youre going to get some big cognitions and youll get some big results you got it all right to summarize up hereto summarize upyou got three data and its the three data that go out in the org and thats why theyre key data for review these three data go out in the org the org in general has many other data which they consider very important and how to run emeters and that sort of thingthese data are very important and how to do power processing and everythingthese things are very important you understand but from the viewpoint of review there are really only three data that are important only three and one of those is high ta equals overrun and if you know that boy youre never going to have any trouble when was it overrun what was overrun two if person rolly coasters he is pts at that moment he is pts and its only question of what was the source of the suppressive action do you see thats the counterpostulate just get that counter postulate thats all who its not by the way good enough to get the counterpostulate youve got to get if you can the source of the counter postulate the reason the r6 bank for instance doesnt blow is because you dont get the counterpostulatewho on the counterpostulate you can get all the counterpostulatesbut who that doesnt emerge till way late dont you see youll find the most difficult problems that you handle on an individual is he never found out who he walked out his front doorstep and all of sudden he had bullet through his head and he never found out who shot him hell be hung up on the track for centuries see who was the other fellow and he goes around asking this question rather haunted next one confusion of any sort comes from misunderstood word that goes before the word the person is arguing about thats the whole lot now you could ask for whole bunch of fancy processes one of which to handle each one and i could probably be very amusing and be very interesting i am going to write one called search and discovery and give several alternate methods of finding the sp and so forth that mostly consist of listing or just asking or something like that but actually if youre skilled auditor you should be able to do these now with the routing for any auditing action required in ethics were for sure going to send that person right straight to the qual div and the department of review and analysis of this particular character is going to be done in ethics of any kind whatsoever they just do nothing but make mistakes oh they spot one every once in while and straighten lot of thing up i shouldnt invalidate them 100 percent but theres too many mistakes too many mistakes and those mistakes have one common denominator the mistakes ethics makes are in actual fact failure to spot the proper sp or source of the suppressive actions and that is the big mistake because if ethics spotted that mistake every time then everyone would be very happy with ethics and its interesting that in the policy letter the person is not permitted if hes gone for an ethics action on this pts hes actually not permitted to be trained or processed till hes paid for his review auditing now youll say boy that is sure commercial oh thats really commercial i have found uniformly that if person wont payactually the pennies and pencefor review auditing they didnt get it in review the person is usually so happyif the person has really been handled in review hes so happy about it he would actually push somebody out of his road to go over there and put down the quid or two that was necessary to handle his little bill do you follow but if he wont pay that i can assure you that it hasnt been located so its just preventer dont you see
