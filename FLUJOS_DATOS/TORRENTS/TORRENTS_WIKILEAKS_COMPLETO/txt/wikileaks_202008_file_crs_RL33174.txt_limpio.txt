community disaster loan cdl program authorized by section 417 of the stafford act and administered by the federal emergency management agency fema the cdl program is intended to assist local governments that experience revenue losses as the result of presidentially declared major disaster the traditional cdl program provides for loan forgiveness cancellation when it is determined for three fiscal years following disaster that the affected government will not be able to repay the loan from the start of the program in august 1976 through september 30 2005 of the 2335 million in principal advanced 2257 million or 97 was for loan amounts that were cancelled five loans in excess of 5 million accounted for 90 of cancelled principal in 2000 5 million limit was placed on loan that any one jurisdiction can receive through the traditional cdl program for single disaster on october 7 2005 both houses of congress approved and president bush signed the community disaster loan act of 2005 cdla pl 10988 the cdla provided for special community disaster loans up to an aggregate of 1 billion in principal amount to local governments so that they could continue to provide essential services in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita for these special loans the new law removed the 5 million per loan limit but prohibited their cancellation fema approved 136 special cdls that summed to 739 million for louisiana communities including 120 million for new orleans and 261 million for mississippi communities all of the loans received subsidized interest rate soon after the cdla was enacted bills to remove the prohibition on the cancellation of the special cdls were introduced but were not voted upon in the 109th congress the emergency supplemental appropriations act of 2006

revenues as the result of hurricane katrina or rita cancellation of these loans was again prohibited the law removed the 5 million per loan limit and raised the other size limit from 25 to 50 of communitys operating budget louisiana communities received 261 million in loans including another 120 million for new orleans and mississippi communities 9 million the safe port act pl 109347 enacted

loan program action in the 109th congress overview in addition to the heavy loss of lives and the dislocation of hundreds of thousands of families hurricane katrina on august 29 2005 and hurricane rita on september 24 2005 caused devastating damage to property and seriously disrupted the economic activity that normally provided the tax and revenue base of the affected areas especially in louisiana and mississippi there was concern in congress and elsewhere but particularly in the taxexempt bond community that the destruction of the underlying tax base would impair the ability of gulf coast communities to make the payments on their outstanding debt let alone their ability to issue new debt1 these communities also faced the loss of revenues needed to finance normal operating expenses and possibly additional operating expenses engendered by the hurricane disasters this point was brought home when new orleans mayor c ray nagin announced on october 4 2005 that he would have to lay off 3000 municipal employees 50 of the citys work force due to lack of revenue2 this report focuses on the federal emergency management agencys femas community disaster loan cdl program this is program of federal aid available to local governments specifically to replace revenues lost as the result of natural or manmade disaster these are the revenues needed to pay for normal operating expenses such as fire and police services public schools and debt servicing this aid is available in addition to the federal disaster aid provided to replace damaged public infrastructure and to address special stormrelated expenses such as debris removal on october 7 2005 both the senate and the house of representatives approved and president bush signed into law the community disaster loan act of 2005 pl 10988 the act provided for up to 750 million of the 50 billion previously appropriated for disaster assistance following hurricane katrina to be available to support up to 1 billion in special cdls to local governments affected by the hurricanes in addition it made two important changes in the conditions governing these loans compared with traditional cdls it removed the 5 million 1

10988 bill was introduced in each house of congress to repeal the provision that disallows the cancellation of the special cdls but neither was voted upon in the 109th congress the emergency supplemental appropriations act of 2006 pl 109234 enacted on june 15 2006 included an appropriation of 2798 million to support an additional 371733 million in direct loans to communities affected by hurricanes during the 2005 season these supplemental loans were available to communities that lost 25 or more of their tax revenues as the result of hurricanes katrina or rita this law again removed the 5 million per loan limit but prohibited cancellation of these loans it also raised the size limit for loan from 25 to 50 of communitys operating budget fema approved loans totaling 271 million for all eligible applicants 101 million of the loan authorization was not used the safe port act pl 109347 enacted on october 13 2006 raised the size limit for traditional cdl from 25 to 50 of local governments annual operating budget if that government lost 75 or more of its tax and other revenue as the result of major disaster the 5 million per loan limit and the cancellation option still apply to traditional cdls traditional community disaster loans section 417 of the stafford act this section describes the law and regulations which governed all community disaster loans before october 2005 these rules will continue to govern traditional community disaster loans cdls made outside of the provisions for special cdls the rules not amended by the laws enacted in 2005 and 2006 will continue to apply to the special cdls as well the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act3 is popularly known as the stafford act the stafford act authorizes the president to issue major disaster declarations that authorize federal agencies to provide assistance to states overwhelmed by disasters through executive orders the president has delegated to the federal emergency management agency fema within the department of homeland security dhs responsibility for administering the major provisions of the stafford act assistance authorized by the statute is available to individuals families state and local governments and certain nonprofit organizations4 3 pl 93288 as amended 42 usc 5121 et seq 4 crs report rl33053 federal stafford act disaster assistance presidential declarations eligible activities and funding by keith bea crs3 of particular relevance to local governments is section 417 of the stafford act5 sec 417 authorizes the president to make loans to any local government which may suffer substantial loss of tax and other revenues as result of major disaster and has demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions loan may be approved in either the fiscal year in which the disaster occurs or the immediately following fiscal year only one cdl may be approved for any one local government as the result of single disaster6 the amount of loan is based on need and is not to exceed 25 of the annual operating budget of the local government for the local governments fiscal year in which the major disaster occurs the safe port act pl 109347 enacted on october 13 2006 raised the size limit for traditional cdl from 25 to 50 of local governments annual operating budget if that government lost 75 or more of its tax and other revenue as the result of major disaster in addition as result of an amendment made in 2000 the dollar amount of any loan is limited to 5 million7 the obligation to repay the loan is to be cancelled if the localitys revenues in the three fiscal years following the disaster are deemed insufficient by fema or its outside auditors the normal term of cdl is five years the loan typically takes the form of fiveyear balloon that is the full principal and accumulated interest are due all together at the end of the fiveyear term the associate director of fema may consider requests for an extension based on the local governments financial condition however the total term of loan normally may not exceed 10 years except under extenuating circumstances8 the interest rate on cdls is based on the average rate on the date of the loan approval for us treasury obligations with maturities of five years the interest rate on cdls is higher than the average rate on municipal state and local bonds of similar maturity this is because the federal tax exemption of interest on state and local government bonds enables those governments to sell bonds at lower interest rates than comparable federal bonds the relatively higher cdl rate implies that localities with strong credit ratings would be better off borrowing from the private credit market if they were permitted to borrow to cover operating expenses only communities with weak credit rating or those hoping for or anticipating loan cancellation would be attracted to traditional cdls locality that is in arrears on its repayment of cdl is not eligible to receive any additional loans under section 417 receiving loans under section 417 does not 5 42 usc 5184 community disaster loans 6 44 cfr 206361d 7 section 2075 of

local government may use the borrowed funds to carry on existing local government functions of municipal operation character or to expand such functions to meet disasterrelated needs9 the funds are not to be used to finance capital improvements or the repair or restoration of damaged public facilities neither the loans nor any cancelled portion of the loans may be used as the nonfederal share of any federal program including those under the stafford act10 for loan cancellation purposes unreimbursed expenses of municipal operating character are those incurred for general government purposes such as police and fire protection trash collection revenue collection maintenance of public facilities and other expenses normally budgeted for the general fund11 disasterrelated expenses that are eligible for reimbursement under project applications or other federal programs are not eligible for loan cancellation12 in addition expenditures associated with debt service any major repairs rebuilding replacement or reconstruction of public facilities or other capital projects intragovernmental services special assessments and trust and agency fund operations are not eligible for loan cancellation the state must cosign the promissory note or else the local government must pledge collateral security to cover the principal amount of the note in the event of default fema may request administrative offset against other federal funds due the borrower andor referral to the department of justice for judicial enforcement and collection cdls are not available to states or nonprofit organizations community must submit an application to fema either to receive cdl or to have loan cancelled typically fema hires an outside auditing firm to perform the required analysis of the communitys operating budget this outside analysis is combined with data and information that the jurisdiction provides to fema in support of its loan application or cancellation application the code of federal regulations cfr assigns the primary responsibility for both making and canceling cdls to the associate director of fema for state and local programs and support however according to femas office of general 9 the code of federal regulations sets forth the policies and procedures concerning the community disaster loan program in 44 cfr ch 1 subpart k secs 206361206367 10104 edition 10 44 cfr 206361 f 11 general fund as defined by the municipal finance officers association see 44 cfr 206366 b 1 12 44 cfr 206366 b 2 crs5 counsel these functions are currently performed by the director of the recovery division the regulations provide that fema shall cancel repayment of all or part of community disaster loan to the extent that the associate director determines that revenues of the local government during the full three fiscal year period following the disaster are insufficient as result of the disaster to meet the operating budget for the local government including additional unreimbursed disasterrelated expenses of municipal operating character13 accordingly community cannot seek to and fema cannot cancel the obligation to repay loan until at least three years following disaster legislation enacted in the 109th congress to address the immediate needs of the local governments affected by hurricanes katrina and rita the 109th congress modified the cdl program and allocated funding for 1 billion in special loans through the community disaster loan act of 2005 pl 10988 enacted on october 7 2005 the emergency supplemental appropriations act for fy2006 pl 109234 enacted on june 15 2006 provided funding for an additional 372 million in special loans to communities that lost tax revenues as result of the 2005 hurricanes this law included another change in the rules governing the size of these disaster loans the safe port act pl 109347 raised the percentofbudget limit on the size of traditional cdl that will now be available to local government that suffers severe loss of tax and other revenue from major disaster special community disaster loans enacted in october 2005 the community disaster loan act of 2005 cdla s 1858 vitter was passed by congress and signed by president bush as pl 10988 on friday october 7 2005 the eve of the weeklong columbus day recess14 the motivation for the expedited treatment was reportedly to have the money available to affected communities by monday october 1015 pl 10962 the second emergency supplemental appropriations act adopted following hurricane katrina provided for 50 billion in disaster relief16 the 13 44 cfr 206366 see also sec 206361g 14 s 1858 was introduced by senator vitter passed without amendment by unanimous consent in the senate then agreed to in the house and passed without objection and signed

appropriations act to meet continued crs6 community disaster loan act of 2005 provided for up to 750 million of those funds to be transferred to femas disaster assistance direct loan dadl program these funds in turn were to be used to make direct loans to local governments to assist them in providing essential services as authorized under section 417 of the stafford act17 the transfer of 750 million could subsidize gross obligations for the principal amount of direct loans not to exceed 1 billion18 the cdla also allowed for an additional 1 million of the disaster relief funds provided by pl 10962 to be transferred to the disaster assistance direct loan program for administrative expenses to carry out the direct loan program19 the new law made three changes to the cdl program law with respect to the special community disaster loans scdls to be made under this section first an scdl may exceed the 5 million limit placed on traditional loans made under section 417 the limit of 25 of the localitys operating budget still applied second the cancellation forgiveness of such loans was prohibited third the law directed that the loans be used to assist local governments in providing essential services the provision eliminating the possibility of loan cancellation was reportedly insisted upon by the bush administration office of management and budget and the republican leadership in the house as condition for providing the loan assistance20 several members made statements on the house and senate floors objecting to the requirement that the loans be repaid21 representative obey requested that requirement be included to report to congress about the size and use 16 continued immediate needs arising from the consequences of hurricane katrina passed by both the house and senate and enacted on september 8 2005 for more information on the two emergency supplemental laws enacted see crs report rs22239 emergency supplemental appropriations for hurricane katrina relief by keith bea 17 the cdla does not define the term essential services the stafford act does include the term within its definition of private nonprofit facility 42 usc 51229 18 the 1 billion amount is based on the assumption by the office of management and budget that the new loan program will have credit subsidy rate of 75 this is explained in greater detail in the section on budgetary treatment later in this report 19 for comparison femas budget request for fy2006 was for 567000 to administer the entire disaster assistance direct loan program which includes state share loans in addition to cdls under

addressed after the columbus day recess23 but it was not the interim rules implementing the special community disaster loans program were published on october 18 200524 the standard interest rate on scdls was again the average rate on treasury issues with fiveyear maturities however the rules provided that fema would have the discretion to allow localities facing unique economic hardships to receive discounted interest rates at levels consistent with the lowest rate offered by the small business administrations disaster loan program25 formula was provided for determining the discounted interest rate the subsidized rate would be the us treasurys fiveyear maturity rate plus one percentum adjusted to the nearest 18 and reduced by onehalf for example assume that the yield on fiveyear treasury bonds were 432 as it was on october 21 2005 adding one percentum would give 532 rounding that to the nearest 18 would give 538 reducing that by onehalf would give 21116 269 as the subsidized interest rate on scdls the federal budget for fy2007 assumed that the borrower interest rate for the cdl program would be 270 during fy200626 the term of the scdls was to remain as for traditional cdls at five years with the option for the associate director of fema to extend the term to up to 10 years only under extenuating circumstances may the repayment period exceed 10 years also as with

executive office of the president office of management and budget budget of the united states government fiscal year 2007 federal credit supplement washington february 2006 p 10 crs8 enacted on june 15 200627 among its many provisions it appropriated an additional 2798 million for the disaster assistance direct loan program account of which 1 million was for administrative expenses the remaining 2788 million was to subsidize gross obligations for the principal amount of direct loans up to 371733 million as with the special community disaster loan scdl program authorized under the cdla of 2005 this numerical relationship was based on the assumption of 75 credit subsidy rate for the loans the funds were to be used to assist local governments affected by hurricane katrina and other hurricanes of the 2005 season in providing essential services as with the scdls the loans made under this law could not be cancelled loans were available only to local governments that suffered loss of 25 or more in tax revenues due to hurricane katrina or hurricane rita this is in contrast to the reference in section 417 of the stafford act to substantial loss of tax and other revenues as was provided for the special cdls loan could exceed the 5 million limit placed on traditional cdls in addition the loan could equal not more than 50 of the annual operating budget of the local government this is in contrast to the 25ofbudget limit that applies to both traditional and special cdls because specific language was included to indicate that the funds would be available until expended it was interpreted by fema that the loans must be made by september 30 2006 the end of fy2006 to take advantage of the supplemental appropriation the same time limit applied to the original scdls this placed time pressure on the loan application approval and dispersal process because the percentofbudget limit was raised to 50 communities that had applied in the first round for scdls of up to 25 of their operating budget could apply for an additional 25 under the emergency supplemental loans variety of special districts that rely on revenues other than taxes such as charges and fees were not eligible

conference report stated that this provision would primarily help small local governments with annual budgets of under 10 million other bills introduced in the 109th congress several other bills introduced on or around october 7 2005 would have made other changes to the rules governing the community disaster loan program three of the comprehensive katrina relief bills hr 3958 s 1765 and s 1766 contained identical cdl provisions these would have lifted limits on the size of loan and allocated specific dollar amounts to five named parishes in louisiana senator landrieu introduced four other bills at that time that addressed cdls s 1846 s 1855 s 1856 and s 1857 the last three which allocated 750 million in disaster relief funds to support 1 billion in loans were superseded by the bill enacted s 1858pl 10988 two bills would have lifted the 5 million per loan limit but imposed the condition of approval by either congress s 1857 or omb s 1856 for loans to be cancelled hr 4024 would have removed the 5 million cap and the automatic cancellation provision for all cdls not just the special new loan program soon after the cdla was enacted companion bills were introduced in each house specifically to repeal the provision that prohibits cancellation of the special cdls hr 4117 and s 1872 part of more comprehensive gulf coast recovery bill would have raised the percentageofbudget limit on cdl from 25 to 50 hr 4438 part of fema overhaul bill s 3721 would have removed the 5 million per loan limit and raised the percentageofbudget limit from 25 to 50 for loan made to local government located in an area determined to have suffered catastrophic damages from major disaster these two provisions were included in the emergency supplemental appropriations act for 2006 pl 109234 cancellation would have remained possibility for loans made under s 3721 representative maloney of new york city introduced three bills that would have made cdls available to state as well as local governments removed size limits on loans and turned the loans into grants from the outset by not requiring any payment of interest or principal in the case of major disaster the first bill hr 1795 addressed the revenue losses experienced by the city and state of new york after the terrorist disaster of september 11 2001 the other two bills responded to the effects of the hurricanes hr 4012 and hr 4090 following are short descriptions of the individual bills addressing cdls that were introduced but not enacted house bills hr 1795 maloney the whatever it takes to rebuild act of 2005 introduced april 21 2005 referred to the committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on economic development public buildings and emergency management on april 22 hr 1795 was introduced with the intention crs10 of increasing federal aid to the governments of new york city and the state of new york to help compensate them for the losses of tax and other revenues related to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 hr 1795 would have amended the stafford act to make community disaster loans available to states as well as local governments it would have retained the restriction that the loan not exceed 25 of the annual operating budget of the state or local governmental entity but it would have removed the limit of 5 million on the size of the loan that could be made to an individual government the bill would effectively have turned into grants loans made as result of major disaster caused by terrorist attacks occurring on or after october 30 2000 the bill provided that the president shall not require the payment of any interest or principal on loan made under this section to state or local government which may suffer substantial loss of tax and other revenues as result of major disaster caused by terrorist attack29 finally section 4 of hr 1795 would specifically have authorized the president to make loans to new york city and the state of new york for losses of tax and other revenues as result of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the total amount of the loans would have been set at 88 billion or greater amount if determined by the president to be necessary to cover the losses subject to the availability of appropriations the president would not have required the payment of any interest or principal on these loans representative maloney had introduced identical legislation in the 108th congress hr 1542 and nearly identical legislation in the 107th congress hr 5523 without section 4 the explicit funding for new york city and new york state hr 3958 melancon louisiana katrina reconstruction act introduced september 29 2005 referred to numerous committees and subcommittees the cdl provisions were identical to those in s 1765 and s 1766 section 114 of the general provisions of this comprehensive bill addressed cdls sec 114a would have prohibited any dollar or percentage limit on cdl made to assist local government in which major disaster relating to hurricane katrina was declared to exist of the funds appropriated for cdls in fy2006 sec 114b of hr 3958 listed specific dollar amounts to be used for loans to five named parishes in louisiana totaling just over 1 billion hr 4012 maloney community disaster loan equity act of 2005 introduced october 7 2005 referred to the committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on economic development public buildings and emergency management hr 4012 would have amended section 417 of the stafford act to make cdls available to states as well as local governments it would have removed the limit of 5 million per loan in addition two special conditions 29 section 3c of hr 1795 in the 109th congress crs11 were provided for loan made to state or local government which has suffered substantial loss of tax and other revenues as result of major disaster that the president determines to be an incident of national significance first the loan would not have been subject to the limit of 25 of the governments operating budget second the president would not have required the payment of any interest or principal on the loan this would effectively have made the loan grant from the outset the amendments would have applied to any major disaster occurring after august 24 2005 the findings section nonetheless referred to revenue losses experienced by the city and state of new york following the terrorist attack of september 11 2001 as well as the effects of hurricane katrina which occurred on august 29 2005 hr 4024 baker community disaster loan act of 2005 introduced october 7 2005 referred to the committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on economic development public buildings and emergency management of the funds appropriated for disaster relief by pl 10962 hr 4024 would have allocated 300 million to subsidize loan amounts not to exceed 400 million and another 1 million for loan administration like the cdla pl 109 88 and the emergency supplemental pl 109234 bills enacted hr 4024 would have removed the limit of 5 million per loan and prohibited the cancellation of the special loans made from these funds but it would also have removed the 5 million cap and the requirement that loans be cancelled if the local government is in poor fiscal condition for all loans made under the traditional cdl program hr 4090 maloney whatever it takes to rebuild act of 2005 part ii introduced october 20 2005 referred to the committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on economic development public buildings and emergency management hr 4090 built upon hr 4012 hr 4090 would have repealed the recently passed community disaster loan act of 2005 pl 10988 like hr 4012 hr 4090 would have made state as well as local governments eligible for cdls it would have removed the 5 million cap on cdl in the case of loan made as result of major disaster that the president determines to be an incident of national

that the president could establish additional criteria as conditions for eligibility for loans in excess of these limitations the text of the amended bill referred to limitation in the singular but it did not specify which of the two limitations it might be referring to the absence of the plural may be an error these additional criteria were intended to focus the assistance on those jurisdictions

has typically been to subsidize borrowing costs this has taken the form of providing federal guarantee of loans made to the local government as in the case of the loan guarantee enacted for new york city in 1978 in the midst of its fiscal crisis it has also taken the form of permitting locality to issue federally taxexempt bonds for private activities in order to augment its tax base over the long run as in the case of liberty zone bonds issued by new york city after the terrorist attack of september 11 2001 the community disaster loan program is unique in permitting local governments struck by disasters to borrow directly from the federal government it has also been unique in giving the federal administrators of the loan program the crs15 authority to cancel the borrowers obligation to repay the loan under specified local budget conditions state and local governments are generally prohibited by state constitutions or laws from issuing municipal debt to finance deficits in their operating budgets indeed the regulations governing traditional cdls prohibit loan cancellation to finance budget deficit that was anticipated before the disaster30 instead the cdl program is intended specifically to permit community to borrow to pay for operating expenses when its revenue base has been damaged by disaster budgetary treatment financing for the activities authorized by the stafford act is provided through funds appropriated to the disaster relief fund drf which is administered by the department of homeland security dhs through the federal emergency management agency fema funds appropriated to the drf remain available until expended termed noyear account typically there is supplemental appropriations legislation to meet the needs of especially catastrophic disasters as occurred with hurricane katrina31 accordingly femas budget request for fy2007 included only routine administrative expenses of 569000 for the disaster assistance direct loan program account32 the cdla of 2005 pl 10988 provided 1 million from disaster relief funds to help administer the special cdls however fema expected to spend an additional 25 million in fy2006 for advisory and assistance services to help process the 1 billion in special cdls33 the cdl program is direct loan program of the federal government in contrast to loan guarantee program the cdl program is classified as discretionary program in contrast to mandatory program under the budget enforcement act of 1990 the cdl program is subject to the federal credit reform act of 1990 fcra34 the fcra changed the

the agency for its credit program35 these requirements of the fcra explain the language used in the cdla of 2005 and the emergency supplemental appropriations act of 2006 in february 2005 the office of management and budget omb estimated the credit subsidy rate of the traditional cdl program at 93 for fy2005 and fy200636 roughly speaking this means that for every 100 million of loans made and interest due 93 million in principal or interest was cancelled or forgiven37 this was by far the highest subsidy rate among all of the federal governments direct loan and loan guarantee programs in contrast subsidy rate of 75 was used in the calculations for the cdla of 2005 and the emergency supplemental appropriations act of 2006 this lower rate was based on the assumption that the special cdls could not be cancelled the 75 subsidy rate was used to determine that 750 million in budget authority could support total loans of 1 billion as provided in the language of pl 10988 this language

programs40 the interest rate component of the subsidy should be higher under the special cdl program and the emergency supplemental cdls than under the traditional cdl program because all of the gulfarea jurisdictions will get the discounted interest rate41 the fy2007 budget assumes borrower interest rate of 270 for the cdl program in fy2006 this is half or less of the borrower rate reported for other federal direct loan programs despite this apparent interest subsidy the fy2007 budget attributes all of the 75 subsidy rate to defaults net of recoveries and none to interest42 the actual subsidy outcome will not be known for five or 10 years depending upon the maturity period set for the special cdls historically cdls have been made on an asneeded basis without pre specified aggregate limit furthermore from 1974 until 2000 there was dollar limit on the size of loan that could be made to an individual local government through the traditional cdl program the 2000 amendment limited the loan to any individual local government to 5 million and provided that additional loan would be made to community that is in arrears on payments under previous loan43 congress made these changes to help control program costs the 2005 cdla took another approach to controlling the cost of the special cdl program that it created while it lifted the 5 million cap on an individual loan the new law prohibited the cancellation of any loan made under its auspices it also set an aggregate limit of 1 billion on the principal amount of loans that could be made based upon setaside of 750 million from

affected by hurricanes katrina and rita should be treated as loans that must be repaid or as loans that may be cancelled forgiven cancellation of loan repayment obligation in effect results in grant to the community the community disaster program for local governments began in 1970 as program of community disaster grants in 1974 congress replaced the grant program with program of community disaster loans45 however the loan program was accompanied by provision requiring mandatory cancellation of the obligation to repay all or part of the loan under specified local budget conditions in contrast the funds advanced under the 2005 cdla or the 2006 emergency supplemental would be treated strictly as repayable loans 1995 report by femas office of inspector general recommended considering the conversion of the community disaster loan program into grant program because so few of the loans were expected to be repaid and because it requires much less time effort and expense to administer grant program than loan program46 in 1996 femas director of the office of policy and regional operations noted that the subsidy rate for the cdl program was close to 90 for fy1996 and close to 100 for fy1997 he said that femas goal was to terminate the loan program or if not terminated to administer it as grant program47 in 1997 congressional testimony then fema director james lee witt asked

without saddling them with additional debt with possibility of interest or principal repayments grant program would cost more per dollar of aid delivered than loan program in addition grant program would likely be used by more jurisdictions than loan program and could thus be considerably more expensive for federal taxpayers larger program would redistribute more resources from nonaffected areas to areas affected by disaster however even though administrative accounting costs may be lower with grants than loans grants may require more federal control and oversight of the use of funds monitoring compliance could increase the cost of administering grant program experience with traditional loans and their cancellation the traditional cdl program has been used infrequently relative to the number of declared disasters from the first loans made in august 1976 through september 30 2005 period of 29 years fema received 64 loan applications related to 21 separate disasters of those 64 applications four were withdrawn by the community and five were suspended because another federal aid program was then available to school districts through the department of education fema approved the remaining 55 loan requests and disbursed funds in contrast over the same time period there were 1104 declared major disasters many of which affected more than one local jurisdiction community disaster loans were made from fy1999 through fy2005 the fema data summarized in table 1 in millions of dollars and table 2 as percentage of total for loans disbursed suggest that the traditional cdl program is more accurately described as grant program with small loan component this is because the cdl program has experienced high rate of loan cancellation measured in dollar terms of the 2335 million in total loan principal disbursed 1687 million or 722 went to 16 loans that were fully cancelled another 570 million or 244 was the amount of principal cancelled for the 6 loans that were partially cancelled adding these two categories together indicates that 2257 million or 966 of the total loan principal disbursed was cancelled the repayment experience looks better when measured simply by the number of loans thirtysix or twothirds of the 55 individual loans made have been paid back in part or in full however many of these loans were for amounts as small as 500 or 1000

data on individual loans as of sept 30 2005 provided by gerry miederhoff fema program specialist crs22 eliminating the 5 million per loan cap many large local governments in the gulf region including new orleans could not benefit significantly from the traditional cdl program because of the loan limit of 5 million per jurisdiction per disaster removing the 5 million limit is likely to deliver more federal aid to large jurisdictions than would be allowed under traditional program rules the primary argument against eliminating the 5 million cap is the greater potential cost to the federal government total of five of the 55 cdls approved through september 2005 under the traditional cdl program exceeded the 5 million cap together they accounted for 90 of the cancelled principal and 93 of the cancelled principal and interest see table 3 this suggests that removal of the 5 million cap is likely to increase the federal cost of the program if there are defaults on large loans some argue that the other cap 25 of the borrowing governments operating budget in the fiscal year of the disaster event achieves the objective of capping the federal exposure albeit at higher level that cap was

approvals source data as of sept 30 2005 from gerry miederhoff fema program specialist lowering the interest rate consolation offered to those concerned about the noncancellation provision for the special cdls was that the administrators of the loan program would have considerable latitude in setting the terms of repayment for the loans which include crs23 both the interest rate and the time period of the loan49 however according to the interim regulations accompanying cdla of 2005 the time period for repayment is the same for the special program as it is for the traditional program typically five years and not to exceed 10 years except in cases of exceptional financial hardship50 the special cdl program provides fema administrators the option of offering lower interest rate to communities judged to be in more serious financial distress according to fema all gulf jurisdictions will be eligible for the subsidized interest rate on the special and emergency supplemental cdls lowering the interest rate is intended to reduce the burden of repaying the loan this is counter to the usual practice in credit markets where borrowers judged more financially risky typically face higher interest rate than those judged more likely to repay however it does parallel the treatment of physical disaster business loans offered by the small business administration sba to businesses that have not been able to obtain credit elsewhere51 lower interest rate would by design increase the attractiveness of the cdl program to more governments the likely increased demand for the loans would increase the federal cost of the program the larger interest subsidy alone would add to the cost of the program even if the loans were repaid attracting less creditworthy borrowers is likely to raise the risk of default on the loans further increasing the cost of the program in contrast policy of linking the cdl interest rate to the underlying credit rating of the borrowing government could reduce the adverse selection that may exist under both the traditional and special cdl programs52 for example setting the interest rate at fixed amount number of basis points or percentage below the local governments current fiveyear bond rate is method that could be easily implemented by fema yet would still reduce the burden on the borrowing government 49 statement of representative baker

community disaster loans program 70 federal register 60443 october 18 2005 51 the sba sets maximum interest rate of 4 per year and maximum maturity of 30 years on loans to borrowers judged unable to

disaster or 8 whichever is less and the maturity period cannot exceed three years httpwwwsbagov visited october 18 2005 52 the term adverse selection refers to the concept in insurance markets whereby only those who will likely need insurance are most likely to purchase policies in the context of cdls it suggests that jurisdictions with serious budget troubles will be more likely to use the federal loan program crs24 experience with the special cdl program with the authority to make up to 1 billion in loans the special cdl program was nearly four times as large as the traditional cdl program was as of september 30 2005 2335 million loaned as of october 4 2006 fema had provided 84 special community disaster loans for local governments in louisiana and 52 for mississippi for total of 136 loans

orleans and 261 million for mississippi communities thus the 1 billion limit on loans under the original special cdl program was reached and the program was considered completed53 all of the loans received the subsidized interest rate calculated by the formula set forth in the interim rules implementing the special cdl program54 the subsidized rates were in the range of 266 to 290 based on fiveyear treasury note rates in the range of 432 to 501 the specific rate depended on the treasury note rate on the date that the loan was approved concerned that applications were approaching the 1 billion limit on november 16 2005 fema officials placed cap of 700 million on the aggregate amount of loans that could be approved for communities in louisiana with the remaining 300 million reserved for mississippi communities applications approved as of november 16 were approved for the full amount requested nineteen applications totaling 2508 million in loans had been approved for louisiana communities as of that cutoff date55 to stay within its limit the state of louisiana reduced by 30 every request for loan of more than 2 million that was received after november 16 as of february 21

by crs from information on individual loans supplied by fema june 18 2007 legislative history over its history the community disaster program has taken the form of both grant program and loan program several approaches have been used to limit the cost of the program in addition changes were made in the definitions of revenues to be replaced and expenses to be supported by the program crs27 disaster relief act of 1970 the cdl program originated as grant program sec 261 of the disaster relief act of 1970 pl 91606 provided for community disaster grants the grant provisions originated in house amendment to s 3619 the president was authorized to make grants to any local government which as the result of major disaster had suffered substantial loss of property tax revenue both real and personal grant could be made for the year of the disaster and the following two tax years the grants were intended to replace lost property tax revenue the locality was expected to maintain its tax rate and assessed value factors at their predisaster levels specifically the grant for any tax year could not exceed the difference between the annual average of property tax revenues received by the local government during the three tax years preceding the disaster and the actual property tax revenue received by the local government for the tax year of the disaster and similarly for the next two tax years however if the government had reduced its tax rates or tax assessment valuation factors subsequent to the disaster an adjustment would be made to remove the effect when measuring the shortfall in revenues alternative senate proposal for loan program not adopted the conference committee on s 3619 did not adopt the provisions of the bill passed by the senate which proposed loan program instead of the grant program the senate passed bill would have authorized 100 million to establish community disaster loan fund in the treasury the fund would have provided loans to local governments for three purposes 1 meeting interest and principal payments on outstanding bonded indebtedness 2 paying the local share of federal grantinaid programs necessary to restore the disaster area and 3 providing and maintaining essential public services such as fire and police protection to qualify for loan local government would have to have suffered loss of more than 25 of its tax base or such substantial amount that it could not otherwise meet payments on its debt obligations its matching shares or its essential public services the size of the loan was linked to the loss of property tax revenues in the same way as the grant program that was adopted the loans would be interestfree for the first two years the term of the loan could not exceed 20 years the interest rate on the loans would be determined by the secretary of the treasury based on the current average market yield on 10 to 12year us treasury obligations less an adjustment not to exceed 2 per year the president would be authorized to defer the initial payments on the loans for five years or half the term of the loan whichever was less such sums as the president might determine necessary could be transferred to the fund from disaster relief appropriations in turn the president could transfer excess monies in the fund to the general fund of the treasury or to disaster relief appropriations59 59

crs28 disaster relief act of 1974 the robert t stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance act60 the disaster relief act of 1974 pl 93288 42 usc 5121 et seq replaced the program of community disaster grants with program of community disaster loans however the loan program was given mandatory cancellation provision this eliminated the localitys obligation to repay the loan under specified budgetary conditions sec 414a the 1974 amendments broadened the consideration of revenues to be replaced from property taxes to tax and other revenues the amount of and limit on the loan was linked not to lost revenues but to the size of the operating budget the budget could include additional disasterrelated expenses if they were of municipal operation nature specifically the 1974 act authorized the president to make loans to any local government which suffers substantial loss of tax and other revenues which the conferees intended to include utility revenues as result of major disaster and has demonstrated need for financial assistance in order to perform its governmental functions the legislative history of the act gives as examples of municipal services the protection of public health and safety and the operation of the public school system the amount of the loan is to be based on need but may not exceed 25 of the annual operating budget of the local government for the fiscal year in which the major disaster occurs repayment of all or any part of the loan is to be cancelled to the extent that revenues of the local government during the three full fiscal years following the major disaster are insufficient to meet the operating budget of the local government this budget may include additional disasterrelated expenses of municipal operation character the 1974 act also provided that any loans made under this section would not reduce or otherwise affect any grants or other assistance under the stafford act the enacted provisions regarding cdls originated in s 3062 the disaster relief act amendments of 1974 as approved by the senate there was counterpart in the house amendment to s 3062 the conference substitute amendment made the cancellation of community disaster loans mandatory under the specified conditions the senatepassed bill had authorized the president to cancel all or part of the cdls under the specified conditions61 the senate report to accompany s 3062 stated that the loan or any cancelled portion could not be used as the nonfederal share of any federal program including those programs under the act62 60 the 1974 act was

disaster mitigation act of 2000 pl 106390 placed limit of 5 million on the size of the loan that could be made to local government this dollar limit was in addition to the limit of 25 of the operating budget the 2000 amendments also provided that local government cannot receive additional assistance under sec 417 if it is in arrears on payments for previous loan63 in placing these limits congress was reportedly reacting to two very large loans that had been made to the virgin islands in the aftermath of hurricane hugo in 1989 and hurricane marilyn in 1995 for which repayment was cancelled see
