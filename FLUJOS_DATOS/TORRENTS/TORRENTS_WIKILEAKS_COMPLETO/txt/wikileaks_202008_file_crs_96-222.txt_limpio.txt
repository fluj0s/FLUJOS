democracy ned private nonprofit organization established during the reagan administration provides grants to private organizations to promote democracy in more than 90 countries around the world throughout its 16 year history neds budget has ranged from low of 15 million in fy1987 and fy1989 to high of 35 million in fy1994 during the 1990s ned has come under attack from few members of congress for several reasons its cost its distribution of noncompetitive grants to four core political business and labor grantees its reliance on government rather than private funding and its possible duplication with other us government programs the presidents fy2000 request for ned is 32 million the house version of the commerce justice state cjs appropriations bill hr 2670 recommends 31 million for neds fy2000 budget the senate appropriation committee recommended government funding for ned in its version of the cjs fy2000 appropriation bill s 1217 senate floor action on this issue later restored ned funding to 30 million by reducing that amount from the state department technology account opponents are likely to continue to raise debate on federal versus private funding for ned this report will be updated as legislation occurs background in the late 1970s west european governments had begun to offer assistance to foreign fraternal political and social institutions to bring about peaceful and democratic progress at the same time number of executive officials in the reagan administration members of congress from both parties and private citizens began to explore the idea that the united states should do more to promote democracy abroad and in particular to assist private groups for this purpose in march 1983 the reagan administration requested 65 million for program project democracy which would have sought matching public and private funds to support democratic institutions abroad congress did congressional research service the library of congress crs2 not pass this legislation but it did pass other legislation which included the national endowment for democracy acttitle v of the state department authorization act fy1984 and fy1985 pl 98164 signed nov 22 1983 unlike the project democracy proposal ned legislation did not require matching public and private funds the national endowment for democracy act recognized the existence of the national endowment for democracy ned as private nonprofit corporation whose purpose was to encourage the development and expansion of free and democratic institutions in other countries through private sector initiatives especially through the two major american political parties labor and business groups ned does not conduct democracy promotion programs itself but provides grants to four core groups and other private organizations for wide range of nedapproved activities in many different countries the four core groups receiving grants are the american center for international labor solidarity affiliated with the aflcio acils the center for international private enterprise affiliated with the us chamber of commerce cipe the international republican institute iri and the national democratic institute of international affairs ndi all of the institutes were established in 1983 in connection with the founding of ned except the american council for international labor solidarity an organization created in 1997 from merger of the free trade union institute and three other aflcio regional labor institutes small direct grants are also made to democratic activist groups in africa asia the middle east eastern europe the former soviet union and latin america the endowment made 265 grants to these groups in 1998 an additional 120 grants were made by the four core groups all ned grants are reviewed and approved or rejected on caseby casebasis by the ned board nedfunded projects are varied but often have one unifying characteristic their ability to function and implement democracy programs because they are not part of the us government for example ned has supported numerous democracy and human rights initiatives in china cuba burma iraq north korea and sudancountries where the us government is banned by law from providing direct foreign aid the recent conflict in the balkans demonstrates various types of nedsupported activities in fy1998 ned funded independent news organizations in serbia such as the association for independent electronic media and beta which provide alternative sources of news from that of the government controlled media in the states of the former republic of yugoslavia the ned has funded human rights monitoring groups policy forums and centers that promote the development of civil society the independent daily koha ditore in prishtina which has been publishing in macedonia since the serbian invasion of kosovo is also ned grant recipient since the serbian withdrawal it has distributed 3000 newspapers day in the kosovo capital1 ned is located in washington dc ned staff size which is not limited by law or regulation has grown from 19 in 1986 to 56 in 1999 additional accounting and auditing staff were added following 1991 gao audit which expressed the need to increase monitoring of grantees neds board of directors has ranged between 13 and 25 1 conversation with paul mccarthy ned program officer for central and eastern europe june 17 1999 crs3 members with 19 directors in fy1999 officers of the board are elected annually and they in turn elect the president carl gershman has been president since neds inception and former representative john brademas is chairman of the board of directors funding history and resource allocations although the national endowment for democracy act specifies that ned should operate as private organization it calls for usia to make an annual grant to the endowment from funds specifically appropriated for that purpose or from usias own salaries and expenses account

is an ongoing threat lawmakers also continue to debate the size scope and distribution of us democracy promotion efforts some foreign policy experts argue that encouraging development of democracies overseas is crucial to americas own national and economic security and that while supporting political transition is not costless it is far cheaper and safer than crisis response those who would like to reduce the amount of government expenditures on democracy promotion activities contend that success is difficult if not impossible to assess because of these differences coupled with the offset requirement for funding new or expanded programs the house zeroed out neds budget during the fy1994 funding debate but the senate and conferees subsequently restored it in 1995 ned opponents in the senate sought to drastically cut or totally eliminate ned funding for fy1996 the senate appropriations committee recommended the elimination of funding in fy1998 and fy2000 but the full senate subsequently restored funding in both years the following issues continue to frame the debate over ned funding core granteescompetitive bidding many critics of ned have expressed concern that four grantees receive the bulk of government funds on noncompetitive basis according to senator gregg the bottom line is this is relic of the cold war in time when we have very limited resources it is very hard to justify funding the democratic national committee the republican national committee aflcio and the chamber of commerce all of whom have significantly more resources available to put into this than we have3 proponents of funding the core grantees contend that political parties business and labor are at the heart of pluralistic democratic society they argue that the four organizations experiences and expertise make them particularly wellequipped to assist emerging democracies in transition from oneparty regimes to multiparty governments 3 congressional record july 22 1999 p s9004 crs5 ned responds to these charges by stating that grant proposals are strictly reviewed by financial staff and the bipartisan board of directors on projectbyproject basis furthermore the core grantees are covered by stringent reporting and evaluation requirements ned maintains that coordination with the department of state and possible audits by the general accounting office gao keep the grantees efficient honest and in line with us foreign policy objectives in june 1999 senator feingold introduced an amendment to the foreign relations authorization bill s 886 to gradually reduce to zero by fy2004 the percentage of funds set aside for the four core groups at that time all grants are to be awarded competitively senator feingold decried the annual bonanza received by the four groups and asserted that these four grantees know the fix is in so there is less incentive to make sure every single program is as efficient and as well planned as it possibly can be4 senator lugar and others opposed the feingold amendment by defending the funding levels as checks and balances that insure that ned is not politicized5 the amendment was defeated by vote of 76 to 236 government versus private funding of ned policymakers who oppose government grants to ned have claimed that when the organization first was established the intention was that ned eventually would rely on private funding some members of congress have asked if ned gets its funds from the us government is monitored by government auditors and must coordinate its activities with the state department then in what way is it private conversely they wonder if ned is considered private entity shouldnt most of its funding be private although ned was originally established as private entity private funding was not required neither the congressional debate in 1983 nor the national endowment for democracy act requires private source funding the foreign relations act fy1992 and fy1993 pl 102138 did include sense of congress provision that the national endowment for democracy should make every effort to solicit private contributions to realize the purposes of the endowment as set forth in the national endowment for democracy act also many ned grantees including the core grantees typically use ned grants to leverage private contributions ned argues that private statusgovernment funding is key to its effectiveness as nongovernmental organization ngo ned can work in areas of democratic development that are too risky for the us government in countries where the united states does not have an official assistance program or with local ngos where us government agency does not want overt ties such as in cuba and china variety of factors restrict direct government support in such circumstances including foreign policy considerations statutory prohibitions and the unwillingness of given foreign leader to allow assistance furthermore the credibility of democracy promotion projects in the recipient countries often is greater if private rather than government organizations conduct them 4 congressional record vol 145 88 june 21 1999 p s7316 5 id p s7317 6 id p s7410 crs6 duplication number of government and private entities in addition to ned carry out democracy promotion activities government organizations include usia usaid and the departments of state justice and defense private organizations promoting democracy include the asia foundation the international foundation for electoral systems ifes the soros foundation and the ford foundation in addition foreign governments such as canada germany and the united kingdom fund democracy institutes in fy1997 the most recent year for available numbers usaid funds for democracy promotion amounted to 402 million7 and usia democracy promotion funds equaled 3505 million other democracy programs are funded through the department of defenses international military education and training program imet and the military to military contacts program mmct the department of states democracy promotion activities are primarily through the economic support fund esf program jointly managed with usaid critics argue that with the myriad governmental private and overseas democracy programs in place ned is redundant supporters of ned however stress neds strength is its independence from government agencies senator kyl emphasized this point during senate floor debate if ned were to be too closely associated with the department of state ned might be seen as merely mouthpiece for whatever administration currently occupies the white house8 future prospects although efforts have been made in every congress to eliminate funding for ned the program has survived and its funding level has stabilized proponents in congress continue to stress its useful role as conduit for nongovernmental aid and its ability to respond quickly to changing democracy assistance challenges many believe that the prospects for continued funding of ned are good but issues related to the size and division of grants between the four institutes and outside organizations chosen by ned will continue to attract congressional interest in addition neds independence from the state department will be closely watched as the upcoming reorganization that abolishes the united states information agency is implemented 7 us aid
