commission recommendations the senate confirmation process for presidential nominees summary on july 22 2004 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states known as the 911 commission issued its final report detailing the events up to and including the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks upon the united states the report contained 41 recommendations on ways to prevent future catastrophic assaults including series of proposals designed to improve the presidential appointments process as it relates to the top national security officials at the beginning of new administration on october 6 the senate passed legislation s 2845 to implement many of the changes recommended by the 911 commission the house on october 8 passed its version of the legislation hr 10 the president signed the final version of the bill on december 17 2004 pl 108458 two other measures dealing with the 911 commissions recommendations s 2774 and hr 5040 were introduced in early september the 911 commission recommended that the senate adopt rules requiring hearings and votes to confirm or reject national security nominees within 30 days of their submission at the start of each new presidential administration implicit in the proposal is the assumption that there is problem with the process for nominating and confirming presidential appointees analysis of senate consideration of the initial nominations by presidents william j clinton and george w bush to the posts covered by the recommendation shows that the commissions proposed timetable was not met in 14 of the 49 cases suggesting this is an issue in minority of cases the constitution gives the senate role in the presidential appointments process but the parameters of that role have never been clearly defined the current process is regulated by mixture of formal rules and informal customs as well as by political interactions between the president and senators implementing the commissions proposal would presumably require instituting procedures that guarantee committee consideration of each nomination at least at hearing and final vote on each by the full senate changes of this kind would involve new restrictions on both the power of committee chairs to control the agenda of their committees and the rights of senators to delay or block nominations through holds and extended debate these changes would likely also alter the relationship between the legislative and executive branches weakening the negotiating posture of the senate in relation to the president particularly if they were to be extended to additional nominations procedures adequate to implement the commissions recommendation would resemble an expedited procedure such as those used in resolutions of approval and disapproval of executive actions procedural changes of this kind could be achieved by amending the standing rules of the senate changing the standing orders of the senate passing constitutional

nominees on july 22 2004 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as the 911 commission issued its final report detailing the events up to and including the september 11 2001 attacks on the united states the commission made 41 recommendations to congress and the president on ways to prevent future catastrophic assaults as part of its recommendations concerning unity of effort in the congress the 911 commission included series of proposals designed to improve the presidential appointments process as it relates to the top national security officials during presidential transitions recommendation since catastrophic attack could occur with little or notice we should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the process for national security appointments we think the process could be improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new officials to assume their new responsibilities as quickly as possible1 in the specific steps needed to implement this recommendation the 911 commission mentions the senate confirmation process in single sentence the senate in return should adopt special rules requiring hearings and votes to confirm or reject national security nominees within 30 days of their submission2 this short proposal appears to require major changes in the way the senate conducts its part of the process the 911 commissions report did not say how to implement or enforce their recommendation this report addresses these questions and also discusses the rationale for and implementation of the recommendation 1 the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states the 911 commission report final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states washington gpo 2004 p 422 hereafter cited as the 911 commission report 2 the 911 commission report p 422 crs2 the 911 commissions proposal on november 27 2002 congress created commission charged with investigating the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the united states also known as the 911 commission was to make full and complete accounting of the circumstances surrounding the attacks and the extent of the united states preparedness for and immediate response to the attacks andinvestigate and report to the president and congress on its findings conclusions and recommendations for corrective measures that can be taken to prevent acts of terrorism3 the panels july 22 report was the culmination of series of hearings and investigations by the panel and its staff into the terrorist attacks the report included wideranging series of proposals to change intelligence agencies of the executive branch and some committee structures within the legislative branch the 911 commissions recommendations on the appointment process are designed to make it quicker and more predictable for relatively small group of nominees the proposal is relatively sparse on details and implementing it would require the senate to flesh out the plan substantially however it is clear that the recommended changes in the senates confirmation process would provide certain upordown vote by the full chamber on all national security team nominees within definitive time frame 30 days after nomination is made at the start of an administration congressional response on october 6 the senate passed by vote of 962 legislation s 2845 introduced by senate governmental affairs committee chair susan collins and ranking member joseph i lieberman that would implement many of the 911 commissions recommendations as introduced the bill did not address the 911 commissions proposal to institute timeframe for senate consideration of national security nominees at the start of new presidential administration during consideration of the measure senators adopted by voice vote an amendment that added sense of the senate language to the bill it states that the senate committees to which these nominations are referred should to the fullest extent possible complete their consideration of these nominations and if such nominations are reported by the committees the full senate should vote to confirm or reject these nominations within 30 days of their submission this is essentially an affirmation of the current confirmation process the housepassed version of the bill contains different approach the bill an amendment to s 2845 formerly hr 10 which passed by vote of 282134 would require that the office of personnel management create list of all national security positions which require senate confirmation 3 pl 107306 116 stat 2383 crs3 the house provision would not change the current system for the top level of national security appointees such as the secretary of defense who are level i employees on the executive schedule the president would chose his nominee and submit their name to the senate for its advice and consent the nominee would not be confirmed in the position without senate action for executive schedule level ii employees such as the deputy attorney general and executive level iii employees such as an under secretary of state however the house provision would require that the senate act within 30 days of receiving nomination or the nomination would go into effect without action by the senate finally for level iv and level v national security employees who currently require senate confirmation the house provision would remove that requirement and make them appointed at the discretion of the president the housepassed bill does not contain any details about how the senate would implement the change for level ii and level iii employees concerning the 30day deadline but it is reasonable to assume that the analysis of the 911 commissions recommended 30day deadline would be applicable see section implementation of the 911 commissions recommendation on november 20 house and senate conferees on the 911 legislation reported out compromise measure it includes the senatepassed sense of the senate provision on presidential nominations not the housepassed language lastminute objections prevented either chamber from voting on the compromise measure at that time but congress returned in early december to consider the bill4 the house passed the bill by vote of 33675 on december 7 2004 and the senate followed suit the next day passing the bill by vote of 892 president george w bush signed the bill into law on december 17 2004 pl 108458 scope of the issue the national security team as defined by the 911 commission would include roughly 31 positions from the defense department the homeland security department the justice department the state department and the central intelligence agency the group extends from the heads of the departments down through and including the under secretary positions5 in testimony before the senate governmental affairs committee on july 30 commission chair thomas kean told members that the senate should treat these nominations unlike other nominations in that they recognize the speed with which we need those people in place6 the report of the 911 commission also pointed out that the time for transition between the clinton administration and the bush 4 walter pincus passage of intelligence bill called doubtful lawmakers say bush cheney need to lobby washington post nov 22 2004 p a3 5 jonathan stull communications assistant 911 commission telephone conversation with the author aug 9 2004 6 transcript of committee hearing on lexisnexis accessed on aug 20 2004 p 45 crs4 administration was shortened the dispute over the election and the 36day delay cut in half the normal transition period given that presidential election in the united states brings wholesale change in personnel this loss of time hampered the new administration in identifying recruiting clearing and obtaining senate confirmation of key appointees7 the commissions recommendations built on the work of series of commissions and scholars who have investigated the appointment process generally over the last 20 years virtually all of the studies reached similar conclusion that it takes too long to get presidential nominations through the appointment process the presidential appointment initiative for example project of the brookings institution found in 2001 that there is ample evidence that the process for both nominating and confirming talented citizens to presidential service is failing at its most basic tasks8 that followed similar study in 1996 called the 20th century task force on the presidential appointment process which called for prohibiting senators from delaying consideration of nominee by using extended debate called filibuster9 that the nomination and confirmation process is broken is truism now widely accepted by both republicans and democrats wrote congressional scholars norman ornstein and thomas donilon in 2001 the lag in getting people into office seriously impedes good governance new presidents first year clearly the most important year for accomplishments and the most vulnerable to mistakes is now routinely impaired by the lack of supporting staff for executive agencies leaderless periods mean decisions not made initiatives not launched and accountability not upheld10 recent experience one of the complaints about the nominations process from scholars and commissions has been that nominations can get bogged down in the senate confirmation process sometimes falling victim to parliamentary devices that can prevent final vote on the nomination from taking place an analysis of data on how the clinton administration and the current bush administration were able to fill those offices considered to make up the national security team at the beginning of their administrations shows that senate delay does not tend to be major problem for this subset of nominees the senate did not reject any of the national security team nominations in either administration11

norman ornstein and thomas donilon the confirmation clog foreign affairs vol 79 6 novdec 2000 p 89 11 that is not to say that the senate never rejects nominee during the george hw bush continued crs5 the amount of time it took nominations to work their way through the senate varied widely in this small sample from one day for secretaries of state and defense in both administrations to 128 days for the defense departments under secretary for policy in the clinton administration for both administrations the secretary of defense and the secretary of state were confirmed on inauguration day as table 1 shows of the 31 positions in the bush administration that would be included in the new deadline 22 were confirmed ahead of the 30day schedule four were holdovers from the clinton administration and did not require reconfirmation and five nominations took longer than 30 days to win senate confirmation the median elapsed days from submission of the nomination until senate confirmation was 21 days as table 1 also shows for all national security team nominees the process of nomination by the president took longer than the process of confirmation by the senate in some instances the delay between the start of the vacancy to the choice of presidential nomination was two to three times longer than the time from nomination to confirmation of the five nominations that exceeded 30 days for senate confirmation in the bush administration all were confirmed within 73 days four of the five were confirmed in less than 60 days in all five instances the delay between the start of the vacancy and the choice of nominee was longer than the time between the nomination and confirmation of the nominee as table 2 shows the four holdovers from the clinton administration had longer confirmation time during their original consideration by the senate the mean time for those nominations was 75 days as table 3 shows the clinton administrations national security team members were also confirmed largely ahead of the 30day deadline for the 23 positions covered by the definition12 seven were considered by the senate for more than 30 days one was holdover from the previous administration and did not require reconfirmation one of those was confirmed at 36 days another at 44 days the next after 47 days and another at 51 days the remaining two nominees had lengthy confirmations one was 122 days and the final one was 128 days table 3 also shows however that as with the bush administration the delays by the clinton administration in making its appointments were generally longer than 11 continued administration the senate rejected the nomination of former senator john r tower to be secretary of defense by vote of 4753 on mar 10 1989 also president clinton withdrew the nomination of anthony lake to be director of central intelligence on apr 18 1997 after three days of contentious confirmation hearings by the senate select committee on intelligence 12 the number of positions for the clinton administration is smaller than those for the bush administration because the department of homeland security did not exist and the position of under secretary of defense for intelligence had not been created crs6 the senate confirmation process typically the time to presidential nomination was significantly longer than the senate confirmation sometimes several times as long as this information shows the 911 commissions proposal for an accelerated senate confirmation process would not have affected 35 of the 49 national security team nominations that were in office before the 30day deadline review of the data on the speed with which new administrations have been able to get their national security team members in place suggests this is an issue in minority of cases advice and consent the recommendation of the 911 commission would deal with only small subset of the presidential nominations considered by the senate with respect to the offices included in the national security team however it would place substantial new conditions on how the senate carries out its role in confirming presidential nominees while the constitution includes the senate in the confirmation process it does not spell out how the chamber should fulfill its role of providing advice and consent to nomination the extent of legislative and executive control of the process has in many respects remained undetermined in response to this constitutional indeterminancy some have asserted that the senate should have coequal role with the president in the process the senates responsibility for confirming presidential nominees although fixed firmly in the constitution remains unsettled in its application the senate was not meant to be passive participant delegates to the philadelphia convention believed that the senate would be knowledgeable about nominees and capable of voting wisely yet for the most part it has acted cautiously uncertain of the scope of its own constitutional power the source of this uncertainty is not the constitution nowhere in that document or in its history is there an obligation on the part of the senate to approve nomination on the contrary the burden should be on the president to select and submit nominee with acceptable credentials13 others have said the senate should play lesser role allowing the president greater leeway in his choices for office than is currently the case law professor john c eastman told the senate rules committee on june 5 2003 that the appointment power is located in article ii of the constitution which defines the powers of the president not in article i which defines the powers of the legislature as the supreme court itself has noted by vesting appointment power in article ii the framers of our constitution intended to place primary 13 louis fisher constitutional conflicts between congress and the president lawrence kansas university press of kansas 1997 p 38 crs7 responsibility for appointments in the president the advice and consent role for the senate then was to be narrowly construed14 the practice of the senate however has not systematically reflected either of these perspectives historically much of the regular order of business on the nomination and confirmation of presidential appointments has been regulated not by strict formal rules but rather by informal customs that can change and have changed over the years as the relative balance of power between the president and the senate ebbs and flows it is these traditions which form the process according to appointments expert michael j gerhardt these informal arrangements those not clearly required or clearly prohibited by the constitution have come to define the dynamic in the federal appointments process the informal arrangements through which the system operates including senatorial courtesy logrolling individual holds blue slips consultation between presidents members of congress and other interested parties including judges interest group lobbying strategic leaking by administrations senators and interest groups manipulation of the press the medias effort to influence the news and nominees campaigning are the sum and substance of the federal appointments process studying these arrangements provide even greater illumination than studying supreme court decisions or the constitution itself of how the different branches of the federal government interact on matters of mutual concern15 under these informal customs individual senators have historically been deeply involved in the nomination and confirmation process the procedures and traditions that have developed have tended to protect the autonomy of individual senators to choose how to fulfill the advice and consent role rather than to dictate the process for all senators16 it is this combination unwritten senate traditions and the protection of each senators rights that has led critics of the process to call for changes similar to those proposed by the 911 commission the senates confirmation process is entirely consistent with all of its other norms traditions and rules concern for the rights and prerogatives of individual senators gives rise to numerous opportunities for obstruction and delay argued political scientists nolan mccarty and rose razaghian17 14 testimony of professor eastman in

security team the recommendations made by the 911 commission would require some major changes in the way the senate typically conducts its business in exchange for relatively quick and predictable process senators as group and as individuals would relinquish some of their current rights under the senates rules and practices under current practice once the president has chosen an individual for position the nomination is submitted to the senate and referred to the committee with jurisdiction over the agency or office which the nominee would fill the committee may or may not act on the nomination if the committee approves the nomination it goes before the full senate which may or may not take up the nomination on the floor if the senate does proceed to consider the nomination it may or may not proceed to final vote final vote of the full senate is required for nomination to be confirmed the president gives to the confirmed nominee commission with the seal of the united states and the individual is sworn into office18 nominations are part of the executive business of the senate the other component being ratification of treaties these are matters that come directly from the president and require the senates approval to implement the senate treats these items as separate from its legislative business they are placed on different calendar the executive calendar and the senate must be in executive session to consider them the official record of senate action on treaties and nominations is known as the executive journal while the record of senate action on legislation and other matters is called the senate journal in practice the chair of the committee of jurisdiction generally has the discretion whether to move the nominee through his or her committee or not the action can take the form of hearing at which the nominee testifies or markup of the committee to formally approve the nomination and send it on to the full chamber or both if the committee reports nomination the majority leader may ask unanimous consent or move that the senate enter executive session to take it up he is not required to take either action in principle any senator may move to take up nomination but in practice the senate treats this action as the prerogative of the majority leader if the senate agrees to take up the nomination it may proceed to final vote but again it is not required to do so while nomination is pending before the senate any senator or group of senators may act to delay or defeat the nomination by extended debate called filibuster the senate custom of holds which can allow senator or group of senators to delay consideration of measure or matter has also been used to prevent full senate consideration of nominations 18 for more on the role of the executive branch during the appointment process see crs report rl31346 presidential appointments to fulltime positions in executive departments during the 107th congress 20012002 by henry b hogue crs9 while the vast majority of presidential nominees receive senate action not all do senate rules do not require that nominee receive consideration there is nothing inherent in the appointments process that forces action as there is for example in the budget process if the congress fails to act on the budget the unpleasant prospect of government shutdown looms this usually inspires action even if it is not always completed by the first day of the new fiscal year an appointment carries similar sense of urgency noted political scientist g calvin mackenzie19 in the case of nominees by contrast if the senate does act there is established time frame for that action the mere fact that the president submits name for consideration does not obligate the senate to act promptly wrote separationofpowers scholar fisher20 implementation of the 911 commissions recommendation committee proceedings the 911 commissions proposal and most likely the housepassed provision to s 2845 would presumably require that senate committee chairs schedule confirmation hearings on the proposed members of the national security team if hearings were not held on the nominee in timely fashion or the nomination not reported out after certain number of days the nomination would presumably be discharged either automatically or through motion to discharge as result of this change nomination could come before the full senate for consideration without having had hearing in the committee of jurisdiction while some argue that too many nominations are subject to senate confirmation hearings it is unlikely that senators would want to skip such step in the case of the secretary of state or secretary of defense this change would constitute major change in the established prerogative of committee chairs the power of committee chairs to control the agenda of their panels is longstanding several times in recent years committee chairs have refused to grant nominee hearing and effectively prevented the senate from being able to act on the nomination21 the senate can discharge committee from consideration of nomination and frequently does so by unanimous consent when the nominations concerned are noncontroversial when there is opposition however the process to 19 g calvin mackenzie the state of the presidential appointments process in his innocent until nominated the breakdown of

committee from further consideration of the nomination is difficult and subject to filibuster and has been used rarely responding to concerns that committee chairs were too powerful in their ability to block consideration of legislation the 1970 legislative reorganization act created new senate rule to allow majority of committee to call meeting without the approval of the chair 22 it is rarely used perhaps because of the inherent political consequences of challenging committee chairs authority because the chair retains control over the agenda for any new meeting scheduled or because the threat is sufficient to bring about action by the chair implementing the 911 commissions proposal would require guaranteeing action on nominee at the committee level it would accordingly weaken the power of the chair to use his or her position to block nomination floor consideration the deadline proposed by the 911 commission and the house also would seem to exclude the possibility of senators placing holds on these nominees to postpone their consideration for any length of time it would mean that votes on these specific nominations would have to be protected against being delayed by filibuster senators have several times refused to allow the senate to reach final vote on nomination thus permitting filibuster or extended debate to kill that nomination23 in other instances senator or group of senators has placed hold on nomination which can also effectively kill the nominees chance for confirmation the system of holds is not formal part of the senate rules rather it is practice honored by the senate leadership if senator or group of senators tell their leader they want to place hold on nomination or piece of legislation the leader may decide to honor that request and not schedule the nomination for floor consideration the leader also may decide to honor the hold for specific period of time or not at all the power of the hold lies in its implicit threat that if the item is scheduled for floor consideration the concerned senator and his or her allies might wage filibuster and try to prevent final up or down vote on the matter24 holds and filibusters are essentially two versions of the negative power of the senate and its members the ability to stop something from happening whether it be passage of piece of legislation ratification of treaty or confirmation of nomination the 911 commissions recommendation which calls for guaranteed up or down vote on all nominees in the national security team would require altering these traditions in order to ensure that nominees receive final vote it would be necessary to preclude the possibility of successful filibuster if the nomination had to be acted upon within 30 days the hold would lose its power as 22 senate rule xxvi 23 see crs report rl32878 cloture attempts on nominations by richard s beth and betsy palmer 24 see crs report 98712 holds in the senate by walter j oleszek crs11 well under those rules delay of day even week is unlikely to be detrimental to nominees ultimate confirmation many critics argue that senators should not be able to use these powers to block action on nominations that it distorts the confirmation process and prevents the full chamber from working its will holds mentioned nowhere in senate rules are antidemocratic and probably unconstitutional although not likely subject to judicial review since the courts tend to be deferential to political questionsyet the hold subjects nominations to single senators veto argue ornstein and donilon25 political scientist christopher j deering wrote that the practice of holds has been destructive to the confirmation process members of the senate of both parties have placed holds on particular individuals in some cases the nominee is the target in other cases merely pawn but in either case the use of the nominees as in effect hostages has undermined the integrity of the system the use of such holds is serious abuse of the current system26 as political scientist barbara sinclair has noted however holds are not meaningful unless they are backed up by the threat of filibuster therefore it is the senates tradition of unlimited debate on most subjects including nominations that is at the heart of this dispute sinclair observed as long as members are willing to back their holds with actual extended debate the leaders are faced with an impossible situation when floor time is short assuming that the bill is not must legislation calling it up is likely to consume scarce time unproductively time for which the leaders have multiple and clamorous requests27 supporters of the senates tradition of unlimited debate argue that it is necessary component of the chambers procedures advocates of restrictions on debate rest their case on the cliches of democracy and transform government by majority from an imperfect device into an eternal principle wrote senate historian lindsay rogers yet curiously enough freedom of debate although sanctioning minority control by avoirdupois rather than by argument has proved to be valuable safeguard against executive inefficiency and corruption he concludes28 senator jw fulbright in 1957 during senate debate on proposal to change its rules to make it easier to invoke cloture and end debate defended extended debate this way 25

and to subject approval of measures to delay in order that the people themselves may be able to understand controversial issues i hope senators will not take seriously the argument that democracy is in some way equivalent to majority rule because there is nothing whatsoever to such an argument there is nothing in our constitution which in any respect implies directly or indirectly that majority rule should be the rule of the senate29 others have argued that the full senate must be able to act on presidential nominees and not allow one or several senators to block confirmation vote political scientist brannon p denning put it this way the notion of advice and consent is mutable it has evolved from an alleged rubberstamp into right to inquire into the jurisprudential commitments of supreme court nominees to right to disapprove nominees because particular senator believes that they are not ambassadorial quality tools for facilitating consensus said to be the raison detre of most senate rules and procedures have in short order been fashioned into weapons of minority rule customs like the hold and the prerogative of committee chairs have lately been exercised not for the benefit of the senate as an institution or even for the benefit of particular party but for the benefit of individual senators30 implementation requirements rules implementing the requirements outlined above would have the main features of an expedited procedure expedited procedures are tools used by the house and senate that can override the normal parliamentary procedure to ensure relatively quick action on particular measure or matter examples of expedited procedures also known as fast track provisions include the defense base closure and realignment act of 1990 and the trade act of 1974 the process by which congress considers most trade agreements31 given its call for deadlinemandated up or down vote on each nominee in the national security team the most likely way to implement the 911 commissions recommendation or the housepassed provision of s 2845 would be for the senate to create new expedited procedure that would apply to this specific set of nominations expedited procedures have not previously been used in the senate to consider executive business so enactment of the 911 commissions recommendations would be precedentsetting that would not necessarily however be barrier to using expedited procedures for executive business 29 remarks of senator jwfulbright us senate congressional record vol 103 jan 4 1957 p 208 30 brannon p denning reforming the new confirmation process replacing despise and resent with advice and consent administrative law review vol 53 1 p 27 31 see crs report 98888 fasttrack or expedited procedures their purposes elements and implications by christopher m davis crs13 necessary elements an expedited procedure reflecting the 911 commissions recommendation and the house provision would need to include time limit for action by the committees on nominations referred to them this provision might require that the committee hold hearing on the nomination and report it to the full chamber by set time after receiving it such as 20 days32 an effective expedited procedure would need to include an enforcement mechanism at this stage so that if the committee did not act either the nomination would automatically be discharged from committee and placed on the executive calendar making it available for consideration by the full chamber or motion to do so would be in order an effective expedited procedure also would need to provide some controls regarding senate floor action currently under senate precedents member may move to go into executive session to take up particular nomination without that motion being subject to debate and thus filibuster the nomination itself however is subject to debate and therefore to filibuster the expedited procedure would need to foreclose the possibility of filibustering nomination probably by placing limit on the total amount of time the senate could spend debating the nomination of member of the national security team how much debate time would be required could be tricky question to decide the senate spent floor time debating the two nominations for under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs it has approved during the bush administration that position is included in the 911 commissions definition of the national security team the senate might however want to be sure it includes sufficient debate time to consider other members of the national security team such as secretary of defense secretary of state or attorney general in general the senate does not tend to include in its expedited procedures provision automatically calling measure to the floor33 usually the expedited procedure would make it in order for the majority leader or another member to bring the matter up if desired the expedited provision for national security team nominations could include such provision requiring that within several days after the end of committee consideration the senate take it up this provision would need to specify when in the senates normal course of daily operations the nomination would come up because this procedure would be designed to apply to nominations it also would need to provide for motion that the senate go into executive session or that the senate be considered to have gone into executive session at specified time finally to implement the 911 commissions recommendation fully the expedited procedure would need to require an up or down vote at the end of the debate for each nominee included in the national security team 32 those crafting the expedited procedure also would need to decide whether they wanted to measure the time in calendar days or only those days in which the senate was in session 33 crs report 98888 fasttrack or expedited procedures their purposes elements and implications by christopher m davis crs14 in spite of all the requirements of an expedited procedure it is possible that the senate as body might refuse to act on particular nomination the majority leader might simply decline to call it up it is not apparent how any form of procedure could provide effective recourse in this situation expedited procedures in existing statutes often provide that if congress does not act on presidential proposal within specified time the proposal goes into effect permitting nomination to be treated as confirmed without affirmative action by the senate however would not likely be acceptable to the senate and the validity of such an outcome might well be questioned on constitutional grounds means of implementation the senate could institute procedures to implement the 911 commissions proposal or the house provision in several ways by enacting an expedited procedures law by amending the senates standing rules or its standing orders through adoption of unanimous consent agreement or by passage of constitutional amendment expedited procedures statute language to create an expedited procedure for the national security team could be included in larger bill to implement other elements of the 911 commission recommendations such as the creation of director of national intelligence if the expedited procedures legislation were subject to filibuster 60 votes would be required to invoke cloture34 legislation including an expedited procedure however could be enacted into law only through the constitutional lawmaking process requiring action by the house of representatives and the president as well as by the senate this method of implementation raises the question whether the senate would be willing to involve the house and the president in making changes to the confirmation process matter which is bound up in with its own rules and special constitutional prerogatives amending senate rules similar changes also could be implemented by amending the senate rules this approach would have the advantage to the senate of not having to go through the house or be signed by the president rather the changes would take effect as soon as the senate adopted them the difficulty with this approach is that if the changes to the rules were opposed by filibuster it would take twothirds vote of those present as many as 67 senators to invoke cloture and cut off debate which is very high threshold to meet constitutional amendment the senate also could try to amend the constitution to redefine the confirmation process along the lines of the 911 commissions recommendations this approach might be considered less promising because constitutional amendments must be passed by twothirds of those voting or as many as 67 votes in addition once in place such change would be extraordinarily difficult to reverse or modify 34 the only item which requires higher threshold for invoking cloture is change to the senates rules any change to the senates rules which is filibustered requires the votes of twothirds of those present and voting 67 if all senators vote to invoke cloture when the senate lowered the cloture threshold from twothirds voting to 60 it did not lower it for changes to the rules crs15 unanimous consent the senate also could try to amend its rules to conform to the 911 commissions recommendations by unanimous consent agreement for this approach to succeed all senators would have to agree on plan to implement the new confirmation procedure one objection would prevent the agreement from going into effect unanimous consent agreements have been used to structure debate on specific nominations this agreement however would be binding into future congresses unless it specified otherwise or was modified by another unanimous consent agreement standing order finally the senate could try to amend its rules through adoption of standing order which would take the form of simple resolution such standing order would have effects like those of rule but the resolution would require 60 votes for cloture if it was filibustered not twothirds of senators voting such standing order resolution was used for the creation of the permanent select committee on intelligence sres 400 94th congress implications for the confirmation process the balance of nomination politics one impact of the ability of senator to filibuster nominee has been that negotiations over other matters both with the executive branch and among fellow senators have been broadened to include all matter of senate business concept known as linkage for example senators objections to particular nominee might be disposed of by permitting that senator to offer an amendment to bill that is soon to be considered on the senate floor taking nominations out of this equation could shift the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches the appointments process is deeply contentious and as legislative policymaking has grown more difficult in recent decades the process has increasingly become venue for pitched battles over the shape of public policy wrote appointments expert mackenzie he continued more and more the contentiousness in the appointments process is driven not by questions of the fitness of nominees but by policy disagreements senators vote against nominees and nominations fail because the appointments process has become policy battleground this is not new phenomenon this use of the appointments process to wage policy battles in fact it has always been characteristic of the appointments process35 mackenzie noted that president andrew johnson fought with the senate over several of his nominees to head the national bank and of roger taney to be secretary of the treasury what is different now he said is the extent to which those connections are made 35 mackenzie the state of the presidential appointments process pp 2728 crs16 political scientists nolan mccarty and rose razaghian studied more than 100 years of senate action on nominations they said the thrust of our theory is that the supermajoritarianism of the senate in general and the confirmation process in particular gives partisan and ideological minorities strategic opportunity to have an impact on public policy by delaying nominations that would pass on simple majority vote36 for some the ability to engage in extended debate on and effectively block measures or matters is what empowers the senate to deal on equal footing with the president in their fights over both nominations and legislation political scientist rogers argued that for the fact of the matter is as i hope to show that as the much vaunted separation of powers now exists unrestricted debate in the senate is the only check upon presidential and party autocracy the devices that the framers of the constitution so meticulously set up would be ineffective without the safeguard of senatorial minority action37 some also believe that the senates opportunity to play vigorous role in the nomination and confirmation process is essential to the publics trust in the process nonetheless the process of vetting and voting on the presidents candidates for high position is an essential balance wheel in our complicated form of government it lends legitimacy to the whole structure and it is worth the occasional loss of good person wrote former judge and former member of congress abner mikva38 he continued neither branch always chooses good people as history shows and frequently the best people dont get appointed learned hand never made it to the supreme court nonetheless political involvement including confirmation by the very political senate offers reality check on who gets the power to make very important judicial decisions for life the case is little less compelling for appointments to the executive branch but it still can be made most of the federal work force come into their positions and are protected in them by civil service system based on meritocracy for those relatively few policy makers whose appointments require senate confirmation an extra look see is justified39 others believe that the delaying strategies being employed by some in the senate detract from that legitimacy40 and some contend that it is not right to use nominations as bargaining chips in legislative negotiations the senates constitutional and institutional role of advice and consent is being supplanted by informal extraconstitutional customs that allow 36 mccarty advice and consent senate responses to executive branch nominations 18851996

process p 26 crs17 individual senators to effectively veto the presidents nominees even if only to gain leverage with the executive branch on an unrelated matter wrote denning41 changing politics rather than rules any change to the confirmation process of the kind proposed by the 911 commission would almost certainly also influence the balance of power between the executive and the legislative branches the ability to block final vote on nomination has become critical element in the senates power relationship with the president both for its action or inaction on the nomination itself and frequently for senator or group of senators to gain leverage in negotiations on other matters vote deadline for example could still lead to defeat so requiring vote could lead to more presidential defeats or to pressure to go along with the president so as to not hand him defeat political scientist burdett loomis observed that trying to change the senates rules may not be an effective plan is there any indication that the senate might smooth the way for future nominees given the profound changes in the chamber over the past twentyfive years the greater latitude allowed individual members and the intense partisanship that dominates much decisionmaking it seems unlikely that reformers would profit much from attempting to reshape senate procedures42 instead he argued striving to govern together by bridging the separate institutions may be valuable than seeking to change an institution that has proved highly resistant to structural reforms43 if the history of the confirmation process is more about practices than rules perhaps it would be useful to consider informal changes in the dynamics that undergird the process instead of setting up timetables for action this approach would build upon view that the problem is not procedural but political political scientist christopher j deering wrote that politics has always been part of the process the relationship between the executive and legislative branches has been and remains essentially political that should not change the senates role in the review of executive personnel is but one example of that political relationship the senates role in the confirmation process was designed not to eliminate politics but to make possible the use of politics as safeguard from the outset the political motivations of the two branches were to be protection against tyranny44 41 denning reforming the new confirmation process replacing despise and resent with advice and consent p 41 42 burdett loomis the senate an obstacle course for executive appointments in innocent until nominated the breakdown of the presidential appointments process g calvin mackenzie ed washington brookings institution press 2001 p 170 43 loomis the senate an obstacle course for executive appointments p 171 44 deering damned if you do and damned if you dont pp 118119 crs18 the one enduring characteristic of the process is that it is as deeply and intensely political now as it has always been45 agreed mackenzie the process is political he asserted because its results can have major impact on policymaking and therefore politics conflict occurs in the appointment process for very simple reason appointments matter were that not the case presidential administrations would not have several dozen white house aides devoting full time to appointment decisions senate committees would not hold hundreds of hours of confirmation hearings interest groups agencies political parties and members of the house would not spend their time and resources trying to shape appointments decisions yet they do all these things and they do them because they think it makes difference who gets appointed to serve in particular federal offices46 as result when the process has worked it frequently was because the two branches of government found way to make it work the appointment power operates in framework of studied ambiguity its limits established for the most part not by court decisions but by imaginative accommodations between the executive and legislative branches wrote separationofpowers scholar fisher47 broader implications the 911 commissions proposal provides an occasion for the senate to evaluate the larger question of its confirmation process and its role in the presidential appointment process adoption of the recommendation for example could open the door to consideration of ever more nominations through expedited procedures what would new process mean for other presidential nominations particularly those to the judiciary for several years the senate has been debating the proper role of the president and senators in the nomination and confirmation of the nations federal judges during the clinton administration critics charged that the judiciary committee was not acting on all the nominations it needed to during the bush administration the controversy has been over the use of the filibuster to block final vote on judicial nominee48 before the 911 commission released its recommendations senator arlen specter had introduced resolution that would establish protocol for the confirmation of federal judges his plan sres 327 would establish timetables for action at both the committee and senate floor stages and it would effectively prohibit 45 mackenzie the state of the presidential

bill frist on june 26 2003 would set up diminishing threshold for invoking cloture on presidential nominations that are subject to senate approval the threshold necessary for invoking cloture would drop each time the senate voted on cloture motion on particular nominee until it reached 51 senators majority of the chamber given the interest already expressed some senators might want to expand the 911 commissions recommendations to include broader number of presidential nominees the 30day timetable would likely have to be adjusted to allow the senate to complete its work on larger number of nominations on the one hand this action could put in place definitive system for the consideration of presidential nominees it could bring order and predictability to the entire process on the other hand it might rush the process for some nominees and make it more difficult for senators to defeat nomination they oppose alternative approaches existing rules instead of or in addition to instituting new procedures to expedite action the senate might exercise more control over threatened filibusters against nominations by enforcing more stringently its existing rules under current procedures debate on nominations and treaties is in some respects easier to limit than on legislative matters first the motion to proceed to consider nomination may be offered in nondebatable form whereas the motion to proceed to consider legislation is usually debatable second the two speech rule of the senate limits each senator to two speeches per day on any given question with respect to legislative matters this rule is not viable deterrent to extended debate for each new amendment is viewed as new question on which each senator may speak two more times on unamendable matters such as nominations the two speech rule could more effectively be used as procedure to limit debate indirectly under current interpretations however the twospeech rule has proved to be an ineffective deterrent against extended debates on nominations because it has been interpreted to apply to the calendar day on each new calendar day every senator is able once again to make two speeches on the pending nominee as result since the late 1980s the senate has rarely sought to enforce this rule reinterpretation of the rule in its application to nominations could make it more effective given such an interpretation it would be easier for senate leaders to overcome filibusters against nominee by forcing opposing senators to speak at length in modern practice most filibusters feature delay by means other than debate quorum calls or agreements to turn to other items of business in effect the threat of filibuster is treated as though the senate is being prevented through extended debate 49 see crs report rs21506 implications for the senate of president bushs proposal on judicial nominations by betsy palmer crs20 from reaching final conclusion on the measure or matter at hand keeping the senate in continuous executive business session for consideration of nomination could make it more difficult for senators to sustain true filibuster and perhaps reduce the incidence of filibuster threats expiring nominations another approach might be to place time limit on presidential nomination while such requirement might seem counterintuitive it would prevent an endless delay in filling the position in question if the senate did not act on nomination after defined period of time say 60 days it would automatically be returned to the president while the president would have the ability to renominate the individual in question if he so chose he could also take the opportunity to reconsider his choice without the politically sensitive problem of asking nominee to step aside crs21 table 1
