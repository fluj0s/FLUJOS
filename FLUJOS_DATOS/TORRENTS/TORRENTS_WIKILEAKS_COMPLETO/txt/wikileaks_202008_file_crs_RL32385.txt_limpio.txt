learned from states may 17 2004 stephanie lewis consultant to crs institute for health care research and policy georgetown university jean hearne and hinda chaikind crs project coordinators domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress expanding health care coverage for the uninsured lessons learned from states summary state policymakers have been concerned about the uninsured for number of years and have pursued many strategies to help expand health care coverage to understand the strategies undertaken by states and their successes and failures crs contracted with the institute for health care research and policy at georgetown university to conduct 50 state survey the findings of that survey are presented here in 2002 all states subsidized comprehensive health care for at least some of their lowincome residents medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip programs which enable states to augment their resources with federal matching funds were the principal means of subsidizing health coverage in states in addition to medicaid and schip number of states used stateonly funding to subsidize health insurance or pay the cost of health care services for the uninsured or lowincome populations three states for instance had tax credits for small employers or individuals six states and the district of columbia had other statefunded programs to either subsidize health insurance or provide direct coverage for the uninsured twenty nine states had established highrisk pools for individuals rejected from traditional insurance for health reasons the variety of approaches used by the states that have engaged in these initiatives can yield some useful information for congress many have been in place for number of years so state program officials are knowledgeable about the strengths and weaknesses of the initiatives while many of the states efforts are small in scale they provide an opportunity to track their impact and any administrative challenges they pose caveat for the reader is that the changing fiscal conditions reflected in many states budgets in the years since 2002 may have changed the priorities of states and impacted the size or generosity of some of the programs that were in effect at the time of the survey understanding how states regulated insurance markets and improved the availability of insurance for the sickest and poorest before feeling the full impact of the recent recession remains valuable nonetheless by providing insight into the various choices that are available and their implications for federal initiatives at the same time we know that in few states dramatic changes in state health policies to increase coverage have occurred since 2002 this includes initiatives in maine and california as well as several other states that have established high risk pools using funds made available under the trade adjustment act of 2002 this report will

years and have pursued many strategies to help expand health insurance coverage in their states some of these initiatives have involved creating new or expanding existing stateoperated and statefunded programs other states have increased access to health insurance coverage through the regulation of the private health insurance market because the states serve as laboratories of innovation their activities may give federal policymakers examining this issue some insight into how different approaches to public program expansions and private insurance initiatives may or may not work this report explores range of state coverage initiatives by reviewing what states have done through public initiatives and private health insurance it is based on data from 50 state survey conducted in 2003 by the institute for health care research and policy at georgetown university under contract to crs more specifically it examines the states experience expanding health insurance to the uninsured through state tax credit programs statefunded public programs group health insurance rules with an emphasis on standards for small group health insurers statesponsored purchasing pools individual health insurance rules and highrisk pools this paper does not however discuss medicaid expansions in detail because of the considerable literature already available on that topic in addition related federal initiatives are reviewed briefly finally it doesnt describe in detail programs enacted or signed into law since 2002 this includes initiatives in maine and california as well as several other states that have established high risk pools using funds made available under the trade adjustment act of 2002 california passed legislation mandating that medium and large size employers offer health insurance coverage as benefit beginning in 2006 although the press reports that this bill may be repealed before implementation in addition maine has established universal health program called dirigo health small employers are scheduled to begin purchasing the statesponsored coverage beginning in the summer of 2004 the final major change since 2002 is that grant funds made available under the trade adjustment assistance act of 2002 has prompted several additional states to establish high risk pools crs2 the report concludes with discussion about what members of congress might be able to learn from the states experiences and the key challenges states face reducing the number of uninsured in their state the uninsured in 2002 about 436 million americans or about 152 of the us population were uninsured1 the percentage of uninsured individuals among states varies widely as illustrated in table 1 in 2002 79 of the residents in minnesota were uninsured in contrast to almost 211 of the

congressional research service and published in crs report 96979 health insurance uninsured by state 2002 by paulette morgan state coverage initiatives states have pursued different coverage initiatives to varying degrees to make health insurance more affordable andor accessible all states subsidize health insurance for at least some of their lowincome residents medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip programs which enable states to augment their resources with federal matching funds are the principal means of subsidizing health insurance in states as table 2 illustrates few states have used stateonly funding to go beyond medicaid and schip to establish initiatives that subsidize health insurance or provide coverage directly to the uninsured in 2002 three states for instance used tax credits for small employers or individuals and six states and the district of columbia had established stateonly funded programs to subsidize health insurance or provide direct coverage for the uninsured states have also tried to make health insurance more available to employers and individuals by setting rules for private health insurers these rules seek to stabilize coverage for those who have it such as when people change jobs or family circumstances change many states rules minimize the number of uninsured by removing barriers people face in obtaining and keeping health insurance and place limits on how much insurers can charge for insurance all states have comprehensive rules for insurers that sell health insurance to small firms with two to 50 employees called small group health insurers these rules are product of state efforts in the early 1990s and federal law the health insurance portability and crs4 accountability act hipaa of 1996 pl 104191 that made these state reform efforts more uniform to lesser degree states have used other strategies few states have tried to enhance the availability and accessibility of health insurance for small employers through purchasing pools for individuals without jobbased health insurance some states have pursued market reforms affecting individuals seeking to purchase coverage independently intended to make coverage more accessible and stable many more states have opted against individual market reforms instead pursuing another option highrisk pools for individuals whom insurers will not cover the following sections elaborate on this landscape of states efforts to expand coverage options for employers and individuals how they have done so and what has been learned from their

health coverage few states have established public programs outside of medicaid or schip with stateonly funds these programs usually provide insurance directly to program participants or provide enrollees with subsidies for workbased insurance fewer states yet have enacted tax credits toward the cost of privately sponsored insurance tax credits state experience with tax credit programs has been very limited in the late 1980s and early 1990s at least four states california kentucky massachusetts and oregon introduced tax credit programs for small employers3 each of these programs has been discontinued as noted in study of such state initiatives they appeared to have had very little impact on the number of small employers offering benefits to their employees the study authors noted that the small size of the credits may have provided an insufficient incentive to the relatively 3 debra j lipson daniel m campion and michael birnbaum approaches for providingfinancing health care

not already offering coverage4 in 2002 two states had tax credits for small employers kansas and maine5 as with the aforementioned programs both had strict eligibility criteria and low participation rates kansas program was implemented in december 1999 by the beginning of 2002 175 companies had applied for certification but the state received only 50 claims from employers for coverage maines program is newer it began in 2001 and smaller its benefits are limited to employers with fewer than five employees who offer dependent coverage as of 2002 14 small employers were participating colorado was the only state that had an individual health insurance tax credit in place in 2002 individuals who meet certain income eligibility limits can claim 500 credit for group or individual health insurance the program was implemented in 2000 and had 7544 participants for tax year 2000 at program cost of 27 million north carolina had an individual tax credit for child health insurance that was repealed in 2001 to devote greater resources to another public coverage program the later repealed tax credit was passed by the states legislature in 1998 and was provided to 125199 people in 2001 at program cost of 211 million interestingly this program was not limited to the lowincome households with adjusted gross income under 225 of the federal poverty level fpl just under 41000 for family of three in 2001 received 300 credit those with income over that amount and up to 100000 for family of three or about five times the 2001 fpl were eligible to receive 100 credit public programs public programs are another way to offer subsidized coverage to the uninsured6 tables 4 5 and 6 describe the various public programs in place by states in 2002 the number of states that have funded public coverage initiatives without federal support is small in 2002 six states arizona massachusetts minnesota new york pennsylvania and washington and the district of columbia had programs in place to reach the uninsured that were funded outside of medicaid and schip these programs differ dramatically both in terms of who is eligible and how coverage is provided reflecting number of factors including the availability of funding and the availability of safety net system in each state for example washingtons basic health plan was by far the largest program in terms of enrollment and financial support with 2002 monthly average of about 122250 enrollees and an appropriation of 499 million for fy20022003 it uses two strategies to reach lowincome residents with income below 200 of the federal poverty level for those without access to employersponsored coverage the state arranges for access to health services directly for those with access to employer sponsored coverage it

co nc and ut that have tax credit programs for business enterprise zones and emerging businesses they are extremely limited in scope and were not reviewed for this report 6 as previously noted because there are many other reports on state initiatives under medicaid and schip this report will largely focus on initiatives funded only by the states crs6 according to sliding scale arizonas premium sharing program on the other hand offered direct coverage only to uninsured residents with income below 275 of the federal poverty level or to people who have one of 19 chronic conditions whose incomes are below 400 of the federal poverty level the demonstration program now dismantled paid up to 97 of the premium based on sliding scale for coverage provided through contracts with three health insurers for enrollment that reached just over 3600 people in 2002 while these programs have helped expand coverage to people without affordable alternatives enrollment is limited relative to demand primarily because of funding constraints the massachusetts childrens medical security plan which began in 1994 had to close enrollment temporarily in its first year because of high demand at the end of june 2002 it had 25680 children enrolled who were not eligible for medicaidschip enrollment rises by almost 650 new people each month pennsylvania began its new direct coverage program in july 2002 using tobacco settlement dollars adultbasic which provides direct coverage through four blue cross and blue shield plans ended its first month with over 6000 enrollees by the next month enrollment had nearly doubled in 2002 the state estimated that it has enough funding for about 40000 enrollees taking into account the 30 per month contribution by each enrollee enrollment however reached this threshold quickly and the state was required to later institute waiting list7 new jersey had program for childless adults with incomes under 50 of the federal poverty level but

previous fiscal years appropriations obtaining the resources needed for these programs to reach large number of people presents significant challenges for states further in the recent budget environment states were concerned about their ability to maintain these programs at their existing levels prompting many to look for ways to maximize resources from the federal government minnesota for example developed broad stateonly funded program in the early 1990s with the exception of coverage for childless crs10 adults the cost of minnesotacare is now shared with the federal government not long before the completion of the survey two states oregon and illinois had received approval of medicaid research and federal demonstration waivers that will enable the states to augment state resources with medicaid funding for oregons family health insurance assistance program and illinois kidcare rebate program9 another way states leverage their resources is by encouraging employers to enroll in their programs since employersponsored group coverage tends to be more affordable than individual coverage and since most employers contribute to the cost of their workers health insurance states may reach more people with fewer state funds but as indicated by the enrollment in several state programs they have faced challenges in doing so group health insurance is major focus of programs in washington and new york these states programs serve both individuals and employer groups but the majority of their enrollment is from individuals the washington basic health plans average monthly enrollment of 122250 in fy2002 for instance includes 808 enrollees from 237 employer groups the remaining enrollees are individuals new york also experienced an unexpected surge in individual enrollment unlike number of the other public programs new yorks does not provide direct coverage or subsidies to program participants but provides stoploss coverage to insurers whose costs fall within specified range for individuals sole proprietors or small employers who purchase package of benefits under the healthy ny program in other words the state does not help pay for any specific individuals coverage but reimburses the health plan if the cost of health care for particular individual reaches certain amount in september 2002 this young program had about 13430 active enrollees of which 7400 were individuals 3430 were sole proprietors and 2600 were workers covered through 835 participating small employers10 consistent with the desire to build on jobbased health insurance some states have created or built into other existing programs ways to help subsidize health insurance offered by employers in 2002 seven states were planning to offer or are currently offering premium assistance through schip to enroll children in their parents jobbased health insurance11 medicaid also permits states to help pay the cost of employersponsored insurance available to those who are medicaideligible and their families when it is costeffective to do so through the health insurance premium payment program hipp 9 oregons family health insurance assistance program fhiap covered about 3300 people and had waiting list of approximately 27000 residents in june 2002 with the federal waiver it plans to ultimately cover between 20000 and 25000 people 10 for an analysis of new yorks

insurance family style public approaches to reaching the uninsured national health policy forum sept 24 2001 p5 crs11 group health insurance initiatives because most people twothirds of nonelderly americans get health insurance through their job and most of the nonelderly uninsured are employed group health insurance has been the cornerstone of many initiatives and proposals intended to expand coverage while these efforts principally seek to stabilize coverage they are also intended to reduce or prevent an increase in the number of uninsured by removing barriers to accessing health insurance and helping workers keep their health insurance12 federal and state portability statutes and other market reforms created for private group health insurance have removed many of the access barriers to health insurance for example insurers are prohibited from denying or canceling health insurance because an employee is in poor health and for most people there are limits on how long insurers can deny them coverage for pre existing conditions few states have gone step further and sponsored purchasing pools for small employers to buy health insurance small group health insurance prior to the early 1990s state regulators identified number of problems in the small group market for health insurance some insurers were rejecting small employers who had an employee with poor health status others would accept the group but refuse to cover any employees or dependents with history of illness in some cases insurers would refuse to renew health insurance or dramatically increase the price of health insurance for groups with high claims access rules beginning in the early 1990s the states moved to address these barriers to health insurance by setting rules for small group health insurers later in 1996 hipaa established national standards for private health insurance based in large part on these state efforts although almost all of the states had small group reforms by the time hipaa was enacted there was inconsistency in the degree of the protections among the states some states for example required insurers to make all of their products available to small employers but in many other states insurers were only required to make one or two products available these products tended to have many more sick people than healthy people and were usually very expensive hipaa provided greater uniformity and breadth to these protections it also expanded them to selffunded group health plans that state law does not reach and 12 within group health insurance there are large group and small group health plans large group health plans are those offered by employers with more than 50 employees small group health plans are those offered by employers with two to 50 employees in about 10 states the definition of small employer has been expanded to include groups of one that is selfemployed persons with other employees in 2002 in five states co ma vt wa groups of one had guaranteed access to all products offered by small group health insurer yearround but some states co fl md nh and nc had carved out an exception for groups of one on limited basis for instance they may have guaranteed access during one month out of the year or may be limited to standardized plans in az and nm groups of one have been guaranteed access to small group health insurance through statesponsored purchasing pools crs12 fullyinsured large group health plans which states had not previously regulated13 in other words it created federal floor of protections for all group health plans of all sizes across all of the states14 this federal floor prohibits all group health plans regardless of size and whether they are insured or selffunded from imposing preexisting condition exclusion periods for longer than 12 months 18 months for late enrollees requires insurers to credit certain prior coverage against any new preexisting condition exclusion period for certain individuals who change jobs requires insurers to give all small employers access to all of their small group products called guaranteed issue prohibits insurers from cancelling coverage because an employee gets sick or makes claims called guaranteed renewability prohibits all group health plans from denying or limiting an employees coverage or charging an employee more because of health status called nondiscrimination and requires group health plans to allow employees and their dependents to sign up for coverage at times other than the open enrollment period if certain changes in family status occur called special enrollment periods rating rules while hipaa helps make health insurance more accessible to all small employers without regard to their employees health status and stabilizes the market somewhat the federal law does not address what many employers see as the major barrier to coverage for small employers its cost15 most states have tried to 13 over 64 of the nonelderly us population obtains private health insurance through their employers only 6 buy it directly from insurers when employers provide the insurance they do so on either an insured or selffunded basis in other words they either buy the insurance from stateregulated insurer insured or they pay for the cost of their employees care out of their own general assets selffunded the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa federal law governs both insured and selffunded plans and does not allow states to regulate the employers health plan as result self funded plans are not affected by any of the state laws we discuss in this report states can and do however regulate insurers and thus indirectly affect insured health plans for primer on private health insurance

rules but the extent to which they have done so varies table 7 approaches to rating reform for small group health insurers pure community rating insurers cannot set premiums for policies sold to small group based on the health status or case characteristics demographics such as age gender or industry of the groups membership those buying the same benefits are charged the same premium adjusted community rating insurers cannot set premiums based on health status the state might allow insurers to vary premiums based on factors such as age gender or industry rate bands insurers can set premiums based on factors such as health status age gender or industry but the state limits how much the premium can vary among those receiving the same benefits based on some or all of these factors health status and claims experience are the primary factors influencing rates and the focus of most state rating rules most states place some limits on their use in setting premiums by group insurers but in 2002 only 13 states prohibited their use altogether as rating factors for small group health insurance the most stringent form of rating restriction pure community rating see table 7 can be found only in the states of new york and vermont16 in those states small group insurers cannot charge more because of the health status age gender or occupation of members of the group as result the cost of health insurance is spread more broadly across the entire market and premium variations are based only on benefits and not health status or demographics called case characteristics this makes the cost of health insurance more predictable for small employers it also spreads the cost of health insurance among all groups making it more affordable for groups with sicker employees and

more due to health status they are able however to charge more for other factors such as age or gender one of these states oregon applied this rule to products purchased by groups of two to 25 instead

policies in the state will be communityrated crs14 case characteristics such as age gender or occupation allowing for much greater variation in premiums almost all of the remaining states had some form of rate bands required under small group market laws or regulations when states restrict premiums by setting rate bands premiums are allowed to vary by demographic factors but only by limited amount for example state may allow premiums for an insurance product to vary based on the health status of the employer groups purchasing the insurance but the amounts can vary by more than 2 to 1 ratio purchasing pools in 2002 two states arizona new mexico and new york city operated health insurance purchasing arrangements also known as purchasing pools17 purchasing pools allow small businesses to band together to purchase health insurance some argue that they expand access to health insurance for small businesses by offering health insurance at lower cost than would otherwise be available to small firm purchasing coverage independently in the private market it is argued that the cost savings is achieved through volume purchasing and discounts negotiated with insurers18 cost savings may also be achieved through favorable selection of purchasing pool members who are healthier than average such savings however may be directly offset by increases in the cost of health insurance for sicker groups who are left outside of the pool although achieved costs savings are debatable pools can improve choice for small businesses and their workers generally employees of participating small businesses choose among different insurance companies health insurance policies and benefit levels such choices are not typically available to employees of small businesses outside the purchasing pool19 additionally purchasing pools may fill an unmet need by serving population that has limited access to health insurance for example as discussed earlier it is more difficult for small businesses with fewer than 10 employees to buy health insurance directly from private health insurers for statesponsored purchasing pools states establish eligibility rules design benefit offerings sometimes regulate the premium that may be charged and negotiate with insurers the existing statesponsored purchasing pools are subsidized by state 17 there are several states that have created statesponsored purchasing pools some of them have been discontinued such as those created in fl nc and tx the flagship state operated purchasing pool and the pool attaining the largest size

firms those with fewer than ten are even less likely to offer coverage20 while number of complex factors are involved one of the most important reasons is sensitivity to price in the same survey 84 of

an alternative for some people who cannot obtain jobbased insurance or who do not qualify for public programs others however cannot buy individual policies either because their application is denied because of health status or other risk factors or because they cannot afford it many states have set up highrisk pools for those who cannot purchase private health insurance on their own while only 5 to 6 of the population has individual coverage at any given time many more people move in and out of the individual market over time recent study found that one in four adults had been insured through individual health insurance at some point during threeyear period21 individual health insurance as illustrated in table 10 many of the state laws in effect in 2002 intended to preserve access to

require insurers to make their individual products available without regard to health status instead individual health insurers were able to medically underwrite applicants researching applicants

the states have taken variety of approaches to improve access to individual health insurance these approaches can be summarized as follows all products guaranteed issue five states maine massachusetts new york new jersey and vermont required individual health insurers to make all of the individual products available to all comers the experience of the states guaranteeing access to all products has been mixed all five states have preserved this requirement for number of years although not necessarily without political struggle other states that used to have these rules longer do new hampshire and washington for example had both repealed many of their individual health insurance reforms by 2002 selected guaranteed issue some states required insurers to make individual health insurance available only if the applicant is federally eligible as narrowly defined in hipaa22 while hipaa required guaranteed access to those individuals who are federally eligible it allowed states to choose how to implement this guarantee most states used options that already existed such as highrisk pools as result in most states hipaa protections do not change peoples options for coverage when they do not have jobbased health insurance or do not qualify for medicaid 22 person is federally eligible if he meets several criteria he has to have 18 months of continuous coverage ending with group health plan he must use up any cobra or state continuous coverage for which he was eligible and he must apply for health insurance for which he was federally eligible within 63 days of losing his prior coverage he cannot be eligible for medicare medicaid or group health plan and cannot have other health insurance an exception is if the other insurance is about to end then he may apply for guaranteed issue coverage while still insured crs18 there are few states that required individual health insurers to guarantee issue coverage to nonfederally eligible individuals under certain circumstances or during certain times of the year how they structured this requirement differs considerably ohio for instance required insurers to take turns holding an open enrollment period throughout the year oregon required insurers to make available certain plans to those who have had six months of prior coverage rhode island required insurers to guarantee issue all products to individuals who have had 12 months of prior coverage with gap in coverage insurer of last resort in 2002 four states michigan north carolina pennsylvania and virginia and the district of columbia required certain health insurers selling plans in the individual market in their state usually blue cross and blue shield plans to cover individuals who cannot get insurance elsewhere in addition to the above protections congress and the states enacted laws in the 1990s to make health insurance more secure by prohibiting insurance companies from canceling policies once an individual became sick as result insurers can longer cancel individuals because of their medical claims23 rating rules as shown in table 11 some states limited insurers ability to base individual health insurance premiums on health status three states required pure community rating while four states required adjusted community rating in another three states some dominant insurers community rated individual health insurance as matter of law

average wait is 1218 months c florida closed its highrisk pool to new enrollment in 1991 there are number of reasons for the small enrollment numbers the most prominent reason is that these programs have lacked funding to enroll larger number of people26 states and enrollees generally share in the cost of the insurance funding for states high risk pools came from variety of sources including general revenue tobacco settlement funds state taxes assessments on insurers and taxes or service charges on providers27 at the time of the survey participants were also required to pay premium for their coverage while states often offered variety of levels of coverage highrisk pool coverage is still nonetheless expensive and unaffordable for many uninsurable individuals28 this may have discouraged some people from applying some of the features of highrisk pools may also have contributed to low enrollment levels while individuals meeting the eligibility requirements could not be turned down the highrisk pools could use many of the same features as private individual health insurers for example to protect against individuals waiting until they get sick to purchase coverage called adverse selection highrisk pools had preexisting condition exclusion periods however these strategies used to protect against overwhelming the pool may also deter the seriously and chronically ill from buying coverage 26 pizer evaluation of high risk p 39 27 communicating for agriculture pp 2933 28 pizer evaluation of high risk pp 4749 crs21 despite these challenges some states have made

against that exclusion period minnesota also caps its highrisk pool premium at 125 of the standard rate in the individual health insurance market by contrast the premiums for most other state highrisk pool premiums are between 150 to 200 of the standard rate for individual health insurance this makes minnesotas highrisk pool premiums even for an elderly enrollee lower than many of the other states related federal initiatives in the 1990s efforts to expand coverage to the uninsured largely focused on public programs in partnership with the states the state childrens health insurance program schip is the latest major example more recently the bush administration and congress have focused on how to use private health insurance 29 communicating for agriculture and discussions with highrisk pool program representatives 30 in 2002 ca passed assembly bill 1401 requiring that high risk pool subscribers be disenrolled after 36 months of continuous enrollment implemented in 2003 this change

jan 10 2004 pg 1a 32 communicating for agriculture p 23 crs22 to expand coverage this section highlights some of the recent federal initiatives that affect or relate to state activities tax credits in each of the years that president bush has been in office the administrations budget proposals have included as central component of his health care agenda proposal to establish health insurance tax credits for the uninsured in addition various members of congress have introduced their own health insurance tax credits bills some of those bills include credits for employers but most of the national debate has focused on credits for individuals33 there has been much discussion among policy analysts about how large tax credit has to be to make individual health insurance affordable and growing consensus that it will have to be large to substantially lower the number of uninsured34 analysts have struggled with the difficult question of how tax credit could be structured so that it really reached the uninsured35 there has also been discussion about how tax credit could be structured to minimize any adverse impact on jobbased coverage36 this discussion includes for instance the extent to which younger and healthier workers who qualify for the tax credit will drop their jobbased health insurance and make health insurance more expensive for those who remain the impact of tax credits on people with chronic conditions or history of illness has also been subject of concern since as discussed above most states currently do not have the protections in place to make individual health insurance accessible to broad range of people public programs the health insurance flexibility and accountability demonstration initiative hifa gives states options to expand coverage to the uninsured by allowing them more flexibility in designing eligibility benefit packages and costsharing requirements than under current medicaid and schip rules it also encourages states to offer premium assistance through schip to enroll children in their parents jobbased health insurance37 while this may expand coverage some have expressed concern about the effect on medicaid beneficiaries should states reduce benefits packages or increase costsharing as allowed under the initiative38 other proposals have been introduced to expand coverage through public programs 33 for more on tax

in the house by representative kaptur and in the senate by senator bingaman is one example association health plans because small employers continue to have difficulty affording health insurance congress continues to debate other strategies to make insurance affordable one strategy that has been discussed for number of years is to change federal law so that many associationsponsored plans would not be subject to state small group health insurance rules including some benefit mandates and rating rules the bills would establish association health plans ahps as legal entities that allow small employers to pool together to buy coverage that is priced below plans that must meet state regulations this approach has been the subject of heated debate for many years three bills hr 4281 hr 660 and its companion bill s 545 have been introduced in the 108th congress39 the trade act of 2002 some of the approaches discussed in this report were incorporated into the trade adjustment assistance reform act of 2002 pl 107 210 this act included an individual tax credit that applies only to individuals who are receiving trade readjustment assistance or benefits from the pension benefit guaranty corporation they will be able to use the credit to subsidize 65 of their cost for cobra or other qualified health insurance the act relies on states to establish these other qualified health insurance arrangements it also provides some resources to states to create or expand highrisk pools the act included seed money in the amount of 1 million for each state that had not yet started highrisk pool and limited matching funds to help states with existing pools defray some of their costs the matching funds available amount to total of 40 million in each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003 three states new hampshire maryland and south dakota have qualified for grants under the taa to establish risk pools implications for the future the federal government continues to look to the states as its laboratories of innovation states have spent many years exploring ways to expand private health insurance and public programs to the uninsured medicaid and schip are the primary vehicles through which they have pursued this goal states have also made progress designing rules to better stabilize group health insurance and promoting access for those who can afford to pay but they have been largely unable to reach those who are not eligible for public programs or those who are declined or cannot afford private insurance for those who lack access to group health insurance the states have faced greater challenges access to and affordability of individual health insurance and alternative forms of coverage such as highrisk pools in particular remains problematic creating stable coverage options for small employers and individuals who cannot access or afford private health insurance has proven difficult task for states 39 for more information on association health plans see crs report rl31963 association health plans health marts and the small group market for health insurance by jean hearne crs24 probably the most important lesson learned from the states experience is that they cannot easily do this alone the most comprehensive initiatives that states have undertaken involved significant federal involvement federal standards andor federal dollars the schip program and the small group health insurance rules established under hipaa are the most recent notable examples while states had begun to enact many of the market reforms later included in hipaa the federal laws passage created uniformity across states so that all small employers have the opportunity to buy group health insurance schip helped states make significant headway in reducing the uninsurance rate for children states have been uneven in their efforts to expand coverage to the uninsured reflecting at least in part the significant financial costs associated with many of these initiatives and the demands of different priorities only six states and the district of columbia for instance had public programs in place in 2002 providing access to health insurance funded without federal dollars very few states have attempted to extend tax credits to subsidize the cost of health insurance coverage further with few exceptions such as minnesotas highrisk pool or washingtons basic health plan the states have not reached appreciable numbers of uninsured through these initiatives even in the case of highrisk pools which 29 states have created states have struggled to garner sufficient resources to reach large number of residents or to make such coverage affordable they are further challenged by the rising number of people without insurance and the declining number covered by employerbased coverage given competing priorities for limited state budgets questions remain about how states can maintain their current public programs much less begin new ones nevertheless the variety of approaches used by those states that have engaged in these initiatives can yield some useful information for congress many have been in place for number of years so state program officials are knowledgeable about the strengths and weaknesses of their initiatives understanding how these public and private programs have been designed can provide insight into the various choices that are available and their implications while many of the states efforts are small in scale they provide an opportunity to track their impact and any administrative challenges they pose for
