adopt two budget resolutions each year the first budget resolution which was to be adopted by may 15 was advisory in nature the second budget resolution which was to be adopted by september 15 about two weeks before the beginning of the fiscal year was binding the second budget resolution revised or reaffirmed the first budget resolution by taking into account budget and economic changes in the months since the first resolution additional budget resolutions could be adopted at any time the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 10381101 eliminated the requirement for second budget crs2 resolution beginning in fy1987 for several preceding years for fy1983fy1986 congress did not adopt second budget resolution but instead included provision in the first budget resolution that made the spending and revenue totals in it binding automatically as of the beginning of the fiscal year during the 33 years that the congressional budget

following the submission of the presidents budget in january or february congress begins formulating its budget resolution the house and senate budget committees are responsible for developing and reporting the budget resolution within six weeks after the presidents budget submission each house and senate committee is required to submit its views and estimates relating to budget matters under their jurisdiction to their respective budget committee section 301d of the budget act these views and estimates often submitted in the form of letter to the chair and ranking member of the budget committee typically include comments on the presidents budget proposals and estimates of the budgetary impact of any legislation likely to be considered during the current session of congress the budget committees are not bound by these recommendations the views and estimates often are printed in the committee report accompanying the resolution in the senate or compiled in separate committee print in the house the budget resolution was designed to provide framework to make budget decisions leaving specific program determinations to the appropriations committees and other committees with spending and revenue jurisdiction in many instances however particular program changes are considered when formulating the budget resolution program assumptions are sometimes referred to in the reports of the budget committees or may be discussed during floor action although these program changes are not binding committees may be strongly influenced by these recommendations when formulating appropriations bills reconciliation measures or other budgetary legislation appendix d provides list of the house senate and conference reports to the first budget resolutions adopted by congress each year content of the budget resolution section 301a of the budget act requires that the budget resolution include the following matters for the upcoming fiscal year and at least the ensuing four fiscal years aggregate levels of new budget authority outlays the budget surplus or deficit and the public debt aggregate levels of federal revenues and the amount if any by which the aggregate levels of federal revenues should be increased or decreased by legislative action amounts of new budget authority and outlays for each of the major functional categories and crs8 for purposes of senate enforcement procedures social security outlays and revenues although these amounts are not included in the budget surplus or deficit totals due to their offbudget status in addition to the content required by the budget act section 301b lists several other matters that may be included in the budget resolution appendix provides table indicating selected components included in first budget resolutions for fy1976fy2008 the most important of the optional matters is the inclusion of reconciliation directives provided by section 310 of the budget act budget reconciliation is an optional twostep process congress may use to bring direct spending revenue and debtlimit levels into compliance with those set forth in budget resolutions2 in order to accomplish this congress first includes reconciliation directives in budget resolution directing one or more committees in each chamber to recommend changes in statute to achieve the levels of direct spending revenues debt limit or combination thereof agreed to in the budget resolution the legislative language recommended by committees then is packaged without any substantive revision into one or more reconciliation bills as set forth in the budget resolution by the house and senate budget committees in some instances committee may be required to report its legislative recommendations directly to its chamber once the budget committees or individual committees if so directed report reconciliation legislation to their respective chambers consideration is governed by special procedures3 these special rules serve to limit what may be included in reconciliation legislation to prohibit certain amendments and to encourage its completion in timely fashion during the 33year period since the congressional budget process was established congress has included reconciliation directives to house and senate committees in 20 budget resolutions4 the directives resulted in the enactment of 19 2 for more detailed discussion of the reconciliation process see crs report rl33030 the reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jr 3 for brief summary of these procedures see crs report 98814 budget reconciliation legislation development and consideration by bill heniff jr 4 the number 19 of budget resolutions containing reconciliation directives includes the fy1976 second budget resolution hconres 466 there has been an ongoing controversy about whether the directive in this budget resolution was reconciliation directive as set forth in section 310 of the congressional budget act the senate treated it as such and considered the resultant legislation hr 5559 as reported by the senate finance committee 94th congress under the reconciliation procedures the house did not however consider and adopt its version of the resultant legislation as reconciliation measure and thus it presumably did not consider the directive as reconciliation directive see floyd m riddick and alan s frumin riddicks senate procedure precedents and practices rev ed sdoc 10128 101st cong 1st sess washington gpo 1992 pp 622623 the legislation subsequently was adopted by the senate and house but was vetoed by the president for further information on these directives see 1 crs congressional continued crs9 reconciliation measures on four occasions in 1982 1986 1997 and 2006 congress adopted two reconciliation measures in one year four reconciliation measures have been vetoed in 1975 1995 1999 and 2000 appendix f lists the budget resolutions that contained reconciliation directives and the associated reconciliation acts beginning with the fy1981 budget resolution congress also included amounts for federal credit activities the 1985 balanced budget act permanently required the inclusion of aggregate and functional levels of direct loan obligations and primary loan guarantee commitments in budget resolutions the inclusion of federal credit levels however was made optional by the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 111 stat 677712 of the 27 first budget resolutions adopted by congress 18 budget resolutions included federal credit amounts another optional component of budget resolutions has been the inclusion of reserve funds the reserve fund provisions generally provide for the revision of budget resolution aggregates functional allocations and committee allocations if certain deficitneutral legislation is enacted or some other condition is met over the last decade congress often has included several reserve funds in budget resolutions as indicated in appendix for instance the fy2008 budget resolution sconres 21 110th congress included 23 reserve funds in recent years declaratory statements increasingly have been included in budget resolutions these nonbinding statements express the sense of congress the sense of the house or the sense of the senate on various issues as indicated in appendix congress has included on average 22 declaratory statements in the last 11 budget resolutions not including budget resolutions for fy1999 fy2003 fy2005 and fy2007 because congress did not complete action on these measures but only on average about two and half declaratory statements in the first 18 budget resolutions the annual budget resolution also may require deferred enrollment procedure see section 301b3 of the budget act under which all or certain bills providing new budget authority or new entitlement authority for the upcoming fiscal year cannot be enrolled until congress has completed action on reconciliation measure or prior to fy1987 reconciliation measure or the second budget resolution budget resolutions for fy1981 fy1982 fy1983 and fy1984 contained deferred enrollment provisions5 lastly congress has included several other procedural provisions in budget resolutions under section 301b4 of the budget act the socalled elastic clause 4 continued distribution memorandum reconciliation directives to house committees in budget resolutions for fy1976fy2005 by bill heniff jr and 2 crs congressional distribution memorandum reconciliation directives to senate committees in budget resolutions for fy1976fy2005 by bill heniff jr both available from the author 5 the fy1983 budget resolution exempted legislation dealing with certain trust funds from its deferred enrollment provision crs10 congress may set forth such other matters and require such other procedures relating to the budget as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of the congressional budget act in the budget resolution the number of procedural provisions included in budget resolutions is listed in the last column of appendix some of these procedural provisions include deferred enrollment automatic second budget resolutions special budgetary treatment of certain activities such as the sale of government assets and more recently enforcement of payasyougo requirement in the senate and limits on advance appropriations source of economic assumptions associated with budget levels in the budget resolution the budget levels contained in the budget resolution are developed using baseline which is projection of revenues and spending under existing law and assuming policy changes there are two baselines commonly used in the federal budget process 1 the current services estimates calculated by the office of management and budget omb and 2 the budget baseline projections calculated by the congressional budget office cbo these two projections often differ because they are based upon different sets of economic and technical assumptions reflecting different projections of future economic and program performance the economic assumptions developed by omb are published in the analytical perspectives volume of the presidents budget submitted to congress6 cbo includes its initial economic assumptions in its annual economic and budget outlook report published early in the year7 often cbo revises these economic assumptions to reflect new economic data which become available after the publication of this report in some years cbo will revise its economic assumptions in late winter or early spring and publish them in its analysis of the presidents budget8 in other years revised economic assumptions will be included in cbos economic and budget outlook update report published in the summer congress is not required to use the economic assumptions developed by either omb or cbo in the budget resolution but must identify the economic assumptions upon which the budget levels are based9 the original budget act required that only the house and senate committee reports accompanying the budget resolution include the economic assumptions upon which the spending and revenue levels were based the common practice however was to extend this to the conference report on the 6 for example see omb budget of the us government fiscal year 2007 analytical perspectives washington gpo february 2006 chapter 12 pp 165174 7 for example see cbo the budget and economic outlook fiscal years 20072016 washington january 2006 chapter 2 pp 2549 8 for example see cbo an analysis of the presidents budgetary proposals for fiscal year 2003 washington march 2002 pp 45 9 in addition section 301g1 of the budget act prohibits the senate from considering budget resolution that contains budget levels based on more than one set of economic assumptions this provision was added by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 title i of pl 100119 99 stat 754788 crs11 budget resolution as well in 1985 congress amended the budget act to specifically require that the joint explanatory statement accompanying conference report on budget resolution set forth the common economic assumptions upon which the statement and conference report are based10 appendix g specifies the source of the economic assumptions used in the first budget resolutions for fy1976 to fy2008 of the 29 budget resolutions adopted by congress during this period 17 were based upon economic assumptions developed by cbo usually these were the assumptions in cbos economic and budget outlook report published early in the year in four instances however congress used the economic assumptions that were revised by cbo after the publication of this report the budget resolutions for fy1984 fy1985 fy1997 and fy1998 were based upon revised cbo economic assumptions on four other occasions congress made adjustments to the cbo economic assumptions the budget resolutions for fy1996 fy1997 fy1998 and fy2000 were based upon adjusted cbo economic assumptions in the first three the adjustments were intended to reflect anticipated revisions to the consumer price index in six of the 29 budget resolutions congress used the economic assumptions developed by omb usually these were the assumptions included in the presidents budget submitted to congress early in the year in two of these budget resolutions however the omb economic assumptions were adjusted to reflect revisions in economic data in 1982 congress based the budget levels in the fy1983 budget resolution upon economic assumptions agreed to by negotiators from congress and the administration during budget summit finally the joint explanatory statements accompanying the conference reports to the first five budget resolutions specified the economic assumptions upon which the budget levels were based but did not indicate the source of those assumptions number of years covered by the budget resolution originally the budget act mandated that budget resolutions cover only the upcoming fiscal year beginning on october 1 referred to as the budget year desire to use the budget resolution as tool for budget planning and other factors prompted congress to expand this time frame to include the upcoming fiscal year as well as the two ensuing fiscal years congress used the authority provided by the elastic clause of the budget act to adopt threeyear budget resolutions for the period covering the second budget resolution for fy1980 through the fy1986 budget resolution the practice of including three fiscal years was formalized by the 1985 balanced budget act the budget enforcement act bea of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 13885731388 through 630 10 section 301g2 of the budget act as amended by the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 99 stat 10381101 crs12 temporarily extended to five fiscal years the period the budget resolution is required to cover the 1990 bea provision originally covered fiveyear periods beginning in fy1991 and continuing through fy1995 this provision was extended to cover the fy1996 through fy1998 budget resolutions in 1993 title xiv of pl 10366 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 107 stat 683685 as an integral part of congresss goal of achieving balanced budget by fy2002 the fy1996 and fy1997 budget resolutions covered seven and six fiscal years respectively the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 balanced budget act of 1997 111 stat 677712 amended the budget act to require permanently that budget resolution cover the budget year and at least the four ensuing fiscal years appendix h provides information regarding the number of years covered by the budget resolutions agreed to by congress congress also may revise budget levels for the current year in the budget resolution pursuant to section 304 of the budget act congress has adopted 14 first budget resolutions that revised currentyear budget levels consideration and adoption of the budget resolution floor consideration of the budget resolution differs in the house and senate section 305 of the budget act sets forth special procedures for the consideration of the budget resolution generally to expedite its consideration the house however regularly adopts special rule simple house resolution setting forth the terms for consideration of the measure in particular special rules have been used for more than decade to limit the offering of amendments to few major substitutes appendix i lists the special rules that provided for the consideration of budget resolutions in the house in contrast floor consideration in the senate is governed by the procedures set forth in the congressional budget act the procedures generally limit debate and prohibit certain amendments and motions11 amendments to the budget resolution the house has considered on average six amendments per budget resolution12 the largest number of amendments considered was 45 in 1979 the largest number agreed to was 11 in 1979 the first fy1983 budget resolution also was amended 11 times but it subsequently was rejected appendix j identifies the number of accepted and rejected amendments to budget resolutions considered in the house 11 for discussion of these procedures see crs report 98511 consideration of the budget resolution by bill heniff jr 12 these averages as well as the averages related to senate amendments derive from all first budget resolutions considered and adopted on the house or senate floor that is the averages do not include amendments to budget resolutions that subsequently were rejected crs13 the amending activity in the house during the last several years is in marked contrast to the early years of the congressional budget process during the first eight years the house considered on average more than 13 amendments per budget resolution agreeing to on average three of these in contrast during the past 25 years the house has considered very few amendments to budget resolutions averaging almost four per budget resolution and agreeing to even fewer of these of the 89 amendments considered by the house during this time period only four were adopted since 1992 the house has rejected all amendments contributing to this trend the house special rule typically has allowed for consideration of only amendments in the nature of substitute to the budget resolution for example between 1983 and 2007 for the fy1984fy2008 budget resolutions 84 out of the 89 amendments to the budget resolution made in order by the special rule were amendments in the nature of substitute only one of these 84 amendments in the nature of substitute was agreed to that one contained the budget resolution text recommended by the house budget committee offered by its chair at the time representative william h gray iii pa appendix k lists the amendments in the nature of substitute to the budget resolution made in order by the special rule unlike the house which has reporting deadline for its budget committee to report budget resolution the senate has an april 1 reporting deadline for the budget resolution13 in addition the terms of debate and the consideration of amendments are not structured by special rule as in the house but instead are governed by the procedures set forth in section 305b of the budget act typically larger number of amendments is considered consisting of substitute amendments as well as amendments that address specific issues during the period between 1975 and 2007 the senate considered on average about 42 amendments per budget resolution agreeing to on average 22 of these14 the largest number of amendments considered was 106 in 1998 the largest number agreed to was 57 in 1998 and 1999 appendix l identifies the number of amendments accepted rejected withdrawn and ruled outoforder during senate consideration of budget resolutions in contrast to the house the number of amendments considered by the senate has increased over the last decade for the last 14 budget resolutions considered on the floor for example the senate considered on average 72 amendments per budget resolution agreeing to on average about 43 of these amendments have been agreed to in the senate at much higher rate compared to the house as well for instance in 10 of the past 14 years in which budget resolution was considered on the floor the success rate for amendments has equaled or exceeded 60 13 for further information see crs report

reconciliation procedures the house did not however consider and adopt its version of the resultant legislation as reconciliation measure and thus it presumably did not consider the directive as
