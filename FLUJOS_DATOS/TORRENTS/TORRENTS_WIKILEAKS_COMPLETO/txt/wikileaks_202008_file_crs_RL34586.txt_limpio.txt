appropriations for child survival and maternal health programs csmh have grown by about 22 during the tenure of president george w bush most of that growth occurred in fy2008 when congress provided 5219 million for csmh programs up from 3611 million in fy2001 although congress provided support during this time for other global health initiatives that affect csmh such as some 197 billion for international programs that prevent and treat human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome hivaids tuberculosis tb and malaria other global health interventions are discussed only as they relate to usaids csmh programs according to latest estimates 97 million children under the age of five died in 2006 some 26000 each day the majority of those deaths occurred in developing countries and almost half of them in africa on average nearly 90 of all child deaths are caused by neonatal infections and five other diseases acute respiratory infections primarily pneumonia diarrhea malaria measles and hivaids undernutrition contributes to more than half of these deaths more than 500000 women die each year due to pregnancyrelated causes and many more suffer debilitating longterm effects such as obstetric fistula most of these deaths occur in developing countries about 20 of global maternal deaths are linked to undernutrition and about 75 result from obstetric complications most often hemorrhage sepsis eclampsia and prolonged or obstructed labor while most health experts applaud the recent increase in us commitment to global health many remain concerned that funding is largely aimed at specific diseases such as hivaids and malaria other health programs that offer life saving interventions for women and children are overlooked and underfunded they contend particularly in subsaharan africa in addition to proposing an increase in funding for csmh programs some observers urge congress to boost support for health systems so that countries can better address wide range of health issues that affect child survival and maternal health this report will be updated at the end of the 110th congress contents introduction 1 child survival 1 maternal health

in addressing malaria might improve maternal and child survival child survival in the united nations childrens fund unicef report the state of the worlds children 2008 child survival unicef executive director ann veneman celebrated the decline of total annual deaths among children under age five in 2006 an estimated 97 million children in that age range died representing 60 drop in underfive mortality since 19601 despite the decrease ms veneman asserted that critical number of daily deaths among children under five remains high some 26000 die each day most studies that measure child mortality focus on deaths that occur before age five because 90 of childhood deaths occur during this time while 37 occur during the neonatal period the first 28 days amounting to about 4 million annual newborn deaths2 the majority of child deaths occur in developing countries and almost half of them in africa on average nearly 90 of all child deaths are caused by neonatal infections and five

world health organization who 2007 world health statistics p 31 note figures may not add up to 100 because of rounding some health experts assert that maternal and child health are particularly important to monitor because their mortality rates serve as barometer for overall health conditions4 supporters of this idea often use the millennium development goals mdgs listed in table 2 to demonstrate the interconnected nature of health and development and to gauge improvements in child and maternal health table 35 mdgs 4 and 5 call for twothirds reduction in child and maternal mortality the ability to reach those goals however is affected by progress in other mdgs for example countries with significant undernourished populations mdg 1 that lack sufficient access to clean water mdg 7 tend to have higher maternal and child mortality rates mdgs 4 and 5 undernourished women and children are also more likely to be impoverished mdg 1 and are more susceptible to infectious

obstructed labor and unsafe abortions9 maternal mortality and morbidity rates are generally higher for mothers younger than 20 years who typically have more pregnancy and delivery complications such as toxemia anemia premature delivery prolonged labor and cervical trauma and are at higher risk of delivering low birth weight babies pregnancyrelated complications are the leading cause of death among 15 to19yearolds around the world and their babies have higher morbidity and mortality rates10 the united nations estimates that adolescents give birth to 15 million infants each year girls aged between 15 and 19 years are twice as likely to die from childbirth as women in their twenties and those younger than 15 years are five times as likely to die11 survey conducted in mali indicated that the maternal mortality rate for girls aged between 15 and 19 years was 178 per 100000 live births and 32 per 100000 for women aged between 20 and 34 years12 8 postpartum hemorrhage occurs when the woman bleeds excessively from her uterus after baby is delivered sepsis is blood infection that people whose immune systems are weakened due to illness such as cancer or hivaids are more prone to contract infants may contract the disease from their mothers also referred to as toxemia preeclampsia is condition that occurs when pregnant women has high blood pressure accompanied by high level of protein in the urine eclampsia occurs when preeclampsia is untreated in addition to preeclampsia symptoms women with eclampsia often have seizures eclampsia can also cause coma or death of the mother and baby before during or after childbirth 9 unicef countdown to 2015 maternal newborn child survival 2008 p 42 at httpwwwwhointpmnchcountdownto2015finalreportapr7pdf 10 cdc family planning methods

international development is the lead us agency responsible for improving child survival around the world according to usaid research that it supported during the 1970s and 1980s has been used to develop interventions and technologies now used to save millions of children17 over the past 20 years usaid has committed more than 6 billion in support of global child survival efforts18 about half of those funds were committed from fy2001fy2008 when congress appropriated 34 billion to child survival and maternal health efforts recognizing that six health problems acute respiratory infections diarrhea malaria hivaids measles neonatal complications cause about 90 of all child deaths in developing countries and that undernutrition contributes to half of these 17 see usaid website on maternal

presented about its efforts to improve child and maternal health child survival and undernutrition the united nations food and agriculture organization fao argues that the vast majority of the nearly 10 million children who die each year would not die if their bodies and immune systems had not been weakened by hunger and malnutrition20 ten whosupported communitybased studies conducted from 1991 through 2001 of children under age five found that children who are mildly underweight are about twice as likely to die of infectious diseases as children who are better nourished for those who are moderately to severely underweight the risk of death is five to eight times higher21 the studies also indicated that 45 of children who died after contracting measles were malnourished as were more than 60 of children who died after the onset of severe diarrhea good nutrition can improve child survival health and cognitive development while undernutrition impairs the immune system22 children with impaired immune systems disproportionately suffer from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhea pneumonia and measles undernourished children have also been found to be more susceptible to other infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis this section discusses usaids nutrition programs which focus on micronutrient supplementation and fortification and infant and young child feeding iycf micronutrient supplementation and fortification usaidsupported micronutrient programs add vital immunebuilding micronutrients including zinc vitamin iron and iodine to processed foods such as rice and sugar23 usaid funds are also used to expand research on biofortified crops which could improve the micronutrient content of basic foods such as maize enhanced with vitamin iron and zinc beans enhanced with iron and zinc and sweet potatoes enhanced with vitamin micronutrient supplementation and other usaid nutrition programs are integrated with other interventions including safe water hygiene and sanitation infant and young child feeding usaid estimates that more than two thirds of malnutritionrelated infant and child deaths are associated with poor feeding 19 see usaids

exclusively breastfed during the first six months of life early cessation of breastfeeding and introducing foods either too early or too late expose infants to disease usaid contends that the foods that are introduced are often nutritionally inadequate and unsafe one usaidsupported study showed that exclusively breastfed infants have 25 times fewer episodes of childhood diseases are four times less likely to die of acute respiratory infection and are up to 25 times less likely to die of diarrheal diseases the study also indicated that continued breastfeeding during acute episodes of diarrhea protects infants from loss of energy and protein during illness in communities affected by hivaids usaid works with its implementation partners to integrate safe infant feeding practices with programs that prevent mothertochild hiv transmission pmtct usaid spends about 30 million each year on nutrition programs which include vitamin iodine food fortification anemia packages and zinc25 child survival and acute respiratory infections pneumonia unicef asserts that pneumonia can be largely prevented if indoor pollution is minimized and if children are adequately nourished exclusively breastfed and receive vitamin and zinc supplements as necessary26 children should also receive the full series of immunizations against infections that directly cause pneumonia such as haemophilus influenzae type b hib and those that can lead to pneumonia as complication eg pertussis international health organizations also seek to expand access to vaccines that protect against streptococcus pneumoniae the most common cause of severe pneumonia among children in the developing world usaid reports that since 2002 it has supported the administration of immunizations to almost 500 million children and the treatment of more than 375 million cases of child pneumonia27 in the mid1990s unicef and who developed the integrated management of childhood illness imci with usaid support the

the onset of labor and nevirapine syrup is given to the infant within 72 hours of birth34 who asserts that it is critical that children are diagnosed early and provided with antiretroviral therapy art as early as possible as the course of hiv infection is faster and more aggressive in children the cost of art is significantly higher for children than for adults unaids estimates that an annual supply of generic arts costs about 260 per child while the same regimen for adults costs about 18335 fixeddosed treatments in which two or three different drugs are combined in single pill have proved to be most effective though they are more expensive for children in 2005 oneyear supply of standard threedrug regimen for an adult costs an average of 148 in lowincome countries but the regimen for children cost 2000 per child and 800 for generic version the clinton foundation however was able to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to charge lower prices for pediatric arts in its programs about 016 per day or 60 per year36 health experts point out that art is not the only treatment that can be used to reduce child mortality among hivpositive children treatment of opportunistic infections such as pneumonia can also improve child survival among hivpositive children cotrimoxazole drug used to treat pneumonia has been found to reduce mortality in children with hivaids by about

until the girls pelvic region is fully developed ensuring that women have ready access to emergency obstetric care in the case of prolonged labor and removing the fetus through caesarean surgery when needed usaid reports that it has supported fistula prevention programs since 1989 and repair programs since 2005 obstetric fistula prevention programs are commonly integrated with other programs that

debut training families and community health practitioners to identify the signs of prolonged or obstructed labor increasing access for women to emergency obstetrical care and reducing stigma about obstetric fistula52 maternal health and unsafe abortions who estimates that complications due to unsafe abortion procedures account for 13 of maternal deaths worldwide amounting to 67000 deaths each year53 there are significant regional variations however in latin america and the caribbean the practice accounts for 12 of maternal deaths on average while in africa about 4 of women die after attempting an unsafe abortion54 usaid reports that its international family planning programs help to avoid these deaths and that it has helped to avert an estimated 4 million maternal deaths over the

on targeted diseasespecific us programs through three key initiatives the presidents international mother and child hiv prevention initiative fy2002fy2004 pepfar fy2004fy2008 and the presidents malaria initiative fy2006fy2010 at the same time appropriations to other health issues such as child survival and maternal health have changed little with the exception of fy2008 when appropriations to csmh activities increased while most health experts applaud the recent increase in us commitment to countering the global spread of diseases like hivaids many remained concerned that other health programs that offer lifesaving interventions for women and children are overlooked and underfunded particularly in subsaharan africa the world health organization asserts that some twothirds of child deaths are preventable through practical lowcost interventions those expressing concern about the apportionment of us global health funds argue that hivaids tb and malaria are not the only diseases killing people in addition to proposing an increase in funding crs24 for csmh programs some observers urge congress to boost support for other health issues that affect child survival and maternal health60 consider role of family planning in improving maternal and child health some urge congress to consider how voluntary family planning could improve maternal and child health according to usaid family planning activities protect the health of women by reducing highrisk pregnancies and the health of children by allowing sufficient time between pregnancies prevent hivaids with information counseling and access to male and female condoms reduce abortions and protect the environment by stabilizing population growth61 others oppose funding family planning for number of reasons including concern that in some countries abortions and coercive practices may occur in family planning programs family planning can help improve the morbidity and mortality rates of adolescent girls in many rural areas of developing countries girls are married and begin to have children in their teen years some research indicates that mothers younger than 20 years of age are at higher risk of delivering lowbirthweight babies and suffer more pregnancy and delivery complications such as toxemia anemia premature delivery prolonged labor and cervical trauma girls between 15 and 19 years of age are twice as likely to die from childbirth as women in their twenties and those younger than 15 years of age are five times as likely to die62 young girls are also more likely to develop obstetric fistula in kenya one study found that 45 of all fistula cases were among adolescents63 obstetric fistula can be prevented by delaying pregnancy until the girls pelvic region is fully developed and performing caesarean surgery when needed the condition can be repaired for about 300 cost that is prohibitive to most young girls and women in the most affected countries64 increase support for health system strengthening and improve donor coordination some observers advocate that congress increase spending on health systems because to significantly reduce maternal and child mortality governments must be

systems in many countries cannot deliver essential interventions such as vaccinations sufficiently enough to reduce mortality nationwide66 supporters of strengthening health systems urge congress to direct usaid to better coordinate its health assistance with other donors and with respective health ministries to improve efficiency and overall health outcomes proponents of this idea point to whos international health partnership and related initiatives ihp coalition of international health agencies governments and donors committed to improving health and development outcomes in developing countries and reaching the healthrelated mdgs67 the ihp encourages donors to create compact with countries to commit development partners and governments to support one results oriented national health plan in harmonized way that will ensure predictable long term financing from both national and international sources compact is contract through which the international community and the recipient country reach consensus on results based on mutual accountability country compacts bind all donors and respective government agencies to one single country health plan one monitoring and evaluation plan one budget with external funding harmonized with recipient countries budget cycles one reporting and validation process and benchmarks for government performance encourage governments to increase national health budgets global health experts increasingly underscore the role recipient governments should play in improving health systems some critics contend that donors must consider the role that political will plays in minimal health spending by many developing countries according to the international monetary fund imf when asked about the most important reason health funds go
