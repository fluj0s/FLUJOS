divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281patent quality and public policy implications for innovative firms in domestic markets summary the administration of united states patent and trademark office uspto concerns issues of resource availability and management as well as need to identify and prioritize the goals of federal patent examination procedures this report focuses upon this latter issue there are currently at least three competing views concerning uspto priorities one position is that the uspto should aim to achieve high level of patent quality government industry academia and the patent bar alike have traditionally agreed that the uspto approve only those patent applications that fully describe and clearly claim an inventive advance high quality patents fully disclose and distinctly claim new useful and unobvious invention thereby meeting each of the statutory requirements under the patent act some commentators have challenged the notion that high patent quality should be priority goal they believe that interested private parties are often able to assess the robustness and value of individual patents more easily than the uspto making uspto hard look during its examination procedures economically inefficient moreover because relatively few patents are ultimately licensed or the subject of litigation other observers have argued that it may be inefficient to conduct rigorous examination proceedings for all patents these varying perspectives hold implications for the administration of the patent system each of three views possesses its merits and shortcomings uniformly high levels of patent quality may be difficult for the uspto to maintain in light of budget constraints and increasing workloads however improvidently granted patents may lead to certain social costs stringent patent grant proceedings could potentially limit some of these costs legislation introduced before the 107th congress bears upon the patent quality issue in the event that congress further considers this issue uspto administrative practices may be reviewed with an eye towards their capability for maintaining high levels of patent quality within current resource constraints congress may wish to consider whether patent examiners have appropriate resources and training that will allow them to conduct rigorous review of patent applications the responsibilities of patent applicants to contribute to quality patent examination may also be weighed finally congress might choose to assess the contributions members of the general public might make within an optimal patent examination regime for example by encouraging interested third parties to comment upon pending patent applications httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281contents introduction to the patent

fashion usually confined to the community of patent professionals have recently entered the popular press3 several accounts suggest that the uspto has become more lenient allowing an increasing number of patents to issue that lay claim to knowledge that has previousl entered the public domain4 this impression recently received quantitative boost from cecil d quillen jr and ogden h webster whose data analysis concluded that the uspto may approve as many as 97 of the applications placed before it5 some commentators agree that the usptos growing workload and increasing budgetary pressures are at the root of perceived patent quality concerns6 sound uspto administration concerns issues of resource availabilit and management as well as the identification of the most appropriate purposes of

commercial transactions9 not everyone agrees the notion that high patent quality is socially desirable has been challenged some commentators cite the coase theorem as discussed further below the coase theorem postulates that absent transaction costs and wealth or income effects the initial assignment of legal entitlements does not affect the efficiency of the resulting allocation of resources applied to the patent law the coase theorem suggests that market forces will efficiently assign patent rights matter what their quality other commentators refer to the principle of rational ignorance which is also discussed further below under the rational ignorance principle the optimal time spent examining individual patent applications may be brief period10 because many patented inventions are not used in way that calls their validity into question some observers maintain society may be better off making searching inquiry only in those few cases where patent is licensed or litigated all

towards technological innovation this effect is achieved by granting inventors exclusive rights to practice the patented invention11 industry reaction to the plant variety protection act of 1970 pvpa has been cited in support of the rationale that patent rights can stimulate invention in field in which proprietary rights were previously unavailable the pvpa allowed plant breeders the ability to obtain patentlike protection on novel varieties of plants grown from seed12 in the decade prior to the promulgation of the pvpa industry developed approximately 150 new plant varieties but in the decade following the enactment of the pvpa over 3000 new varieties were created13 the regime of patents purportedly serves other goals as well the patent system encourages the disclosure of products and processes for each issued patent must include description sufficient to enable skilled artisans to practice the patented invention14 although estimates vary one report observed that 8590 of the information available in published patent instruments would not otherwise be publicly available15 issued patents may also encourage others to invent around the patentees proprietary interest patentee may point the way to new products markets economies of production and even entire industries others can build upon the patentees disclosure to produce their own technologies that fall outside the exclusive rights associated with the patent16 the patent system has also been identified as facilitator of markets without patent rights an inventor may have scant tangible assets to sell or license in addition an inventor might otherwise be unable to police the conduct of contracting party any technology or knowhow that has been disclosed to prospective licensee might be appropriated without compensation to the inventor the availability of patent protectio n decreases the ability of contracting parties to engage in opportunistic behavior by lowering such transaction costs the patent system may make technologybased transactions more feasible17 through these mechanisms the patent system may provide more socially desirable outcome than its chief legal alternative trade secret

httpwwwphilfrborg filesbrbrnd99rhpdfsecrecy guards against the improper appropriation of valuable commercially useful and secret information in contrast to patenting trade secret protection does not result in the disclosure of publicly valuable information that is because an enterprise must take reasonable measures to keep secret the information for which trade secret protection is sought taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security measures also imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductive for society18 the extent to which the patent system practically achieves these goals is difficult to assess economic research suggests that different industries attach widely varying values to patents for example one study of the aircraft and semiconductor industries suggested that lead time and the strength of the learning curve were superior to patents in capturing the value of investments19 in contrast members of the drug and chemical industries attached higher value to patents differences in the perception of the patent system have been attributed to the extent to which patents introduced significant duplication costs and times for competitors of the patentee studies have indicated that individual entrepreneurs and small innovative firms rely more heavily upon the patent system than larger enterprises larger companies often possess number of alternative means for achieving proprietary or property like interest in particular technology for example trade secrecy ready access to markets trademark rights speed of development and consumer goodwill may to some degree act as substitutes to the patent system as sally wyatt and gilles bertin reported in their survey of alternatives to patenting representative of one european corporation opined that multinational corporations could easily cease to use patents and use other available methods to achieve the same aims20 however individual inventors and small firms often do not have these mechanisms at their disposal as result the patent system may enjoy heightened importance with respect to these enterprises21 perhaps the best evidence available as to the perceived value of patents is that in the united states the number of filed patent applications and issued patents continues to climb22 in 1995 inventors filed 221304 patent applications at the united states

system has long been subject to criticism however some observers believe that the patent system encourages industry concentration and presents barrier to entry in some markets23 for example the world health report 2000 of the world health organization reportedly identified patents as significant barrier to entry for generic pharmaceutical manufacturers24 others believe that the patent system too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity25 the late jerome c lemelson prolific inventor who owned hundreds of patents and launched numerous charges of patent infringement has sometimes been mentioned in this context the annual revenue of the lemelson estates patent licensing program has been reported as collecting over 15 billion26 but as explained by journalist michael ravnitsky critics charge that many lemelson patents are socalled submarine patents overly broad applications that took so long to issue or were so general in nature that their owners could unfairly claim broad infringement across entire industry sectors27 of such patent ventures patent attorney james pooley observes of course there is nothing inherently wrong with charging someone rent to use your property including intellectual property like patents but its useful to keep in mindespecially when listening to prattle about losing american jobs to foreign competi tionthat these patent mills produce products their only output is paper of highly threatening sort28 still other commentators suggest that the patent system often converts pioneering inventors into technological suppressors who use their patents to block subsequent improvements and thereby impede technical progress29 the wright brothers for example patented method for stabilizing flight by warping the wings of an aircraft30 their patent covered any system that varied the lateral margins of the wings in opposite directions soon thereafter glenn curtiss and alexander graham bell improved upon the wright brothers wingwarping device by using set of wing flaps or ailerons although the curtissbell invention was separately patented

result in the infringement of the wright brothers patent some commentators believe that the wright brothers employed their patent to block use of the curtissbell improvement invention to the detriment of the development of the us aviation industry31 when analyzing these contending views it is important to note the lack of rigorous analytical methods available for analyzing the effect of the patent law upon the us economy as whole the relationship between innovation and patent rights remains poorly understood concerned observers simply do not know what market impacts would result from changing patent term from its current twentyyear period for example32 as result current economic and policy tools do not allow us to calibrate the patent system precisely in order to produce an optimal level of investment in innovation legal fundamentals as mandated by the patent act of 195233 us patent rights do not arise automatically inventors must prepare and submit applications to the us patent and trademark office if they wish to obtain patent protection34 uspto officials known as examiners then assess whether the application merits the award of patent35 the patent acquisition process is commonly known as prosecution36 in deciding whether to approve patent application uspto examiner will consider whether the submitted application fully discloses and distinctly claims the invention37 in addition the application must disclose the best mode or preferred way that the applicant knows to practice the invention38 the examiner will also determine whether the invention itself fulfills certain substantive standards set by the patent statute to be patentable an invention must be useful novel and nonobvious the requirement of usefulness or utility is satisfied if the invention is operable and provides tangible benefit39 to be judged novel the invention must not be fully anticipated by prior patent publication or other knowledge within the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs7 4035 usc 102 4135 usc 103 4235 usc 271a 4335 usc 282 44ibid 4535 usc 303a 4635 usc 154a2 although patent term is based upon the filing date the patentee gains enforceable legal rights until the uspto allows the application to issue as granted patent number of patent act provisions may modify the basic 20year term including examination delays at the uspto and delays in obtaining marketing approval for the patented invention from other federal agenciesdomain40 nonobvious invention must not have been readily within the ordinary skills of competent artisan at the time the invention was made41 if the uspto allows the patent to issue the patent proprietor obtains the right to exclude others from making using selling offering to sell or importing into the united states the patented invention42 patent title therefore provides inventors with limited periods of exclusivity in which they may practice their inventions or license others to do so the grant of patent permits the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resources leading to the discovery often by charging higher price than would prevail in competitive market patent rights are not selfenforcing patentee bears responsibility for monitoring its competitors to determine whether they are using the patented invention or not patent proprietors who wish to compel others to observe their intellectual property rights must usually commence litigation in the federal courts an accused infringer may contend that the asserted patent is invalid43 such an argument asserts that the uspto improvidently granted the patent however by virtue of having been approved by the uspto each issue patent enjoys presumption of validity accused infringers bear the burden of proving that patent is invalid by clear and convincing evidence44 interested parties possess another mechanism for challenging the validity of an issued patent they may request that the uspto commence an administrative revocation proceeding termed reexamination in order to provoke reexamination an individual must present the uspto with one or more pertinent patents and printed publications if the uspto agrees that these references raise substantial new question of patentability45 the agency will subject the patent to renewed prosecution in light of this additional information the maximum term of patent protection is ordinarily set at 20 years from the date the application is filed46 the patent applicant gains enforceable rights until such time as the application is approved for issuance as granted patent however once the patent expires others may employ the patented invention without compensation to the patenteehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs8 47see supra note 7 48sherwin supra note 7 49see alfred b engelberg special patent provisions for pharmaceuticals have they outlived their usefulness 39 idea journal of law and technology 1999 389competing perspectives upon the goal of patent quality the community of patent professionals has engaged in dialogue over the desirability of high levels of patent quality the traditional and probably most widely held view is that the uspto should strive to maintain consistently high levels of patent quality two opposing views have arisen in response to this traditional view howeve r one challenge is suggested by the coase theorem staple of scholars within the law and economics movement the second is the fundamental economic principle of rational ignorance this report next reviews these three concepts traditional views government industry academia and the patent bar alike have long insisted that the uspto approve only those patent applications that describe and claim patentable advance47 because they meet all the requirements imposed by the patent act quality patents may be dependably enforced in court and employed as technology transfer tool such patents are said to confirm private rights by making their proprietary uses and therefore their value more predictable quality patents also may clarify the extent that others may approach the protected invention without infringing these traits in turn should strengthen the incentives of private actors to engage in valuemaximizing activities such as innovation or commercial transactions48 in contrast poor patent quality is said to hold deleterious consequences large numbers of inappropriately granted patents may negatively impact entrepreneurs for example innovative firms may be approached by an individual with low quality patent that appears to cover the product they are marketing the innovative firm may recognize that the cost of challeng ing patent even of dubious validity may be considerable therefore the firm may choose to make payments under licensing arrangements or perhaps decide not to market its product at all rather than contest the patent proprietors claims some enterprises have also been accused of creating patent thickets or clusters of closely related patents that cover different aspects of particular technology for example drug company may own suite of patents covering not just the pharmaceutical compound but also various formulations chemical intermediates metabolites and methods of manufacturing and using the pharmaceutical some enterprises have been said to cause followon patents to issue as earlier patents are set to expire resulting in an evergreening portfolio that effectively extends patent term beyond the twentyyear statutory period49httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs9 50robert p merges as many as six

granted patents are also believed to create duplicative transactions costs for example if the patent quality is low private parties must engage in extensive due diligence efforts in order to assess whether individual issued patents are enforceable or not the result may be that the innovative community must consistently conduct their own private patent examinations revisiting the work of the uspto to see if it was done properly poor patent quality may also encourage activity that is not socially productive perhaps attracted by large damages awards and potentially porous uspto rent seeking entrepreneurs may be attracted to form speculative patent acquisition and enforcement ventures industry participants may also be forced to expend considerable sums on patent acquisition and enforcement50 the net results would be reduced rates of innovation decreased patentbased transactions and higher prices for goods and services poor patent quality may also negatively impact market capitalization and other investment decisions the stock market valuation of firm may depend in part upon its patent position an episode that suggests this relationship occurred on march 14 2000 when in response to the completion of phase i of the human genome project president bill clinton and uk prime minister tony blair issued joint statement urging that raw fundamental data on the human genome should be made freely available to scientists everywhere51 number of biotechnology companies lost substantial percentage of their market capitalization as investors sold shares in record numbers52 among these enterprises were human genome sciences inc which fell 25 on the day on the announcement and incyte pharmaceuticals inc which fell 3053 the chief concern of many sellers was that biotechnology patent rights would be weakened or subject to uncertainty54 the uspto responded by issuing press release on march 16 2000 explaining that us patent policy was unaffected by the joint statement as the impact of the clintonblair announcement was better understood the stock prices of many biotechnology enterprises rose55 to the extent that venture capitalists and other individuals rely upon firms patent position when making investment decisions poor quality suggests that patents may be unreliable measures of valuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs10 56see craig allen nard

783although low patent quality appears to affect both investors and competitors of patentee patent proprietors themselves may also be negatively impacted patent owners may make managerial decisions such as whether to build production facilities or sell product based upon their expectation of exclusive rights in particular invention if their patent is declared invalid by the uspto or court the patentee will be stripped of exclusive rights without compensation the issuance of large numbers of invalid patents would increase the possibility that the investmentbacked expectations of patentees become unsettled56 in sum the traditional view is that patent quality matters under this perspective the improvident issuance of patents brings many social costs inventors may possess diminished incentives to innovate and disclose their innovations venture capitalists may be hindered by unreliable innovation indicators when making investment decisions and markets may be restricted due to costly diligence efforts that suppress transactions in contrast high quality patents are said to contribute to the incentives of private parties to innovate invest in the inventions that underlie their technological properties and disclose their inventions to others without fear of opportunistic behavior the coase theorem in contrast to the traditional view of patent quality the coase theorem offers different perspective upon the worth of high levels of patent quality the coase theorem provides that when bargaining costs are zero the initial assignment of legal entitlements does not affect the efficiency of the resulting allocation of resources57 ronald coase who was awarded the 1991 nobel prize in economics introduced this concept in 1960 in his article the problem of social cost58 the implication of the coase theorem is that in the absence of transaction costs legal rules do not affect individuals economic behavior59 an example illustrates the logic of the coase theorem suppose that the use of machinery is worth 100 to manufacturer but because it generates great deal of smoke its operation causes 90 in injury to neighboring homeowner the efficient allocation of resources calls for continued operation of the manufacturers equipment for this creates 100 in value at cost of only 90 if the manufacturer was forced to stop using her machines the collective wealth of the two parties would be 10 less the social cost would also be 10 for society as whole would be 10 poorer httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs11 60daniel q posin the coase theorem through glass darkly 61 tennessee law review 1994 797the coase theorem says that the efficient outcome continued operation of the manufacturers equipment will result whether or not the manufacturer is held liable under nuisance law or not if the manufacturer is liable he will be willing to bargain with the homeowner to continue operating the machinery if for example the manufacturer pays the homeowner 95 both the manufacturer and the homeowner will be 5 better off if the manufacturer is not liable the homeowner will be willing to pay the manufacturer only 90 to stop using the machinery but the manufacturer will be unwilling to accept anything less than 100 once again the manufacturer will continue operating the machinery in this example the implication of the coase theorem is that the assignment of legal liability to the manufacturer will not determine whether the manufacture may use his machines or not forces of supply and demand dictate that the machinery will run whatever the legal determination the parties will bargain to achieve the same efficient result to continue this hypothetical observe that the parties will not reach an optimal result if the costs of communication and bargaining exceed 10 such costs are commonly known as transaction costs if the manufacturer is found liable and transaction costs are 15 the manufacturer must pay the homeowner at least 90 plus the 15 in transaction costs before the homeowner will agree to permit the machinery to operate but the manufacturer is unwilling to pay more than 100 bargain can be reached and the presence of transaction costs will lead to social losses the coase theorem by its own terms involves world where transactions may be completed without cost nevertheless it is regarded as offering insights into making legal decisions in real world in which substantial transaction costs exist one such insight is that if transaction costs are low private markets will achieve the optimal resource allocation regardless of any entitlements assigned by the law some commentators suggest that acceptance of the coase theorem permits decision makers to spend less resources on difficult valueladen questions of deciding how to assign legal entitlements and instead merely attempt to reduce marketplace transaction costs60 applied to the patent law the coase theorem suggests that low patent quality does not detract from efficient operation of markets stated in the manner of the coase theorem the allocation of initial entitlements of patent rights between rival inventors is irrelevant to reaching economically efficient outcomes suppose for example that company can produce patented product more cheaply than company b if company b holds patent then the parties can be expected to negotiate an assignment or license absent nontrivial transaction costs private bargaining will inevitably transfer company bs patent to company an entity that more highly values the asset alternatively if company owns the patent or if patent exists then company can market its product without negotiating licensehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs12 61robert p merges of property rules coase and intellectual property 94

the parties individual wealth varies depending upon who owns the patent in either case company as superior product will reach the market61 the principle of rational ignorance second challenge to the traditional goal of patent quality comes from the principle of rational ignorance this principle recognizes that obtaining information can be costly undertaking an individual may spend more resources acquiring certain information than the benefits that information will provide when the cost of acquiring information exceeds the benefits to be derived from the information it is rational to remain ignorant62 suppose for example that surgeon may command fees of 300 per hour from the perspective of costbenefit analysis the surgeon would not wisely spend an hour clipping grocery coupons from newspaper for benefit of saving perhaps 10 from his grocery bill such surgeon is rationally ignorant about opportunities to save money from local grocers mark lemley member of the university of california at berkeley law faculty has recently applied the rational ignorance principle to the issue of patent quality lemley asserts that the uspto wisely spends little time and effort examining individual applications63 lemleys initial observation is that only about 5 of issued patents are subject to litigation or licensing as result money spent improving uspto examination procedures is in lemleys view largely wasted on the large majority of patents that will never be used lemley reasons that society is better off making searching inquiry of the prior art only in those few cases where patent is licensed or litigated lemley therefore concludes that the uspto has rationally chosen to be lenient when deciding whether or not to allow particular patent applications to issue because the cost of making rigorous validity determin ations for each patent application exceeds the benefits according to lemley resourceintensive efforts to improve patent quality would be unwise lemley advises that the innovative community should resign itself to the fact that invalid patents will issue and allow the federal judiciary to deal with them during enforcement

aligning incentives for rd investment with incentives to disclose prior art 2 washington university journal of law and policy 2000 23 6535 usc 102an assessment of challenges to traditional notions of patent quality acceptance of one of these three views of patent quality holds consequences for patent administration maintenance of the traditional view indicates that the uspto should take steps to ensure that each patent it issues marks patentable advance over the prior art if there is perceived shortcoming in patent quality the uspto should take more ambitious steps to improve the rigor of its patent examination procedures64 in contrast acceptance of the coase theorem or rational ignorance principle suggests that the uspto should not be overly concerned with patent quality but instead process patent applications as quickly as possible in keeping with the coase theorem and rational ignorance principle the uspto might choose to suspend substantive patent examination wherein examine rs consider whether the claimed invention meets core patentability requirements such as novelty and nonobviousness and instead simply register each filed patent application further if reforms of the patent system are considered at all the coase theorem and rational ignorance principle suggest that they be directed towards increasing the efficiency of litigating and licensing of those patents that prove commercially valuable each of these three accounts of patent quality may deserve further consideration however the traditional view of patent quality may be theoretically sound but difficult to achieve in practice the contrast of the coase theorem and rational ignorance principle with the prevailing wisdom of the patent community as well as their profound implications for patent administration suggests that they may not so easily translate into the patent system this report next considers the limits of these concepts as applied to the regime of patents assessing traditional views of patent quality the practical achievability of the traditional concept of patent quality should be considered in light of the demands that congress has placed upon the uspto through the patent statute section 102 of the patent statute defines the prior art pertinent to each application information meeting the requirements of this provision must be contrasted with the claimed invention in order to decide the issues of novelty and nonobviousness section 102 is long provision that is not easily susceptible to summary however its prior art definition generally includes all patents and printed publications available anywhere as well as technology known or on sale within the united states65 these references must have been available either prior to the time the invention was made or more than one year before the inventor filed an application athttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs14 6635 usc 102e 67thomas supra note 4 68ibid 69ibid 70sabra chartrand new patent office has old goal new

prior art however which need not have been publicly accessible at all66 the 102 prior art definition is quite broad every book journal article leaflet and student thesis published anywhere in the world in any language potentially serves as prior art other permissible sources of prior art such as sales offers or knowledge need not have been formally documented at all67 the difficulties inherent in obtaining organizing and analyzing these diverse sources of prior art should be apparent68 as result the decision that the uspto should maintain persistently high quality levels for all issued patents may therefore not be light one to make the uspto likely does not have ready access to all the information that is statutorily pertinent to patentability accessing this information may be costly and in many cases may not be practical the uspto also appears to face number of practical difficulties that make the goal of high patent quality hard to fulfill wellpublicized budgetary policies have diverted funds from the uspto to other governmental functions resulting in decrease in the hiring and training of examiners69 although the uspto currently employs approximately 3000 examiners it claims to need to hire 700 more during the year 2002 the resources associated with training this cohort of neophyte patent examiners may be considerable the uspto has also experienced difficulty in retaining its examiners boom in the intellectual property profession resulted in situation where trained examiners with several years of experience could find higherpaying jobs in the private sector in the year 2000 attrition among examiners was 14 percent some uspto initiatives to raise salaries have resulted in some decreases to the attrition rate70 according to some observers the allowance of patents on business methods has also exposed the uspto to many new disciplines in which it has scant examining experience71 traditionally the patent system was combined to inventions from the sciences and engineering however recent judicial decisions have opened the patent system to virtually any innovative advance as result the uspto must deal with application in disciplines such as finance marketing architecture and education72 inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs15 73ibid 74chartrand supra note 70 75ibid 76ibid 77see chulho jung et the coase theorem in rentseeking society 15 international review of law and economics 1995 259 78see lemley supra note 63these disciplines new to the patent system the uspto may have few competent examiners and little documentation of the state of the art73 patent applications have also become more difficult to process reflecting the increasing sophistication of technological advance uspto director james rogan remarked that one patent application was recently filed with 12 cds the equivalent of six million pages of data the expertise and time required for the uspto to process such an application would appear to be considerable74 as well the number of filed patent applications has increased dramatically in recent years in 2000 the uspto received nearly 312000 applications 75 percent more than the 178000 received in 199175 this surge in applications has led some commentators to suggest that the capabilities of the uspto are becoming more strained76 in sum although the goal of consistently high levels of patent quality may be sound one it may be very difficult to achieve the patent statute makes an enormous amount of information pertinent to the patentability of each application however not all of this of this information is readily availability to uspto examiners the uspto also arguably faces challenging operating environment in terms of its budget personnel and workload the maintenance of higher levels of patent quality than are currently observed may require additional resource expenditures or improved grant procedures at the uspto assessing the coase theorem several points of distinction also distance the coase theorem from the realities of the contemporary patent system first the coase theorem presumes that interested parties passively accept the rights and responsibilities given to them by the legislature and courts returning to an earlier hypothetical for example the manufacturer and homeowner simply accept the tort law of nuisance as it exists neither party expends resources encouraging legislature or court to establish or amend the nuisance law77 this presumption stands in high relief to the workings of the patent system inventors and patent attorneys devote substantial resources recently estimated at over 4 billion annually towards obtaining rights allocations from the uspto78 each week thousands of patents issue and thousands more patent applications are filed these high initial resource expenditures present substantially different starting point than the coase theorems presumption that entitlements are costlessly received ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs16 79merges supra note 61resource expenditures associated with patent acquisition are accounted for it may be more difficult for interested parties to achieve efficient results through coasian bargaining another difficulty in translating the coase theorem into the patent system is that the coase theorem is more concerned with maximizing overall social utility rather than with ensuring just distribution of resources the coase theorem explains that total output in an economy is unaffected by the initial allocation of rights to continue the earlier example of the manufacturer and the homeowner in the absence of transaction costs the parties will bargain to produce the same outcome regardless of whether the manufacturer is liable in tort to the homeowner or not however although the coase theorem does not expressly state this the determination of the manufacturers liability will decide whether wealth is transferred between the parties if the manufacturer would be liable to the homeowner then the homeowner will have more money after the bargain is struck79 the coasian indifference to resource distribution does not appear to match well with patent law that allocates property rights to inventors rather than infringers that parties will bargain to the efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of patent rights is beside the point the patent law grants property rights to individuals in order to stimulate them to invent to disclose their inventions and to license their technological properties to others unlike the coase theorem it matters in the patent law whether or not the actual inventor of particular technology will receive proprietary interest third point of departure between the coase theorem and the modern patent system is that coasian bargaining assumes that the parties will equitably divide rather than dispute the cooperative surplus to be gained through their bargaining recalling the earlier example the manufacturer and the homeowner will supposedly agree to split the difference between the value to the manufacturer of running smoke producing machines and the harm to the homemaker although this bargaining may succeed with regard to smoke particles the parties may have more difficult time achieving consensus with regard to the intangible properties awarded by the patent law in the patent law there is smoky soot or other tangible marker of the infringement of the property right inventors often work at different times and places and the prior inventions of others may be unknowingly incorporated into subsequent products as result the bargaining parties may disagree about whether and to what degree the prior work added to the value of the subsequent one prior creations may be minor inputs that are subsequently incorporated into larger product or they may take on form similar to common predecessor technology in the case of patented inventions an infringer may have way of knowing that her own independent invention is an infringement or that at the time she makes her investment decisions that pertinent patent even exists experience suggests that patent proprietors and accused infringers often disagree about whether the latter party employs the patented invention at all not to mention its value relative to prior art knowledge these factorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs17 80ibid 81see byrns stone supra note 62 82lemley supra note 63 83ibidat the least suggest very high transactions costs that will often defeat coasian bargaining80 these three distinctions suggest that the coase theorem lacks significant explanatory power within the context of the patent system many differences may exist between the assumption built into the coase theorem and the contemporary realities of the patent law as result the coase theorem does not appear to have gained acceptance within the intellectual property community assessing the principle of rational ignorance the rational ignorance principle too may possess shortcomings when applied to the patent system first the rational ignorance principle assumes that the decision maker when deciding whether to obtain additional information or not knows that he will bear responsibility for that choice81 to return to an earlier example the surgeon decides not to clip coupons knowing that he could pay less at the grocer in contrast to the surgeon the uspto bears responsibility for allowing an invalid patent to issue courts do not fine the uspto upon invalidating patent the examiners who allowed the case are not disciplined for their oversight nor must the uspto compensate affected members of the public for an improvident grant the costs of not acquiring information are simply shifted to other actors in particular the federal courts the patentees competitors and ultimately consumers under these circumstances the threshold under which the uspto becomes rationally ignorant is extremely slight yet just because the ustpo acts rationally given its own role and resources does not necessarily imply that the patent acquisition regime as whole acts efficiently the theory of rational ignorance also makes the most sense for the patent system if the rate of patent usage is believed to be very low for example lemley estimates that only about 15 of issued patents are litigated with an additional 35 being licensed82 lemley further observes that the patent act requires patentees to pay maintenance fees during the term of the patent if the patentee does not pay the appropriate fee in timely fashion the patent will expire in lemleys view the fact that few patentees pay maintenance fees sufficient to sustain the patent through its maximum twentyyear term suggests that the great majority of patents lack commercial value83 other research suggests higher patent usage rates than surmised by lemley however even where these patents are not maintained for their maximum life study conducted by economist ove granstrand member of the faculty of the chalmers university of technology in sweden reveals robust rates of commercialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs18 84ove granstrand the economics and management of intellectual property 1999 165 85see

swedish firms605 381 49 114 216 the grandstrand study suggests that many patented inventions may have commercial significance even though the proprietor chooses not to pay maintenance fees that would allow the corresponding patent to endure for its maximum term in considering this data the fact that patent maintenance fees are increasingly costly as the patent ages may be significant85 also the product cycles in some industries such as computer software and electronics tend to be far shorter than the maximum twentyyear patent term86 another survey conducted by professor ron westrum and businessman ed zimmer concluded that the prospects of independent inventors making patentbased profits were comparable to the overall success rates of small businesses87 the westrum and zimmer study found that 34 of patented inventions were profitable this study also suggests that for independent inventors many more patented inventions achieve marketplace successes finally use of the rational ignorance principle also depends upon comparison of the costs and benefits of high patent quality there may be good reason to believe that the cost of intellectual property compliance is considerable within the united states to the extent that improvidently granted patents are among those intellectual properties that firms must respect such patents may add considerably to the cost of doing business in the united states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs19 88w mark crain thomas d hopkins the impact of regulatory costs on small firms available at httpwwwsbagovadvoresearchrs207totpdfone benchmark consists of the 843 billion americans spent on compliance with federal regulations in 2000 this sum is equal to 8 percent of the us gross domestic product and amounts to 8164 per household it does not account for benefits obtained from that regulation recent small business administration study found that companies with 20 workers or less face an annual regulatory toll of 6975 per employee88 great deal of this regulation is embodied within the daily federal register the 2000 federal register consisted of 83000 pages of regulations proposed rules notices executive orders proclamations and other presidential documents eightythree thousand pages of regulatio ns is large number but it is considerably smaller than the number of pages of patents that issue in the year 2000 the uspto issued 175983 patents this number works out to 3350 patents in each uspto official gazette which together comprise approximately 40000 pages per week in sum the uspto issues roughly as many pages of regulations in fortnight as the rest of the federal government publishes within the federal register in year in light of the high costs of complying with federal regulation there is ample reason to believe that the costs of complying with uspto work product may be substantial even if the percentage of improvidently granted patents is relatively small the size of the patent system is such that they may amount to an impressive amount of regulation although commentators such as lemley confine the costs of improvidently issued patents to the expense s associated with litigating patent enforcement charges such costs are likely much higher as with the coase theorem the principle of rational ignorance too may hold little prescriptive power in the context of patents rational ignorance arguably does poor job of describing the role of the uspto within the patent system further the costs of improvidently granted patents may be much higher than the litigation or licensing costs associated with some of them simply put once the costs of poor quality mount so does the value of assessing whether that patent should have been granted or not ignorance may longer be rational option concluding observations the uspto has traditionally counted among its goals as the achievement of consistently high levels of patent quality challenges founded upon the coase theorem and rational ignorance principle have cast some doubt upon this aspiration although each of these three accounts of patent quality has its merits and shortcomings it is difficult to assess quantitatively the optimal level of patent quality most apparent is that the ideal of patent quality is easy to articulate yet difficult to achieve in practice some legislation introduced before the 107th congress bears upon the patent quality issue hr 1333 the patent improvement act of 2001 would require patent applicants to disclose whether they completed prior art search in connection withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31281crs20 that application hr 1333 would also establish administrative patent revocation proceedings called oppositions oppositions would allow interested parties to contest an issued patent or pending patent application possibly providing the uspto with more salient data that could inform patentability determinations should congress further consider this issue there exists the possibility that uspto administrative practices could be reviewed with an eye towards their capability for maintaining high levels of patent quality within practical constraints congress may wish to consider whether patent examiners have appropriate resources and training that will allow them to conduct rigorous review of patent applications the responsibilities of patent applicants to contribute to quality patent examination might also be weighed finally congress might wish to assess the contributions members of the general public might make within an optimal patent examination regime subsequent report will proceed further with this analysis considering practical measures directed towards patent quality
