is and infrastructure protection the bts directorate along with the us coast guard is responsible for the first line of defense against terrorism nd for securing and managing the nations borders included in these responsibilitie s are the inspection investigative and enforcement operations of the former i mmigration and naturalization service ins which had been responsible for managing and coordinating the entry of people into the united states and for enforcing immigration laws dhs border and transportation security objectives also include fulfilling the newly expanded responsibilities of the tsa in protecting th nations transporta tion systems initially involving airline passenger s baggage and freight the customs function previously the re sponsibility of the department of the treasurys us customs service now so forms part of bts the customs functions administered by dhs in conj unction with the us coast guard are intended to effectively secure all commercial traffic entering the nations ports the directorate also assumes responsibility fo r inspecting and monitoring plants and animals entering the united states to minimize the risk that noxious pests and diseases will be introduced into the country the activities for which bts has assumed res ponsib ility are organized into three bureaus the bureau of customs and border protection cbp the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice and the transportation security agency tsa the inspection and border patrol functions of the legacy customs ins and animal and plant health inspection service aphis were merged into cbp the investigative and interior enfo rcement functions of the legacy customs and ins were merged within ice the federal protective service fps the federal law enforcement training center fletc and the office of domestic preparedness odp were also included under bts by the homeland security act subsequently the federal air marshals f ams have been transferred from tsa to ice the usvisit program has been transf erred from ice to be managed at the bts directorate level and odp has been reconf igured and renamed the office of state and local government coor dination and

security and interior enforcement and reform immigration processes enhance information shar ing with our partners improve dhs financial management human resources development procurement and information technology and realign the dhs organization to maximize mission performance specific new policy initiatives and pr oposed actions announced on july 13 by the secretary include several signifi cant bts changes including the proposed elimination of the bts directorate the secretary announced the creation of new directorate of policy subject to legisl ative approval whic h would among other things assume the policy c oordination responsibilities of th bts directorate the operational agencies that comprise bts c bp ice tsa would report directly to the secretary and deputy secretary of dhs through this reorganization dhs proposes to streamline the policy creation pr ocess and ensure that the departments policies and regulations are consistent acr oss the department in terms of immediate policy changes the secretary announ ced that the us visit program would be moving from the 2print fingerprinting standard to 10 print standard5 the federal air marshals fams program will be moved out of ice and back into tsa to increase operational coordination between all aviation security entities in the depa rtment regarding immigration the secretary stated that the dhs would be looking at restructuring the immigration process adding more personnel and technology to assist in gainin g control of the border specific details on the nature of these changes are not currently available however in terms of cargo and supply chain security the secretary announced new initiative called secure freight though few details are currently av ailable presumably this initiative builds upon the concepts explored under the advance trade data initiative atdi through secure freight cbp would seek to obtain additional cargo and supply chain data to supplement the data they curre ntly receive through the submission of advanced electronic cargo manifests secretary chertoff also called for increasinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33049crs5 the number of inspections carri ed out at foreign ports before cargo is loaded on us bound vessels increasing the speed of cargo inspections and for completing the deployment of radia tion portal monitors to the nations ports on july 22 2005 the administration so submitted revised budget request for dhs to reflect the organizational nd policy changes recommended by the 2sr the only change of relevance to the bts agencies identified in this report is the elimination of the office of the under s ecretary for bts the 10 million requested for this office in the original fy2006 budget submission would be distributed among several accounts in the depar tmental management and op erations bureau in dhs 13 million for resources management woul d move to the office of the chief financial officer 13 million for administra tion support and func tional integration would move to the office of the u nder secretary for management 20 million would move to the new preparedness dir ectorate for preparedness operations and 32 million would move to the office of the secretary and executive management for the policy office appropriations for border and transportation security march 1 2003 was the effective date fo r shifting most of the responsibilities from former departments and agencies to the new dhs while the transfer of functional lines of authority and the pe rsonnel to carry out those functions was relatively straightforward problems arose with the initial attempts to ascertain the exact amount of appropriated funds that were actually transferred to the new department comparisons of responsibilities and analyses of requests for increased budget authority proved difficult to develop this was due to the fact that the functions now performed by dhs were previously performed by predecessor agencies and that some of these functi ons often had nonhomeland security purposes prior to the creation of the department as result of this the funding lines between fy2003 and fy2004 were not identical to lin of functional responsibility before and after the transfer this reality in turn was exacerbated because the basic documentation of appr opriations in the presidents fy2004 budget was prepared after the formation of dhs but before fi nal enactment of ppropriations for the remainder of fy2003 however with th completion of appropriations for fy2004 baseline has been established making fu ture appropriations decisions more easily compared to the previous years levels it is too early to tell however what the just announced reorganization of th department will mean for next years appropriations cycle the distinction between bts functions and other functions funded through the same account lines is somewhat arbitrary our analysis in this report attempts to identify functional classification for border and transportation security this functional grouping includes th activities of the coast gu ard separate agency in dhs which is not part of th directorate for bts but which has an essential role in providing border and tran sportation security as those words are commonly understood additionally some functions contained in other accounts within dhs that are related to border and transportati on security such as those aspects of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33049crs6 6 identifying the exact dollar amount being spent on border and transportation security is not possible from the documentation available due to the fact that many of these distinctions occur at the subaccount level and are thus not identifiable science and technology account which are us ed to improve security are excluded from this table because that is not the ma in function of the account we also exclude the grant programs available to localities through the office for domestic preparedness and the office of state nd local government coordination and preparation despite the fact that some of these grants may be used to secure transportation assets because that is not n ecessarily the primary function of the grant programs and because they are not an operational component of border and transportation security within dhs the tables presented throughout this re port show an approximation of costs for border and transportation s ecurity based on identifying the accounts for which such security functions are the primary function involved they do not necessarily reflect dhs breakdowns as to estimated amounts specifically associated with the directorate for bts nor the absolute tota l of the funds being spent directly and indirectly on border and transporta tion security by the department6 t h

appropriation for fletc which is located in title iv fletc has b een included because it trains most of the law enforcement officers that are responsib for bts within dhs and compelling argument can

operational components of border and transportation security while most observers indicate the need for additional funding in the area of border and transportation security the issue for congress is to determine the appropriate funding vel in the context of the curren t budget situation and competing claims for resources the following secti ons of the report provi detail concerning the operational components of border and transportation security these include selected appropriations data issues of potential interest to the conferees and discussion of some of the challenges faci ng the different components of border and transportation security securing the nations borders and trans portation systems includes the regulation of imports and exports enforcement of laws pertaining to immigration and visitation borderrelated inspection of ag riculture and livestock oversight of the security of ports federal inspection of airline passe ngers and baggage ach ieving operational control over the international borders be tween ports of entry and establishing comprehensive approaches to improving overall transportation security including securing infrastructure such as roads and railways some observers might question the exclusion of the bureau of citizenship and immigration services uscis from the discussion of border nd transportation security there is question that homeland security is enhanced by the well managed administration of routine immigration services however such services would continue to be provided even in absence of any threats to the homeland because these i mmigration activities would continue in any event including the cost of these activities in this analysis would distort the true summary costs of bor der and transportation security for this reason we include the enforcement of immigration laws but not the provision of immigration services within the purview of this report table 3 provides acc ount leve l details for the various

key differe nces between hr 2360 and the presidents request regarding aviation s ecurity funding for private screening contracts at airports is 65 million less th an the requested level the house

less than the housepassed bill unlike the budget request and the housepassed bill the senate language contains specific cap on the number of screeners but like the house bill increases funding for screening technologies in move to rapidly shift away from workfor ceintensive use of resources the senate bill endeavors to do this in part by in creasing the tsas flexibility to transfer monies from screener workforce account s to accounts for procuring screening equipment the senate bill w ould provide 180 million for eds and etd procurement with the stipulation that at least 50 million be used for acquiring next generation eds equipment the senatepassed bill make s more modest reductions in the budget request for airport management staff information technology and support recommending 748

fo r us transit and intercity rail systems were defeated during senate floor debate tsa issues for congress the presidents proposal to increase airline passenger security fees has been contenti ous issue financially strapped airlines still recovering from the economic impact of the 911 attacks and now facing rising fuel costs argue that they will likely have to absorb some of the cost of these fee increases by reducing ticket prices50 some members of c ongress have also voiced concern that the proposed fee increase could cut into the revenues of the airlines and could have greater impact on rural air line customers who w ould pay proportionately more in persegment fees because fewer direct flights are available to these customers51 the administration on the other hand argues that increased fees could help reduce funding deficit by generating additional revenue to offset expenditures for aviation security or could free up gene ral tax revenues for spending on broader homeland security needs the administrati on also contends that increasing fees to offset costs is in line with longstanding transportation infrastructure policy to fund these services largely through user fees as well as its assessment of the original intent of these passenger security fe established under atsa pl 1077152 however some opponents of av iation security fees contend that aviation security particularly since september 11 2001 is vital to national s ecurity and therefore like defense spending is the responsibility of all taxpayers the house committee on appropriations noted that amending the statutory fee structure falls under the jurisdiction of the homeland security committee and did not include the proposed fee increases in its bill an amendmen t to the fy2006 dhs authorization act hr 1817 prohibiting an increase in airline ticke t taxes for aviation security was agreed to by large majority in the house despite opposition by aviation subcommittee chairman john mica while the sena committee also did not recommend any passenger fee increases language in srept 10983 directs the tsa to use its available authority to collect about 448 million from aviation security infrastructure fees paid directly by the airlines this is the amount determined by gao audit that tsa should be collecting annually howe ver the tsa has been collecting only about 318 million in these fees despite ssuming that collections would total 750 million for fy2005 thus creating project ed shortfall of more than 400 million while both the house and the senate ve indicated support in report language for investment in advanced screening tec hnologies and practices to decrease the need for screeners particularly baggage screeners only the house went along with the administrations request to formally keep in place an identified cap of 45000 fte screeners the principal means for reducin g screener requirement s identified by both the house and the senate is investment in inline

recen t gao testimony highlighted the potential benefits of investing in inline eds in stallation concluding that the federal government could realize return on inves tment in terms of ope rational costs savings in little more than year at airports with existing letterofintent agreements in place with the tsa and the overall savings to the federal government from inline eds installations would be about 1 billion over seven years53 both the house and the senate bills seek to increase funding fo r the purchase of explosives detection equipment with the house approving an additional 40 million and the senate approving 50 million more than th requested level of 130 million both the house and the senate expre ssed concerns over the administrations progress in air cargo security the house agreed to 20 million above the 40 million requested while the nate agreed to 10 million more than the requested level the house also formally recommended pilot programs in air cargo screening and like the senate provided for hiring additional regulatory inspectors and increased oversight of cargo security another key issue for the tsa is the proposed creation of sco with the proposed transfer of progra ms related to credentialing and vetting of passengers and transportation workers seve ral potential issues regard ing coordination of effort between the tsa and the proposed sco aris the administration has offered few details regarding how the proposed sco would interface with the tsa on several highprofile programs such as secure flight and the twic program citing concerns over disrupting work on these key progra ms the house language has taken different tack that would integrate these va rious programs but keep them within the tsa under new office of transportation vetting and credentia ling the senate also favored plan merging vetting and credentialing programs but retaining them under the direction of the tsa another potential issue that may aris during the appropriations process is coordination between tsa and st in light of the proposal to transfer the tsas research and development activities one particular issue would be how aviation security research needs will be prioritized given that st is more broadly focused on all homeland security research and development activities there may be some concern that aviation security projects could take back seat to other highprofile initiatives such as nuclear biological and chemical weapon countermeasures that have been the primary focus of st to date also while consolidating research and development on explosives and chemical weapons detection the primary focus of aviation securityrelated research and development may help leverage resources for other dhs components th projects could potentially lose some of the aviation securityspecific focus that they currently have under the auspices of the tsahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33049crs39 54 further information and analysis of trans portation security

and st will be established under the pr oposed transfer to ensure that aviation security research and developmen t needs are adequately addressed54 the house committee on appropriations has proposed to task the st directorate with carrying out air cargo research and development pilot programs initiated by the tsa but expressed frustration over the lack of progress in this area commenting that high unobligated balances give the imp ression that the tsa does not view air cargo as serious aviation security vulnerability55 consequently the committee directed the tsa to devel op protocols and standards fo r emerging new technologies to screen cargo noting past deployment delays because such coordination was lacking appropriations to the tsa for surface transportation modes raise the issue of determining tsas role and in broader context the fe deral governments role in the security of the nonaviation modes of transportation while atsa made tsa responsible for the security of all modes of transportation it did not direct the tsa to take specific actions to address security needs in m odes other than aviation one view is that the federal government nd tsa in particular should assume more dominant or at least more prominent role in the security of surface modes proponents of this view hold that the fede ral government should f und most of the security needs of surface modes another view is that the federal role in securing surface modes should reflect or parallel its existing role in financing the infrastructure or operations of surface modes this view holds that federal funding for the security needs of surface modes shoul d be in partnership with state and local governments or the private sector for instance because freight railways are predominantly privately owned and finance d some believe that the freight railroad companies should pay for their security need s likewise in the case of mass transit in which state and local governments have primary responsibility for infrastructure financing and operations some believe the federal governments role in securing mass transit should be in partnership with state and local governments rather than having dominant role as it does in aviation us coast guard the coast guard uscg is the lead fe deral agency for the maritime component of homeland security as such it is the l ead agency responsible

that reflects revised post september 11 mission requirements senatepa ssed hr 2360 provides 906 million for deepwater and the senate committees report states that it is extremely disappointed with the

the deepwater program will help the uscg achieve its many missions including maritime security which is another uscg issue of keen interest to congress th presidents fy2006 request includes 22194 million for port waterways and coastal s ecurity an increase of 1279 million from fy2005 maritime domain awa reness mda is central element of the uscgs security mission mda can be described as the uscgs ability to know all that is happening in the maritime environment to understand normal activity in order to spot suspicious activity one objective of mda is to increase the transparency of ship movements in us coastal areas using automatic identification systems ais technology the uscg expects to be able to track ships in coastal waters for fy2006 the president requested 291 million for ais which is 51 million more than congress provided in fy2005 in fy2005 congress expre ssed disappointment that only nine seaports would be able to receive ais signals and therefore increased funding from the requested 5 million to 24 million to achieve nationwide coverage the presidents fy2006 request indicates th at nationwide impleme ntation of ais is the administrations objective another area of maritime security that congress has expressed particular interest in is the security of liquefied natura l gas lng tankers the presidents fy2006 request includes 11 million for additional boat crews

consist of approximately 100 active duty and reserve personnel that provide surge presence at specific ports in response to terrorist threats or incidents in support of special events to protect

provides additional funds for ais noting that this program has significant unobligated funds from prior years nonhomeland security missions key issue is whether the uscgs resources are adequate to perform bot h its maritime secur ity and nonsecurity missions the terrorist attacks of sept ember 11 2001 increased uscg requirements for homeland security missions without obviously reducing the requirements for other missions after september 11 2001 the uscg significantly increased homeland security operations while reducing operations in other missions gao in reports and testimony on this topic not ed reduced number of uscg operating hours devoted to nonsecurity missions for fy2006 the president requested the following amounts for the uscgs nonsecurity missions 15898 million for maritime safety an increase of 635 million over fy2005 12576 million for maritime mobility an increase of 534 millionover fy2005 and 13853 million for marine environmental protection an increaseof 1463 million over fy2005 58 efficient and effective resource allocation while congress is concerned with whether the uscg has sufficient resources to fulfill its multiple missions since september 11 2001 the uscgs budget has increased substantially which raises the issue of whether the agency has the systems in place to make the best use of these additional resources gao has concluded that the agency needs to be able to better track how its personnel spend their time as well as establish clearer link between where resources are spent nd what results are achieved the house appropriations
