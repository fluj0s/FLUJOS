products rates and revenues louis alan talley specialist in taxation government and finance division summary this report examines increases in excise tax rates on tobacco products contained in the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 under that act the increased rates on tobacco products became effective in two stages the first scheduled increase in rates occurred on january 1 2000 while the second increase in rates occurred two years later on january 1 2002 the increased rates apply to all tobacco products in addition the act included new excise tax on rollyourown tobacco which became effective january 1 2000 also included in the act were expanded compliance measures designed to ensure collections of tobacco excise tax monies as result of payments made by tobacco companies under the master settlement agreement and the resulting increase in the cost of tobacco products tobacco consumption declined thus projected federal tobacco revenues have declined somewhat when compared to prior revenue estimates made at the time of the balanced budget acts passage this report will be updated as legislative developments warrant tax rates the federal tax rate on cigarettes remained unchanged at 8 cents per pack from 1951 to 19821 since 1982 the rate has been increased by three federal tax acts the rate was increased to 16 cents per pack as part of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 pl 97248 in the general explanation of the revenue provisions of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 the joint committee on taxation indicated that the reason for this increase was that inflation had caused the effective level of the tax to decline by more than 70 in constant dollars because the tax was imposed as set 1 for more detailed legislative history see crs report 94474 federal excise taxes on tobacco products summary of present law and legislative history by thomas b ripy and mildred c washington congressional research service the library of congress crs2 amount rather than as percentage of sales price the doubling of the tax rate did not increase the perpack tax in real terms above the 1951 level also congress felt that the broadbased increase in revenue required by the fiscal outlook through 1985 mandated an increase in the cigarette excise taxes next the rates were increased in two stages under the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 pl 101508 one half of the increase 4 cents per pack took effect on january 1 1991 with the second half an additional 4 cents in effect as of january 1 1993 thus the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 raised the rates from 16 cents per pack to 24 cents per pack the rates were increased because of large continuing federal budget deficits and the need for additional federal revenues the most recent increase in federal excise tax rates on tobacco products occurred in the balanced budget act of 1997 pl 10533 like the increases provided under the revenue reconciliation act of 1990 the tax rates on all tobacco products increased in two stages the rates first increased on january 1 2000 the final increase in rates occurred on january 1 2002 in the case of cigarettes the first stage increased rates by 10 cents pack to 34 cents in the second stage the rates increased an additional 5 cents pack to make the federal excise tax 39 cents per pack in addition the act established tax rate for rollyourown tobacco which is now in effect table 1 provides details on the rate increases imposed on all tobacco products for the period 1990 to 20022 revenues the actual revenue yield from federal tobacco excise taxes remained relatively stable during the 1990s after the statutory rate increase in 1993 the revenue yield jumped from just over 5 billion in fy1992 to 5875 billion in fy1993 fiscal year revenues over the 1993 to 1996 time period have ranged from low of 5691 billion to high of 5878 billion the joint committee on taxation estimated that the balanced budget act of 1997s increase in tobacco tax rates would increase revenues beginning in fy2000 the increased rate is effective for ninemonth period during that fiscal year at the time of the balanced budget act of 1997s enactment the joint committee estimated that additional revenues of 1175 billion would be collected in fy2000 due to the first part of the rate increase further the committee estimated that the increased rates would result in more than 2 billion in additional annual revenue by fy2002 as indicated earlier these projections were made prior to the tobacco master settlement agreement detailed breakdown of actual and estimated tobacco tax receipts is provided in table 2 which appears on the final page of this report 2 as originally enacted increased revenue collections were to be credited against the total payments to be made under the tobacco industry settlement agreement however this provision was repealed under section 519 of the fy1998 appropriations for labor

agreement between the states the district of columbia us territories and the tobacco industry had not been signed as result of the master settlement agreement tobacco companies have raised prices number of times so as to raise revenues with which to make the annual payments totaling 2045 billion through 2025 in apparent response to the increase in price projected tobacco consumption has declined thus the joint committees revenue estimates for tobacco receipts would be lower if made under current conditions more recent projected federal tobacco tax estimates prepared by the treasury department are shown in the final column of table 2 which appears on the final page of this report the projected revenues in the budget documents have also been revised downward tobacco excise taxes are paid into the general fund of the us treasury there continues to be direct relationship between federal tobacco excise tax collections and any particular federal program in those cases where other excise taxes are directly linked with spending programs as through trust funds there is usually relationship between the taxed products and program financed by the funding such as the gasoline and diesel fuel excise taxes and the highway trust fund in some cases excise taxes may be imposed in situations where those actually responsible for damages cannot be held directly accountable such as the 01 cent excise tax on gasoline used for cleaning up underground leaking storage tanks in those cases taxes are levied on current production of product associated with causing the damages that the government program is trying to rectify crs5 table 2 tobacco excise tax estimates and actual revenue receipts revenue amounts in billions tobacco excise tax joint tax tobacco excise tax revenues
