was remanded for further proceedings regarding the question of risk bragdon v abbott has been heralded as significant decision advancing the rights of individuals who have asym ptomatic hiv infection it also has broader implications on the ada coverage of reproductive disab ilities this report will not be updated background in 1994 dr bragdon performed dental ex amination on ms bbott and discovered cavity ms abbott had indicated on her registration form that she was hiv positive at that time she was asymptomatic dr brag don told her that he would not fill her cavity in his office but would treat her only in hospital setting this would have resulted in higher costs for ms abbott since although dr bragdon would have charged his regular fee she would have had to have paid the hospital costs ms abbott did not find this acceptable and filed complaint under the ada broad civil rights statute that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities she prevailed at the district court and court of appeals leve ls and at the supreme court on the issue of whether she was an individual with disability but the case was remanded for further consideration regarding the issue of direct threat httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98599crs2 1for more detailed discussi on of the ada see jone s the americans with disabilities act ada an overview of major provisions and issues crs rep

disabilities in empl oyment public services public accommodation and services operated by private entities transportation and telecommunication1 the ada states that the term disability means with respect to an individuala physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individuals b record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment2 although discrimination against such individuals is prohibited in places of public accommodations such as doctors offices3 there are some limitations on the reach of this nondiscrimina tion requirement the most significant of these limitations with regard to the issues presented by bragdon is the exception for situations that pose direct threat to the health or safety of others the term direct threat is defined in the statute as significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by modification of policies practices or pro cedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services4 it was created in an attempt to differentiate leg itimate public health concerns from prejudicial stereotypes supreme courts decision the supreme court held that ms abbo tts asymptomatic hiv infection was physical impairment impacting on the major lif activity of reproduc tion thus rendering the hiv infection disability under the ada in addition the court held that when interpreting the ada courts should assess the objective reas onableness of the views of health care professionals by looking to the vi ews of public health authorities but that these views could be rebutted by citing credible scientific basis for deviating from the accepted norm and remanded bragdon for further consideration on this issue these holdings were reached in 5 to 4 decision w ith justice kennedy writing for the majority justices stevens and breyer joined in c oncurring opinion and justice ginsberg filed separate concurring opinion chief justice rehnquist joined by justices scalia and thomas filed an opinion concurring in part nd dissenting in part justice oconnor filed separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part definition of individual with disability writing for the majority justice kennedy began by examining the issue of whether asymptomatic hiv infection constitutes disability under the ada parsing th statutory language and finding that ms abbott was covered under subsec tion having physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities in reaching this holding justice kennedy used the following analytic framework first determining whether ms abbotts hiv infection was physical impairment s econd determining the life activity affected and whether it constituted major life activity nd third determining whether thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98599crs3 5section 504 of the rehabilitation 29 usc 794 prohibits discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance the executive agencies or the us postal service section 504 and its regulations served as model for the ada which expande d these protections to entities that did not receive federal funds 642 usc 1212b3impairment substantially limited the major life activity he then noted that the adas definition was drawn almost verbatim from the definition of handicapped individual included in the rehabilitation act and that the ada specifically states that the ada shall not be construed to pply lesser standard than th standards applied under title v of the rehabilitation act and its regulations5 the first question justice kennedy examined was whether ms abbotts asymptomatic hiv infection constituted physical impairment after detailed clinical discussion of hiv infection justice kennedy concluded that in light of the immediacy with which the virus begins to damage th infected persons white blood cells and the severity of the disease we hold it is an imp airment from the moment of infection next justice kennedy turned to the issue of whether the physical impairment affected major life activity ms abbott had argued that he r hiv infection placed substantial limitation on her ability to reproduce and to bear childre n and justice kennedy had little difficulty concluding that reproduction was major life activity ce reproduction and the sexual dynamics surrounding it are central to the life process itself the ada was found not to be limited to the aspects of persons life which have pub lic economic or daily character the breadth of the term major confounds the attempt to limit its construction in this manner the final issue regarding the definition of individual with disability was whether ms abbotts physical impairment was substantial limitation on the major life activity of reproduction after an evaluation of the medical evidence jus tice kennedy concluded that ms abbotts ability to reproduce was substantially limited in two ways 1 an attempt to conceive would impose signifi cant risk on ms abbotts partner and 2 an hiv infected woman risks infecting her child during gestation and childbirth justice kennedy found that the reasoning us ed above to find that asymptomatic hiv infection was physical impairment that placed substantial limitation on major life activity was confirmed by consistent agency and judicial interpretation he noted that every agency to consider the issue under the rehabilitation act f ound statutory coverage for persons with asymptomatic hiv the gislative history of the ada which cited the section 504 interpretati ons was also seen as buttressing the courts conclusion in addition the administrative guidance issu ed for the ada was found to indicate that asymptomatic hiv infec tion should be covered direct threat exception the other major issue addressed by the court in bragdon involved the interpretation of the adas di rect threat exception even with the finding that ms abbott was an individual with disability dr bragdon could have refused to treat her or insisted on treatin g her in different setting if her condition posed direct threat to th health or safety of others6 direct threat is defined in the ada as significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated byhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98599crs4 7id 8the cdc guidelines recommend certain univers precautions but do not assess the level of risk the american dental association polic on hiv is not that of public health authority and justice kennedy observed that it was not clear the extent to which the policy was based on an assessment of ethical and professional duties and the extent to which the policy was based on scientific assessment of the risk modification of policies practices or pro cedures or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services7 after examining the courts decision in school board of nassau county v arline 480 us 273 1987 justice kennedy termined that the existence or nonexistence of significant risk must be determined from the standpoint of the person who refuses the treatment or accommodation nd the risk assessment must be based on medical or other objective evidence dr bragdon had the duty to assess the risk of infection based on the objective scientific information available to him and others in his profession his belief that significant risk existed even if maintained in good faith would not relieve him from liability thus there was special deference accorded to dr bragdon because of his professional status the question remained as to how to determine if dr bragdons actions were reasonable justice kennedy observed that in assessing the reasonableness of petitioners actions the views of public health authorities such as the us public health service cdc and the national institutes of health are of special weight and authority however justice kennedy found that the vi ews of these entities were not necessarily determinative and could be refuted by citing credible scientific basis for differing from the accepted norm the court of appeals determination of this issue was examined and found to have placed mistake n reliance on the cdc dentistry guidelines and the 1991 american dental association policy on hiv8 the supreme court remanded the case for further consideration on this issue we conc lude that the proper course is to give the court of appeals the opportunity to determine whether our analysis of some of the studies cited by the parties would change its conclusion that petitioner presented neither objective evidence nor triable issue of fact on the question of risk concurring opinions two concurring opinions we re filed one by justice stevens who was joined by justice breyer and one by justice ginsburg justice stevens wrote that he would have preferred an out right affirmance of the court of appeals decision but joined with justice kennedy to provide majority opinion justice ginsburg agreed with the majority and stated that rational legislator it seems to apparent would require nondiscrimination once sy mptoms become visible but permit discrimination when the disease t hough present is not yet visible dissenting opinions chief justice rehnquist join ed by justices scalia and thomas dissented in part and concurred in part he disse nted from the majority finding that ms abbott had failed to demonstrate that any of her major life activities were substantially limited by her hiv infection first it was noted that the issue of whether reproduction is major life activ ity should be answered with regard to the individual in question and he further observed that ther was evidence that absent the hiv infection ms abbott would have had or considered having children second the chief justice found that re production was not major life activity since reproduction is not essential in the daytoday existence of normally functioning individual and even ifhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98599crs5 9see eg krauel v iowa methodist medical center 95 f3d 694 8th cir 1996finding that the ability to reproduce is not major life activityreproduction was major life ac tivity the dissent found that asymptomatic hiv infection does not substantially limit that activity the chief justice concurred in the remand on the direct threat issue but disagreed with th majority with regard to its conclusion that the views of public health officials are entitled to special weight he observed that the credentials of the scientists employed by the public health authority and the soundness of their studies must stand on their own justice oconnor wrote separate opinion disse nting in part and concurring in part she agreed with the dissenting opinion of th chief justice that ms abbotts claim of disability should be evaluated on an indivi dualized basis and that ms abbott did not prove that her asymptomatic hiv infection substantially limited one or more of her major life activities justice oconnor also agreed with the decision to remand on the direct threat issue implications bragdon has implications for other legal issu beyond its basic holding that ms abbotts asymptomatic hiv infection is di sability under the ada prior to the courts decision the courts of appeal had been sp lit on the issue of whet her reproduction is major life activity9 in arriving at its holding the court specifically found that reproduction was major life activ ity thus resolving this issue in addition the courts holding that asymptomatic hiv infection is covered under the ada would appear to indicate that other asymptom atic conditions may also be covered for example in ryan v grae rybicki pc 135 f3d 867 2d cir 1998 the second circuit held that woman with ulcerative colitis was not an individual with disability since she was asymptomatic most of the time however the majoritys language regarding the immediacy with which the virus begins to damage the infected persons white blood cells may create standard which might not be met by ll asymptomatic conditions the court also provided framework for future analysis of issues involving the first prong of the definition of disability first court is to determin whether condition is physical impairment second the life activity ffected and whether this is major life activity are to be determined and third determination shall be made concerning whether the impairment substantially limits the major life activity the supreme court remanded the case to the first circuit for further consideration of the issue of what constitutes direct threat under the ada although the majority found that there was special deferen ce accorded to dr bragdon because of his professional status the questi on of how to determine if hi s actions were reasonable was less clear the decision of the first circuit on remand will be signif icant in determining this issue
