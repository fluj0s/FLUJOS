cc kbriffaueaacukjtouarizonaedudrdendroldeocolumbiaedu keithalversonpagesunibechmmaccraccomcastnetjtouarizonaedu mannvirginiaedu thanks phil tom congrats again the soon baliunas paper couldnt have cleared legitimate peer review process anywhere that leaves only one possibilitythat the peerreview process at climate research has been hijacked by few skeptics on the editorial board and it isnt just frietas unfortunately i think this group also includes member of my own department the skeptics appear to have staged coup at climate research it was mediocre journal to begin with but now its mediocre journal with definite purpose folks might want to check out the editors and review editors 1httpwwwintrescomjournalscrcreditorshtml in fact mike mccracken first pointed out this article to and he and i have discussed this bit ive ccd mike in on this as well and ive included peck too i told mike that i believed our only choice was to ignore this paper theyve already achieved what they wantedthe claim of peerreviewed paper there is nothing we can do about that now but the last thing we want to do is bring attention to this paper which will be ignored by the community on the whole it is pretty clear that thee skeptics here have staged bit of coup even in the presence of number of reasonable folks on the editorial board whetton goodess my guess is that von storch is actually with them frankly hes an odd individual and im not sure he isnt himself somewhat of skeptic himself and without von storch on their side they would have very forceful personality promoting their new vision there have been several papers by pat michaels as well as the soon baliunas paper that couldnt get published in reputable journal this was the danger of always criticising the skeptics for not publishing in the peerreviewed literature obviously they found solution to thattake over journal so what do we do about this i think we have to stop considering climate research as legitimate peerreviewed journal perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to longer submit to or cite papers in this journal we would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board what do others think mike at 0849 am 3112003 0000 phil jones wrote dear all apologies for sending this again i was expecting stack of emails this morning in response but i inadvertently left mike off mistake in pasting and picked up toms old address tom is busy though with another offspring i looked briefly at the paper last night and it is appalling worst word i can think of today without the mood pepper appearing on the email ill have time to read more at the weekend as im coming to the us for the doe ccpp meeting at charleston added ed peck and keith onto this list as well i would like to have time to rise to the bait but i have so much else on at the moment as few of us will be at the egsagu meet in nice we should consider what to do there the phrasing of the questions at the start of the paper determine the answer they get they have idea what multiproxy averaging does by their logic i could argue 1998 wasnt the warmest year globally because it wasnt the warmest everywhere with their lia being 1300 1900 and their mwp 8001300 there appears at my quick first reading discussion of synchroneity of the coolwarm periods even with the instrumental record the early and late 20th century warming periods are only significant locally at between 1020 of grid boxes writing this i am becoming more convinced we should do something even if this is just to state once and for all what we mean by the lia and mwp i think the skeptics will use this paper to their own ends and it will set paleo back number of years if it goes unchallenged i will be emailing the journal to tell them im having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor cru person is on the editorial board but papers get dealt with by the editor assigned by hans von storch cheers phil dear all tim osborn has just come across this best to ignore probably so dont let it spoil your day ive not looked at it yet it results from this journal having number of editors the responsible one for this is wellknown skeptic in nz he has let few papers through by michaels and gray in the past ive had words with hans von storch about this but got nowhere another thing to discuss in nice cheers phil xsender f055popueaacuk xmailer qualcomm windows eudora version 51 date mon 10 mar 2003
