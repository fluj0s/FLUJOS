immigrants ie legal permanent residents lprs were eligible for federal public assistance under terms comparable to citizens and states were not permitted to restrict access to federal programs on the basis of immigration status the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 pl 104193 the original law authorizing the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program dramatically changed noncitizen eligibility for public assistance it restricted the eligibility of lprs refugees asylees and other noncitizens for all meanstested public aid aliens in the united states without authorization commonly referred to as illegal aliens remained ineligible for federal public assistance as congress considers the reauthorization of the welfare reform law the issue of state options to restrict or expand assistance to immigrants arises the 1996 welfare reform act gave states several options of placing further restrictions on noncitizen eligibility or of expanding benefits to noncitizens lprs who entered the united states after august 22 1996 are barred from tanf for five years after which their coverage becomes state option this fiveyear bar however does not apply to lprs who entered the united states as refugees and asylees refugees and asylees who meet the other program criteria are eligible for tanf for the first five years they are in the united states after this period of time refugees and asylees are only eligible for tanf at state option many states have been exercising one or more of these options to extend coverage to certain classes of lprs as of december 2002 34 states reported that they are exercising the option to provide tanf to lprs after the fiveyear bar ends thirtyfive states reported that they have exercised the option to provide tanf to lprs present in the united states before august 1996 furthermore 34 states reported that they provide tanf to asylees and refugees who were residing in the united states at the time of the welfare reform acts passage in 1996 only 27 states however reported that they provide tanf to asylees and refugees who have surpassed the fiveyear limit for tanf in terms of funding 27 states and washington dc reported that they used their own funds as well as federal funds in 2000 and 2002 to cover the costs of providing tanf to those lprs who were in the united states prior to the passage of the 1996 welfare reform act an important source of funding for state assistance to noncitizens comes from the tanf maintenance of effort moe requirement in 2002 17 states reported using their state moe money to provide public assistance to newly arriving lprs who are barred from federal tanf for the first five years six states reported using their state moe money in 2002 to provide tanf to lprs

eligibility for major public assistance programs is an ongoing issue in congress1 prior to 1996 legal permanent residents lprs were eligible for federal public assistance under terms comparable to citizens and states were not permitted to restrict access to federal programs on the basis of immigration status the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of 1996 pl 104193 the original law authorizing the temporary assistance for needy families tanf program dramatically changed noncitizen eligibility for public assistance it restricted the eligibility of lprs refugees asylees and other noncitizens for meanstested public aid these provisions ranged from categorical eligibility bars to new rules governing aliens with sponsors and their sponsors responsibilities2 aliens in the united states without authorization commonly referred to as illegal aliens remained ineligible federal public assistance although the federal government retains exclusive responsibility for immigration policy federal law now permits states to differentiate among types of noncitizens when setting welfare policy the 1996 welfare reform act gave states several options of placing further restrictions on noncitizen eligibility it also gave them options of expanding benefits to noncitizens3 as congress considers the 1 for full discussion of this debate see crs report rl31114 noncitizen eligibility for major federal public assistance programs policies and legislation by ruth ellen wasem 2 see crs report rs21470 noncitizen eligibility for major federal public assistance programs legal concepts by alison smith 3 noncitizen is synonymous with alien and refers to all foreignborn persons in the united states who have not become citizens the two basic types of legal aliens are immigrants and nonimmigrants immigrants are admitted as legal permanent residents lprs of the united states nonimmigrants such as tourists foreign students and diplomats are admitted for specific purpose and temporary period of time illegal aliens or unauthorized aliens are those noncitizens who either entered the united states surreptitiously ie entered without inspection or who violated the terms of their nonimmigrant visas see crs report rs20916 immigration and naturalization fundamentals by ruth ellen wasem crs2 reauthorization of the welfare reform law the issue of state options to restrict or expand assistance to noncitzens arises after outlining the options states have to cover noncitzens under tanf and presenting data on the number of lprs in each state this report studies whether and which states have exercised these options regarding noncitizen eligibility for tanf it investigates how states are funding the assistance provided to noncitizens and also analyzes tanf receipt by state current federal eligibility policy under current law noncitizens eligibility for tanf largely depends on their immigration status and whether they arrived or were on programs rolls before august 22 1996 the enactment date of pl 104193 the tanf eligibility policies laid out by the 1996 welfare reform act remain essentially unchanged for noncitizens entering after its enactment the basic federal rules are as follows4 lprs who entered the united states after august 22 1996 are barred from tanf for five years after which their coverage becomes state option5 lprs with substantial work history generally 10 years 40 quarters of work documented by social security or other employment records or military connection active duty military personnel veterans and their families are eligible for tanf refugees and asylees are eligible for tanf for five years after entering the united states6 after this fiveyear term refugees and asylees may be eligible at state option for tanf7 4 crs report rl31114 noncitizen eligibility for major federal public assistance programs policies and legislation by ruth ellen wasem lays out these rules in more detail including special rules that apply to several limited noncitizen categories certain crossborder american indians hmonghighland laotians parolees and conditional entrants and cases of abuse 5 this fiveyear ban on eligibility for new entrants also applies to program closely related to the medicaid program the state childrens health insurance program schip it is the only categorical noncitizen eligibility rule affecting schip 6 refugeeasylee treatment is accorded to cubanhaitian entrants certain aliens whose deportationremoval is withheld for humanitarian purposes vietnamborn amerasians fathered by us citizens and victims of human trafficking for those aliens who arrive in the united states without one of these forms of humanitarian relief the fiveyear period begins after the date the aliens receive the status 7 refugees are admitted from abroad after it is determined that they would be persecuted or have wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion asylees are aliens physically present in the united states who if returned to their country of origin would be persecuted or have wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion crs3 nonimmigrants eg temporary alien residents and unauthorized aliens ie illegal aliens are barred from tanf as they were barred from its predecessor aid for families with dependent children legal permanent residents by state the state residential patterns of the almost 145 million aliens who became lprs in the united states from fy1988 through fy2002 provide gauge of the relative effect of these policies across the states although substantial number of people who are currently lprs came to the united states before 1988 many others who came prior to 1988 have become us citizens all lprs are eligible to become citizens through the naturalization process after they have lived here for five years as lprs three years in the case of spouses of us citizens8 estimates of the naturalization rate range from 30 to 49 and the median number of years between becoming an lpr and naturalizing as us citizen varies from eight to 10 years for those who opt to naturalize9 immigrants are concentrated in several states indeed over half of all new lprs from fy1988 through fy2002 indicated that they intended to live in just three states california new york and texas10 as table 1 presents california dominates with 4561693 new lprs which is 315 of all new lprs during this period new york follows with 2001439 new lprs 138 interestingly both california and new york had slightly smaller percentage of all new lprs during the 19972002 period 261 and 128 respectively than during 19881996 period 344 and 143 respectively suggesting somewhat wider dispersion of new lprs to other states almost 80 of all new lprs reported their intended state of residence in one of 10 states california new york texas florida illinois new jersey massachusetts virginia washington and maryland the only other states with more than 1 of all new lprs reporting intended residence are pennsylvania michigan arizona georgia connecticut and ohio 8 to naturalize under us immigration law all lprs must also show that they have good moral character demonstrate the ability to read write speak and understand english and pass an examination on us government and history 9 see us department of homeland security 2002 yearbook of immigration statistics gpo 2003 and crs report 95298

stamps medicaid except emergency medical assistance and the social services block grant lprs ineligible for tanf however may receive statefunded benefits if they meet other program requirements after five years the decision as to whether lprs may participate in tanf as well as medicaid and the social services block grant rests with the states many states as discussed below offer public assistance to lprs not eligible for federally financed benefits the fiveyear bar discussed previously does not apply to refugees and asylees refugees and asylees who meet the other program criteria are eligible

likely to have expanded statelevel tanf policies for noncitizens as well as have greater percentage of their caseload who were noncitizens there were however some exceptions as noted above the level of immigrant enrollment in assistance programs is affected by the restrictions imposed under the 1996 welfare reform law by states choices to extend or deny coverage when given the option and to some degree by individuals perception of their eligibility status and their election to participate or not among the public at large confusion remains over what classes of noncitizens are eligible for which programs in part because the 1996 welfare law used the phrase qualified alien not term in immigration law that encompasses variety of classes of noncitizens who must meet additional specified conditions moreover despite narrowly drawn regulations from the former immigration and naturalization service now the us citizenship and immigration services in the department of homeland security on what constitutes public charge many believe that receiving public benefits may adversely affect noncitizens immigration status or potential to sponsor immigration petitions for family members these factors may be inhibiting participation among eligible immigrants for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32363
