adversary intelligence systems determine indicators adversary intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries select and execute measures that liminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities or friendly actions to adversary exploitation 4 specific threats to bds u u opsec deals with the dev elopment of countermeasures to protect information and to eliminate and minimize indi cators it is important to understand that opsec deals mainly with unclassified sensitive cpi t hat when brought together and analyzed could reveal classified information to potential adv ersaries or deny mission accomplishment u the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction wmd continues at least 20 nations maintain or have the capability to develop biological weapons biological weapons bw are an asymmetric counter balance to us sophisticated precision guided weapons and force protection capability state run wmd is serious threat to the us in addition th programs are potential source for terrorists to acquire and employ biological weapons and cbrn hazards against both continental united states conus and outside conus oconus installations and facilities unclassified 8 unclassified u bw agents pose unique challenges because they are relatively easy to produce difficult to detect and their production facilitie s have unique signature the potential lethality of biol ogical versus chemical agents by weight and relative low costs make bw agents an attractive alternative effectiv dissemination can be achieved using readily available commercial technologies such as agric ultural or industrial sprayers threat biological agents include bacterial viruses and toxins jpm bds will use the current itf 6 category agent list for the det ermination of bw agent threat 5 other threats to bds u u the worldwide intelligence collection threat is multidisciplined highly sophisticated and extremely dedicated intelligence collecti on efforts may use only one discipline or combination of disciplines to obtain info rmation opsec is not replacement for traditional security programs nor is it m anagement tool for these programs rather it integrates their efforts and t hus ensures essential secrecy as new threat data is received distribution shall be made to bds personnel and others as appropriate 51 human intelligence u u human intelligence humint is the di scipline of intelligence collection in which humans serve both as collectors and sources of information they may reveal their own knowledge of sensitive proj ect or provide documentation to which they have access as result of being in position of trust u most humint collectors do not fit the image of the spy rather they may be students businessmen and attendees at confer ences or seminars or even tourists seemingly innocent relations with forei gn nationals have turned into espionage recruitment situations initially unwitting to the recruitment process and ulterior motives of the case officer individuals may be conv inced to provide unclassified information and then coerced or enticed with cash to provide more valuable information unclassified 9 unclassified u humint is collected primarily to antic ipate military application of technological advancements and to foster scientific mech anical and industrial support of the collectors military and st rategic forces humint against the bds may include intelligence agents assigned to target and develop contacts with dod and contractor personnel associated with the bds foreign visitors with ulterior moti ves for collecting technical knowledge and information concerning the bds professional conferences or sym posia providing opportunities for adversaries to elicit and exploit personnel associated with the bds engineers and scientists who are attendi ng the conferences or symposia as covert representative of an adversary typically accomplish exploitation collection efforts ma range from innocuous questions to outright blackmail attemp ts without constant awareness of the threat bds personnel may inadvertently release sensitive information employee disaffection although internal in nature poses threat to the bds theft malicious alternations of data sabotage espionage and destruction of critical equipment and materials could cause serious damage to the bds terrorism carried out by militant dom estic or foreign groups poses constant threat to military or contractor personnel equipment and operations u the humint element poses significant threat to sensitive functions of any program the threat is considered to be c ontinuous applicable to all bds activities and functions which could be conducted in an ov ert or covert manner vulnerabilities susceptible to collection include disclosure of sensitive technology transfer applications in technical publications magazines newspapers or other media available to the general public unclassified 10 unclassified dissemination of classified or uncla ssified test results to personnel without the needtoknow failure to truly evaluate the classification or sensitivity of information that would exempt it from release under the foia failure to follow published security guidance or regulations in the physical handling and storage of classified components inadvertent disclosure of classified or unclassified sensitive information 52 opensource intelligence u u opensource intelligence osint is discipline of intelligence collection where collectors use verbal written or electronically transmitted ma terial that can be legally acquired the very best source of technica l data is opensource information more than 90 percent of all information gathered by typi cal foreign intelligence effort about the us and its activities is derived from open sources it includes the acquisition of newspapers magazines journals as well as monitoring broadcasts on commercial and public radio and television u opensource literature s upplies adversaries most of their intelligence requirements through the systematic collecti on and analysis of informati on available to the general public such information is commonly obtained through newspapers the national technical information center the defense technical information center meetings and seminars and through contractor advertisements these sources provide adversary analyses centers with highly valuable informati on regarding capabilitie s limitations and technical performances of our systems u studying the journals in fields ch as chemistry physics engineering mathematics optics et c can provide valuable insight into the level of sophistication country has in particular field examining articles written for ope nsource journals by scientist known to be associated with that institute can gather information about the activities in particular research institut this can provide indicators to ongoing developments that perhaps ar being applied to bds hardw are or software the unclassified 11 unclassified frequency with which researchers publish may prov ide insight into the formation of new research groups and the application of the re search to future components sudden end of published reports may indicate transi tion from basic to applied research and new component the internet is major resource for osint collectors so extreme caution should be given to this resource for osint indicators 53 signals intelligence u u signals intelligence sigint is intelligence derived from the interception processing and analysis of signals s ubsets of sigint incl ude communications intelligence comint electronic intelligenc elint and foreign instrumentation signals intelligence fisint u sigint embraces all forms of radi ating equipment including communications telemetry and microwave primar sigint target is the microwave telecommunications system the unsecur ed telephone all bds personnel will be made aware during security awareness traini ng that the majority of all telephone conversations are transmitted by microw ave and are vulnerable to interception and exploitation unless protected by the use of secure telephone unitsecure telephone equipment stuste in the secure mode u comint one of the primary sigint disci plines includes information derived from intercepted communications transmission including voice facsimile and dialin computer access lines interception of microwave transmission is possible by anyone with adequate receiving equipment the ta rgeting of email and telephone or fax transmissions is of importance to the bds to collect telephone transmissions voice and fax dial number recognition is us ed numbers known to be associated with organizations or locations of interest are aut omatically collected both for content and to monitor the volume of calls which are indica tors of actual or pending activity sigint can be collected from satellites fixed ground stations ships off the coastline aircraft flying overhead and from as close as van parked in nearby lot in addition to gleaning intelligence adversary operatives also monitor communi cations to exploit unclassified 12 unclassified specific personal information that could be used to blackmail bds personnel into committing acts of espionage or sabotage u current technology has produced situation in which telephones in the cradle onhook position may frequently transmit room conversation occurring in the vicinity of the telephone the telephone handset may act as microphone that can pick up and transmit room electronic signals and voice this may be the result of accidental or intended modification or because of design c haracteristic of the telephone instrument or its associated equipment 54 imagery intelligence u u imagery intelligence imint is intelligen ce derived from the co llection processing and analysis of images across the entire optic spectrum including photo satellites commercial and private aircraft handheld photography of documents components areas etc and unauthorized use of copying duplicating or video equipment imint can be collected from platforms on land ai r sea and space while imint agents still provide valuable imagery with handheld cameras the primary imint collection platforms are satellites and aircraft 55 intelligence collection threats to the bds u u there is consensus within the u s intelligence community that almost all dod exercises and operations are faced with intell igence collection thr eats the defense security services publication technology collection trends in the u s defense industry 2004 identifies that information systems is remain the most sought after military critical technology with sensors second only to lase rs as the most frequently reported technology with fo reign collection efforts 6 classified information u unclassified 13 unclassified u bds has an established system of contro l measures which assure that access to classified information is limited to authorized persons the system includes technical physical and personnel control measures u information that is cl assified is often restricted in its dissemination based on the need to know in order to have access to classified information one must have both the appropriate clearance level and the need toknow proper saf eguarding of handling classified information can be found in the spom the following definitions describe the seriousness of both intentional and inadvertent disclosure if released to the public secret the second highest classification information is classified secret when its release would cause significant damage to national security confidential is the lowest classification level it is defined as information which would cause damage to national security if disclosed 61 special considerations aggregation of data u u aggregation of data is the compilation of unclassified individual data systems and data elements resulting in the totality or order in which the information is displayed being classified it is important to reem phasize that aggregation of data is one of the primary focal points of the jpm bdss prot ection methodology for example when an installations specific critical missions ar compiled in their entirety and the missions and critical infrastructure are prioritized th is list becomes classified secret an approved unclassified list would be list in priority order beginning with the most critical and ending with the least essential but not labeled as such and would include building facility unclassified mission and po c information for the facility 7 for official use only information u u for official use only fouo is designation that is applied to unclassified information that may be exempt from m andatory release to the public under the unclassified 14 unclassified freedom of information act foia the f oia specifies nine exemptions which may qualify certain information to be withheld from rel ease to the public if by its disclosure foreseeable harm would occur they are 1 information which is curr ently and properly classified 2 information that pertains solely to the internal rules and practices of the agency this exemption has two profile s high and low the high profile permits withholding of document that if released would allow circumvention of an agency rule policy or statute thereby impeding the agency in the conduct of its mission the low profile permits withholding if there is public interest in the document and it would be an administrative burden to process the request 3 information specifically exempted by statute establishing particular criteria for withholding the language of the statute must clearly state that the information will not be disclosed 4 information such as trade secret s and commercial or financial information obtained from company on privileged or confidential basis that if released would result in competit ive harm to the company impair the governments ability to obtain like informa tion in the future or protect the governments interest in complia nce with program effectiveness 5 interagency memoranda that are deliber ative in nature this exemption is appropriate for internal documents that are part of the decision making process and contain subjective evaluations opinions and recommendations 6 information the release of wh ich could reasonably be expected to constitute clearly unwarranted in vasion of the personal privacy of individuals 7 records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes that could reasonably be expected to in terfere with law enforcement proceedings b would deprive person of right to fair trial or impartial adjudication c could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of others d disclose the unclassified 15 unclassified identity of confidential source disclose investigative techniques and procedures or f could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual 8 certain records of agencies respon sible for supervision of financial institutions 9 geological and geophysical info rmation concerning wells u information that is currently and proper ly classified can be withheld from mandatory release under the first exempt ion category for offici use only is applied to information that is ex empt under one of the other eight categories so by definition information must be unclassified in order to be designated fouo if an item of information is declassified it can be designat ed fouo if it qualifies under one of those other categories this means that 1 info rmation cannot be classified and fouo at the same time and 2 information that is decla ssified may be designated fouo but only if it fits into one of the last eight exemption categories categories 2 through 9 u the foia provides that for information to be exempt from mandatory release it must fit into one of the qualifying categories and there must be legitimate government purpose served by withholding it simply because information is marked fouo does not mean it automatically qualifies for exemption if request for record is received the information must be reviewed to see if it meets this dual tes t on the other hand the absence of the fouo marking does not aut omatically mean the information must be released some types of records for ex ample personnel records are not normally marked fouo but may still qualify for withholding under the foia 71 safeguarding fouo u u the

situations can be as significant as that presented by an adversary who may attempt to exploit personnel experiencing these problems 961 countermeasure u u bds personnel are continually trained to report suspicious behavior or potential security issues to jpm bds security and their management 10 opsec process u unclassified 30 unclassified u the opsec process focuses on the prot ection of information and operations from unauthorized disclosure of the bds to adversaries and others who do not have need to know for the information the process so helps prevent or reduce the inadvertent release of operational information to these same adversaries opsec is fivestep process that entails identification of cr itical information analysis of threats analysis of the vulnerabilities assessment of risks application of opsec measures 101 identification of critical information u u based on the bds and applicable scg jp m bds security manager will determine operational specific critical information to be surveyed this serves to focus the opsec process on protecting the vital information rather than attempting to protect all information 102 analysis of threats u u this involves the research and analysi s of reports and open source information to identify who the likely adversary could be questions to be asked are discussed in the following paragraphs 103 analysis of vulnerabilities u u this action identifies the bds operation vulnerabilities this requires examining the parts of the planned operation and identifying opsec indicators that could reveal critical information vulnerabilities exist when an adversary is capable of observing an opsec indicator correctly analyzing it and then taking appropriate and timely action unclassified 31 unclassified reviewing results of preparations workups to the oper ation such as sensor location will help identify vulnerabilities not readily apparent 104 assessment of risk u u this step essentially has two component s first planners analyze the identified vulnerabilities and then identify possible psec measures against them second specific opsec measures are selected fo r execution based on the risk assessment done by the bds security staff opsec measures can be used to prevent compromise to an opsec indicator intentional deviations from normal patterns and conversely providing sense of normality practicing sound information securi ty physical security and personnel security more than one opsec measure may be identified for each vulnerability and one opsec measure can be identifi ed for multiple vulnerabilities primary and secondary opsec measures can be identified for single or multiple opsec indicators opsec measures are most effect ive when they provide the maximum protection while minimally effe cting operational effectiveness u risk assessment involves comparing the estimated cost time effort resource allocation and money of implementing an opsec measure to the potential effects on mission accomplishment resulting from compro mise of particular vulnerability more than one opsec measure may be ident ified for each vulnerability and one opsec measure can be identified for multiple vulnerabilitie s primary and secondary opsec measures can be identified for single or multiple opsec indicators opsec measures are most effective when they provide the maximum protection while minimally effecting operational effectiveness unclassified 32 unclassified u risk assessment involves comparing the estimated cost time effort resource allocation and money of implementing an opsec measure to the potential effects on mission accomplishment resulting from compro mise of particular vulnerability u planning for opsec measures requires coordination amongst ll staff elements and supporting elements or assets outside the bd s particular care must be taken to ensure that opsec measures do not interfere with other operations solid staff functioning and planning will ensure opsec plans integr ate with and support other bases programs and operations 105 application of opsec measures u u in this step the bds security staf f implements the opsec measures selected in the previous step risk asse ssment planning and integrat ing opsec measures into the bds is critical to ensure counter measur are applied at the right time place and manner in addition to ongoing operations feedback provides information for opsec planning for future operations through lessons learned the opsec survey is an excellent method and tool for providing feedback on the effectiveness of opsec measures 11 opsec survey u u the opsec survey is an intensive application of the opsec process to our operation by multidisciplined team of experts the bds should tailor the survey to their specific requirements to begin the rvey critical information must be identified without critical information determinati on that vulnerabilities exist cannot happen the opsec survey determines if the critical information is being protected opsec surveys evaluate the opsec measures and if needed recommend changes to existing measures the survey can also identify r equirements for additional opsec measures the purpose of the opsec survey is to det ermine if adequate protection exists the survey will determine if critical information is being protected the critical information has to have been identified during the opsec process for this to happen the bds unclassified 33 unclassified security manager shall perform surveys on ll facilities to include subcontractors annually u opsec surveys differ from security inspections in that security inspections seek to ensure compliance with directives and regulat ions concerning classified or unclassified material and security of physical structures and facilities however survey teams should also ensure that security measures are not creating opsec indicators surveys are not to be used as punitive tool but should be conducted on nonattribution basis this will ensure better cooperation and honesty when surveying the bds activities plans and operations u results of opsec surveys should be giv to the bds program security manager all bds survey results shall be forwar ded to the jpm bds security manager u opsec surveys will be accomplished by formal survey an opsec survey is conducted by members within the jpm bds bd s
