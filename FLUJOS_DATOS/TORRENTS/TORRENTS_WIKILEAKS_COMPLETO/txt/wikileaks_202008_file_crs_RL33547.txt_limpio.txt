by senator judd gregg on june 15 2006 and ordered reported with an amendment by the senate budget committee on june 20 the bill consists of five titles covering variety of budget process reforms including providing the president legislative line item veto reinstituting statutory discretionary spending caps establishing maximum deficit amounts converting the annual budget cycle to biennial one establishing two commissions to examine federal government programs and making various other modifications to the congressional budget process according to senator gregg the purpose of the stop over spending act of 2006 is to at least put procedures in place to allow us as congress to begin to control spending1 this report provides brief summary of the major provisions of s 3521 title 1 legislative line item veto title i of s 3521 would create expedited procedures for the consideration of rescissions proposed by the president2 under existing law the impoundment control act of 1974 title x of pl 93344 2 usc 681691f the president may propose to rescind funding in an appropriations act and may withhold that funding from obligation for 45 days without any action by congress the rescission however may become permanent only by an act of congress if congress does not act on the presidents rescission proposal within 45 days the president must release the funds for obligation under the legislative line item veto included in s 3521 the president could propose to rescind funding in appropriations acts items of direct spending and targeted tax benefits within one year of their enactment he would be limited to four special messages proposing rescissions per calendar year there would be restrictions on the number and grouping of rescissions in each special message but the president would be prohibited from resubmitting rescission proposal rejected 1 for senator greggs full statement on the introduction of s 3521 see congressional record daily edition vol 152 june 15 2006 pp s5958s5961 2 for more detailed information on legislative line item veto proposals see 1 crs report rl33517 legislative line item veto act of 2006 background and comparison of versions by virginia mcmurtry and 2 crs report rl33365 line item veto constitutional analysis of recent proposals by morton rosenberg crs2 by congress under the senate budget committeereported amendment after submitting rescission proposal to congress the president could withhold funding in an appropriations act or suspend an item of direct spending or targeted tax benefit as proposed to be rescinded for up to 45 calendar days more significantly s 3521 would establish an expedited process to consider the presidents rescission proposals the new process would require congress to consider legislation containing the presidents rescission proposals within 10 days of its introduction under procedures limiting debate and prohibiting amendments under this proposal therefore congress would be required to vote on the presidents rescission package with opportunity to modify it title ii deficit reduction title ii of s 3521 would establish statutory discretionary spending3 limits and maximum deficit amounts both limits would be enforced by sequestration process by which spending in the amount of any violation of the discretionary spending limits or the maximum deficit amounts would be cancelled4 similar statutory limits enforced by sequestration were in place from fy1990 to fy2002 for discretionary spending and fy1985 to fy1990 for deficit targets5 3 discretionary spending is provided in and controlled by the annual appropriations acts 4 s 3521 provides that the sequestration procedures could be suspended in the event of period of low economic growth by congress enacting joint resolution suspending such procedures 5 the budget enforcement act of 1990 title xiii of pl 101508 omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1990 104 stat 13885731388630 which amended the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 title ii of pl 99177 commonly known as the grammrudmanhollings act first established statutory discretionary spending limits for fy19911995 the limits were modified and extended through fy1998 in 1993 title xiv of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1993 pl 10366 and extended through fy2002 in 1997 the budget enforcement act of 1997 title x of pl 10533 prior to the creation of the discretionary spending limits as well as the associated payasyougo paygo requirement for direct spending and revenue legislation the balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 1985 had established annual maximum deficit targets initially declining to zero by fy1991 and then revised in 1987 balanced budget and emergency deficit control reaffirmation act of 1987 pl 100119 101 stat 754788 to require balanced budget by fy1993 adjustable deficit targets remained in effect through fy1995 but they effectively were superseded by the other two enforcement mechanisms for background information on sequestration see 1 crs report rl31137 sequestration procedures under the 1985 balanced budget act by robert keith and 2 crs report rs20398 budget sequesters brief review by robert keith crs3 discretionary spending limits s 3521 would establish limits on discretionary new budget authority for fy2007 8725 billion fy2008 8954 billion and fy2009 9195 billion it also would require the president to recommend and congress to consider limits for fiscal years thereafter the legislation would allow for adjustments to these amounts for any spending designated by the president and congress as an emergency requirement but limits the adjustment by certain amount for each year6 the limits also could be adjusted for enhanced tax enforcement initiative spending but again limited by certain amount for each year7 the new discretionary spending caps would be enforced by sequestration as during the period covering fy1991fy2002 under the budget enforcement act the office of management and budget omb would be required to issue final sequestration report indicating any breach of the discretionary spending limit for the budget year 15 days after the end of session of congress if omb determined that the spending limit had been exceeded the president would be required to issue sequestration order cancelling budget authority in each discretionary spending account by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate the breach8 maximum deficit amounts s 3521 also would establish annual maximum deficit amounts expressed as percentage of gross domestic product gdp declining to 05 of gdp by fy20129 these maximum deficit amounts ultimately would be enforced by sequestration similar to the enforcement of the discretionary spending limits omb would be required to issue final sequestration report indicating any projected deficit for the budget year in excess of the applicable maximum deficit amount 15 days after the end of session of congress if omb determined that the projected deficit exceeded the maximum deficit amount the president would be required to issue 6 spending designated as an emergency requirement would be capped at 90 billion for fy2007 50 billion for fy2008 and 30 billion for fy2009 emergency spending has averaged about 96 billion over the past six fiscal years 20012006 which includes funding for the military activities in afghanistan and iraq crs calculation based on cbo data 7 the adjustment would be limited to 274 million for fy2007 414 million for fy2008 and 554 million for fy2009 8 along with this endofthesession sequestration withinsession sequestration could occur when an appropriation such as supplemental appropriation caused spending limit to be breached during fiscal year in this case sequestration would occur seven days after the enactment of the appropriation if violation of discretionary spending limit occurred in the last quarter of the fiscal year ie july 1 through september 30 the spending limit for the following fiscal year would be reduced by the amount of the violation 9 the legislation specifies the following annual maximum deficit amounts expressed as percentage of gdp 275 fy2007 225 fy2008 175 fy2009 125 fy2010 075 fy2011 and 05 fy2012 and each fiscal year thereafter the maximum deficit amounts would be calculated by omb presumably using the most recent estimates of gdp at the time omb issues its reports crs4 sequestration order cancelling budget authority in each nonexempt direct spending account by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate the excess deficit10 prior to such action however congress would have an opportunity to develop and consider reconciliation legislation under expedited procedures in response to an anticipated final sequestration report indicating an excess deficit on august 20 of each year omb would be required to issue reconciliation report indicating any projected deficit for the budget year in excess of the applicable maximum deficit amount on september 15 the budget committees would be required to issue reconciliation directive report specifying the projected excess deficit amount for the budget year the amount by which spending and revenues would need to be changed to eliminate the excess deficit and directives to committees to recommend changes in existing laws within their jurisdiction to eliminate the excess deficit11 the senate budget committeereported amendment would require the amount that each committee would be directed to save through legislative changes be proportionate to the amount of direct spending under their jurisdiction committees would be required to submit to their respective budget committees their legislative recommendations to meet their reconciliation directives later than 20 days after the directives had been issued the budget committees as with the existing reconciliation process then would package these recommendations into an omnibus reconciliation measure and report that measure to their parent chamber the reconciliation measure would be considered under expedited procedures that in particular limit debate and amendments in the senate and bar the inclusion of extraneous matter see section reconciliation process below title iii biennial budgeting and appropriations title iii would convert the current annual budgeting and appropriations process to biennial one12 specifically under this proposal in the first session or odd numbered year congress would develop and consider budget resolution setting forth sixyear budget plan the upcoming biennium plus the following four fiscal years regular appropriations measures each containing funding for two fiscal years and any reconciliation legislation in the second session or evennumbered year congress then would conduct oversight and consider authorization measures and any necessary supplemental appropriations bills 10 section 227 of s 3521 exempts from any sequestration order social security benefits tier i railroad retirement benefits and other specific accounts or activities that are not available for sequestration such as interest on the public debt claims against the united states and miscellaneous permanent appropriations for existing contracts 11 not later than 20 days after omb submits such report house and senate committees could submit information similar to that contained in their views and estimates to assist the budget committees in preparation of reconciliation directives reports 12 for further information on biennial budgeting see crs report rl30550 biennial budgeting issues and options by james v saturno crs5 among other aspects of converting the existing budget process to biennial one under the provisions of s 3521 congress would be required to complete action on the budget resolution by may 15 of each oddnumbered year instead of by april 15 of each year under existing law in addition s 3521 would create points of order in the house and senate against the consideration of any regular appropriations measure that contained funding for only the first fiscal year of biennium rather than both years unless funding is needed only for one year and any authorization legislation that did not authorize appropriations for at least two fiscal years finally as with the current enforcement of the budget resolution but reflecting the adoption of biennial budget the budget levels for each fiscal year of the biennium could be enforced through points of order during the consideration of budget legislation title iv commissions title iv would create two commissions to examine federal government programs 1 national commission on entitlement solvency and 2 commission on congressional budgetary accountability and review of federal agencies each commission would be composed of 15 members three members each would be appointed by the president the senate majority leader the senate minority leader the house speaker and the house minority leader13 national commission on entitlement solvency the national commission on entitlement solvency would be charged with examining the three largest federal entitlement programs 1 social security 2 medicare and 3 medicaid the commissions main objective would be to provide by may 1 2007 recommendations to congress to ensure the longterm solvency of these entitlement programs14 under procedures set forth in s 3521 the commissions legislative recommendations would be introduced in both chambers referred to the house ways and means committee and the senate finance committee reported by such committees with or without amendment and generally considered under expedited procedures on the floor of each chamber in particular consideration on the bill would be limited therefore preventing filibuster in the senate and requiring vote on final passage immediately after debate had concluded and amendments would have to be germane the senate budget committeereported amendment would require that in the senate the bill be recommitted to the senate finance committee or the conference report be recommitted to the conference committee as applicable unless the senate agreed to proceed to final passage the motion to proceed to final passage would require the affirmative vote of 60 senators 13 with regard to the national commission on entitlement solvency the senate budget committeereported amendment would prohibit more than two of the three commission members appointed by each person from being affiliated with the same political party 14 any recommendation would have to be approved by at least 10 members of the commission crs6 commission on congressional budgetary accountability and review of federal agencies the commission on congressional budgetary accountability and review of federal agencies would be charged with reviewing and possibly modifying the presidents assessment of all federal agency programs15 based on this review the commission could or in some cases would be required to recommend each year over the next four years beginning january 1 2008 the realignment or elimination of any agency program if it is found to be duplicative wasteful or inefficient or outdated irrelevant or failed the commissions legislative recommendations would be considered similarly to the entitlement solvency commissions recommendations described above including the consideration limitations with few differences in particular the bill containing the accountability commissions recommendations would be referred to the appropriate committees but the committees would be prohibited from recommending amendments in addition during the consideration of the bill on the floor of each chamber amendments would be prohibited title v budget process reforms title v of s 3521 makes several modifications to the existing budget process by amending the congressional budget act of 1974 titles iix of pl 93344 88 stat 297332 specifically the legislation would make changes related to the budget resolution the reconciliation process conference reports and direct spending legislation in addition s 3521 amends 31 usc 1108e regarding agency appropriations requests to congress budget resolution the existing budget process requires congress to adopt budget resolution each year setting forth aggregate spending and revenue levels and spending levels by major functional categories for at least five fiscal years as mentioned above title iii of s 3521 would require congress to adopt budget resolution setting forth budget levels for at least sixyear period ie the upcoming biennium and the following four fiscal years in the first session of each congress title v of s 3521 would make additional changes to the budget resolution and its consideration first s 3521 would require that the budget resolution include the amount of new spending under the jurisdiction of each house and senate committee instead of new spending by major functional category currently the committee spending allocations referred to as 302a allocations are included in the reports accompanying the budget resolution not in the actual text of the budget resolution second under the provisions of s 3521 the consideration of the budget resolution 15 for further information on similar proposals see crs report rs21980 commission on the accountability and review of federal agencies carfa brief overview of legislative proposals by clinton t brass crs7 would be limited in the senate instead of simply the debate with this change once the statutory 50hour limit or the statutory 10hour limit on conference report had expired or was yielded back the senate would proceed to vote on the budget resolution immediately currently because the limitation is on debate only once the 50 hours expires or is yielded back the senate still may consider amendments and other available motions but without debate leading to what has come to be known as votearama the provisions in s 3521 would prevent votearama finally the proposal would limit consideration of motions related to requesting conference with the house to one hour and debate on motion to instruct conferees to 20 minutes equally divided debate on all actions relating to resolving differences with the house on the budget resolution currently is limited to total of 10 hours reconciliation process congress may implement changes to existing law related to direct spending revenues or the debt limit through the reconciliation process under section 310 of the budget act16 the reconciliation process has two stages first congress includes reconciliation directives in budget resolution directing one or more committees in each chamber to recommend changes in statute to achieve the levels of direct spending revenues debt limit or combination thereof agreed to in the budget resolution second each instructed committee develops legislative recommendations to meet its reconciliation directives and reports its legislative recommendations to its respective chamber directly in the case of singlyinstructed committee or transmits such recommendations to its respective budget committee in the latter case the legislative language recommended by committees is packaged without any substantive revision into one or more budget reconciliation bills as set forth in the budget resolution by the house and senate budget committees the consideration of reconciliation legislation reported in the house or senate is governed by special procedures these procedures serve to limit what may be included in reconciliation legislation prohibit certain amendments and encourage its completion in timely fashion s 3521 proposes to make number of changes to the reconciliation process first under the proposal if committee failed to comply with its reconciliation directives the senate budget committee could report amendments within the jurisdiction of the noncompliant committee to achieve compliance as mentioned above the senate budget committee currently may not report any substantive changes to committees legislative recommendations regardless of committee failing to comply with its reconciliation directives second as with the consideration of the budget resolution s 3521 would limit the consideration of reconciliation legislation instead of simply limiting debate thereby preventing votearama at the end of the statutory 20hour limit 16 for full discussion of the reconciliation process see crs report rl33030 the budget reconciliation process house and senate procedures by robert keith and bill heniff jr crs8 finally under the existing byrd rule reconciliation legislation or amendments thereto may not contain extraneous matter as defined in section 313 of the budget act17 under the provisions of s 3521 provision that produces budgetary impact which is merely incidental to the nonbudgetary components of the provision would longer be considered extraneous matter not every component of provision therefore would be required to individually have budgetary impact in addition provision increasing direct spending or reducing governmental receipts would be considered extraneous matter if the budget impact of such provision would exceed 20 of the total amount of changes contained in committees directives s 3521 would retain the other current definitions of extraneous matter technical and conforming provisions would not be considered extraneous matter as well conference reports s 3521 creates new point of order against the consideration of conference report unless cost estimate or table by the congressional budget office is available currently section 308a2 of the budget act requires such cost estimate shall be included in the statement of managers if available on timely basis or made available to members as soon as practicable prior to the consideration of conference report new direct spending point of order tied to medicare spending section 512 of s 3521 would require the senate budget committee chair to submit to the senate notification referred to as medicare funding warning when contributions from the general fund of the treasury to medicare would exceed 45 of total medicare outlays within seven years18 the proposal also creates point of order against any legislation that would cause an increase in direct spending net of other changes to direct spending or receipts contained in the measure if notification has been submitted to the senate for two consecutive calendar years motion to waive the new point of order would require threefifths vote 60 votes if there are vacancies the notification would be withdrawn if legislation is enacted that would reduce the contribution of the general fund of the treasury to medicare outlays below the 45 threshold 17 for detailed information on the byrd rule see crs report rl30862 the budget reconciliation process the senates byrd rule by robert keith 18 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108 173 also requires similar medicare funding warning by the board of trustees of each medicare trust fund under procedures specified in title xiii of pl 108173 117 stat 23572364 if medicare funding warning is issued by the trustees the president is required to submit to congress proposed legislation to respond to the warning and such legislation is considered under expedited procedures in the house and senate for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33547
