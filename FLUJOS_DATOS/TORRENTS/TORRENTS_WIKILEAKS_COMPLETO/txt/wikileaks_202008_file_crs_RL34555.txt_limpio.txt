financial economics government and finance division lynn j cunningham information research specialist knowledge services group speculation and energy prices legislative responses summary while most observers recognize that the fundamentals of supply and demand have contributed to record energy prices in 2008 many also believe that the price of oil and other commodities includes speculative premium in other words speculators who seek to profit by forecasting price trends are blamed for driving prices higher than is justified by fundamentals in theory this should not happen speculation is not new phenomenon in futures markets the futures exchanges are essentially associations of professional speculators there are two benefits that arise from speculation and distinguish it from mere gambling first speculators create market where hedgers producers or commercial users of commodities can offset price risk hedgers can use the markets to lock in todays price for transactions that will occur in the future shielding their businesses from unfavorable price changes second competitive market where hedgers and speculators pool their information and trade on their expectations of future prices is the best available mechanism to determine prices that will clear markets and ensure efficient allocation of resources if one assumes that current prices are too high that means that the market is not performing its price discovery function well there are several possible explanations for why this might happen first there could be manipulation are there traders in the market oil companies or hedge funds perhaps with so much market power that they can dictate prices the federal regulator the commodity futures trading commission cftc monitors markets and has not found evidence that anyone is manipulating prices the cftc has announced that investigations are in progress but generally manipulations in commodities markets cause shortlived price spikes not the kind of multiyear bull market that has been observed in oil prices since 2002 absent manipulation the futures markets could set prices too high if speculative bubble were underway similar to what happened during the dotcom stock episode if traders believe that the current price is too low and take positions accordingly the price will rise eventually however prices should return to fundamental values perhaps with sharp correction one area of concern is the increased participation in commodity markets of institutional investors such as pension funds foundations and endowments many institutions have chosen to allocate small part of their portfolio to commodities often in the form of an investment or contract that tracks published commodity price index hoping to increase their returns and diversify portfolio risk while these decisions may be rational from each individual institutions perspective the collective result is said to be an inflow of money out of proportion to the amounts traditionally traded in commodities with the effect of driving prices artificially high this report summarizes the numerous legislative proposals for controlling excessive speculation including hr 6604 and s 3268

the messengers bearing bad news or are they themselves the bad news the commodity futures trading commission cftc which regulates speculative trading in energy commodities has found evidence that prices are not being set by the economic fundamentals of supply and demand many analysts agree arguing that longterm supply growth will have difficulty keeping up with demand others however believe that changes in the fundamentals do not justify recent increases in energy prices and seek the cause for soaring prices in the futures and derivatives markets which are used by financial speculators as well as producers and commercial users of energy commodities the energy futures markets which date from the 1980s involve two kinds of traders hedgers producers or commercial users of commodities trade in futures to offset price risk they can use the markets to lock in todays price for transactions that will occur in the future shielding their businesses from unfavorable price changes1 most trading however is done by speculators seeking to profit by forecasting price trends together the trading decisions of hedgers and speculators determine commodity prices there is better mechanism available for determining prices that will clear markets and ensure efficient allocation of resources than competitive market where hedgers and speculators pool information and trade on their expectations of future prices since many transactions in the physical markets take place at prices generated by the futures markets speculators clearly play large part in setting energy prices in theory this should not drive prices away from the fundamental levels if financial speculators trade on faulty assumptions about supply and demand other traders with superior information including those who deal in the physical commodities should be able to profit at their expense in other words there is reason why speculation in and of itself should cause prices to be artificially high theory says increased speculation should produce more efficient pricing in practice however some observers including oil company ceos opec ministers and investment bank analysts now speak of speculative premium in the price of oil this view implies that without speculation prices could fall significantly without disrupting current patterns of consumption and production how could the price discovery function of the energy derivatives market have broken 1 see the appendix for description of the mechanics of futures contract crs2 several explanations are possible first the market could be manipulated price manipulation which is illegal under the commodity exchange act involves deliberate strategies by trader or group of traders to push prices to artificial levels since derivatives markets reward correct predictions about future prices manipulation can be very profitable most manipulations in the past have involved shortlived price spikes brought about by spreading false information or concerted buying or selling since 2002 the cftc has brought 40 enforcement cases involving manipulation but these usually have involved attempts to generate shortterm price spikes which may be very profitable for the manipulators but do not appear to explain the longterm energy price trends observed in recent years it is rare but possible for market to be rigged over longer period of time when single trader or group amasses dominant position in both physical supplies and futures contracts and obtains enough market power to dictate prices examples include the hunt brothers attempt to corner the silver market in 19791980 and the manipulation of the copper market by yasuo hamanaka of sumitomo in the mid 1990s the cftc has not produced any evidence that such grandscale manipulation of energy prices is underway and has testified before congress repeatedly that prices are being set competitively in the absence of manipulation another explanation for prices above fundamental levels is speculative bubble if as was the case in the dotcom stock boom majority of traders become convinced that new era of value has arrived they may bid up prices sharply in defiance of counterarguments based on fundamentals eventually prices return to fundamental levels often with sudden plunge this is what many forecast for energy prices including george soros perhaps the best known speculator of the day2 the bubble explanation is the same as the speculative premium argument if market participants are trading on mistaken ideas about the fundamentals they may set price that is above the true price which is the current market price minus the speculative premium however there is sure method for determining what the true price is the only observable price is the one the market generates policy options to discourage speculation driven by irrational exuberance are limited3 actions to reduce the amount of speculative trading such as increasing the margin requirements on futures contracts or restricting access to the markets may not produce the desired outcome higher margins raise trading costs which should reduce trading volumes but the final effect on prices is uncertain empirical studies 2 soros however argues that an energy bust may be forestalled by new regulation on commodity index speculation by institutional investors testimony of george soros before the senate commerce committee june 3 2008 available at httpcommercesenategov public_filessorosfinaltestimonypdf 3 see crs report rl33666 asset bubbles economic effects and policy options for the federal reserve by marc labonte crs3 have not found link between higher margins and lower price volatility or any evidence that would suggest that prices would fall4 apart from the possibility that traders in general are getting the price wrong there is an argument that prices have been driven up by change in the composition of traders in recent years institutional investors like pension funds endowments and foundations have increasingly chosen to allocate part of their portfolios to commodities this is rational from the point of view of the individual fund as it may increase investment returns and diversify portfolio risks but when many institutions follow the same strategy at the same time the effect can be that of bubble number of bills are aimed at reducing the incidence or impact of institutional investment on the energy markets these and other proposals to improve the regulation of derivatives markets are summarized below legislative proposals closing loopholes legislative approaches to ensuring that commodity prices are not manipulated or distorted by excessive speculation focus on 1 extending regulatory control to previously unregulated markets 2 ensuring that speculators cannot use foreign futures markets to avoid us regulation and 3 restraining the ability of institutional investors and others who do not deal in the physical commodities themselves to take large positions in commodities these three areas are known respectively as the enron loophole the london loophole and the swaps loophole the enron loophole the enron loophole refers to range of transactions that occur off the regulated futures exchanges in an overthecounter otc market where the cftc has had little regulatory jurisdiction and from which it does not receive comprehensive information about who is trading in what volumes and at what price the commodity futures modernization act of 2000 cfma pl 106554 created statutory exemption from cftc regulation for certain contracts based on exempt commodities defined in the legislation as commodities that are neither agricultural nor financial5 two types of energy derivative markets were thereby exempted 1 bilateral negotiated transactions between two counterparties that are not executed on trading facility6 and 2 trades done on an electronic trading 4 some argue in fact that higher margins might actually drive prices higher since many long speculative positions are currently held by large institutional investors who would have trouble meeting any margin demand see the appendix for discussion of how margin works 5 see crs report rs21401 regulation of energy derivatives by mark jickling for information on the cfma 6 the term trading facility is defined in the commodity exchange act as person or group of persons that constitutes maintains or provides physical or electronic facility or system continued crs4 facility the cfma specified that these markets must not be accessible to small investors all traders must be eligible contract participants financial institutions units of government or businesses or individuals with substantial financial assets or in the case of the electronic trading facility exemption eligible commercial entities eligible contract participants who either deal in the physical commodity or regularly provide risk management services to those who do substantial volume of overthecounter energy trading makes use of these exemptions there is large market in energy swaps where investment banks like goldman sachs and morgan stanley offer contracts linked to energy prices the otc market in swaps has also evolved towards an exchange model where contracts are traded rapidly over an electronic network and may be backed by clearing house the best known of these electronic trading facilities is operated by intercontinental exchange inc ice7 the ice overthecounter market handles volume of natural gas contracts roughly equal in size to that handled by nymex the largest energy futures exchange government accountability office report in october 2007 noted the growth of the otc market and raised questions about whether the federal regulator had the information it needed to ensure that markets were free of fraud and manipulation8 in the same month the cftc issued report recommending legislative action to increase the transparency of energy markets9 in may 2008 with the farm bill hr 2419 pl 110234 congress passed legislation that generally follows the cftcs recommendations and potentially brings part of the otc market under cftc regulation the new law affects electronic trading facilities handling contracts in exempt commodities primarily energy or metals if the cftc determines that contract traded on such facility plays significant price discovery role that is if the prices it generates are used as reference points for other transactions and markets the facility will come under cftc regulation the market will have to register with the cftc and demonstrate its capacity to comply with several core principles the principles and requirements include maintaining and enforcing rules against manipulation establishing position limits or accountability levels to prevent excessive speculation and providing the cftc with daily reports on large traders positions 6 continued in which multiple participants have the ability to execute or trade agreements contracts or transactions by accepting bids and offers made by other participants that are open to multiple participants in the facility or system 7 ice is publicly traded firm based in atlanta that also owns the largest regulated energy futures market in europe ice futures europe formerly the international petroleum exchange located in london 8 us government accountability office trends in energy derivatives markets raise questions about cftcs oversight gao 0825 october 2007 83 p 9 us commodity futures trading commission report on the oversight of trading on regulated futures exchanges and exempt commercial markets october 2007 23 p crs5 the provisions of the farm bill however do not affect the unregulated status of energy contracts that are not entered into on trading facility in other words the swap market in exempt commodities thus the argument is made that the enron loophole has been only partially closed number of bills propose to end the statutory exemption for otc energy trades altogether by putting energy commodities on the same regulatory basis as agricultural commodities under current law derivatives contracts based on farm commodities may only be traded on regulated exchange unless the cftc issues an exemption10 the cftc is authorized to grant such exemptions on casebycase basis after determining that the contract would not be against the public interest other bills including hr 6244 and s 3268 would authorize the cftc to impose reporting requirements and position limits on energy swap markets the london loophole unlike the enron loophole which addresses the distinction between the regulated exchange markets and the unregulated otc market the london loophole refers to differences in the oversight of regulated markets in different countries the uk counterpart to nymex the leading us energy futures market is ice futures europe which is regulated in the uk by the financial services authority fsa11 for several years the uk exchange has been offering energy futures contracts in the united states via electronic terminals ordinarily an exchange offering futures contracts to us investors is required to register with the cftc as designated contract market and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations however in the case of ice futures europe the cftc has waived that requirement by means of series of noaction letters on the grounds that the uk market is already regulated at home and that requiring it to register with the cftc would be duplicative and add little in terms of market or customer protections12 initially the uk market offered electronic access to us traders to its most popular contract futures contract based on the price of brent crude oil produced in the north sea after the market was acquired by ice however it introduced lookalike contract that was identical to nymexs west texas intermediate crude oil future this contract which could be settled by making or taking delivery of physical crude oil in the united states now trades in significant volumes transactions that would presumably take place on the nymex otherwise13 10 exemptive authority is provided by section 4c of the commodity exchange act 11 the parent company of ice futures intercontinentalexchange inc is publiclytraded us firm based in atlanta 12 the first noaction letter was issued in 1999 when the market was known as the international petroleum exchange when the ipe was acquired by ice us firm in 2001 the waiver continued and was modified several times 13 in 2007 nymex traded 1215 million wti futures contracts while ice futures europe traded 514 million volume surges again futures industry magazine marchapril continued crs6 with concern over high and volatile energy prices there has been more scrutiny of ice futures europes activities in the united states can traders avoid speculative position limits by trading on ice in addition to or instead of nymex does the cftc receive the same information from ice futures europe about large trading positions that could be source of manipulation or instability if they were liquidated suddenly number of bills propose to close the london loophole either by requiring foreign boards of trades exchanges to comply with all us registration and regulatory requirements if they offer contracts that can be settled by physical delivery within the united states or by making cftc relief from such requirements and regulation contingent upon finding that 1 it will receive from the foreign market information that is comparable or identical to what it receives from domestic exchanges and 2 the foreign market is subject to regulatory regime that is comparable to the cftcs in the case of ice futures europe the cftc announced that it had amended the noaction relief letter under which ice futures europe is permitted direct access to us customers the amended letter conditions direct access on ice futures europes adoption of equivalent us position limits and accountability levels on its west texas intermediate crude oil contract which is linked to the new york mercantile exchange crude oil contract14 this agreement complements 2006 memorandum of understanding with the fsa providing for sharing of trading information15 the cftcs agreement with ice appears to fulfill the purposes of several of the bills but only with respect to the london market the cftc has issued other action letters granting regulatory waivers to foreign markets including the dubai mercantile exchange joint venture with nymex permitting it to offer contracts in the united states to be cleared by nymex on july 7 2008 the cftc announced that it would modify the noaction letter to the dubai exchange on terms similar to the agreement with ice futures europe16 13 continued 2008 p 23 14 us commodity futures trading commission cftc conditions foreign access on adoption of position limits on london crude oil contract release 551108 june 17

mercantile exchange release 549508 may 1 2008 crs7 the swaps loophole the view that excessive speculation is driving up energy prices is widely held but controversial the question of whether current prices are justified by fundamental factors of supply and demand or whether irrational exuberance has created bubble in energy prices similar to what was observed in dotcom stocks in the late 1990s is beyond the scope of this report however testimony presented to congress has identified recent trend in financial markets that some argue may be putting upward pressure on prices decisions by institutional investors such as pension funds foundations or endowments to allocate part of their portfolio to commodities17 from the point of view of fund manager investment in commodities may be very attractive under current market conditions average returns on stocks and bonds have been relatively low for the past few years and there is little optimism that they will improve in the near term commodities on the other hand have been the hot sector while commodity investment is recognized as being highly risky risky asset in large diversified portfolio does not necessarily increase overall portfolio risk the risk of downturn in commodity prices is not generally correlated with risks in stocks or bonds in some cases there may be an inverse relationship for example if the price of oil drops suddenly an institution may lose money on its commodity investment but the price change will be good for its transportation stocks institutional investors may take positions in commodities in number of ways but they do not generally trade on the futures exchanges directly instead they use an intermediary such as commodity index fund or an otc swap contract that is structured to match the return of published index of commodity prices18 as result of this investment strategy institutional investors in commodities are often called index traders while the decision of an individual pension fund to put 34 of its portfolio in commodities may appear entirely rational some observers argue that the aggregate impact of institutional index trading has been to overwhelm the commodity markets because of the disproportion between the amount of money held by pension funds foundations and other institutions and the amounts that have traditionally been traded in the energy futures market in other words index investing is seen as excessive speculation one particular feature of index trading is the focus of several legislative proposals the swaps loophole 17 testimony of michael w masters before the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs may 20 2008 available at httphsgacsenategovpublic_files 052008masterspdf 18 examples of such indices are the dow jonesaig commodity index or the goldman sachs commodity index which are variously weighted among farm products energy commodities and metals swap contract is derivative economically equivalent to futures contract two parties agree to exchange payments over the life of contract that are linked to price index or other variable depending on which way the underlying variable moves the net cash flow will be positive for one counterparty and negative for the other crs8 the cftc and the exchanges maintain position limits or accountability levels that apply to speculative traders speculators either face ceiling on the number of contracts they may own or if they breach position accountability level they must explain to the exchange why they are accumulating such large position the purpose of the speculative limits is to prevent manipulation by speculators with very large positions and to limit the market impact in cases where losses force speculators to liquidate their positions suddenly hedgers those who use the futures markets to offset price risk arising from their dealings in the underlying commodity are generally exempt from position limits hedgers are allowed to take futures positions of any size provided those positions are commensurate with their commercial interests the rationale for exempting them from position limits is that when they have hedged position they have incentive to manipulate the market any gains in their futures position will be offset by losses in their physical transactions and vice versa they use the futures markets to lock in todays price meaning that subsequent price changes do not affect them traditionally hedgers have been thought of as those who are active in the physical commodity market in the energy market these would be oil producers refiners transporters and industrial users such as airlines and utilities with the rise of index trading however the definition of hedger has broadened both the cftc and nymex now extend exemptions from speculative position limits to swaps dealers who are using the futures exchanges to hedge price risk arising from financial contract with an institutional investor in other words pension fund wishing to invest in commodities may go to swaps dealer19 and enter into contract that will pay returns equal to the percentage increase in an index of commodity prices in economic terms this is equivalent to long position in futures which will gain value if the underlying commodity price rises the swap dealer has in effect taken the short side of the trade it will lose money if prices rise the swap dealer is exposed to price risk and may wish to offset that risk by purchasing exchangetraded futures contracts because the dealer is using the futures market to hedge the risk of the swap the exchanges and the cftc exempt it from position limits even though it does not deal in the physical commodity the rationale is the same as for traditional hedgers since the swap dealer will gain on its futures position whatever it loses on the swap and vice versa it has incentive to manipulate futures prices the effect of this swaps loophole however is to permit the ultimate customers the institutional investors who are clearly speculating on commodity prices to take larger positions than they would be able to do if they traded directly on the futures exchanges where they might be constrained by speculative position limits hence the description of institutional investors index trading as excessive speculation 19 the major swap dealers in energy markets are investment banks like goldman sachs and morgan stanley crs9 number of bills propose to constrain the ability of institutional investors to use the swaps loophole they would limit the definitions of bona fide hedger or legitimate hedge trader to those who deal in the physical commodity or they would prohibit trading in otc energy contracts by those who do not deal in the physical commodity other legislative approaches raising margins three bills hr 2991 s 3044 and s 3183 call for the cftc to raise margins on oil futures the margin requirement is the minimum amount of money per futures contract that traders must deposit with their brokers margin requirements are set by the exchanges and are intended to cover losses at the end of each day the exchange credits or debits every traders margin account with the amount of gains or losses traders whose margin accounts fall below the minimum requirement will be required to post additional margin before the market opens next day or their positions may be closed out at loss the exchanges tend to raise margins during periods of price volatility when the probability of large price swings increases the risk of loss nymex has raised the initial margin requirement for crude oil futures contracts each of which represents 1000 barrels of oil several times in 200820 since everyone in futures markets trades on margin21 raising margins means higher trading costs which should cause some traders to reduce the size of their positions and reduce trading volume overall however as noted above there is empirical evidence that higher margins dampen price volatility making the effect on price uncertain increasing cftc resources several bills call for supplemental appropriations to permit the cftc to hire 100 new employees to monitor the energy or agricultural derivatives markets emergency actions hr 6377 passed by the house on june 26 2008 and other bills direct the cftc to use its existing powers including its emergency authority to curb immediately the role of excessive speculation in energy and to eliminate price distortion unreasonable or unwarranted price fluctuations or any unlawful activities that prevent the market from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand for energy cftcs emergency authority includes the power to change margin levels or order the liquidation of trading positions 20 at the end of 2007 the crude oil margin requirement was 7088 on july 1 2008 it was raised to 12488 for contracts expiring in 2008 both figures are for customers margin requirements for exchange members are slightly lower 21 this is unlike the stock market where margin refers to loans extended to buy stock and collateralized by the purchased securities relatively few stock purchases are made on margin crs10 studies of the market number of bills call for studies of various aspects of the market including the effects of raising margin the adequacy of international regulation the effects of speculation and the impact of index trading on prices table 1 below provides summaries of all legislation that bears on the regulation of energy speculation table 2 provides more detailed comparison

party to the contract need ever possess the actual commodity contracts may be settled by physical delivery but in practice the vast majority are settled in cash when contract is made today one party called the long agrees to buy oil at future date from the other the short contracts are available with different maturities designated by expiration months but the size is always the same in oil there is contract expiring every month the price at which this future transaction is to take place is the current market price assuming the price of oil is 135 per barrel the long trader is committed to buy at that price and the short is obliged to sell assume that tomorrow the price of oil goes to 140barrel the long trader now has the advantage he is entitled to buy for 135 oil that is now worth 140 his profit is 5000 the 5 per barrel increase times the 1000 barrels specified in the contract the short has lost the identical amount she is obliged to sell oil for less than the going price if on the following day the price goes to 145 the long gains another 5000 the short down total of 10000 may reconsider her investment strategy and decide to exit the market she can do this at any time by entering into an offsetting or opposite transaction that is she purchases long contract with the same expiration date her obligation on paper is now to sell 1000 barrels according to the first contract and to buy 1000 barrels the second contract when both contracts expire simultaneously whatever price prevails at that time the net effect of the two transaction will be zero the shorts position is said to be evened out she is out of the market the shorts decision to exit does not affect the long who may prefer to ride with the trend this is because all contracts are assumed by the exchanges clearing house which becomes the opposite party on each trade and guarantees payment the ability to enter and exit the market by offset without having to make or take delivery of the physical commodity permits trading strategies based on shortterm price expectations while some traders may keep long or short position open for weeks or months others buy and sell within time frame of minutes or seconds the exchange clearing house which guarantees all trades also controls traders funds before entering into the trade described above both long and short would have been required to deposit an initial margin payment of 11813 the amount is set by the exchange the figure is current as of june 30 2008 all contracts are priced or markedtomarket each day the long trader above would have had his 10000 gain credited to his margin account while the short would have had to make additional maintenance margin payments to cover her losses it is worth noting that her twoday 10000 loss represents 85 of her original investment that is her initial margin deposit of 11813 the risks of futures speculation are high when traders exit the market any funds remaining in their margin accounts are returned other transaction costs such as brokerage commissions and exchange fees are not returnable options on futures are also available for many futures contracts the holder of an option has the right but not the obligation to enter into long or short futures contract over the life of the option the option will only be exercised if price movements are favorable to the option buyer that is if the underlying futures contract would be profitable the seller of the option receives payment called premium for granting this right the seller profits if the option is not exercised by the buyer for
