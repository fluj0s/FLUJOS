william g whittaker specialist in labor economics domestic social policy division davisbacon act coverage and the state revolving fund program under the clean water act summary the davisbacon act dba requires among other things that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid to workers employed under contract on federal construction work to which the united states or the district of columbia is party congress has added dba prevailing wage provisions to more than 50 separate program statutes in 1961 dba prevailing wage requirement was added to the federal water pollution control act pl 8788 now known as the clean water act cwa which assists in construction of municipal wastewater treatment works in 1987 congress moved from program of federal grants for municipal pollution abatement facilities to state revolving loan fund srf arrangement in which states would be expected to contribute an amount equal to at least 20 of srf capitalization funding the srfs were expected to remain as continuing and stable source of funds for construction of treatment facilities and congress specified that certain administrative and policy requirements including davisbacon were to be annexed from the core statute and would apply to treatment works constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995 with srf assistance by october 1994 under the 1987 amendments it was expected that federal appropriations for srfs would end after 1987 congress variously reconsidered the cwa and the srf program but made further authorizations it did however contrary to expectation when the 1987 legislation was adopted continue to appropriate funds for srf pollution abatement projects thus conflict arose did the administrative and policy requirements associated with federal funding inter alia the prevailing wage requirement continue to apply if so or if not upon what legal foundation in 1995 the environmental protection agency epa ruled that prevailing wage rates davisbacon would longer be required on srf projects the building and construction trades department bctd aflcio protested what happened after 1994 is not entirely clear that is whether prevailing rates were actually paid in the spring of 2000 epa reversed its position and came to conclude that davisbacon did indeed apply following notice in the federal register and review of submissions from interested parties epa entered into settlement agreement with the bctd it would enforce dba rates on cwa projects effective july 1 2001 but then epa moved the effective date back to late summer and then to october thereafter it seems epa was silent during recent years congress has increasingly considered funding mechanisms other than direct appropriations for public construction eg joint federal and state revolving funds loan guarantees tax credits etc this report is case study of the application of dba requirements to one such mechanism the cwasrfs the question of dba application to the srfs continues

establishment of program of state revolving loan funds srfs through which to finance local water pollution abatement projects pl 1004 the srfs were to be jointly funded by the federal government and the states with loans to be made and repaid in cyclical fashion the legislation included provision mandating that construction work performed with srf assistance would be covered by the prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act dba 1931 statute requiring payment of not less than the locally prevailing wage on certain federal and later federally assisted construction work1 by the mid1990s this system was expected to have changed once the srfs were in place federal funding for these waste water treatment facilities would pass through the srfs on revolving basis it was assumed that by the mid1990s the transition would be complete and that further federal appropriations would be needed however federal presence would continue through the srfs as funds were recycled through loans and repayment in practice matters evolved somewhat differently although additional authorizing legislation was adopted after 1987 clean water act appropriations contrary to stated expectations continued given continuing federal funding some have argued federal requirements governing administration of the program including labor standards should remain in place others have sought to set aside the various federal requirements including the cwa davisbacon provision debate over davisbacon coverage under the cwasrf program is ongoing and has been the subject of several policy shifts on the part of the environmental protection agency epa first in 1995 epa ruled that davisbacon longer applied to cwasrf projects second in the spring of 2000 epa reversed itself and entering into settlement agreement with the building and construction trades department aflcio affirmed that the act would be applied to such projects effective july 1 2001 third epa then set back the effective date for davisbacon coverage to the fall of 2001 perhaps reversing itself once more thereafter epa seems to have remained silent on the issue 1 the davisbacon act has been codified at 40 usc 276a to 276a7 it has now been recodified at 40 usc 31413148 crs2 this report deals neither with environmentalwater quality issues nor with the davisbacon act per but rather with the intersection of two statutes and the regulatory complexities that have resulted it suggests the evolution of the davis bacon provision of the clean water act and traces the conflict 19942008 as to whether dba wage standards shoulddo still apply to cwasrf projects finally it poses questions of policy how did the dispute develop how has it been resolved if indeed it has been and how might similar conflicts be avoided with more than 50 program statutes now covered by davisbacon prevailing wage provisions and with congress exploring variety of innovative funding mechanisms for public works how this issue is ultimately resolved could have wider implications background in 1948 congress enacted the federal water pollution control act setting in motion continuing initiative for restoring the health of americas water resources the act which would evolve into the clean water act started modestly mandating series of studies and limited projects gradually on an ad hoc basis the pollution abatement program became more ambitious with federal aid to states and local governments in 1972 the various initiatives and requirements were drawn together in more coherent manner other amendments followed in 1987 the most recent amendments congress made changes both with respect to policy and funding2 the davisbacon act 1931 had twofold thrust to promote stability within the construction industry and to protect construction workers from downward spiral in wages and working conditions in 1935 congress broadly restructured the davis bacon act reducing the coverage threshold from 5000 to 2000 and extending the scope of the act to construction alteration andor repair including painting and decorating of public buildings or public works to which the united states or the district of columbia is party3 gradually and with increasing frequency after the mid1950s davisbacon provisions were added to statutes in which the work was made possible through federal grants loans and other financial arrangements4 linking davisbacon to the clean water act conflict developed early on between federal and state responsibilities in 1956 congress adopted legislation pl 84660 to provide for grants of up to 50 million year through 10year period to be used for matching grants to states and localities for construction of community sewagetreatment plants president eisenhower reluctantly signed the legislation but later urged that the grant program be abolished when congress instead nearly doubled the size of the program the 2 concerning water quality issues see crs report rl33800 water quality

evolution and public policy by william g whittaker crs3 president vetoed the legislation and his veto was sustained5 observing that water pollution is uniquely local blight the president stated that primary responsibility for solving the problem lies not with the federal government but rather must be assumed and exercised as it has been by state and local governments6 the 1961 amendments and their aftermath in early 1961 president kennedy reversed the eisenhower policy on water pollution abatement and called for increased federal assistance to municipalities for construction of waste treatment facilities7 when new cwa legislation was reported in the house in april 1961 it provided inter alia that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on projects for which construction grants were to be made were to be paid wages as determined by the secretary of labor in accordance with the act of march 3 1931 as amended known as the davisbacon act8 the davisbacon provision was explained to members of the house representative john blatnik dmn chair of the subcommittee on rivers and harbors stated that this was not an unusual practice since similar provisions already applied to contracts for school hospital housing and airport projects constructed with federalaid funds9 the municipal wastewater pollution abatement program it was explained would be partnership between the federal government and state or local entities davisbacon coverage does not appear to have been contentious representative james wright dtx observed if we were to oppose the payment of prevailing standard wages then would this not mean that we favored the payment of substandard wages surely he added the congress does not wish to take that position10 though other aspects of the legislation were subject to extended debate one seemed seriously to dispute the requirement for dba coverage11 senate consideration of the 1961 legislation appears to have been more controversial where davisbacon coverage was concerned the concept was 5 congressional quarterly almanac 1960 washington congressional quarterly inc 1960 pp 250251 hereafter cited as cq almanac 6 veto

technical and fiscal aspects of pollution control13 with the house and senate in agreement davisbacon was not an issue in the conference report14 congress appeared to accept the premise that federal funding for pollution abatement projects even when made available through assistance to states and local entities on matching basis should include as corollary davisbacon coverage see pl 8788 through the next few years congress variously modified the federal water pollution control act fwpca though davisbacon had high visibility during the 1960s it does not appear to have been an issue in the context of pollution abatement legislation fwpca amendments in 1965 retained the dba requirement and added antikickback provisions15 during senate hearings on the program in 1971 davis bacon was mentioned only in passing16 and when the following year congress restructured the act with passage of pl 92500 the davisbacon and anti kickback provisions remained in place notwithstanding authorization of substantial expenditures for construction of state and local wastewater treatment facilities under the 1972 legislation17 stable and adequate funding would continue to be an issue through the next decade davisbacon however does not appear to have been serious issue for any of the parties at this juncture emergence of the state revolving fund concept through the 1980s and beyond congress would continue to wrestle with issues of policy raised under the early statutes in 1981 the federal contribution to assist states and local governments with pollution abatement was reduced

governance18 restructuring the cwa program during hearings in march 1985 jack ravan assistant epa administrator in the reagan administration called for total phasingout of the federal construction grants program by the end of fy1989 ravan argued that federal funding has simply substituted for not supplemented state and local financing devolution he suggested would be wiser course19 in the context of projected shift from federal to state or nonfederal funding of treatment facilities creation of state revolving funds srfs surfaced as one option however questions arose concerning management of such program how much or how little local control ought to be allowed20 ravan suggested gradual phasing out of existing requirements he opined that the first use of the money out of the revolving fund might very well carry with it the requirements of the existing program italics added he continued i believe there also must come day hopefully as quickly as possible when the states would be given absolute flexibility for utilization of these funds 21 robert perry of the water pollution control federation was more expansive treat moneys that have been used and then paid back to fund as state revenues he urged remove the requirement that they be treated as federal funds ad infinitum22 different versions of the cwa amendments were passed by the house and senate during the summer of 1985 but in neither body did labor standards appear to be an issue23 for nearly year the legislation laid dormant until during the spring of 1986 conferees met and began what became protracted process of negotiation the thrust of the pending proposals s 1128 hr 8 seemed clear that is that at some point in the near future federal appropriations and authorizations would cease and construction of treatment facilities would rest on the srfs 18 us congress house committee on public works and transportation subcommittee on water resources possible amendments to the federal water

continuing administrative practices that would apply to treatment works which will be constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995 with funds directly made available by capitalization grants among those requirements it was specified that section 513 of the cwa the davisbacon provision would continue to be applied in the same manner as it had been applied to treatment works constructed with assistance under title ii namely the former direct federal grants program24 the house approved the report 408 yeas to 0 nays as did the senate yeas 96 to 0 there appears to have been other discussion of the davisbacon prevailing wage language25 however despite strong support for the legislation it was subjected to pocket veto congress having adjourned by president reagan for reasons other than davisbacon26 early in the 100th congress consideration of the issue resumed with new essentially identical legislation being introduced members spoke of transition from federal to state funding and of phasing out the federal program without abandoning the needs of states and municipalities it is not clear whether members viewed devolution as absolute27 what requirements if any would remain in place in fact the federal phaseout would not be total for the srfs rested upon federal seed money28 had there been federal funding seed money there would have been state revolving funds but there were ambiguities representative arlan stangeland rmn for example observed federal moneys made available for these funds would be subject to certain restrictions on their use as are moneys provided through the construction grant program as these moneys are repaid into the fund the restriction on how the funds can be used would be eliminated thereby allowing the states greater flexibility and freedom mr stangeland did not specify the restrictions he had in mind was this flexibility with respect to the types of projects and the priorities to be assigned or did it imply that the states would be free to utilize the srfs without restraint it was clear that the srfs would serve federally specified purposes and in federally specified manner29 congress quickly approved the legislation in late january 1987 consistent in his opposition president reagan vetoed the measure while endorsing pollution abatement he focused upon the federal deficit 24 congressional record

old title ii direct federal grants program would be phasedout and replaced with the title vi srf loan program questions of interpretation and intent in pl 1004 congress appeared to assume from debate and public documentation did assume that federal appropriations for srfs would be made after 1994 however even were that assumption to have held true in fact it would not the federal presence would not have ended the srfs were direct federal creation largely capitalized by the federal government under pl 1004 at least two elements need to be considered first there is the language of s 1128 of the 99th congress the vetoed bill and of the conference report that accompanied it second there is the actual language of the new statute pl 1004 with respect to dba coverage they differ in critical aspects when reporting s 1128 in the house in the 99th congress the conference report explained that the 16 administrative requirements of section 602b6 including the davisbacon requirement section 513 of the cwa were not to apply to funds contributed by the state or to monies repaid to the fund32 senator george mitchell dme explained the measure in the senate in almost identical language33 but that language was not incorporated within the proposed legislation which in any event did not become law pl 1004 like s 1128 of the 99th congress states that treatment works to be constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995 with funds directly made available by capitalization grants under this title must meet the requirements set forth in section 602b6 the 16 specific requirements which included the section 513 davisbacon provision the statute did not say that davisbacon coverage would cease after 1995 when authorization would have terminated nor did it specify that section 513 davisbacon and the other enumerated requirements would not apply to recycled repaid funds it carried the program up to fy1995 and then was silent making reference to the first use concept where the davisbacon act was concerned 30 public papers of the president of the united states ronald reagan 1987 washington govt print off 1989 pp 9596 31 congressional record february 3 1987 pp 25052516 and

coverage for the srf program appears to have sparked concern neither during the closing days of the 99th congress nor early in the 100th congress but there may have been continuing ambiguities the legislation projected direct federal role in the srfs continuing appropriations until fy1995 thereafter the program was still expected to continue on foundation of federal funding did congress intend to drop the davisbacon requirement with others once the srfs were in place resting as they were on federal funding and was congress willing to acquiesce in the payment of wages lower than those prevailing in locality after fy199434 there may also have been the matter of disaggregation of sfr funding an abatement project commenced prior to 1995 with an srf loan would clearly be dbacovered what if work were to continue beyond 1995 through supplemental srf loans the entire project could be grandfatheredin and wholly subject to davisbacon or once 1994 had been reached coverage could cease or coverage might be associated with each contract or subcontract depending upon the date on which contract was entered into or on which the work commenced could worksite be fragmented part covered and part exempt how were the various agencies to distinguish between covered and noncovered funding construction grants under title ii had always required dba coverage but with federal funds now going first to srfs capitalization grants and then being loaned out to local entities would dba still apply in the absence of specific policy from the congress and what about the first use doctrine given the very high visibility of davisbacon during this period some may wonder that the act was not major subject of debate where the cwa was concerned documents to this point 1987 are remarkable silent35 34 the 100th congress may arguably have seen need to reaffirm prevailing wage coverage taking coverage for granted or conversely it might have added specific language stating that after 1994 the dba would not apply to srffunded construction but it did not do so the target date was after all nearly seven years off and surely there would be time to revisit the act how much weight should be given the absence of language overturning longestablished public policy 35 an issue at least since the later 1950s major controversy erupted with the 1979 gao report the davisbacon act should be repealed us government accounting office hdr7918 washington us govt print off april 27 1979 the report led to hearings by three separate committees of congress projected administrative reform and litigation then continued in some degree into the clinton administration crs9 charting new federal role 19871995 through the late 1980s members of congress continued to speak in terms of terminating program and shifting responsibility pl 1004 brings the title ii federal grant program to an end observed senator daniel moynihan dny the program will end in 1994 the end after that there is revolving loan fund to sustain the program36 but federal financial involvement didnt end by 1991 the beginnings of policy shift were evident senators max baucus dmt and john chafee rri introduced legislation s 1081 that became in effect vehicle for oversight senator chafee asserted that the states have actually lost ground as the construction grants program is being phased out and affirmed that the states are starved for resources to carry out the act among other things the baucuschafee proposal would have set back the target date for termination of the federal role in the srfs from 1995 to 1998 and it appears would have extended through that period applicability of the existing specific requirements under section 602b6 including davisbacon coverage section 51337 hearings commenced on the baucuschafee legislation in the spring of 1991 but by that point number of things had changed concern with wetlands and combined sewer overflows csos and nonpoint source pollution had become the key issues especially the former the reagan administration had given way to the bush administration and epa administrator william reilly now acknowledged municipal pollution abatement need into the indefinite future he stated that the costs of abatement were rising and that the states and municipalities are very often not in position to meet the many federal requirements we are imposing38 these problems may have overshadowed concern about prevailing wage standards except perhaps from the standpoint of keeping costs down though specific proposals were avoided for the moment it became increasingly clear that the federal government would not be able to make clean break from federal funding and to independent and selfsustaining srfs interest groups associated with pollution abatement began to call for more federal funding such calls for federal dollars were accompanied with appeals for enhanced flexibility fewer strings less federal control states it was argued should be allowed to maintain the flexibility to establish priorities and to deploy available funds for the most pressing problem on timely basis continued capitalization by the federal government through fy1994 and beyond it was asserted is essential39 appeals for increased federal funding were coupled with pleas for relief from the 36 congressional record july 12 1988 pp 17658 37 congressional record may 15

1994 that date is now in sight he pointed out and it is time to reconsider that decision i have come to the floor of the senate today to urge that federal support for the state revolving loan funds be continued at current levels for the foreseeable future41 italics added the nature of continuing federal presence was now at issue the baucuschafee bill would not have terminated the federal role in construction of treatment plants rather it would have created series of new categorical grant programs to be placed under the srf umbrella but this it seems was opposed by certain state authorities hostile to the idea of proliferation of new federal categorical grants instead they wanted the flexibility already available to them in the srfs to effectively address their highest priorities as they see them42 since the bush administration had not yet announced firm policy with respect to srf funding epa administrator reilly was not then able to address the issue definitively the baucuschafee bill was not markedup reauthorization to provide for sustained and comprehensive cwasrf funding did not move forward43 the end draws near until fy1995 the srf structure would remain in place what would or what ought to happen thereafter remained in question meanwhile congress continued to review variety of cwarelated proposals interim assessment in march 1991 and in january 1992 gao released assessments of the initial operation of the cwasrf program stating that the wage requirement was the most controversial of the old title ii now title vi administrative requirements but it also found opinion mixed some arguing that dba could increase project costs significantly while others suggested that except for small or disadvantaged communities the increased costs associated with the title ii requirements may not be as substantial as critics aver44 in short its findings seem to have been ambiguous with little hard evidence upon which to rest 40 ibid pp 917918 41 congressional record

srf loans would be made the epa study paralleled the march gao report suggesting that payment of the locally prevailing wage could increase the cost of public construction but epa also pointed out that the dba requirement varies considerably based on local socioeconomic and market conditions and state prevailing wage rate laws45 in each of these reports dba was merely touched upon assessments of the prevailing wage statute were more reportorial than analytical and rendered as the views of persons interviewed new evidence or impact analysis was presented new legislative proposals with the 1987 authorization set to expire in october 1994 reauthorization of the cwasrf program assumed high priority46 on june 15 1993 senators chafee and baucus introduced s 1114 which proposed to extend the srf program to increase federal funding and to permit the states greater flexibility the dba requirement would have remained in effect47 hearings before the senate clean water subcommittee commenced the following day continuing intermittently through three months general consensus became apparent concerning the srf program senator bob graham dfla chair of the subcommittee explained the justification for this change in policy extending the program through 2000 seems to be grounded in the continued need for federal support48 witnesses offered mixed responses in an exchange with senator chafee ronald marino of the investment firm of smith barney raised the issue of first use and recycled funding suggesting that when the loan is recycled and repaid mandates such as davisbacon

municipal pollution abatement was deferred the committee noted that early policy had contemplated transition to full state and local financing by fiscal year 1995 when the capitalization grants were to end and the funds were to be sustained by repayments of loans made from the fund however confronted with 20year agenda of treatment projects estimated to cost 130 billion past assumptions seemed longer appropriate the new bill would authorize continued funding for the successful srf program through the year 2000 the committees position was made clear were the legislation to be adopted the federal role in the srf program would not end rather it would be extended at least until 2000 and possibly into the indefinite future51 but what about the various administrative requirements of the 1987 legislation existing law would be modified to increase state flexibility in managing loan funds but for the most part these changes would affect utilization and financial management of the srfs52 during markup senator robert smith rnh proposed repeal of the existing davisbacon requirement under the cwa the smith amendment was defeated by vote of 611 thereupon senator harris wofford dpa offered an amendment confirming that the davisbacon act would apply to all state loans under the srf the wofford amendment was approved by vote of 11 to 6 the committee voted to report the bill by vote of 14 to 353 with respect to davisbacon and its applicability under the srfs the bill as reported was clear the relevant part of the new section 513 was to have read the administrator shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that each laborer or mechanic employed by contractor or subcontractor of project that is financed in whole or in part by grant loan loan guarantee refinancing or any other form of financial assistance provided under this act including assistance provided by state from water pollution revolving loan fund 50 ibid pp 332 344 348349 360 407 412 and 415417 one witness suggested that dispensing with the administrative regulations presumably including the dba would allow communities to get more bang for the bucks the inference was clear paying lower wages would stretch tax dollars bit further the stated purpose of the davisbacon act however was to maintain at least the locally prevailing wage structure 51 us congress senate committee on environment and

reauthorization legislation stalled both in the house and senate through the remainder of the 20th century an into the 21th century further reauthorization for the clean water act would be adopted55 the srfs and mandated water quality objectives remained in place congress continued to appropriate funds for cwa projects and for srfs construction of abatement facilities continued the absence of reauthorization notwithstanding under the circumstances it may have seemed reasonable that normal administrative requirements of the cwa would similarly remain in place but not all agreed with that

davisbacon the discussion however was brief and focused on dba generally not on the davisbaconcwa connection59 further kermit prime speaking for the national society of professional engineers nspe

appears to have been some ambiguity with respect to cwas davisbacon provision each side sought to have their interpretation prevail davisbacon is not selfenforcing if an agency determines not to apply the statute someone must take exception move through the appeals process and potentially through the courts its not simple procedure nor is it quick few individuals would be in position to take such action nor might they be inclined to do so where wages and conditions of employment are reasonably good organized labor the building and construction trades department aflcio the bctd will normally support prevailing wage requirement conversely some employers often open shop firms may be hostile to davisbacon and seek to avoid its applicability or enforcement federal agencies contracting for various types of construction and operating on tight budgets may find themselves the natural allies of the contractoremployer as they seek to reduce wages labor costs even within an administration there may be different perspectives among agencies on prevailing wage requirement in the case of dba and srf projects various factors come into play congress might have spoken with greater clarity if stalemate had not occurred with nondba issues blocking further authorizing legislative but stalemate did occur congress made immediate cwa authorizations beyond 1994 similarly changes within 61 continued washington us govt print off may 3 1995 pp 164 62 the implications of the changes proposed in hr 961 may not be entirely clear in letter to epa administrator carol browner august 3 2000 representative shuster would recall hr 961 which i was the lead sponsor of and which passed the house in 1995 included specific provisions which had the effect of reapplying davisbacon to the clean water srf he added one including the administration commented that epa already had sufficient legal authority to effectuate this policy change thereby making these provisions unnecessary it is possible others thought there was need for comment if the amended statute merely extended the davisbacon requirement as it stood while deleting certain other administrative requirements and deleting consideration of time before fiscal year 1995 that was longer relevant 63 congressional record may 16 1995 p 13094 crs16 the congress and at the white house may have brought shift of philosophies this could and likely would result in new policies both at dol and in epa the davisbaconcwa issue begins to form in memorandum of august 8 1995 michael cook of epa called the attention of his staff to confusion about applicability to the srfs of the equivalency requirements including the dba provision64 noting the language of the statute and making allowance for the altered circumstance cook stated section 602b6 of the clean water act requires section 212 publiclyowned treatment works projects to comply with these statutory requirements if they are constructed in whole or in part before october 1 1994 with funds directly made available by capitalization grants consequently projects that began construction on or after that date do not have to comply with the requirements underscoring in the original cook explained various complexities for example with binding commitment for the project made prior to october 1 1994 or an ongoing project being incrementally funded the equivalency requirements could be expected to apply but where commitment or initiation of construction occurred on or after october 1 1994 the equivalency requirements do not attach to the project this would be true even though the project was funded with funds directly made available by capitalization grants equivalency funds65 there would be dba coverage the cook memorandum did not resolve all confusion about dba applicability from public documents it is not clear how widely it was circulated nor how it was treated by cwasrf managers what advice was given to potential contractors in this respect did dba provisions continue to be written into cwasrf contracts if not was there objection from the workers or from the several unions involved in january 1997 epas region iii philadelphia sought advice from dol in philadelphia concerning dba coverage for cwa projects on the assumption that davisbacon longer applied epas regional office was ready to remind the states within its jurisdiction that coverage had ceased and that dol would longer enforce compliance it sent dol copy of its proposed policy statement asking please let us know if we are misstating the department of labors role in this particular situation the epa draft commenced it has come to our attention that some states are continuing to apply the davisbacon act to cwasrf projects and later the draft advised since the dba is federal statute it is inappropriate 64 the section 602b6 requirements including the davisbacon provision are variously referred to in the literature as the specific requirements or the equivalency requirements 65 memorandum from michael b cook director office of wastewater management us environmental protection agency to water management division directors august 8 1995 crs17 to use the threat of federal enforcement in cases where compliance is not federally mandated in the first place66 the exchange between epa and dol sparked renewed interest in davisbacon and cwasrf projects word of epas position filtered back to washington and in april 1997 robert georgine president of the building and construction trades department aflcio laid the matter before john fraser acting administrator wage and hour division dol georgine reviewed the history of the labor standards provisions of the cwa pointing to two separate sections of that statute section 513 which he stated applies davisbacon wage standards generally to cwafunded projects and section 602b6 the segment of the 1987 cwa amendments that requires davisbacon coverage through fy1994 under the srf program even if congress intended to repeal application of the davisbacon requirements in the clean water act to construction of treatment works began sic after the beginning of fiscal year 1995 section 602b6 simply failed to give effect to that intention congress left in place and did not qualify the scope of the applicability of section 513 to all construction of treatment works for which grants are made under the act when construing legislation of this type the plain statutory language should control and that sic epa cannot perform linguistic gymnastics in order to upset the plain language of the clean water act as it exists today67 copy of georgines letter was dispatched to epa administrator carol browner as well as to the member unions of the bctd dol referred the georgine letter to epa for review in october 1998 epas michael cook responded with sixpage analysis he began with the assertion that title vi limits application of the cwa davisbacon act provision to srffunded projects constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995 he stated contracts to which the united states is not party but which are awarded under federal assistance program must also comply with davisbacon act requirements if the statute authorizing the assistance so requires italics added cook stated further federal grantmaking agencies recognize that the davisbacon act applies to federally assisted construction projects only if it is required by the legislation authorizing the assistance he again pointed to the time limitation to projects constructed in whole or in part before fiscal year 1995 italics in the original having taken that initial stand cook then reviewed each of the arguments made or implied in the georgine letter and concluded that the interim period of davisbacon coverage had ended by 66 denise harris assistant counsel epa region 3 to susan jordan staff attorney us department of labor january 28 1997 with enclosure the region iii epa directive quoted here was simple draft language but presumably represented the perspective of the regional office at that juncture 67 robert georgine to john r fraser administrator wage and hour division us department of labor april 30 1997 crs18 fiscal year 1995 he added for these reasons we are confident that the position reflected in the epa memorandum cooks own earlier memorandum is the proper one and we urge the department of labor to respond to the building and construction trades council accordingly68 gradual change of policy at epa from the perspective of epa the matter was closed davisbacon should not apply did not apply as epa interpreted the 1987 statute to cwasrf projects begun after october 1994 but the issue was not entirely resolved tentative compromise is reached during the late 1990s the bctd variously conferred both with dol and with epa seeking ruling that would affirm dba coverage for cwasrf projects by early 2000 there seems to have been some shift of policy on the part of the latter agency on may 22 2000 epa wrote to bctd counsel terry yellig with copies to various epa dol and aflcio officials noting an interest in settling the labor department proceeding between epa and the building trades epa stated under the proposed settlement agreement we have drafted the agency would again require states to ensure that treatment works projects receiving cwsrf assistance directly made available by capitalization grants comply with the clean water acts davisbacon provisions for as long as grants are awarded to the states under this program in exchange for the agencys agreement the building trades would withdraw its pending labor department challenge and refrain from challenging the agency on this issue in the future once bctd had agreed to the settlement epa would commence the administrative process to give it effect depending upon the results of consultations with state and local officials and public comment through federal register notice epa reserved the right to withdraw from or withhold agreeing to the proposed settlement assuming the settlement were to proceed then epa would direct that provision be added to grant agreements entered into with the states on or after january 1 2001 requiring them to comply with section 513 of the cwa with respect to projects receiving cwsrf assistance directly made available by capitalization grants69 epa published the notice in the federal register june 22 2000 outlining the projected agreement and calling for comment it was explained that epa would prospectively apply the davisbacon acts prevailing wage rate requirements in the 68 michael b cook director office of wastewater management epa to ethel p miller office of enforcement policy government contracts team dol october 29 1998 while title vi affirms that dba does apply prior to fy1995 it does not state that it will not apply to subsequent work arguably it awaits further action by congress 69 geoff cooper finance operations law office us epa to yellig may 22 2000 where an interested party believes that the dba has been misapplied formal appeals procedure exists within the department of labor process that has on occasion led to judicial redress crs19 clean water state revolving fund in the same manner as they applied before october 1 1994 the notice reviewed the dispute and concluded epa has closely considered the relationship of cwa section 513 and cwa section 602b6 while the agencys position to date rests on reasonable legal interpretation epa is now persuaded of the appropriateness of the view that cwa section 513 imposes continuing independent obligation on the agency to ensure that davisbacon act requirements apply to any grants made under the cwa for treatment works including capitalization grants made under title vi of the cwa the language of cwa section 602b6 does not relieve the agency of this obligation furthermore as matter of policy the agency has determined that prevailing wage rate requirements applicable to federally assisted construction projects should continue to apply to federallyassisted treatment works construction in the cwsrf program in the proposed settlement agreement per it was added that while the requirements of section 513 dba would hereafter apply to srf projects other requirements identified in section 602b6 of the cwa will apply 70 the proposed settlement raised number of questions how did the parties distinguish between the initial section 513 requirement standing on its own and section 602b6 into which section 513 had been incorporated if section 513 continued to have independent applicability then why was it necessary to include it within section 602b6 at all what was the intent as used in the agreement of such phrasing as capitalization grants and directly made available which given the history of the statute could become focus of litigation even were the settlement affirmed why had epa acquiesced to enforcement of the davisbacon requirements while specifically rejecting enforcement of the other provisions of section 602b6 and were epas actions here in compliance with the administrative procedure act more broadly provision allowed epa to opt out of the agreement should testimony and comment warrant in that event the bctds sole remedy will be to reinstitute its request for ruling before the dol epa also stated in exchange for epas commitment building trades would agree not to pursue any further action on this matter before dol or any other federal administrative agency or in litigation cooks conclusions and the settlement seem at odds cook had held that dba did not apply to srf programs after october 1 1994 neither through section 513 nor section 602b671 but epa having closely considered the relationship of 70 federal register june 22 2000 p 3882838830 71 cooks argument is lengthy but he observes in part the application of section 513 is limited it applies the davisbacon act only to treatment works receiving grants from the agency section 602b6 merely extends this otherwise limited application to certain srffunded projects for certain period of time epas construction of the clear direction in section 602b6 did nothing to disturb the application of section 513 it continues to apply to treatment works for which grants are made under the cwa but not to grants for continued crs20 the two sections had now come to conclude that dba does apply and further that the language of cwa section 602b6 does not relieve the agency of this obligation what was the true meaning of the law and what was the intent of the congress was cook right or were the authors of the settlement right finally epas federal register explanation noted as matter of policy the agency has determined that prevailing wage rate requirements applicable to federallyassisted construction projects should continue to apply to federallyassisted treatment works construction in the cwsrf program italics added one may query did the proposed settlement rest on law or upon policy as enunciated by the spokesman for an administrative agency call for public comment during the summer of 2000 epa took public comment on its proposed notice of settlement two statements supported the settlement 23 opposed it testimony fell into three general categories the bctd contractor associations and state agencies responsible for dealing with the cwa several members of congress presented their views few statements focused on legal issues others argued for or against the davisbacon act per which though interesting added little insight with respect to the actual settlement72 views from members of congress representative shuster raised legal concerns he questioned whether an executive branch agency can make the decision to reapply statutory requirement that expired after september 30 1994 the act as currently written he suggested does not allow epa to take such action new legislation he stated would be needed to reinstate the dba he said that epa had failed to provide credible legal analysis of the agencys purported authority to implement this proposal73 william goodling education and the workforce chair with 10 other republican committee members called upon epa to reverse its plan to apply the davisbacon act to clean water infrastructure projects funded through the srfs they stated that the proposed settlement violates the clear intent of congress the members suggested that procedure aside applying dba to such work would be bad public policy that needlessly adds to the cost of clean water projects thus harming taxpayers consumers and communities in need of affordable clean water solutions74 71 continued capitalizing state funds see cook to miller october 29 1998 cited above 72 reaction was not so onesided as the numbers might suggest the bctd presented single statement on behalf of the fifteen national and international labor organizations affiliated with it the association of state and interstate water pollution control administrators presented testimony in its own behalf but number of individual state agencies presented testimony independently 73 honorable bud shuster to carol browner administrator us epa august 3 2000 74 honorable william goodling et to carol browner july 31 2000 crs21 industry and local government comment industry and state agencies assumed that the dba requirement had expired which both epa and the bctd would now dispute75 their subsequent comments were based on that premise the associated general contractors agc urged epa to withdraw the settlement william isokait for agc argued that the settlement is policy judgment beyond the authority of the agency for which epa offers explanation desire for settlement he chided does not grant it the authority to originate prevailing wage policy or to administer its programs in ways that contradict the laws that establish and fund those programs he termed the epa proposal inappropriate improper and inconsistent as technical matter isokait stated that section 602b6 had contained 16 administrative requirements inherited from the title ii program although the other 15 requirements had been allowed to expire in 1994 epa had selected one dealing with dba to retain why this obligation does not exist with respect to these other conditions is not explained76 charles maresca jr for the associated builders and contractors abc also accused epa of acting beyond its statutory authority in attempting to legislate via executive fiat the plain language of section 513 he stated authorizes the application of davisbacon to projects funded by grants under the act it does not authorize davisbacon application to projects funded by revolving funds to which epa has made grant in any case it would have been nullified by the sunset provision of section 602b6 like several others he charged that epa had proposed legal argument to support its new position adding the agency merely announces that it is now persuaded of the appropriateness of imposing davisbacon and that as matter of policy the application of davisbacon requirements to treatment works begun after fy1994 should resume the administration he concluded is overstepping its bounds77 the association of state and interstate water pollution control administrators expressed dismay that the settlement had been developed without input from this association or the various state agencies78 that view was echoed by number of witnesses for the states79 some questioned why epa would act at all it has been 75 the heavy highway contractors association supported

applied and congress had taken action to reinstate the requirement80 besides several commenters argued there would be little purpose in imposing dba requirements since local construction tradespeople are receiving wages that often exceed those published as davisbacon prevailing rates81 several submissions focused upon procedural issue were federal funds being made 1 to fund construction of treatment works or 2 to provide capital for the srfs which would then make loans for specific projects the importance of the distinction direct and indirect funding however was not spelled out with total clarity in the submissions nor was it developed clearly in the legislative history or for that matter in the comments of epa associated with the agreement82 were the settlement to be approved several commenters urged the effective date should be set back to allow time to notify future loan recipients and to re train personnel for implementation83 perspectives of the bctd aflcio as potential party to the settlement the bctd was presumably privy to the reasoning upon which the compromise was based thus its testimony transmitted to epa by bctd president edward sullivan could be regarded as an inside assessment the bctd stated its understanding that epa would prospectively apply davis bacon prevailing wage requirements to construction of treatment works projects assisted by state water pollution control revolving funds with funds made directly available by capitalization grants under title vi of the clean water act 84 the bctd explained in order to receive capitalization grant for its srf the states had been required to enter into capitalization grant agreement with the epa that imposes an assortment of conditions one of which was the section 602b6 79 continued

capitalization grants under title vi may benefit from amplification crs23 dba requirement included in section 602b6 by reference section 513 provided that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on treatment works for which grants are made under this act shall be paid wages at least equal to dba rates85 the effect and standing of section 513 originally applicable to title ii and of section 602b6 of the new title vi remained in dispute raising the question as to whether the federal funding in question came from epa or from the cwasrfs section 513 the bctd stated applies to all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on treatment works for which grants are made under this act not all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on treatment work by which grants are made by epa under this act that is it concluded the plain language of section 513 is not as limited as epa claimed86 the bctd then turned to congressional intent there is question that in 1987 congress intended to discontinue providing capitalization grants to the srfs after fy1994 however federal funding of capitalization grants to the states has continued unabated since fy199587 why would epa having taken very public stand that the dba did not apply to srf work suddenly reverse itself if the bctd interpretation of the law is correct the statement speculated there is potentially substantial amount of back pay liability arising from failure to pay prevailing wages and benefits on cwa projects epa has wisely decided that although its prior position rests on reasonable legal interpretation it is now persuaded of the appropriateness of the view that cwa section 513 imposes continuing independent obligation on epa to insure that davisbacon act requirements apply to any grants made under the clean water act for treatment works including capitalization grants under title vi of the cwa88 new epa policy enunciated epas final settlement agreement with the bctd appeared in the federal register of january 25 200189 first epa explained that under the settlement it would prospectively apply the davisbacon acts prevailing wage rate requirements in the clean water state revolving fund program established in title vi in the same manner as they applied before october 1 1994 second in exchange for epas

be in effect the federal register notice reviewed the controversy summarized the submissions and explained the position of the agency among other things the legal basis for reimposing the davisbacon act requirement is sound and as matter of policy it is proper for prevailing wage rates to apply to construction projects that are for all intents and purposes federallyassisted italics added reimposing the davisbacon act requirements may increase construction costs for many cwsrf recipients but the levels of those cost increases vary widely and are often insignificant although epa is interested in streamlining administrative requirements and reducing implementation costs state prevailing wage rate laws cannot substitute for the requirements of cwa section 513 the settlement however still contained the provision that were epa after the signing and publication of the settlement to fail to meet its obligations under the settlements terms the sole remedy of the building and construction trades department would be to reinstitute its request for ruling before the dol90 another reversal at epa interest groups had aligned on each side of the epabctd settlement if the trade union movement could applaud the decision as simply consistent with statute and with sound policy industry would dissent the associated builders and contractors abc protested that the settlement essentially repeals statutorily mandated sunset date of october 1 1994 and charged that it was violation of the clean water act91 nevertheless both sides agreed to work for reauthorization of the cwa in the case of the abc without davisbacon coverage for associated general contractors expansion of federal drinking water and wastewater revolving funds was top legislative priority for the 107th

was agreed epa would begin mandating davisbacon coverage on all srfassisted projects94 but epa subsequently moved the effective date back to september 1 2001 then with elaboration epa moved it back again this time to october 1 200195 thereafter there was silence some considerations of policy conceived prior to the depression the davisbacon act 1931 was passed at the urging of the hoover administration the intent was to bring stability to the construction industry and at the same time to prevent construction wages from spiraling downward as part of the depressionera decline after the act was refined and expanded in 1935 subsequent amendment has been largely technical though the davisbacon principle has been extended to more than 50 program statutes review of the davisbacon statute almost from the beginning there was debate about the statute that quickly became symbolic organized labor supported the act as did many in industry for others from industry and elsewhere the davisbacon became target with support for or opposition to the act viewed as political litmus test arguments pro and have through the years been pursued with vigor the act with the related program provisions has been litigated extensively with individual words phrases and concepts becoming grist for the contending parties on each side congressional debate over davisbacon has been intermittent at least since the 1950s but it was more or less ongoing through the 1970s 1980s and into the 1990s not infrequently dba has surfaced as subject of consideration several times during single session of the congress and given what some perceive as the ambiguity of the statute and the difficulty of its implementation one may reasonably expect that it will continue as part of the agenda of the congress and the courts davisbacon and the clean water act davisbacon prevailing wage coverage was added to what would become the clean water act in 1961 when congress created the cwasrf loan program in 1987 dba with other administrative requirements was made part of that program what happened after 1994 when srf authorizations expired remains in question federal funding and administrative requirements in 1987 congress decided to end new authorization for srfs after fy1994 almost immediately however there was recognition that further federal funding for srfs would be needed for the foreseeable future several proposals to that effect were considered 94 bureau of national affairs daily labor report january 25 2001 p a4 95 bureau of national affairs daily labor report september 14 2001 p a14 crs26 possibly because of more contentious issues wetlands for example they were not enacted but absent further authorizations congress continued to fund the srf program through the appropriations process the program is ongoing so long as the srf program received federal funding with authorizations through fy1994 congress provided that dba coverage continue given literal interpretation of the 1987 authorization that is that dba and other administrative requirements would apply only to treatment works constructed in whole or in part before 1995 one could argue that any project constructed after that time would not be dbacovered however one might also argue that congress intended to continue the initial srf program through the appropriations process and since appropriations continued to be made it might also be argued that the various administrative provisions including davisbacon in place in 1994 would continue until such time as congress intervened from this perspective there would have been change in the longstanding policy of dba coverage of cwa and cwasrf projects and need for new statement of intent by the congress the concept to which the united states is party speaking generally davisbacon coverage has taken two forms the act itself requires an agreement to pay not less than the locally prevailing wage rate be included in every construction contract in excess of 2000 to which the united states or the district of columbia is party italics added in the case of the clean water act dba prevailing wage requirement has been added to the statute with section 513 of the core act and with section 602b6 with respect to the srf program determination of what constitutes locally prevailing wage is left to the secretary of labor while the epa administrator is directed to insure that all laborers and mechanics employed on covered work are paid wages at rates not less than those found by the secretary to be prevailing in narrow legal sense the concept of is party may be interpreted as requiring that the united states through its authorized agent be an actual signatory to construction contract more broadly in the case of federally assisted programs some may argue that the recipient of federal funds loan grant tax incentive by virtue of the receipt of such assistance becomes the facto agent of the federal government and thereby takes on variety of federally imposed responsibilities the cwasrf is by and large federal program even where the federal government is not immediately signatory to specific contract under its egis srfs were established at the initiative of the federal government and have been funded largely by the federal government if there are administrative or social requirements inherent in federal funding fiduciary practice nondiscrimination etc some might argue that they should continue in place while the program continues or until specifically stricken from the statute96 here the srfs were designed to be 96 for example the states presumably having accepted federal grants to capitalize the srfs are not free to convert these funds to an unrelated purpose of their own choice eg continued crs27 ongoing one might argue that the concept of being party to an ongoing program with the responsibilities that may entail does not end simply because new federal funding is forthcoming and while the program continues to operate by virtue of the old funding97 the program even without new authorizations is ongoing and it might be argued that the federal government continues to be party to it that would seem on the surface to be implicit in the epa agreement to enforce the dba requirements prospectively and in the same manner as they applied before october 1 199498 such assumptions of course lay at the heart of the continuing dispute establishment of srfs in effect creates an intermediary between the source of the funding largely federal and the loan recipient to what extent is the continuing federal presence modified by the mechanism through which funding is made available for local abatement projects does the existence of the srfs render the federal government other than party to the construction99 the issue is legal philosophical and disputable the complexities of regulatory enforcement both davisbacon and the cwasrf initiative have enjoyed high visibility conflict about prevailing wage treatment of srffunded projects has been an issue through more than decade and suggests various policy dilemmas 96 continued highway construction public welfare or support for the arts these restraints upon how the funds might be used flow arguably from the original character of the funding mechanism 97 here one might consider the concept of first use some have argued that federal funds loaned out and then repaid lose their federal character and take on the character of the administrator of the program in this manner it is argued the federal government ceases to be party to programs it has initiated and funded and which would not exist in the absence of federal role or presence 98 in its january 2001 settlement agreement epa stated the legal basis for reimposing the davisbacon act requirements is sound and as matter of policy it is proper for prevailing wage rates to apply to construction projects that are for all intents and purposes federallyassisted italics added federal register january 25 2001 p 7762 99 legislation introduced by senator mark hatfield ror and representative curt weldon rpa in the 104th congress s 1183 and hr 2472 attempted to address these issues this legislation not adopted would have added language to the dba specifying 3 federally assisted the requirements of this act shall apply to any project for the construction rehabilitation reconstruction alteration or repair including painting and decorating of buildings or works that are financed in whole or in part by loans grants revolving funds or other assistance from the united states pursuant to statute that is enacted after the effective date of this act unless exempt or otherwise limited by federal law or b contains provision requiring the payment of prevailing wages as determined by the secretary of labor pursuant to this act crs28 was epa correct beginning in 1995 in asserting that the davis bacon requirements did not apply to srf projects or was it correct in its new position in 20002001 that davisbacon did apply if the epa were correct in either stance upon what legal foundation does its judgment rest what was the role of the department of labor through this period assuming that it had required application of dba standards prior to 1994 did it stop doing so in 1995 if so on what ground since the cwasrf initiative has and will involve multiple billions of dollars it is major undertaking are there now in place procedural restraints through which to handle conflicts of this sort davisbacon act and the cwasrfs in the 110th congress through more than decade authorization for funding of the cwasrfs has been matter of contention with the authorizing committees of both the house and the senate each time bill has been brought up for consideration various other factors were raised among them coverage under the davisbacon act and ultimately the several bills died100 in the 110th congress there has once again been consideration of clean water bills almost immediately after the congress convened the process commenced in the house as with prior congresses the issue of davisbacon remained an essential ingredient in the proceedings101 preliminaries and an early hearing on january 19 2007 the house subcommittee on water resources conducted an oversight hearing on investment in clean water infrastructures j kevin ward speaking for the council of infrastructure financing authorities cifa did not refer to the davisbacon act in his prepared testimony but he did urge that more operating flexibility be allowed for the states concept sometimes associated with an antidavisbacon stance ward continued certainly states must be fully accountable for their use of federal dollars but an excessive overlay of mandates and set asides and operational requirements will only serve to stifle innovation and interfere with the ability of states to best respond to local needs the success of this program derives from the flexibility of the srf model 100 for general background on the recent period see crs report rl33800 water quality issues in the 110 congress oversight and implementation by claudia copeland 101 bureau of national affairs daily labor report january 10 2007 p a8 crs29 with view to prospective legislation of the 110th congress ward affirmed that there are number of specific program changes that we would want to see included in cwsrf reauthorization102 jim stutler representing the national utility contractors association nuca noted that there are several policy issues that will doubt be debated during the legislative process but urged the committee to focus on the big picture stutler continued the impasse over prevailing wage requirements under the davisbacon act has stymied this legislation for too long he continued nuca represents both union and nonunion contractors and davisbacon is not an issue of contention for our members103 new bill introduced hr 720 on january 30 representative james oberstar dmn introduced hr 720 the water quality financing act of 2007104 the bill was referred to the subcommittee on water resources and environment markedup and promptly forwarded to the full committee on transportation and infrastructure subcommittee and committee action in the subcommittee january 31 2007 davisbacon again became an issue representative richard baker rla in an amendment proposed by representative thelma drake rva urged that the davisbacon language be stricken on voice vote the bakerdrake amendment was rejected and the davisbacon provision was retained105 on february 7 the house committee on transportation and infrastructure took up the sewage and wastewater measure in each case in the subcommittee and in the committee there had been controversy but it had been overcome the bill was approved in the full committee by vote of 55 yeas to 13 nays with the davis bacon provision intact the bill was ordered reported106 report from the subcommittee hrept 11030 as reported two provisions deal with davisbacon section 513 which had applied the act broadly to treatment construction was retained it required that all laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on treatment works for which grants are made under this act shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing for the same type of work on similar construction in the immediate locality 102 testimony of j kevin ward on behalf of the council of infrastructure financing authorities before the house subcommittee on water resources and the environment january 19 2007

added section 602b17 the committee report explained new section 602b17 requires the application of the davisbacon requirements for the construction of treatment works carried out in whole or in part with assistance made available from state revolving loan funds under title vi funds from section 205m of the act or both this amendment authorizes the application of the prevailing wage requirements to construction projects carried out with any financial assistance from the state revolving fund whether the source of assistance originates from federal capitalization grant funds state matching funds repayments to the fund interest payments or other sources of income to the state revolving fund and whether the character of the assistance is through loans loan guarantees or other types of assistance authorized by section 603d the report continued by establishing the davisbacon prevailing wage requirement for the construction of treatment works the committee continues its longstanding practice of ensuring the application of davisbacon where federal funds are provided for construction it added for the clean water srfs the most significant source of revenue in the state revolving funds is the federal capitalization grant as congress has done in 63 separate instances for federallyfunded construction the davisbacon act should apply to the reauthorization of the clean water srfs the committee went on to discuss the varied rationale for support of the davis bacon act to attract more experienced and better trained workers workers who are often more productive than workers with less training and experience that davisbacon work results often in the completion of construction projects ahead of schedule reducing the overall cost of the project and offsetting any increased costs due to higher hourly wage rates107 conversely representative john mica rfl together with several others suggested strong opposition mr mica stated that the bill represents an important step forward for clean water but it also takes significant step backwards by mandating and expanding upon the past application of davisbacon act prevailing wage requirements in the srf program davisbacon he stated would add to the cost of public construction and have disproportionate impact on small rural and disadvantaged communities which can least afford to pay the higher cost of projects he stated that the act was discriminatory in that few small and minorityowned firms can afford to pay the higher wages that the davisbacon act requires as result he observed they are rarely awarded davisbacon contracts and many of them stop applying for those contracts he concluded there is precedent here for applying the davisbacon act to state funds108 107 us congress house committee on transportation and infrastructure hrept 11030 water quality financing act of 2007 report to accompany hr 720 section 302 capitalization grant agreements b additional requirements last paragraph p 24 of written version

for debate in the house davisbacon was significant part of the discussion that followed in discussing the rule representative pete sessions rtx brought up davis bacon coverage stating the democrat leadership is bringing legislation to the house floor that benefits big labor bosses at someone elses expense sessions continued in order to help big labor bosses pad their dwindling ranks they would apply these same provisions davisbacon regulations to all nonfederal funds such as loan repayments state bond revenues interest and statematching funds sessions objected to this depression era wage subsidy law and its associated inflation which means that local budgets cannot build schools hospitals prisons roads and other vital projects he continued if you support fiscal responsibility small business states rights rural communities women and minorityowned businesses and the environment you will join with in opposing this rule if however instead you support environmental harm market distortion wasteful federal spending and stacking the deck in favor of labor bosses i wholeheartedly encourage you to vote for this legislation109 representative kathy castor dfl responded that some were unable to criticize the heart of this legislation that is authorization for an important part of the clean water act thus she suggested that the member from texas instead reverts to attacking portion of this legislation that is vital to workers across america the davisbacon provisions castor noted that it has become all too familiar from the other side of the aisle to attack workers across america she then affirmed that it is our policy in fact it is congresss longstanding continuing tradition of applying prevailing wage requirements to federally funded construction projects studies have shown that by attracting more experienced bettertrained workers that wage requirements lead to higher productivity and they reduce overall costs which offset any higher wages castor argued that davisbacon protects communities by ensuring that wage determination is based solely on the local workforce costs the locally prevailing wage rate further she argued with davisbacon in place oftentimes projects come in under budget and on time110 throughout floor consideration of hr 720 davisbacon was of continuing interest with members some taking strong positions either for or against the statute111 as discussion moved on to amendments representatives baker and steve king ria proposed an amendment king explained really all this amendment does is it just stops the expansion of the davisbacon and it says we are not going 109 congressional record march 9 2007 p h2346 110 congressional record march 9 2007 pp h2346h2347 111 congressional record march 9 2007 pp h2345h2368 crs32 to move this davisbacon into revolving fund baker added with respect to davis bacon it will make the compliance of the rules for rural and lower income communities much more difficult to achieve compliance with the davisbacon provisions he stated is difficult and cumbersome task112 speaking against the bakerking amendment was the chairman of the committee on transportation and infrastructure mr oberstar who noted the difference between union wage and prevailing wage this davisbacon provision is prevailing wage not union wage oberstar added it is the prevailing local wage113 on rollcall vote the bakerking amendment was defeated 140 ayes to 280 noes114 thus the davisbacon act would apply to the srfs under the housepassed version of the water quality financing act of 2007 whether on first use basis or repeatedly throughout the program following discussion of other issues the bill was adopted and was dispatched to the senate consideration of hr 720 by the senate in the senate on march 12 2007 hr 720 was read and referred to the committee on environment and public works the bill remains in committee further action having been reported 112 congressional record march 9 2007 p
