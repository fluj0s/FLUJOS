mechanics of suppression lecture given on 19 march 1962 and this is the second lecture whats the date audience 19 march 12 nineteen mar 12 and the first lecture that was not dated there was the bad auditor and this lecture has to do with the mechanics of suppression now for long time youve had lot of axioms you may have heard of them and they actually contain the basic data on suppressors the axioms of course are way ahead of us always have been trying to get technology to catch up with the axioms is one of my tougher jobs but the suppressor is already forecast in the axioms under the heading of notis and it is simply notisness and what is notisness and i for long time have played with notisness from various angles and you get simple statement there in the axioms simpler than im making now actually and that is you get the isness of something you get the alterisness of something and you get the notisness of something and notisness is peculiarly enough suppressed isness and that is all it is and if you redefined notisness as suppressed isness it is the effort to put out of existence energywise an isness it is an effort to suppress an isness elephant is standing on the front steps we say well elephants dont belong on the front steps so there is elephant on the front steps now whenever you find that running out lies out of bank has enormous numbers of applications and there are tremendous numbers of ways you can apply these particular axioms when you run lies out of bank you of course are running alterisnesses or notisnesses now lie could simply say it was something else that its childs toy on the front steps its live elephant you see we could say well its toy its an advertisement you see its something made out of rubber so theyre advertising something or we could say it doesnt exist you see and youd get lie actually covers an alter isness and notisness now alterisness is change and it sits between an isness and suppression and therefore were getting nicely tied up with time here because time is basically only mechanically so but is change time is change now cycle of action does run from nonexistence to an existence to nonexistence that is cycle of action and if you look over the time track youll find that cycle of action goes from theres nothing there theres creation there and then theres changes in the creation and then deteriorationtype changes but theyre nevertheless still changes and then we finally get nonexistence again so we run from nonexistence to existence to nonexistence and that is cycle of action they are all types of creation and so on as we know we know lot about this sort of thing but lets look and see how this directly applies the first material we have on this is science of certainty the something nothing process process in england you know they dont work in england unless you call them processes and the cycle of action was never entered into this we just talked about think of something think of nothing think of something think of nothing you know that type of alternate to get out the maybe and that was under the heading of the anatomy of maybe maybe an uncertainty guess or as most people conceive unknowns an unknown that isnt really what an unknown could be but it could be mechanical variation of unknown is simply the nomansland between the certainty that something is and the certainty that something isnt so we have these two things the certainty that something is and the certainty that something isnt and between those two things we have the maybe see we have it is and then we have it is it is uh it is uh it isnt and we get the cycle of action so you can stack cycle of action alongside of maybe and you could say change is maybe these are approximations not exact things you see now it looks in the reactive mind then as though cycle of action is maybe the middle of cycle of action so that all change is maybe and therefore if anythings changed maybe it isnt you see and you get all kinds of things if we change techniques in scientology lot of people dont think scientology exists see they say well he rons just changing his mind again oh ron hasnt changed his mind about this in long time see but they never look at the certainties we have they look at the middle see and we get something thats very peculiar we get new process and this is process now to show you how difficult it is to immediately approximate this semantically so that it can be run by mind ill call attention to the fact that the somethingnothing process is quite limited in use it has some value it you could do various things with it and other types of processes all about notis and so forth had practically use at all there have been many of them there have been processes about lies processing lying and that sort of thing and their use put it off into the step 6 phenomena creativeness we started beefing up bank and various other things have occurred by lying the processing lies you know that wasnt very successful thereve been lot of efforts here only thing im trying to sketch out for you here is this has long history and lot of efforts involved with it well lot of things come together at the same point so weve been around the fringes of these things and lot of people on the whole track have been around the fringes of us but the point im making here is i came across process which is runable process which is class i process youre perfectly at liberty by the way to run this process on somebody i dont care whether you do or dont it isnt an exactly tailored process yet you probably have to fish for the wording of it but actually the process is simply it is it isnt it is it isnt it is it isnt it is it isnt it is it isnt it is it isnt after youve gotten the pc to do the it is and it isnt and it is and it isnt for little while hell move on the time track but he ordinarily will give you direct application of this process to his case and hell deliver up to you the chronic automaticity of his case or the chronic present time problem or the chronic something of his case almost at once this is quite peculiar what youre doing of course is running the cycle of action on him youre running those two portions of the cycle of action which are important to him and in view of the fact you have said it is followed by it isnt you havent said whether it was vanishment or notis and hell always run it as suppressor so youre running direct suppressors and the thing which he is most closely and most immediately suppressing is the most likely to come into view his hidden standard or the thing that immediately is wrong with him is liable to appear almost at once now of course the thing hes trying to make up his mind about stems from the fact that he at some time or another had said that it is and then he didnt like that so he has said that it isnt and this has left him in the maybe of whether or not it ever was or is or ever will be see there is you wouldnt ever get anyplace processing person this way maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe see you would get place processing this get the idea of maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe person will fog up go out go anaten that sort of thing basically there is such thing as maybe see there is only creation and the conditions of the creation because even when cycle of action has been run it still stands there as memory the person remembered there had been see he got married got divorced he actually doesnt get nonexistence again he gets remembrance of having been married and more deeply in the bank he gets recording of having been married i dont care at what fabulously faraway time it was in time hell have slight inkling of it in other words so you dont get ever get pure nonexistence after you get any existence see the only pure nonexistence is prior to the existence so you get positive assertion of isness followed by positive assertion of it isnt you will inevitably get memories and cognitions and various other mental phenomena will occur and oddly enough this fantastically simple process it is it isnt it is it isnt it is it isnt it is it isnt will produce practically every other phenomenon in scientology it stems out of existence and nonexistence which of course stems out of perception and dont want to perceive which of course goes over into creativeness and destruction and all the time youre jumping across wild bands of change so youre getting the certainty that it is and the certainty that it isnt and the certainty that it is and the certainty that it isnt and all of sudden you get all this change boiling up and boiling over because of course change is simply the different conditions of an existence leading to nonexistence or new condition of positiveness the uncertainty of the case blows off now the fellow with the open mind the fellow who doesnt know the fellow who isnt sure the fellow who just grinds and never gets cognition this fellow who cant find out the fellow who has memory of the whole track the fellow who just doesnt ever recognize that maybe it well i can say that it does and i can say yes i suppose i could assume uhhuh maybe uh well yes and all of his conversation is like this you ever read any scientific papers of the last twenty or thirty years you know if the universe exists they dont want to get stuck with any isnesses see they dont want to be guilty of any isnesses i was sitting in front of the meter of course i was sitting in mark vi type chair using hungover type lamps and the reflective qualities on the screen were x970 and i uhuhuhbelieve that i perceived uhuh apparently uh as the needle registered uh that is if the machine were on which would have to be verified by the machine operator uh that uh if i uh recall properly uh and if i am not controverted by the faculty or my immediate superior there were 230 volts on the mains that day i think that is forthright scientific statement thats just about as flat out as scientist these days could get without being shot by his brethren most of the boys get upset about in the field of science is because i will say something is or something isnt and i dont qualify it i dont say well if the faculty gives permission you see or something like that then i could guess that maybe adjectival clause modifying paragraph b that adverbial phrase modifying verb g might finally turn out to be guess you see and in view of the fact that i dont talk that way they think im unscientific you have to be doubtful to be scientific well it sure hangs these guys in an awful muddled mess doesnt it now the very funny part of it is you could take that exact frame of mind and have the boys say it is and it isnt and it is and it isnt get the concept that it is get the concept that it isnt fellow says get the concept of what was what you say well just it it anything it it it uh i dont know what you mean by that you see he might have quite an argument on this other itd be very laughable because of course he is trying to get the idea that it is and he runs into the maybe see and he cant get clean idea that is see nor can he get clean idea that it isnt youd have to actually rehabilitate him into being able to get clean idea that something was and something wasnt you watch the boys in charge of the abombs and the stuff we breathe right at the present moment are mostly in that frame of mind you know the hbomb marchers missed their bet you know they miss their bet all the time if they wanted really to wipe out the hbomb they wouldnt worry about that theyd just insist that all the atomic scientists and politicians that had anything to do with the hbomb produce proper sanity certificates so that they could be and that they should be examined by psychiatrists and so forth theyd drive everybody batty but the funny part of it is none of these guys could pass see because it may be all right to drop it maybe see but it might not be all right but thats neither here nor there that doesnt have anything to do with us to even that they add irresponsibility you see they all stand in this middle ground its the noresponsibility attitude so youd have hard time on that type of case thats very low scale as case youd have hard time getting that person to get positive idea of something was and something wasnt and they could get such cleancut idea theyd get something was i guess and something wasnt rrrrrrr perhaps so theyre always on the verge of having something being revealed suddenly and it would scare them to death they make very bad auditors they in fact wont talk to you about auditing anybody theyd much rather jump out of their scientific boots and instantly and immediately hold forth with pope pius who said that nobody should monkey with the human mind i think thats direct quote nobody should monkey with the human mind you or i would not want somebody coming into his basement i think that was direct quote i think it was its papal bull and therefore you shouldnt want to have somebody come into your mind thats right in view of the fact that we got withholds we dont want to be invaded now theres frame of mind that is always on the idea of revelations only their revelations let call to your attention are delusory revelations tremendous numbers of angels are going to sing on heads of pins you see youre suddenly going to get vision of some holy messiah holding his head in saucer or something of the sort standing in front of him youre going to get word which is going to come down from shaft of light through the heavens you see and suddenly all is going to be well only the shaft comes over the left shoulder you get terrific superstition you get all types of religious revelations so you get scientific revelations well of course our current scientific revelation is so out of control that it takes the form of an h bomb now thats revelation boom and of course nobody can face that much revelation so they say well it doesnt exist so people keep calling attention to the hbomb the hbomb the hbomb the hbomb the h bomb the h nobody can look at this hbomb see what they got to do is call attention to the fellow who pushes the button the fellow who pushes the button the fellow who pushes the button the fellow who pushes the button hahahaha people would look at him and you say well we want to see psychiatric investigation of all the fellows who are going to push the button immediately the whole public is liable to get very interested see because they can face the guy whos going to push the button and they can face button but they cant face the bomb so you see the hbomb marchers are trying to get too much revelation for the public to assimilate so all they got to do is cut back the revelation very simple mechanism cut back the revelation to ping ping see now you do that with scientology you say well we make the clear we do this and do that and you get healthy and all that sort of thing and its terrific and you get more intelligent and so forth and its just too much revelation now if you said to the fellow you know have you got an ache or pain the fellow says well yeah as matter of fact i got bad pain in the back of my neck back of my neck back of my neck well you say well scientology would take quite while to help that say it must be pretty true then you could do this weird stunt with him see you could say well ill show you ill just show you now get the idea theres pain there good get the idea theres pain there good get the idea theres pain there good get the idea theres pain ow youd say there you see thats scientology the fellow says you just about blew my silly head off thats scientology well you could say you could say well can is the pain still there as matter of fact it isnt well there you are pain scientology pain scientology there was hell of pain there minute ago nevertheless he could confront it because its slightly on did you ever stop to think about that he may have an awful pain his stomach may be in absolute agony but hes got it totally suppressed so he doesnt know that see hes going totally to pieces but he doesnt ever find out about that until you started running just general it is or it isnt and he was functioning on this and was thinking the ideas id check on this have you followed the auditing command or have you missed any auditing commands id do that about every six or eight commands if i were running this you know just check the end rudiment do five six commands have you missed an auditing command well yes i didnt get that one id make him go get that one and then give it to you few more times get him so he was really doing it and youll be amazed some of the most fantastic pains that people are totally unaware of will suddenly turn on in parts of the body where theyre having malfunction nonpainful malfunction is what drives the medico mad this the medico cant understand what is nonpainful malfunction you see theres agony connected with it theres pain connected with it the person is just all out of gear you see he should be standing up straight and he makes picture like corkscrew doesnt hurt now you try to do something for this fellow and of course it doesnt hurt and nothing happens well why does nothing happen well he just suppresses you too and you want to see one of these guys twisted up like corkscrew and all messed up like fire drill you try to do something for that person he lets you he wont have any cognition and nothing will happen and hell break your heart the only thing that happens is he just suppressed you and the treatment too ah but you get him to say it is haha it isnt it is it isnt i dont care how you get him to say it is or it isnt you could probably do it by feel it is it there dont feel it now dont feel it feel something else dont dont feel it all right now feel it feel it good now dont feel it probably something wild would happen i mean theres various ways you could do this it appears it doesnt appear it appears it doesnt appear you see thats the it is it isnt theres various variations but you oddly enough dont have to go off into these variations the mind tries to go off into dozens of variations the second you start to think of it because it gets into this obsessive change see if you were trying to run this on yourself i guarantee that within five or six commands youd be running another command see i just guarantee it because youd be running another command and youd never really notice change you got on to something that was hotter thats how youd explain it to yourself right how the hell did you get onto something hotter if it is it isnt turned on the hotter thing hahaha you get back to run it is it isnt it is it isnt and the thing that you got on to that was hotter will blow off thats just the isness and the notisness is really what youre asking somebody to run youre asking him to run directly suppressors you say there sits the object unsuppressed good there it sits suppressed haha good youre running this identically you see there sits the object freshly beautifully created thats fine now there sits the object beautifully disappeared but still there thank you get the idea now there it sits unsquashed by you there it sits squashed by you thank you thats what youre getting and of course you get continuous consecutive appearances because you get all the appearances coming up that the guy has squashed and you get him moving on the time track and you get this cycle of action going you start him completing cycles of action we dont care which way he completes them some people complete them like it is it isnt see and thats cycle of action but the other people are completing them it isnt it is quite weird do you see how this works now theres only two things can happen to person is to have nothing appear and have something appear thats the only two things that can happen to person see see even the consequences of having made something appear is just getting something else to appear so the two conditions of any game are appearance and nonappearance and we get the anatomy of games which is where i studied this thing out originally i was studying games when i finally calculated down to level of that we dont have to know too much about games we scientology fundamentals of thought gives you about all there is about that but you get down to more fundamental fundamental and you get down to this fact of that is game something is something isnt and there are all kinds of ramifications of it is you see you dont have to say what it is you know but you can say put anything in the game in it take the opposite player all right he is or he isnt see he is behind your goal post or he is in front of your goal post or he is in front of his own goal post or he is in front of you you see thats isness by location which is via but now lets just take the overall purpose of the game and the overall purpose of the game is you were the catchalots and hes the sharks and up catchalots and disappear sharks see so totally the end of the game is is catch alots that you want you see and sharks and he wants is sharks catchalots and you get your basic disagreement which gives you game now this it is it isnt is all that reads on an emeter the middle between is what reads on the meter the amount of is that the person can conceive compared to the amount of isnt the person can conceive finds the disagreement between the isnt and the is which gives you read all the meter reads is disagreement and that is the basic disagreement basic disagreement youre sitting in the room with presbyterian and he says an angel has just descended in that rocking chair and you say there isnt any angel in the rocking chair and he says there is an angel in the rocking chair and thats basic disagreement well if you had two valences in one mind an atheist and presbyterian lets say these are two valences that have occurred in the goals problem mass see theres those two valences you get terrific registry when you hit either one well why do you get terrific registry when you hit an atheist well thats because of the pressure over here from the unseen pressure of the presbyterian and why do you get such tremendous charge whenever you hit presbyterian well thats because of the unseen atheist quite fascinating you know youll blow just as much charge off by getting the oppterm as youll get the term if you list the terminals if you make list of pcs terminals theyre giving him pain the whole way and you get so much tone arm motion so much charge and so much blowdown and so forth if you oppterm that right away youll get the equal amount if you get the exact oppterm sometimes you get gradient scales of oppterms in other words you get associated oppterms that are out here some distance and gradually walk in and you eventually collide with the actual oppterm so you can get your hands on one side of the picture and then get your hands distantly on the other side of the picture but you will eventually if you blew tremendous amount of charge off case by assessing the case out to atheist eventually on some other line some other time maybe when you opptermed it why you got idol but somehow or another you got another thing and you finally wound up and you found out the thing the package that put that goals problem mass you see the problem versus the problem youll all of sudden find this terrifically hot other side see the other side you know when they hit this atheist that it just blew zooooom see well youre doing this is ten items later and on totally independent line you all of sudden hit this presbyterian see and it all of sudden goes squash boom crash and its just the same amount of force and power there was in atheist because those things had to be equal to be in balance and the whole mass goes out of balance when you discharge one but that one wont discharge totally itd discharge the other one then they all both go they tend to go out of line when you discharge one and sometimes you dont find the oppterm at once because its kind of slippery im just giving you examples of the thing now why are those two valences counteropposed and why do they get so much charge one versus the other on the emeter well thats because one is saying certain principles are and the other is saying certain principles arent and the second one i just mentioned are saying certain principles are and the first one i just mentioned is saying certain principles arent so theyre in violent disagreement and youll notice this is the common denominator of every opposed goals problem mass package is the fact that you get the atheist versus the priest or something you get the virgin and the harlot you get the child and the mother you get things that make problems ones against the other theyll be opposites in various ways so you have saintly person versus the devil devilish person you see well its the disagreement between these two things and one stands for certain isnesses and certain isntnesses and the other stands for certain isnesses and certain isntnesses it isnt that one stands for is and one stands for isnt but its practically everything that one conceives is the other conceives isnt and then that is reversed the other way to so that everything the second one conceives is the first one conceives isnt so you have this tremendous number of items all these isnesses are opposed by all these notisnesses and then we have all these isnesses opposed by these notisnesses and so it everything is just blah and you hit these two you get heavily charged mass and of course it wont discharge and the person gets somatics and everything goes mad every time you hit the thing in the bank and it restimulates and has total command over the person and its violent well its simply violent because of all these disagreements well how could you find it on the meter well its just because its full of disagreements thats all and thats the is and isnt the funny part of this is is this theory could probably be put into any process you could probably i dont say you should but you could probably prepcheck with this with this type of zero question have you ever considered another didnt exist or have you ever insisted another didnt exist use that as zero question well itd be rather hot and very lengthy but itd sure run i dont recommend it as it merely would run well have you ever insisted something was youd get youd get tremendous number of overts because of course every overt hes got either consists of asserting that something was or asserting that something wasnt and there are only really two classes of overts when you damage something youre trying to insist that it isnt and when youre creating something youre trying to assert that it is and when somebody else is trying to create something you may be trying to help him create it or trying to keep him from creating it and when hes trying to notis something you are either trying to assist him notis it or youre trying to prevent him from notising it and these frames of mind im afraid are very black and white aristotle to the contrary now aristotle said that everything was black and white and non aristotelian logic is the favorite logic of semantics and modern science and of course it insists that theyre fantastic numbers of shades of gray and that there are positives and negatives well that sounds to like an awful big goals problem mass i admit there are lots of shades of gray and i admit lot of gradient scales and i admit lot of these things but to say that positives dont exist from standpoint of somebodys reality is going pretty far thats going pretty far you can say ultimates are unobtainable thats fact thats fact it course thats telling you an infinite an infinite total presence or total absence of zero these things are but it would not be maintainable but to say that merely positives not ultimates but positives couldnt exist that would just be pure nonsense and im afraid that is the nonsense on which modern science is making its basic errors but you start dealing with positives after all youre positive youre sitting in chair right this minute arent you well you are its good enough positive we dont say youre the ultimate but you certainly are see and you arent at home are you right at this moment you arent at home are you male voice well thats fairly positive isnt it youre not at home now to the degree that youve left something home or are going to return home that reduces the ultimate of homeness not youness you see and to the degree that youre not going to sit here all night thats ultimate of hereness so what you get is as time drags out positiveness reduces the less concept person has of time the less concept they have of time the less positive things seem get the idea so we get all of our concepts of present time the hereness and nowness of it have you ever had havingness being run on you and all of sudden the walls got awfully bright you know i mean common experience what you actually did was not having the walls get any solider or brighter but you became more aware of the nowness of the instant thats actually what happened all you have to be is very aware of the nowness of the instant and you get quite lot of isness and the odd part of it is you get lot of notisness but your notisness goes from not notisness to nonexistence now the person is sitting there and hes surrounded by these masses theres just masses masses masses you know hes just got masses oh boy you know just packed in blah and so on although hes rather thin person he has to have truck move him you know and he got masses masses those are all notisnesses those are all nonexistences the first thing hed say about all of them is theyre nonexistence thats thats what his first declaration concerning them they dont exist so you see as he came up to present time the walls got brighter these things would disappear see but when youre running some people on havingness it comes from notisness to nonexistence on such clearcut track that as you run havingness on them and make the walls more real their bank materializes and they have people standing in the room you see what you do is run off the notisness by running on the isness of the wall see the wall gets very real to them and theyre getting their time track stretched out you see and theyre getting more here in this particular instant of nowness you see and they keep looking over at the corner and you finally say whats the matter with the corner well its just that my aunt agatha seems to be standing there and i know she isnt there but shes awfully threedimensional few more commands well hows aunt agatha well shes gone why why are you worried about aunt agatha i wasnt worried about it in other words the notisness which pushed this mockup of aunt agatha into invisibility released as the persons reality on the wall increased you ran out the invisibility of the isness here you understand that person could actually conceive this these sheets of paper to not exist while at the same time he was looking straight at them well theres funny mechanism in the bank where he can go kind of squash with energy you know and he makes the mental image picture just disappear well you make the wall get real and of course you make this notisness run out and what do you find the fellow beholding he beholds this threedimensional picture ulp he beholds aunt agatha in the middle of the room sometimes in auditing somebody if youre being very successful in running some process or another doesnt matter what process havingness or bank or prepchecking or anything else he might have two or three dead bodies lying in the room at the same time awfully solid so solid that hes absolutely sure he can reach out and touch them and theyd be solid but if the fellows fairly well adjusted in existence and the auditor is running smooth session and that sort of thing you very often arent told this fact he says all right he knows what they are they its bank manifestation and theyll go away and they do and he forgets about it what you did is theyve always been there and he had them notised so that he never saw them but my god did he have to be careful in life every time he sat down in room hed have to make sure that this body this body and that body were notised somebody would say well how are you joe and hed say i was reading the stock exchange papers today and i saw some very interesting things people wouldnt ever notice that hed never said it answered how he was haha well monkey you say how about giving you little auditing joe well i dont think id well actually we dont have much time you know youre liable to have materialization of dead body number one dead body number two and dead body number three and he just doesnt like to look at them i mean after youve killed people been responsible for their deaths you dont like to stand around looking at them some people dont theyre peculiar i know i have at times gloated not like you on the track youve always been social about the thing ive actually been crass enough to stand there and say haha but its not the thing to do you know so i have to withhold that actually he knows because hes learned that if he sits down in certain type of room this thing starts to loosen up and he starts to feel sort of peculiar so he has to get very interested and he has to get very occupied and he never can sit quietly woman made funny remark to one time i told her i said well i think ill sit down for while and rest and she said well what are you going to do and i said nothing oh youre going to read huh just nothing youre going to think about something why all of sudden she practically spun in you know the idea of just sitting down and not doing anything and not thinking about anything and not having your mind occupied this caused her to get sensation of spinning in what was that sensation well you had to keep yourself distracted if you didnt keep yourself distracted something would appear well the question is what would appear its actually mental image picture that will appear and thats all that will appear and theyre deathly afraid of mental image pictures or the appearance of something all right the fellow that you audit and audit and audit and audit and audit and go on and on and on and on and on and audit and audit and audit and audit and audit and audit and audit and audit and they never get any pictures oooh youre dealing with classic you got total suppression nothings going to appear whats the matter with him well whats he afraid is going to appear thats simple question you make list of things who or what would be afraid to find out youre asking for appearance you see just to have him list that ahhhhhhh that would be the most horrible thing you ever tried to do to that poor fellow ruin him ruin his case the odd part of it is as you went at this and went deeper into it and opptermed the terminals you found and found other analogous lines and so on you would get appearances place gets haunted from time to time you know the dead bodies start to show up yeah hes got them all beautifully squashed and sometimes they bleed green and this is very startling now sometimes somebody has been in weakened condition has suddenly taken his attention off one of these things and its materialized auggggggg fair slaughtered him it did actually practically scared him out of his wits hell say hes been blanketed i know of case sat down in well this case absolutely shattered sat down in dentists office i think it was something like that or away in doctors office and all of sudden this fantastic terrible dizzying series of cones turned on over the body case went stark staring mad went home and never left home from that year to the next until finally audited on an engram in old dianetic days now thats not one just one case see the case for moment peculiarly just didnt notis this particular mass and it went into action case changed its mind in certain way and got this thing materialized see well it was always there except they took their notis off of it and it went zzzzzzt and then they stopped it see with new suppression and they said something had happened to them yes thats true something had happened to them theyd stopped notising for moment pretty desperate so this case in being audited of course afterwards would be very carefully notis and then answer the auditing question not is and then answer the auditing question except they wouldnt do it consciously so that itd never wear out well the case wouldnt ever really ever make any progress would it at all hahahaha case knew theyd better not let their mind change now actually there are some pretty hideous phenomena occur there are various sensations and motions and sick stomachs and terror stomachs and backs of heads falling off and noses disappearing and all of sudden the pc looks down and cant see himself from the thighs down you know its just all vanished you get upset well the thing to do is to go on through see and not let the pc stop on such thing or be upset about such thing because youre just running into an is and it isnt type of manifestation and if you can get an it is youll certainly sooner or later get an isnt and this used to upset auditors once in while in the old days when we were running notknow notknowing peoples heads and hats and so forth and what could you notknow about this one and auditors would go mad on this you know every once in while thatd youd never hardly get anybody to run this cleanly because the pc would say well yes i did that and the auditor would say oddly enough and mistakenly say well did what well i notknew his head all right hes walking down the street with head and the auditor would get so curious at this moment this was the worst trouble with this process why we dont use it anymore the auditor would get so curious that hed stop and question the pc as to what happened and how it happened and everything else and then walk around in circles and not finish the process and skip the whole thing well of course this was terribly restimulative on the subject of this not find out button wasnt it you were running straight into the notis and the auditor all of sudden had been running process he didnt realize that he was in that much danger but he was running process which would turn off and turn on notisness ooooooooooh ooooh maybe itd all go the other way you see many people dont have time track they have series of not isnesses many people dont have any present time at all they just have generality of comfortable notis they are the calm people you know calm as whizbang on guy fawkes fourth of july anyhow the manifestations you see as result of this particular activity of notis brings about an isness because when the notisness disappears the isness materializes and of course it can be guaranteed to occasionally scare pcs spitless and after its happened to him once after that they make sure nothing happens to their case oh its not going to happen to again i want to keep that from happening again which is duplication and nothing happens you see that an isness appeared because notisness ran out then you get manifestation you get pictures actually solid objects will appear in room right with the pc all kinds of wild things will occur i know what this is because one time i was running being run through something and ran into something and i ran into european battle where the columns of soldiers and the grass and the soldiers and everything and the guns and the smoke and all perceptions were much more there than present time was there they were all lined up firing at each other in volleys you know it was quite surprise do you know quite surprise it didnt last very long i didnt have hardly time to duck before the but it was startling to say the least now much brighter than this room appears at the moment you see facing up to and exchanging volleys with other company in company front formations you see what bigger overt is there about twenty paces between the ranks slaughter you know well there is lot of isness there man because you see firing the gun is an insistence on beingness see somebody comes along and says youre not so much and you swell up at once like frog you know pooooof see i is see here i is i is im big im big shot im not this thing youre trying to notis you see get the idea ooooo see girl immediately puts on more lipstick men swell up or fire guns it all depends on what civilization youre living in girls adopt bustles and falsies theres telling what theyll do in the manifestation but thats representing an isness see somebody else comes along says theyre good see they shouldnt do that paints bad dresses are bad these things everybody should be natural all kinds of campaigns oh my dear what beautiful hat ive liked it ever since last year various types and degrees and grades you see of isness and not isness you know well of course where person in the bank has been asserting isness and somebody else has been asserting notisness or somebody else has been asserting isness and where he has been asserting notisness you get there are various bank phenomena and they turn on and they turn off and one hardly knows whats happening but its where they get stuck that the pc gets worried so if he gets into these things he gets afraid to find out things will materialize you see something is liable to materialize something is liable to appear god knows what will happen hes got somebody talking about his bank so lord knows whats going to appear hes just shocky on the subject of things appearing that is the only thing wrong with this bad auditor he gets leery having things appear pc is liable to materialize something hes liable to get restimulated telling what might happen well the thing to do is get him over being scared of this sort of thing as i say you can get him over it educationally you can get him over it directly with process before we only had education to get him over it now we have direct process to get him over it you can get person over notisness in various ways it is it isnt it is it isnt thats kind of lengthy 3d criss cross various types of notisness in prepcheck questions and more important than these other manifestations at the moment is you can go ahead and do this and ill give you bulletin on it and if it doesnt work out why thats fine but i know itll work out because i gave it little more testing and checking and that is change in the withhold system that gives you this same manifestation now your withhold system goes what when all and who isnt that right audience voices mmhm and thats the totality of the withhold system all right now lets buck the withhold system up and have it take care of suppressors and i think you will find although i dont guarantee this i havent done as much testing on this as i should have i think you will find and that youll be on safe ground that it will run an engram if you do this so that you could prepcheck and if you ran into an engram and thats the primary reason why you shouldnt go whole track with the thing it might not run an engram you see i think with this additive i think you will find itll run an engram thats just good guesstimate thats an expert piece of guesstimate by my part if you add appear before you add who youve got your zero question you get your what question ive been working on this trying to make prepchecking little easier for you and i have some other little changes in prepchecking ill give you later but you can use this one at once now these are just how you get the subject of your zero question so it doesnt influence what im talking to you about right now and you say when just as you have been all just as you have been appear and who now how do you say appear well what might have revealed itself at that point or what might have appeared at that point or is there anything that should have shown up or is there anything that didnt show up you see any variation on this subject of appear what might have revealed itself at that moment and just run that in before you say who and what you say well what might have appeared and the pc says well haha the cops well who didnt know about it well the police of course yeah here we go and you took the suppressor off the police see so this is just removing suppressors just little mechanism for the removal of suppressor off of withhold which should make the withhold much more rapidly cleanable im aiming in the direction however of using the this question system of running an engram i havent expected it to run engrams ive just been expecting to run locks of withholds but i think beefed up to that degree theres possibility that it will directly run engrams not that you use it directly on an engram but if your pc got into one there itd go what might have appeared do you see should anything have appeared anything that makes sense and just use the word reveal or appear question mark you get the maybe off of the thing and just run that in its all right you can go ahead and make few mistakes first time youre getting used to the when all who well its when all appear who is that all of it well what should have appeared okay and who should have found out about that and didnt and i think itll take the suppressors off well now there is the constituency and the consistency of the mind as regards to auditing talked to you first in the other lecture about the inhibitions of the auditor this has been more on the basis of what happens with the pc and if the pc has something materialize which then mysteriously disappears and the pc sits there comfortably forevermore haha i think you must have missed do you see how it would be pc says awful pain in the well thats all right now go ahead with the next auditing question its all right with he just suppressed the living daylights out of that one well howre you going to work around it dont because if youre running on suppressors the rest of it will run out doesnt require any particular or special handling if youre running an appearance so the suppression that you often got you know on running early sessions have you noticed that running some early sessions person repressed past lives or repressed this or repressed that and so forth well now running withholds youll probably pull off those suppressors and the thing shows up now there are possibly other ways of handling suppressors there undoubtedly are there are possibly neater ways of handling this and so forth and they will be developed as they develop i personally at the present moment consider the ways ive given you completely adequate to your purposes all i need to give you now to smooth out your prepchecking completely is method of finding the zero questions and so forth accurately and instantly on this particular pc and i got that worked out too but its late and i will talk to you about that next time thank you
