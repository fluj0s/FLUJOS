removed to yield clean raw wool sheep producers are influenced by both the price of meat lamb and mutton5 and wool producers sell lamb and mutton when meat prices are high therefore reducing the size of their inventory however producers sell wool when wool prices are high increasing the size of their inventory some of the issues involved in sheep production include predator losses hired labor costs labor shortages the cost of treating sheep for hoof and skin problems and competition with cattle producers for grazing land labor water and marketing and transportation facilities as shown in

historically have been much smaller than imports less than 10 million pounds annually in 2003 wool exports rose above 10 million pounds to 11 million pounds in 2007 wool exports increased to 171

agriculture there were 46255 farms with sheep and lambs used for wool production there are two types of wool territory and fleece territory wool is used to make better quality apparel and is produced in territory wool states which include texas south dakota the rocky mountains and the pacific coast states th flock size for territory pr oduction typically ranges from 150 to 400 sheep although some producers may ve several thousand sheep according to usda approximately 70 of all us sheep are located in territory wool states fleece wool is used to make coats blankets and sweaters it is produced in fleece wool states which include virginia west virginia pennsylva nia states north of the ohio river and the great plains area the flock size for fleece production ranges from 20 to 50 sheep and typically is only small part of farm that may also raise cattle hogs and field crops the demand for wool is affected by fash ion relative fiber prices price variability and the economy consumer acceptance of manmade fibers began in the mid 1950s manmade fibers which are sometimes mixed with wool are fashionable and offer conveniences such as dripdry washing shrinking and moth damage the us textile industry started using noncellulosic manmade fibers s uch as nylon polyester and acrylic because of its relative price stability and durability us sheep and lamb prices and foreign supply and dema nd cause price variability b ecause the united states has small share of the wool market and textile mills import over half of the wool they use manmade fiber production s minimal price variability and does not depend on biological lags and annual shearings so the quality does not vary and since it is manufactured domestically foreign supply and demand have little eff ect on us
