makes its ipr protection regime conform to the wto agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights trips upon accession us government and business officials have given taiwan relatively good marks for its wto implementation efforts to date however complaints have arisen over number of issues including inadequate enforcement of ipr laws failure to privatize stateowned enterprises lack of transparency for trade rules and regulations restrictive sps measures uneven administration of tariffrate quotas especially for rice and regulatory barriers on pharmaceuticals and telecommunications wto and taiwanchina commercial ties bilateral trade flows have grown substantially since taiwan and china joined the wto despite the current lack of direct economic and political links most trade goes through hong kong according to taiwan trade data its exports to china have risen from 99 billion in 2002 to 34 billion in 2004 up 243 while imports have risen from 79 billion to 167 billion up 111 making china one of taiwans fastest growing trading partners see table 2 in 2004 alone taiwan exports to and imports from china rose by 589 and 518 respectively in 2004 over 2003 levels 7 taiwan places significant restrictions on imports from china especially products that might compete directly with taiwanesemade goods many trade restrictions have been lifted in recent years which has boosted imports from china taiwans trade policies have helped it maintain large trade surpluses with china taiwans trade data indicates that it had 173 billion trade surplus in 2004 while chinese data estimate that surplus at 513 billion table 2 taiwans major trading partners 2004 billions total trade exports imports trade balance japan 568 132 436 304 united states 498 281 216 65

from and exports to taiwan were 648 billion and 135 billion respectively the disparity between chinas and taiwans trade data is likely the result of how the two sides count trade that passes through hong kong the chinese data would indicate that significant share of taiwan exports to hong kong as reported in official taiwanese trade data is actually reexported to china crs5 hong kong 319 298 21

many of its laborintensive export oriented industries to the mainland the actual level of taiwanese fdi in the mainland is greatly debated taiwan maintains restrictions on the amount and types of investment that are allowed to be made in china by taiwanese investors although many seek to circumvent these restrictions by investing in the mainland through offshore companies taiwanese data show the cumulative level of taiwanese fdi in china through 2004 at about 413 billion or about half of its cumulative fdi some taiwanese business groups contend that the actual level of taiwanese fdi in china is far higher than taiwanese and chinese official data with estimates ranging from 60 billion to over 150 billion according to taiwans ministry of finance mof taiwanese fdi flows to the mainland over the past five years have increased by leaps and bounds the mof estimates that the share of taiwans total fdi going to the mainland on an annual basis rose from 333 in 2000 to 672 in 2004 an indication that mainland china has become the dominant destination for taiwanese investors8 electronics and electrical industries are the largest recipients of taiwanese fdi in the mainland according to report by the center for strategic and international studies csis taiwan invested firms employed total of 82 million chinese workers 39 percent of chinas urban labor force and produced 702 billion in output or 46 percent of chinas total industrial output9 since 1996 the taiwanese government has maintained haste be patient policy seeking to limit the level of taiwanese investment with the mainland for security reasons but this policy has come under review in recent years mainly because of growing economic problems in taiwan the economic slowdown in the united states and other major world economies in 2001 caused taiwanese exports especially information technology products to decline sharply raising unemployment to record levels 53 in november 2001 and pushing the economy into recession real gdp declined by 21 these conditions led several taiwanese government and business officials to call for an abandonment of the haste be patient policy as means to help revive the economy in august 2001 taiwanese president chen shuibian endorsed the replacement of the haste be patient policy with an active opening effective management policy which would relax current restrictions on investment in the mainland establish commercial links with china and gradually allow mainland investment in taiwan supporters of closer economic integration with the mainland argue that taiwanese firms must take advantage of chinas growing demand for goods and services as well as its abundant lowcost labor in order to stay competitive in world markets several taiwanese business representatives have called on the taiwanese government to remove restrictions on direct commercial links with the mainland as such restrictions add 8 taiwan ministry of finance press release march 20 2005 9 center for strategic and international studies taiwans crossstrait economic strategy and the wto by jane skanderup january 2004 crs6 significant costs to doing business with china10 some supporters of normalized trade relations with the mainland have called on the taiwanese government to negotiate an fta with china many taiwanese policymakers believe that closer economic ties with the mainland will help to stabilize the relationship and reduce the likelihood of chinese invasion opponents of closer ties with china contend that such policies will accelerate the transfer of taiwanese firms to the mainland leading to hollowing out of core industries and raising the level of unemployment in taiwan another major concern is over becoming too economically dependent on the mainland and thus becoming more vulnerable to political pressure from china chinese officials have indicated support for direct trade links with taiwan but have often predicated that support on taiwans acceptance of beijings one china principle which states that taiwan is part of china position rejected by taiwans government more recently it appears that chinese officials have tended to avoid tying political issues to closer economic ties perhaps in part in the belief that closer economic cooperation will advance chinas goal of reunification however crossstrait relations remain volatile for example on march 14 2005 the chinese government enacted into law its long standing stated policy that it would use military force if taiwan declared independence the taiwan government responded by announcing that it would slow down the pace at which certain industries are allowed to invest in china and the pace at which bans on certain imports from china are relaxed11 some us policymakers have expressed concern that china may attempt to use its expanding economic power and taiwans growing dependence on its economic ties to the mainland to undermine taiwans autonomy some members of congress have indicated support for ustaiwan free trade agreement fta that would reduce trade barriers by both sides thus boosting ustaiwanese economic ties12 bush administration officials have indicated support for such an fta but only after taiwan first agrees to resolve various trade disputes with the united states in particular taiwans inadequate enforcement of ipr and trade barriers on telecommunications services pharmaceuticals and various agricultural products13 on november 29 2004 the united states and taiwan resumed discussions after six year hiatus under the trade and investment framework agreement tifa forum designed to resolve major trade and investment disputes progress towards resolving current trade disputes being addressed 10 one study found that establishing direct trade links between china and taiwan would boost gdp on both sides by 3 and increase trade by total of 10 billion see peter chow francis tuan and zhi wang wto accession and economic integration among taiwan hong kong and china pacific economic review october 2001 11 taiwan ministry of finance press release march 14 2005 12 legislation was introduced in the 108th congress hconres 98 rep ramstad expressing congressional support for ustaiwan fta the bill had 69 cosponsors 13 some progress has been made on these issues especially on ipr the international intellectual property alliance iipa estimates that ipr piracy in taiwan cost us firms 314 million in lost sales in 2004 down from 465 million in 2003 in november 2004 press release the iipa stated that taiwan had made significant law reform and enforcement progress in 20032004 but stated that piracy remains high and that much work remains to be done in january 2005 the ustr upgraded taiwans ipr status from priority watch list to watch list in recognition of taiwans progress in improving ipr protection crs7 under the tifa could lead to an agreement to begin discussions for bilateral fta china may oppose ustaiwan fta especially if it views taiwans motivation for such an agreement as political rather than economic it is not clear whether chinese opposition would discourage the united states from pursuing an fta with taiwan for other versions of
