specialist in social security domestic social policy division social security the public servant retirement protection act hr 2772s 1647 summary worker is covered by social security if he or she pays into social security through the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi payroll tax currently 96 of all workers are covered by social security the majority of non covered positions are held by federal state and local government employees the currentlaw windfall elimination provision wep reduces the social security retirement or disability benefits of workers who also receive pension from employment not covered by social security the goal of the wep was to remove an unintended advantage that the regular social security benefit formula provided to employees who divided their careers between covered and noncovered positions as of december 2006 approximately 971300 beneficiaries approximately 2 of the entire beneficiary population at that time had their benefits reduced as result of the currentlaw wep on june 19 2007 representative kevin brady introduced hr 2772 the public servant retirement protection act psrpa which would alter the currentlaw wep formula for those who first enter nonsocial securitycovered employment one year after the bills enactment the psrpa would maintain the currentlaw wep for workers who have worked in noncovered employment prior to this date except in cases where the psrpa wep provides them with higher benefit on june 19 2007 senator kay bailey hutchison introduced the sister bill s 1647 both bills would replace the currentlaw wep formula with new wep formula that provides benefit in rough proportion to the percentage of earnings worked in social security covered employment when compared to currentlaw the effect of the psrpa wep on workers benefit levels varies both by earnings level and the number of years of social security coveredearnings the currentlaw wep generally provides benefit that increases with additional years of social security coverage by contrast the key determinant of the new proportional benefit amount is the percentage of the highest 35 years of covered and noncovered earnings that can be attributed to social security covered work the higher the value of these covered earnings compared to the highest 35 years of covered and noncovered earnings the larger the benefit under the psrpa thus the psrpa wep provides benefit that increases with rise in the proportion of social security covered earnings relative to overall earnings regardless of the number of years worked in social security covered

covered by social security on june 19 2007 representative kevin brady introduced hr 2772 the public servant retirement protection act psrpa which would alter the currentlaw wep formula for those who first enter nonsocial securitycovered employment one year after the bills enactment the psrpa would maintain the currentlaw wep for workers who have worked in noncovered employment prior to this date except in cases where the psrpa wep provides them with higher benefit on june 19 2007 senator kay bailey hutchison introduced the sister bill s 1647 both bills would replace the currentlaw wep formula with new wep formula that provides benefit in rough proportion to the percentage of earnings worked in social securitycovered employment currentlaw windfall elimination provision wep the currentlaw wep reduces the social security retirement or disability benefits of workers who also receive pension from employment not covered by social security1 the base social security benefit the primary insurance amount pia is the amount that worker would receive as social security retirement benefit if he or she retired exactly at the full retirement age 65 years and eight months in 2007 the pia formula applies three progressive factors 90 32 and 15 to three different levels or brackets of workers average indexed 1 the wep is sometimes confused with the government pension offset gpo which reduces the social security spousal benefits of individuals who receive pension from employment not covered by social security for more information on the gpo please see crs report rl32453 social security the government pension offset gpo by laura haltzel crs2 monthly covered earnings aime2 in 2007 for those who reach age 62 or who become disabled the pia formula is 90 of the first 680 of the aime plus 32 of the aime between 680 and 4100 plus 15 of the aime exceeding 4100 under currentlaw this regular pia formula is modified for those receiving pensions from nonsocial security covered employment by adjusting the 90 factor based on the number of years the worker had substantial employment covered by social security ie having earned at least one quarter of the oldlaw social security maximum taxable wage base for each year3 the higher the number of years of substantial social security coverage the higher the first formula factor used in the wep pia formula the lowest formula factor is 40 which applies to those with 20 or fewer years of substantial social security covered employment for each additional year of substantial social security coverage over 20 the formula factor increases by five percentage points until it reaches 90 for those with 30 years of substantial social security covered employment the same first formula factor as under the regular pia formula thus worker who would otherwise be subject to the wep would be exempt from any benefit reduction if he or she had at least 30 years in covered employment the 32 and 15 pia formula factors continue to apply as under the regular pia formula figure 1 demonstrates how the benefit level resulting from the currentlaw wep formula varies by years of covered earnings for 2 the aime is dollar amount that represents the average monthly earnings from social securitycovered employment over most of the workers adult life indexed to the increase in average annual wages to calculate the aime for retired worker workers earnings prior to age 60 are first indexed to the year that the worker reaches age 60 the highest 35 years of indexed yearly earnings are used to compute the aime the sum of the indexed earnings in these 35 years is divided by the number of months in these 35 years to obtain the average indexed monthly earnings 3 for determining years of coverage after 1978 for individuals with pensions from non covered employment the amount is 25 of what the contribution and benefit base otherwise would have been if the 1977 social security amendments had not been enacted in 2007 the oldlaw taxable wage base is equal to 72600 and thus to earn credit for one year of coverage under the wep worker would have to earn at least 18150 in social securitycovered employment crs3 worker with average earnings4 in case can the reduction in benefits under the wep exceed more than half of the pension based on noncovered work figure 1 currentlaw wep scaled averagewage earner 3500 3000 constant

wep was to remove an unintended advantage that the regular social security benefit formula provided to employees who divide their careers between covered and noncovered positions the regular social security formula is intended to replace higher proportion of earnings for those workers who spend their working years in low paying jobs relative to those who have high earnings however the regular formula cannot differentiate between those who work their whole lives in lowpaying jobs and those who simply appear to be low paid because they work for many years in jobs not covered by social security because those who work in nonsocial security covered positions do not contribute to social security through the payroll tax each year of noncovered employment is recorded as year 4 year of coverage should not be confused with year of covered earnings in 2007 to earn credit for one year of coverage under the wep worker would have to earn at least 18150 in social securitycovered employment year of covered earnings is any year in which the worker had earnings from social securitycovered employment regardless of the amount earned because the psrpa does not rely on the currentlaw definition of years of coveragein calculating wep benefits as determined by measuring substantial earnings the common denominator of years of covered earnings is used in all charts for example in 2007 minimumwage worker in social security coveredemployment would earn 10712 although this minimumwage worker has year of social security covered earnings he or she would not have earned year of coverage towards the current law wep formula that requires worker to earn at least 18150 in social security covered employment any attempt to graphically represent minimumwage workers currentlaw benefit under the wep by years of coverage would have been impossible as the minimum wage worker never qualifies for single year of coverage crs4 of zero earnings in the calculation of workers aime thus workers in non covered social security positions received the advantage of the progressive social security formula because their few years of covered earnings were averaged over their entire working career to determine the average covered earnings on which their social security benefits were based the wep formula is intended to remove this advantage for these workers social securitycovered and noncovered work worker is in position covered by social security if he or she pays into social security through the oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi payroll tax approximately 96 of all workers are covered the majority of non covered positions are held by government employees most federal employees hired before 1984 and 29 of current state and local government employees the latest available information on the social security coverage of state and local workers is for the year 2005 nationwide approximately 71 of state and local government employees are covered5 however coverage varies from state to state for example approximately 97 of state and local employees in vermont are covered by social security while only 3 of state and local employees in

changed most state and local government employees became covered by social security through voluntary agreements between the social security administration and individual states7 beginning in july 1991 state and local employees who were not members of public retirement system were mandatorily covered by social security because they had alternative retirement or disability protection8 who is

coverage should not be confused with year of covered earnings under the currentlaw wep the number of years the worker had substantial employment covered by social security ie having earned at least one quarter of the oldlaw social security maximum taxable wage base for each year qualifies as year of coverage in 2007 the oldlaw taxable wage base was equal to 72600 and thus to earn credit for one year of coverage under the wep worker would have to earn at least 18150 in social securitycovered employment year of covered earnings is any year in which the worker had earnings from social securitycovered employment regardless of the amount earned crs10 the public servant retirement protection act psrpa the psrpa would treat future noncovered workers differently from current or past noncovered workers when calculating social security retirement or disability benefits future noncovered workers applies new proportional pia formula to those who first begin noncovered employment one year after the bills enactment the psrpa legislation establishes new pia formula that takes into account the proportion of workers career earnings attributable to social securitycovered employment first to represent the pia that worker would receive if he or she had worked full career in social securitycovered employment pia is calculated using the workers highest 35 years of earnings from both covered and noncovered employment second this careerbased pia is multiplied by ratio that reflects the portion of the workers lifetime earnings attributable to covered employment this ratio is equal to the currentlaw aime which is based on the workers highest 35 years of social securitycovered earnings divided by an aime based on the workers highest 35 years of earnings from both covered and noncovered employment the new pia is therefore equal to the portion of the career pia that the worker is eligible to receive based on his or her social securitycovered earnings thus the new pia formula for future noncovered workers is as follows new pia pia using covered x aime using highest 35 years covered earnings and noncovered earnings aime using highest 35 years covered and non covered earnings current and past noncovered workers holds harmless individuals who already work or have worked in noncovered employment those individuals currently working in nonsocial securitycovered employment those who have worked in noncovered employment in the past and those who begin work in noncovered employment within oneyear of the bills enactment would not experience any reduction in benefits and could potentially experience benefit increase the psrpa legislation retains the current law wep formula for these individuals as well as the guarantee that the reduction in benefits caused by the currentlaw wep cannot exceed more than half of the pension based on noncovered work however if the pia calculated under the proportional wep formula would be higher than that provided under currentlaw the worker would receive the higher pia figure 2 demonstrates the basic relationship between the currentlaw wep formula and the psrpa proportional benefit formula for scaled

benefits under the psrpa while the line with bend points at 20 and 30 years of covered earnings and shifting slopes represents the currentlaw wep the area between these two lines represents the estimated change in benefits between currentlaw and the psrpa most of the following analysis of the results deals with explaining the difference in the gaps for workers with varying levels of earnings and years of covered earnings how will the psrpa affect benefits under the currentlaw wep benefits are driven by the number of years of coverage while under the psrpa benefits are driven by the value of covered earnings relative to overall earnings regardless of the number of years spent accruing those covered earnings while the currentlaw wep formula provides increase in the first pia formula factor of 40 for those with between 10 and 20 years in covered employment the psrpa uses 90 formula factor and thus would provide higher percent increase in benefit levels for each year of covered earnings future noncovered workers who spend 30 years or more in social security covered employment would not be exempt from reduced social security benefit as are workers under currentlaw crs12 on the basis of estimates for future hypothetical workers using the pspra formula minimumwage workers and lowwage workers would receive the greatest percent increase in social security benefits under the psrpa relative to currentlaw regardless of the number of years of covered earnings averagewage workers with up to 27 years of covered earnings would receive benefits greater than what they would receive under current law highwage workers with up to 23 years of covered earnings would receive benefits greater than what they would receive under current law maximumwage workers would experience decrease in social security benefits under the psrpa relative to currentlaw regardless of the number of years of covered earnings the remainder of this report uses the congressional research service crs social security casesimulation model to analyze how the psrpa would affect the social security benefits of hypothetical workers with various earnings levels who spend differing numbers of years working in social securitycovered employment in the casesimulation model it is necessary to specify not only the number of years of covered employment but also when those years occurred because we are relying on hypothetical earnings patterns for workers in all of our examples higher earnings levels come towards the end of the workers career therefore individuals whose years of covered earnings occur later in their career experience slightly higher benefit levels under the psrpa than those individuals who have covered earnings earlier in their career while the relative importance of the timing of covered earnings holds true for individuals with earnings histories that start low and increase throughout the career it would not necessarily hold true for other earnings patterns the appendix provides series of tables with examples of how the psrpa would affect future noncovered workers based on differences in earnings levels and years of social security covered earnings for these examples each workers covered earnings are assumed to fall towards the end of his or her career the output for each scenario includes information on the pia based on all earnings the new psrpa pia the currentlaw wep pia and the percent increase or decrease under the psrpa proposal compared to currentlaw the main results based on these examples and preliminary explanation of these results are summarized below earnings levels figures 3 4 5 and 6 demonstrate the relationship between currentlaw and the psrpa for minimumwage workers scaled lowwage workers scaled highwage workers and maximumwage workers respectively who have covered earnings at the end of their careers9 these figures illustrate features of the 9 the projected earnings histories for these workers are those used by the social security administration to produce the annual trustees report it is assumed that they follow continued crs13 currentlaw and the psrpa wep formulas with respect to years of covered earnings by earnings levels in all cases the wep benefit level under both current law and the psrpa increases with years of covered earnings however the current law wep generally increases at varying rate with years of covered earnings whereas the psrpa wep increases at constant rate10 also the slope of both the currentlaw wep and psrpa wep with respect to years of coverage increases as earnings increase eg compare figure 3 with figure 4 these formula features account for the differences in benefits illustrated in subsequent figures with respect to years of covered earnings and earnings levels given our assumed earnings histories the psrpa provides strictly proportional benefit however the currentlaw wep formula replaces higher proportion of the aime of higherwage workers than lowerwage workers higher wage workers tend to have larger aimes and larger portion of their benefit is based on the 32 and 15 formula factors under the currentlaw wep pia lower wage workers tend to have smaller aimes and larger portion of their benefit is based on the first pia formula factor which can be as small as 40 under the current law wep furthermore under the currentlaw wep minimumwage earners do not have high enough earnings to qualify for year of coverage under the wep therefore while their aimes increase with additional years of covered earnings their wep years of coverage do not and so the first pia formula factor remains at 40 9 continued typical lifetime earnings patterns that would produce social security benefit equivalent to that of workers with career earnings of either 1 lowwage 45 of wage equal to social securitys average wage series 2 an average wagea wage equal to social securitys average wage series 3 high wage 160 of wage equal to social securitys average wage series or 4 the maximum wage creditable under social security 10 this constant rate is primarily function of the assumptions used to generate the hypothetical earners used in this analysis particularly the longterm constant rate of growth in the national average wage crs14 figure 3 currentlaw wep and psrpa wep minimum wage earner 3500 3000 constant 2007 dollars current lawwep 2500 psrpa wep benefit level 2000

of this year of coverage requirement can be seen by comparing figure 3 minimumwage worker with figure 2 scaled averagewage worker the pattern of currentlaw benefits by years of covered earnings for the minimumwage worker does not exhibit the typical bendpoints one expects from the wep formula because the first pia formula factor never rises with additional years of covered earnings this same pattern holds true for scaled lowwage workers figure 4 but to lesser degree scaled lowwage workers earn high enough wages in some years to qualify for year of coverage but even then the first pia formula factor only reaches 60 thus when the new proportional pia is used and the regular pia formula using the 90 first formula factor is put in place minimumwage and scaled lowwage workers experience the greatest percent increase in benefits scaled averagewage scaled highwage and maximumwage earners all have high enough earnings in each year of covered earnings to qualify for year of coverage under the wep and thus their first pia formula factors rise every year between 20 and 30 years of covered earnings figure 2 figure 5 and figure 6 the difference in the percentage increase or

under the psrpa the key determinant of the new proportional benefit amount is the percentage of the highest 35 years of covered and noncovered earnings that can be attributed to covered work the higher the value of covered earnings to career earnings the larger the benefit under the psrpa in order to separate out the effect of the number of years of covered earnings we examined workers with identical earnings histories but with different numbers of years of covered earnings for example figure 8 highlights how the percent change in benefit level for scaled averagewage worker who has covered earnings at the end of his career varies by the number of years of coverage11 as seen in figure 8 the averagewage worker who has between 10 and 20 years of covered earnings experiences large percent increase in social security benefit level compared to the currentlaw wep the currentlaw wep formula limits the first pia formula factor to 40 instead of 90 for regular workers matter how many additional years of coverage worker earns between 10 and 20 with the psrpa pia workers would receive an increase in benefit proportional to the increase in their earnings for each year of additional covered earnings figure 8 percent change in wep benefit under psrpa compared to current law by years of covered earnings 30 25 percent change in wep benefit scaled averagewage worker 20 15 10 5 0 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 5 10 years of covered earnings for those workers with 21 to 29 years of covered earnings the percent increase in benefit under the psrpa declines for each year of covered earnings gained again this pattern is due to the currentlaw wep formula under the currentlaw wep the first formula factor in the pia increases by 5 for each additional year of coverage at the same time the currentlaw aime increases as result of 11 for scaled averagewage workers year of covered earnings equals year of coverage under the currentlaw wep crs18 additional covered earnings for the averagewage worker the percent increase in the covered aime per year of coverage the base of growth for the psrpa doesnt keep pace with the 5 increase in the first pia formula factor the base of growth for the currentlaw wep thus for the averagewage worker the currentlaw wep provides higher benefit than the psrpa would once covered earnings exceed 275 years relative to currentlaw individuals who work 30 to 34 years of covered earnings would experience the largest percent decrease in their social security benefits under currentlaw individuals who work 30 or more years in covered employment are exempt from any reduction in benefits under the wep because their benefits are calculated using the regular pia formula with the 90 formula factor under the new psrpa these individuals would now be affected by the proportional wep pia individuals who work for 35 years in covered employment at the end of their careers would experience neither an increase nor decrease in benefit levels under currentlaw these individuals would be exempt from the wep pia formula under the psrpa pia formula these individuals are still exempt from the proportional wep reduction because their aime based on covered work is equal to the aime based on all earnings because the aime takes the highest 35 years of earnings and in both cases the highest 35 years are covered earnings from the end of the career the aimes are equal and the 35 year covered worker receives pia identical to what he would have received under the currentlaw wep pia assumptions and methodology the results presented in this report were calculated using the intermediate alternative ii assumptions of the 2007 social security trustees report all dollar figures are in constant 2007
