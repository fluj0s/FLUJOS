2002 pl 107204 this law has been described by some as the most important and farreaching securities legislation since passage of the securities act of 19331 and the securities exchange act of 19342 both of which were passed in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929 sarbanesoxley had its genesis early in 2002 after the declared bankruptcy of the enron corporation but for some time it appeared as though its impetus had slowed however when the worldcom scandal became known in late june the congress showed renewed interest in enacting stiffer corporate responsibility legislation and sarbanesoxley quickly became law the act established the public company accounting oversight board pcaob or board which is supervised by the securities and exchan ge commission sec or commission the act restricts accounting firms from performing number of other services for the companies which they audit the act also requires new disclosures for public companies and the officers and directors of those companies among the other issu affected by the legislation are securities fraud criminal and civil penalties for violating the securities laws and other laws blackouts for insider trades of pension fund shares and protections for corporate whistleblowers currently one of the most controversial provisions of the act is section 404 management assessment of internal controls the provision states rules requiredthe commission shall prescribe rules requiring each annual report required by section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 15 usc 78m or 78od to contain an internal control report which shall 1 state the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and 2 contain an assessment as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of the issuer of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting b internal control evaluation and reportingwith respect to the internal control assessment required by subsection each regi stered public accounting firm that prepares or issues the audit report for the issuer shall attest to and report on the assessment made by the management of the issuer an attestation made under this subsection shall be made in accordance with standards for attestation engage ments issued or adopted by the board any such attestation shall not be the subject of separate engagement the provisions controversy stems from charges that some aspects of sarbanesoxley particularly section 404 are overly burdensome and costly for small and mediumsized companies for example one critic has stated that the costs of section 404 are extreme as one of our members testified before the house small business committee his companys efforts to comply with section 404 in preparation to go public were simply too excessive to justify the effort10 1 15 usc 77a et seq 2 15 usc 78a et seq

section 404 to the smallest companies but that ultimately all public companies would be required to comply with the internal control reporting requirements of section 4044 this view taken by the
