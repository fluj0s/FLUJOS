accomplishments and relevance to the present summary periodically members of congress and others have recommended establishment of marshall plan for central america eastern europe the former soviet union and elsewhere they do so largely because the original marshall plan program of us assistance to europe during the period 19481951 is considered by many to have been the most effective ever of us foreign aid programs an effort to prevent the economic deterioration of europe expansion of communism and stagnation of world trade the plan sought to stimulate european production promote adoption of policies leading to stable economies and take measures to increase trade among european countries and between europe and the rest of the world the plan was joint effort between the united states and europe and among european nations working together prior to formulation of program of assistance the united states required that european nations agree on financial proposal including plan of action committing europe to take steps toward solution of its economic problems the truman administration and the congress worked together to formulate the european recovery program which eventually provided roughly 133 billion of assistance to 16 countries two agencies implemented the program the us economic cooperation administration eca and the europeanrun organization for european economic cooperation the latter helped insure that participants fulfilled their joint obligations to adopt policies encouraging trade and increased production the eca provided dollar assistance to europe to purchase commodities food fuel and machinery and leveraged funds for specific projects especially those to develop and rehabilitate infrastructure it also provided technical assistance to promote productivity guaranties to encourage us private investment and approved the use of local currency matching funds at the completion of the marshall plan period european agricultural and industrial production were markedly higher the balance of trade and related dollar gap much improved and significant steps had been taken toward trade liberalization and economic integration the plan had contributed to more positive morale in europe and to political and economic stability which helped diminish the strength of domestic communist parties the us political and economic role in europe was enhanced and us trade with europe boosted although the plan has its critics many observers believe there are lessons to be learned from the effort that are applicable to present foreign aid programs however the extent of the plans replicability is subject to question central europe and the former soviet union may most closely fit the mold of wardevastated western europe but the vast differences in economic systems and environmental burden left by communist regimes among other factors show up the distinctions between 1947 europe and the present undertaking an effort equivalent to the original would be an

1948 and 1951 the united states undertook what many consider to be one of its more successful foreign policy initiatives and most effective foreign aid programs the marshall plan and the european recovery program erp that it generated involved an ambitious effort to stimulate economic growth in despondent and nearbankrupt postworld war ii europe prevent the spread of communism beyond the iron curtain and encourage development of healthy and stable world economy it was designed to accomplish these goals through achievement of three objectives the expansion of european agricultural and industrial production the restoration of sound currencies budgets and finances in individual european countries and the stimulation of international trade among european countries and between europe and the rest of the world it is measure of the positive impression enduring from the economic recovery program that in response to critical situation faced by some regions of the world there are periodic calls for new marshall plan this was the case in 1984 when the kissinger commission proposed an 8 billion infusion of funds to the caribbean and central america in 1987 range of senators and representatives from both parties proposed minimarshall plan for the philippines in the early 1990s members of congress recommended marshall plans for eastern europe and the former soviet union and more recently international statesmen have suggested marshall plans for the middle east and south africa1 generally these references to the memory of the marshall plan are summons to replicate its success or its scale rather than every detail of the original plan 1 for example richard n gardner time for new marshall plan new york times june 3 1967 robert pastor and richard feinberg us latin american policy marshall plan for the caribbean vital issues vol 33 1 1984 alan cranston lets have marshall plan for philippines angeles times september 13 1987 irwin m stelzer marshall plan for eastern europe commentary january 1990 global marshall plan urged for environment washington post may 3 1990 mandela urges marshall plan for south africa reuters may 22 1996 kohl proposes new marshall plan for the middle east deutsche presse agentur january 25 1996 crs2 sometimes parallels are drawn between the crisis to be resolved by such assistance and that faced by europe in 1947 when the plan was first proposed the replicability of the marshall plan in these diverse situations or in the future is subject to question to understand the potential relevance to the present of an event that took place fifty years ago it is necessary to understand what the plan sought to achieve how it was implemented and its resulting success or failure this report looks at each of these factors and then attempts to derive some lessons for the future formulation of the marshall plan the marshall plan was proposed in speech by secretary of state george marshall at harvard university in june 1947 in response to the critical political social and economic conditions in which europe found itself at that time recognizing the necessity of congressional participation in development of significant assistance package general marshalls speech did not present detailed and concrete program he merely suggested that the united states would be willing to help draft program and would provide assistance so far as it may be practical for us to do so2 in addition marshall required that it be joint effort initiated and agreed to by european nations the formulation of the marshall plan therefore was from the beginning work of collaboration between the administration and congress and between the us government and european governments the crisis that generated the plan and the legislative and diplomatic outcome of marshalls proposal are discussed below the situation in europe european conditions in 1947 as described by secretary of state marshall and other us officials at the time were dire although industrial production had in many cases returned to prewar levels the exceptions were belgium france west germany italy and the netherlands the economic situation overall appeared to be deteriorating the recovery to date had been financed by drawing down on domestic stocks and foreign assets capital was increasingly unavailable for investment agricultural supplies remained below 1938 levels and food imports were consuming growing share of the limited foreign exchange european nations were building up growing dollar deficit as result prospects for any future growth were low trade between european nations was stagnant having already endured years of food shortages unemployment and other hardships associated with the war and recovery the european public was now faced with further suffering to many observers the declining economic conditions were generating pessimism regarding europes future that fed class divisions and political instability communist parties already large in major countries such as italy and france threatened to come to power 2 address at harvard university june 5 1947 p 284 in joseph m jones the fifteen weeks the jones book is an excellent description of events leading up to this speech crs3 the potential impact on the united states was severalfold for one an end to european growth would block the prospect of any trade with the continent one of the symptoms of europes malaise in fact was the massive dollar deficit that signalled its inability to pay for its imports from the united states3 perhaps the chief concern of the united states however was the growing threat of communism although the cold war was still in its infancy soviet entrenchment in eastern europe was well under way already early in 1947 the economic strain affecting britain had driven it to announce its withdrawal of commitments in greece and turkey forcing the united states to assume greater obligations to defend their security the truman doctrine enunciated in march 1947 stated that it was us policy to provide support to nations threatened by communism in brief the specter of an economic collapse of europe and communist takeover of its political institutions threatened to uproot everything the united states claimed to strive for since its entry into world war ii free europe in an open world economic system us leaders felt compelled to respond how the plan was formulated three main hurdles had to be overcome on the way to developing useful response to europes problems for one as secretary of state marshalls invitation indicated european nations acting jointly had to come to some agreement on plan second the administration and congress had to reach their own concordance on legislative program and finally the resulting plan had to be one that in the words of the secretary of state would provide cure rather than mere palliative4 the role of europe most european nations responded favorably to the initial marshall proposal insisting on role in designing the program 16 nations attended conference in paris july 12 1947 at which they established the committee of european economic cooperation ceec the committee was directed to gather information on european requirements and existing resources to meet those needs its final report september 1947 called for fouryear program to encourage production create internal financial stability develop economic cooperation among participating countries and solve the deficit problem then existing with the american dollar zone although europes net balance of payments deficit with the dollar zone for the 19481951 period was originally estimated at roughly 29 billion the report requested 19 billion in us assistance an additional 3 billion was expected to come from the world bank and other sources cautious not to appear to isolate the soviet union at this stage in the still developing cold war marshalls invitation did not specifically exclude any 3 the dollar gap was considered important because the united states was the dominant economy at this time and it was assumed that us goods would remain attractive enough to outcompete other nations products for years to come the dollar gap would be likely to grow until european countries were able to build up reserves they would tend to divert their exports to and their imports away from the dollar area this would force cuts in food imports and capital goods further destabilizing europe and slowing growth the marshall plan sought to close the dollar gap 4 june 5 1947 address in jones fifteen weeks p 283 crs4 european nation britain and france made sure to include the soviets in an early threepower discussion of the proposal nevertheless the soviet union and under pressure its satellites refused to participate in common recovery program on the grounds that the necessity to reveal national economic plans would infringe on national sovereignty and that the us interest was only to increase its exports ceec formulation of its proposal was not without us input its draft proposal had reflected the wide differences existing between individual nations in their approach to trade liberalization the role of germany and state controls over national economies as result of these differences the united states was afraid that the ceec proposal would be little more than shopping list of needs without any coherent program to generate longterm growth to avoid such situation the state department conditioned its acceptance of the european program on six factors that participants make specific commitments to fulfill production programs take immediate steps to create internal monetary and financial stability express greater determination to reduce trade barriers consider alternative sources of dollar credits such as the world bank give formal recognition to their common objectives and assume common responsibility for attaining them and establish an international organization to act as coordinating agency to implement the program the final report of the ceec contained these obligations executive and congressional roles after the european countries had taken the required initiative and presented formal plan both the administration and congress responded formulation of that response had already begun soon after the marshall speech as democratic president facing republican congress that was highly skeptical of the need for further foreign assistance truman took two pronged approach that greatly facilitated development of program he opened his foreign policy initiative to perhaps the most thorough examination prior to launching of any program and secondly provided perhaps equally rare process of close consultation between the executive and congress5 from the first the truman administration made congress player in the development of the new foreign aid program consulting with it every step of the way meeting on june 22 1947 between key congressional leaders and the president led to creation of the harriman krug and nourse committees secretary of commerce averell harrimans committee composed of consultants from private industry labor economists etc looked at europes needs secretary of interior julius krugs committee examined those us physical resources available to support such program the group led by chairman of the council of economic advisers edwin g nourse studied the effect an enlarged export burden would have on us domestic production and prices the house of representatives itself formed 5 the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee called the version of the legislation which went to the floor of the congress the final product of eight months of more intensive study by more devoted minds than i have ever known to concentrate upon

separation of powers the case of the marshall plan the review of politics january 1965 p 5877 crs5 the select committee on foreign aid led by representative christian herter to take broad look at these issues6 before the administration proposal could be submitted for consideration the situation in some countries deteriorated so seriously that the president called for special interim aid package to hold them over through the winter with food and fuel until the more elaborate system anticipated by the marshall plan could be authorized congress approved interim aid to france italy and austria amounting to 522 million in an authorization signed by the president on december 17 1947 west germany also in need was still being assisted through the government and relief in occupied areas garioa program state department proposals for european recovery program were formally presented by truman in message to congress on december 19 1947 he called for 4 14year program of aid to 16 west european countries in the form of both grants and loans although the program anticipated total aid amounting to about 17 billion the administration bill as introduced in early 1948 hr 4840 provided an authorization of 68 billion for the first 15 months the house foreign affairs and senate foreign relations committees amended the bill extensively as s 2202 it passed the senate by 6917 vote on march 13 1948 and the house on march 31 1948 by vote of 329 to 747 the bill authorized 53 billion over oneyear period on april 3 1948 the economic cooperation act title i of the foreign assistance act of 1948 pl 80472 became law the appropriations committee conference allocated 4 billion to the european recovery program in its first year by restricting the authorization to one year congress gave itself ample opportunity to oversee the plans implementation and consider additional funding three more times during the life of the plan congress would be required to authorize and appropriate funds in each year congress held hearings debated and further amended the legislation as part of the first authorization it created joint congressional watchdog committee to review the program and report to congress implementation of the marshall plan profile of the marshall plan in its legislative form as the european recovery program erp the marshall plan was originally expected to last four and one quarter years from april 1 1948 6 see house select committee on foreign aid final report on foreign aid 80th congress 2d session washington us govt print off may 1 1948 883 p 7 many argue that the decisive support for the erp came as result of the czechoslovak coup on february 25 1948 which brought the communists to power there this convinced many of those who saw the plan as giveaway program that soviet expansionism was serious threat other major factors which swayed public and congressional opinion were the information dissemination activities of the public citizens committee for the marshall plan and support for the plan from influential onetime isolationist senator vandenberg republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee crs6 until june 30 1952 however the duration of the official marshall plan as well as amounts expended under it are matters of some disagreement in the view of some the program ran until its projected enddate of june 30 1952 others date the termination of the plan some six months earlier when the plans administrative agent the economic cooperation agency was terminated and its recovery programs were meshed with those of the newly established mutual security agency process that began during the second half of 1951 estimates of amounts expended under the marshall plan range from 103 billion to 136 billion8 variations here can be explained by the different measures of program longevity and the inclusion of funding from related programs which occurred simultaneously with the erp table i contains one estimate of funds made

expected to continue the dialogue on european economic problems coordinate aid allocations insure that aid was appropriately directed and negotiate adoption of effective policy reforms economic cooperation administration due to the complex nature of the recovery program the magnitude of the task and the high degree of administrative flexibility desired with regard to matters concerning procurement and personnel congress established new agency the economic cooperation administration eca to implement the erp as separate agency it could be exempted from many government regulations that would impede flexibility another reason for its separate institutional status was strong distrust by the republican congress for state department headed by democrat administration however because many in congress were also concerned that the traditional foreign policy authority of the secretary of state not be impinged it required that full consultation and close working relationship exist between the eca administrator and the secretary of state paul g hoffman was appointed as administrator by president truman9 9 the original administration proposal would have given state almost total control over the eca us senate committee on foreign relations european recovery program senate continued crs10 republican and businessman president of the studebaker corporation both requirements posed by the congressional leadership hoffman is considered by historians to have been particularly talented administrator and promoter of the erp 600man regional office located in paris played major role in coordinating the programs of individual countries and in obtaining european views on implementation it was the most immediate liaison with the organization representing the participating countries averell harriman headed the regional office as the us special representative abroad missions were also established in each country to keep close contact with local government officials and to observe the flow of funds both the regional office and country missions had to judge the effectiveness of the recovery effort without infringing on national sovereignty sensitivities as required by the erp legislation the united states established bilateral agreements with each country these were fairly uniform they required certain commitments to meet objectives of the erp such as steps to stabilize the currency and increase production as well as obligations to provide the economic information upon which to evaluate country needs and results of the program the organization for european economic cooperation european body the organization for european economic cooperation oeec was established by agreement of the participating countries in order to maintain the joint nature by which the program was founded and reinforce the sense of mutual responsibility for success of the program earlier the participating countries had jointly pledged themselves to certain obligations see above the oeec was to be the instrument which would guide members to fulfill their multilateral undertaking to advance this purpose the oeec developed analyses of economic conditions and needs and through formulation of plan of action influenced the direction of investment projects and encouraged joint adoption of policy reforms such as those leading to elimination of intraeuropean trade barriers at the ecas request it also recommended and coordinated the division of aid among the 16 countries each year the participating countries would submit yearly program to the oeec which would then make recommendations to the eca the determination of assistance allocations was not an easy matter especially since funding declined each year as result there was much bickering among countries but formula was eventually reached to divide the aid programs the framers of the european recovery program envisioned number of tools with which to accomplish its ends these are discussed below dollar aid commodity assistance and project financing grants made up more than 90 of the program the eca provided outright grants which were 9 continued report 935 on s 2202 february 27 1948 crs11 used to pay the cost and freight of essential commodities and services mostly from the united states conditional grants were also provided requiring the participating country to set aside currency so that other participating countries could buy their export goods this was done in order to stimulate intraeuropean trade the eca also provided loans eca loans bore an interest rate of 25 starting in 1952 and matured up to 35 years from december 31 1948 with principal repayments starting later than 1956 the eca supervised the use of the dollar credits european importers made purchases through normal channels and paid american sellers with checks drawn on american credit institutions the first year erp bill provided that 1 billion of the total authorized should be available only in the form of loans or guaranties in 1949 the congress reduced the amount available only for loans to 150 million the administrator had decided that loans in excess of these amounts should not be made because of the inadvisability of participating countries assuming further dollar obligations which would only increase the dollar gap the plan was attempting to close as of june 30 1949 9723 million of us aid had been in the form of loans while 4948 billion was in the form of grants estimates for july 1949 june 1950 were 150 million in loans and 3594 billion for grants the content of the dollar aid purchases changed over time as european needs changed from program supplying immediate foodrelated goods food feed fertilizer and fuel it eventually provided mostly raw materials and production equipment between early 1948 and 1949 foodrelated assistance declined from roughly 50 of the total to only 27 the proportion of raw material and machinery rose from 20 to roughly 50 in this same time period project financing became important during the later stages of the erp eca dollar assistance was used with local capital in specific projects requiring importation of equipment from abroad the advantage here was leveraging of local funds by june 30 1951 the eca had approved 139 projects financed by combination of us and domestic capital their aggregate cost was 225 billion of which only 565 million was directly provided by marshall plan assistance funds10 of these projects at least 27 were in the area of power production and 32 were for the modernization and expansion of steel and iron production many others were devoted to rehabilitation of transport infrastructure11 counterpart funds each country was required to match the us grant contribution dollars worth of its own currency for each dollar of grant aid given by the united states the participating countrys currency was placed in counterpart fund that could be used for infrastructure projects roads power plants housing projects airports etc of benefit to that country each of these counterpart fund projects however had to be approved by the eca administrator in the case of great britain counterpart funds were deemed inflationary and simply returned to the national treasury to help balance the budget 10 opie and brown american foreign assistance p 237 11 department of state bulletin january 14 1952 crs12 by end of december 1951 roughly 86 billion of counterpart funds had been made available of the approximately 76 billion approved for use 2 billion were used for debt reduction as in great britain and roughly 48 billion were earmarked for investment of which 39 was in utilities transportation and communication facilities electric power projects railroads etc 14 in agriculture 16 in manufacturing 10 in coal mining and other extractive industries and 12 in low cost housing facilities three countries accounted for 80 of counterpart funds used for production purposes france half west germany and italytrieste12 five percent of the counterpart funds could be used to pay the administrative expenses of the eca in europe as well as for purchase of scarce raw materials needed by the united states or to develop sources of supply for such materials up to august 1951 more than 160 million was committed for these purposes mostly in the dependent territories of europe for example enterprises were set up for development of nickel in new caledonia chromite in turkey and bauxite in jamaica13 technical assistance technical assistance was also provided under the erp special fund was created to finance expenses of us experts in europe and visits by european delegations to the united states funds could be used only on projects contributing directly to increased production and stability the eca targeted problems of industrial productivity marketing agricultural productivity manpower utilization public administration tourism transportation and communications in most cases countries receiving such aid had to deposit counterpart funds equivalent to the dollar expenses involved in each project through 1949 5 million had been set aside for technical assistance under which 350 experts had been sent from the united states to provide services and 481 persons from europe had come to the united states for training by the end of 1951 with more than 30 million expended over 6000 europeans representing management technicians and labor had come to the united states for periods of study of us production methods14 although it is estimated that less than onehalf of one percent of all marshall plan aid was spent on technical assistance the effect of such assistance was significant technical assistance was major component of the productivity campaign launched by the eca production was not merely function of possessing uptodate machinery but of management and labor styles of work as one senate appropriations staffer noted productivity in french industry is better than in several other marshallplan countries but it still requires four times as many manhours to produce renault automobile as it does for chevrolet and the 12 as much as 1 billion in counterpart funds was never released by the eca

european production up to par the eca funded studies of business styles conducted management seminars arranged visits of businessmen and labor representatives to the united states to explain american methods of production and set up national productivity centers in almost every participating country16 guaranties guaranties were provided for convertibility into dollars of profits on american investments the purpose of the guaranties was to encourage american businessmen to invest in the modernization and development of european industry by insuring that returns could be obtained in dollars the original act covered only the approved amount of dollars invested but subsequent authorizations broadened the definition of investment and increased the amount of the potential guaranty by adding to actual investment earnings or profits up to 175 of dollar investment the risk covered was extended as well to include compensation for loss of investment due to expropriation although 300 million was authorized by congress subsequently amended to 200 million investment guaranties covering 38 industrial investments amounted to only 314 million by june 195217 table 3 expenditures under

programs contributed to aims the individual components of the european recovery program contributed directly to some of the immediate aims of the plan dollar assistance kept the dollar gap to minimum the eca made sure that both dollar and counterpart assistance were funneled toward activities that would do the most to increase production and lead to general recovery the emphasis in financial and technical assistance on productivity helped to maximize the efficient use of dollar and counterpart funds to increase production and boost trade the importance to future european growth of this 15 us

third higher than the prewar rate since national savings were practically zero in 1948 the high rate of investment is largely attributable to us assistance but the aims of the marshall plan were not achieved by financial and technical assistance programs alone the importance of these americansponsored programs is that they helped to create the framework in which the overall oeec european program of action functioned american aid was leveraged to encourage europeans to come together and act individually and collectively in purposeful fashion on behalf of the three themes of increased production expanded trade and economic stability through policy reform the first requirement of the plan was that european nations commit themselves to these objectives on an individual basis each nation then utilized its counterpart funds and american dollar assistance to fulfill these objectives they also with the analytical assistance of both fellow european nations under the oeec and the american representatives of the eca closely examined their economic systems through this process the eca and oeec sought to identify and remove obstacles to growth to avoid unsound national investment plans and to promote adoption of appropriate currency levels thanks to american assistance many note european nations were able to undertake recommended and necessary reforms at lesser political cost in terms of imposing economic hardship on their publics than would have been the case without aid however contending with deeply felt sensitivities regarding european sovereignty us influence on european economic and social decisionmaking as direct result of plan assistance was restricted where it controlled counterpart funds for use in capital projects influence was considerable where counterpart funds were simply used to retire debt to assist financial stability there was little such influence some analysts contend the united states had minimal control over european domestic policy since its assistance was small relative to the total resources of european countries but while it could do little to get europe to relinquish control over exchange rates on less sensitive smaller issues the united states many argue was able to affect change18 on few occasions did the eca threaten sanctions if participating countries did not comply with agreements italy was threatened with loss of aid for not acting to adopt recommended programs and in april 1950 aid was actually withheld from greece to force appropriate domestic action as collective of european nations the oeec generated peer pressure that encouraged individual nations to fulfill their plan obligations the oeec provided forum for discussion and eventual negotiation of agreements conducive to intra european trade for europeans its existence made the plan seem less an american program in line with the american desire to foster european integration the oeec helped to create the european idea as west german vicechancellor blucher noted the oeec had at least one great element european men came together 18 alan s milward the reconstruction of western europe 1984 p 113125 crs15 knew each other and were ready for cooperation19 the eca provided financial assistance to efforts to encourage european integration see below and more important it provided the oeec with some financial leverage of its own by asking the oeec to take on share of responsibility for allocating american aid among participating countries the eca elevated the organization to higher status than might have been the case otherwise and thereby facilitated achievement of plan aims the sum of its parts evaluating the marshall plan how the marshall plan was different assistance to europe was not new with the marshall plan in fact during the two and one halfyear period from july 1945 to december 1947 roughly 11 billion had been provided to europe compared with the estimated 13 billion in three and one half years of the marshall plan one of the factors that distinguishes the marshall plan from its predecessors is that the marshall plan was plan because the earlier more ad hoc and relieforiented assistance had made little dent on european recovery different coherent approach was put forward the new approach called for concerted program with definite purpose the purpose was european recovery defined as increased agricultural and industrial production restoration of sound currencies budgets and finances and stimulation of international trade among participating countries and between them and the rest of the world the plan as illustrated in the preceding section insured that each technical and financial assistance component contributed as directly as possible to these longrange objectives other aspects of its planlike character were distinctive it had definite time and monetary limits it was made clear at the start that the us contribution would diminish each year in addition to broad objectives it also supported by reference to the ceec program in the legislation and more specifically in congressional report language the ambitious quantitative targets assumed by the participating countries20 the marshall plan was also joint effort by bringing in european nations as active participants in the program the united states assured that the commitment to alter economic policies necessity if growth was to be stimulated would be translated into action and that the objective of integration would be further encouraged the marshall plan promoted recognition of the economic interdependence of europe by making the congress firm partner in the formulation of the program the administration assured continued congressional support for the commitment of large sums over period of years further the marshall plan was first recognition by us leaders of the link between economic growth and political stability unlike previous postwar aid 19 quoted in harry bayard price the marshall plan and its meaning p 294 20 hrept 1585 on s 2202 and srept 935 on s 2202 crs16 which was twothirds repayable loans and onethird relief supplies marshall plan aid was almost entirely in the form of grants aimed at productive developmental purposes the reason for this large infusion of grants in peacetime was that us national security had been redefined as containment of communism governments whose citizens were unemployed and unfed were unstable and open to communist advancement only longterm economic growth could provide stability and as an added benefit save the united states from having to continue an endless process of stopgap reliefbased assistance the unique nature of the plan is perhaps best emphasized by what replaced it the cold war reinforced by the korean war signalled the end of the marshall plan by altering the priority of us aid from that of economic stability to military security in september 1950 the eca informed the european participants that henceforth growing proportion of aid would be allocated for european rearmament purposes although originally scheduled to end on june 30 1952 the plan began to wind down in december 1950 when aid to britain was suspended in the following months ireland sweden and portugal graduated from the program the use of counterpart funds for production purposes was phased out to attack inflation which resulted from the shortage of materials due to the korean war the eca had begun to release counterpart funds in the fourth quarter of 1950 13 billion was released twothirds of which were used in retiring public debt under the mutual security act of 1951 and subsequent legislation although in lesser quantities and in increasing proportions devoted to defense aid continued to be provided to many european countries in the 195253 appropriations for example france received 525 million in grants half of which was for defense support and the other as budget support the joint nature of the marshall plan disappeared as national sovereignty came to the fore again unlike the marshall plan france insisted on using counterpart funds as it wished commingling them with other funds and only later attributing appropriate amounts to certain projects to satisfy american concerns accomplishments of the marshall plan for many analysts and policymakers the effect of the marshall plan policies and programs on the economic and political situation in europe was broad and pervasive while in some cases direct connection can be drawn between american assistance and positive outcome for the most part the plan may be viewed best as stimulus which set off chain of events leading to the accomplishments noted below did it meet its objectives the marshall plan agencies the eca and oeec established number of quantitative standards as their objectives reflecting some of the broader purposes noted earlier production the overall production objective of the european recovery program was an increase in aggregate production above prewar 1938 levels of 30 in industry and 15 in agriculture by the end of 1951 industrial production for all countries was 41 above the 1938 level exceeding the goal of the program however aggregate agriculture production was only 9 above prewar levels and crs17 given 25 million rise in population during these years europe was not able to feed itself by 1951 viewed in terms of the increase from 1947 the achievement is more impressive industrial production by the end of 1951 was 64 higher than only four years earlier participating countries increased aggregate agricultural production by nearly 24 in the four cropyears after 194748 total gnp rose by roughly 25 during the four years of the plan the 1948 senate report on the erp authorization had noted set of production goals that the europeans had set for themselves goals that they noted seem optimistic to many american experts21 the participating countries for example had wanted to increase steel production to 55 million tons yearly 20 above prewar production by 1951 they had achieved 60 million it was proposed that oil refining capacity be increased by 2 12 times that in 1938 in the end they managed four fold increase the goal for coal production was 584 million tons an increase of 30 million over prewar production by 1951 production was still slightly below that of 1938 but 27 higher than in 1947 balance of trade and the dollar gap in 1948 participating countries could pay for only half of their imports by exporting an objective of the erp was to get european countries to the point where they could pay for 83 of their imports in this manner although they paid for 70 by exporting in 1938 the larger ratio was sought under erp because earnings from overseas investment had declined even though trade rose substantially especially among participants the volume of imports from the rest of the world rose substantially as well and prices for these imports rose faster than did prices of exports as result europe continued to be strained one obstacle to expansion of exports was simply trying to break into the united states and south american markets where us producers were entrenched oeec exports to north america rose from 14 of imports in 1947 to nearly 50 in 195222 related to the overall balance of trade was the deficit vis vis the dollar area especially the united states in 1947 the total gold and dollar deficit was over 8 billion by 1949 it had dropped to 45 billion by 1952 to half that figure and by the first half of 1953 had reached an approximate current balance with the dollar area23 trade liberalization in 1949 the oeec council asked members to take steps to eliminate quantitative import restrictions by the end of 1949 50 and by february 1951 75 of quota restrictions on imports were eliminated by 1955 90 of restrictions were gone in 1951 the oeec set up rules of conduct in trade under 21 us senate committee on foreign relations economic recovery program senate report 935 on s 2202 february 27 1948 22 oecd observer june 1967 p10 23 oecd observer june 1967 p 1011 crs18 the code of liberalization of trade and invisible transactions at the end of 1951 trade volume within europe was almost double that of 1947 other benefits some benefits of the marshall plan are not easily quantifiable and some were not direct aims of the program psychological boost many believe that the role of the plan in raising morale in europe was as great contribution to the prevention of communism and stimulation of growth as any financial assistance as george kennan noted the psychological success at the outset was so amazing that we felt that the psychological effect was fourfifths accomplished before the first supplies arrived24 economic integration the united states had view of itself as model for the development of europe with individual countries equated with american states as such us leaders saw healthy europe as one in which trade restraints and other barriers to interaction such as the inconvertibility of currencies would be eliminated the erp required coordinated planning for recovery and the establishment of the oeec for this purpose in 1949 the erp authorization act was amended to make it the explicit policy of the united states to encourage the unification of europe25 efforts in support of european integration integral to the original plan were strengthened at this time to encourage intraeuropean trade the eca in its first year went so far as to provide dollars to participating countries to finance their purchase of vitally needed goods available in other participating countries even if these were available in the united states in step toward encouraging european independence from the dollar standard it also established an intraeuropean payments plan whereby dollar grants were made to countries which exported more to europe as group than they imported on condition that these creditor countries finance their export balance in their own currencies the european payments union epu an outgrowth of the payments plan was established in 1950 by member countries to act as central clearance and credit system for settlement of all payments transactions among members and associated monetary areas such as the sterling area at eca request the 1951 congressional authorization withheld funds specifically to encourage the pursuit of this program since successful conclusion of the epu depended on an american financial contribution in the end the united states provided 350 million to help set up the epu and another 100 million to assist it through initial difficulties many believe that these and other steps initiated under the erp led to the launching of the coal and steel community in 1952 and eventually to the european union of today stability and containment of communism perhaps the greatest inducement to the united states in setting up the marshall plan had been the belief that economic hardship in europe would lead to political instability and inevitably 24 in charles mee jr the marshall plan the launching of the pax americana p 246 25 this term was left undefined an amendment calling for both political federation as well as economic unification was stricken in conference crs19 to communist governments throughout the continent in essence the erp allowed economic growth and prosperity to occur in europe with fewer political and social costs plan assistance allowed recipients to carry larger import surplus with less strain on the financial system then would be the case otherwise it made possible larger investments without corresponding reductions in living standards and could be antiinflationary by mopping up purchasing power through the sale of imported assistance goods without increasing the supply of money the production aspects of the plan also helped relieve hunger among the general population human food consumption per capita reached the prewar level by 1951 in west germany economically devastated and besieged by millions of refugees from the east one house of every five built since 1948 had received marshall plan aid26 perhaps as result of these benefits communism in europe was prevented from coming to power via the ballot box it is estimated that communist strength in western europe declined by almost onethird between 1946 and 1951 in the 1951 elections the combined prowestern vote was 84 of the electorate27 us domestic procurement champions of the marshall plan hold that its authorizing legislation was free of most of the potential restrictions sought by private interests of the sort to later appear in foreign aid programs nevertheless restrictions were enacted which did benefit the united states and us business in particular procurement of surplus goods was encouraged under the plan legislation while procurement of goods in short supply in the united states was discouraged it was required that surplus agriculture commodities be supplied by the united states and procurement of these was to be encouraged by the eca administrator the erp required that 25 of total wheat had to be in the form of flour and half of all goods had to be carried on american ships in the end an estimated 83 of european purchases using eca dollars were spent in the united states types of commodities purchased from the united states included foodstuffs grain dairy products cotton fuel industrial and raw materials iron and steel aluminum copper lumber and industrial and agricultural machinery sugar and nonferrous metals made up the bulk of purchases from outside the united states enhanced role in europe for the united states us prestige and power in europe were already strong following world war ii in several respects however the us role in europe was greatly enhanced by virtue of the marshall plan program us private sector economic relations grew substantially during this period as consequence of the programs encouragement of increased exports from europe and plan grants and loans for the purchase of us goods the book value of us investment in europe also rose significantly furthermore while the plan grew out of recognition of the economic interdependence of the two continents its implementation greatly increased awareness of that fact the oeec which 26 state department bulletin january 14 1952 27 changes in electoral laws also contributed to this outcome us senate committee on foreign relations united states aid programs in europe 1951 p 2224 crs20 eventually became the oecd 1961 with the united states as full member endured and provided forum for discussion of economic problems of mutual concern finally the act of us support for europe and the creation of diplomatic relationship which centered on economic issues in the oeec facilitated the evolution of relationship centered on military and security issues in the view of eca administrator hoffman the marshall plan made the atlantic pact nato possible28 critiques of the marshall plan not everyone agrees that the marshall plan was success many of the current criticisms of foreign aid that it is giveaway program that it is waste of money were heard then as well one such appraisal was that marshall plan assistance had little effect it is for example difficult to demonstrate that plan aid was directly responsible for the increase in production and other quantitative achievements noted above critics have argued that plan assistance was never more than 5 of the gnp of recipient nations and therefore could have little effect29 some analysts pointing out the experimental nature of the plan agree that the method of aid allocation and the program of economic reforms promoted under the plan were not derived with scientific precision some claim that the dollar gap was not problem and that lack of economic growth was the result of bad economic policy resolved when economic controls established during the nazi era were eventually lifted30 even at the time of the marshall plan there were those who found the program lacking if marshall plan aid was going to combat communism they felt it would have to provide benefits to the working class in europe many believed that the increased production sought by the plan would have little effect on those most inclined to support communism in congressional hearings congressmen repeatedly sought assurances that the aid was benefiting the working class would loans to french factory owners they asked lead to higher salaries for employees31 journalist theodore h white was another who questioned this trickle now called the trickle down approach to recovery the trickle theory had thus far white wrote in 1953 resulted in brilliant recovery of european production but it had yielded love for america and little diminution of communist loyalty where it was entrenched in the misery of the continental workers32 28 us house of representatives committee on appropriations foreign aid appropriation bill for 1950 1949 p 33 29 for

concern was expressed that the aid provided to europe would allow these countries to maintain their colonies in africa and asia the switch in emphasis from economic development to military development which began in the third year of the plan was also the subject of criticism especially in view of the limited time frame originally allowed for the plan staff member of the senate appropriations committees special subcommittee on foreign economic cooperation believed that the original intent of the plan could not be accomplished under these conditions33 the tactics employed to achieve plan objectives were often questioned as well much of our effort in france has been contradictory reported the committee staffer on the one hand we have been working toward the abolition of trade barriers between european countries and on the other we have been fostering or rebuilding uneconomic industries which cannot survive unhampered international competition34 another issue is the proportion of funding which went to the public rather than private sector one contemporary writer noted that public investments from the italian counterpart fund obtained twice the amount of assistance as did the private sector in that country another analyst has argued that the eca promoted government intervention in the economy35 in the 1950 authorization hearings us businessmen urged that assistance be provided directly to foreign business rather than through european governments only in this way they said could free enterprise be promoted in europe36 from its inception members of congress voiced fears that the erp would have negative effect on us business some noted that the effort to close the trade gap by encouraging europeans to export and limit their imports would diminish us exports to the region amendments most defeated were offered to erp legislation to insure that certain segments of the private sector would benefit from plan aid that strengthening europe economically meant increased competition for us business also was not lost on legislators the eca for example helped europeans rebuild their merchant marine fleets and by the end of 1949 had authorized over 167 million in european steel mill projects most using the more advanced continuous rolling mill process that had previously been little used in europe as the congressional watchdog committee staff noted the eca program involves economic sacrifice either in direct expenditure of federal funds or in readjustments of agriculture and industry to allow for foreign competition37 in the end the united states seemed to be willing to make both sacrifices 33 us senate committee on appropriations conditions in europe in the spring of 1951 p 2 34 conditions in europe in the spring of 1951 p 3 35 us senate committee

and far reaching experiment in foreign relations38 although in many ways unique to the requirements of its time analysts have attempted over the years to draw from it various lessons which might possibly be applied to present or future foreign aid initiatives these lessons represent what observers believe were the primary strengths of the plan39 despite growing national isolationism polls showing little support for the plan congress dominated by budget cutters and an election looming whose outlook was unfavorable to the president the administration decided it was the right thing to do and led campaign with national commissions set up and cabinet members travelling the country to sell the plan to the american people congress was included at the beginning to formulate the program because he faced congress controlled by the opposition party truman made the plan cooperative creation which helped garner support and prevented it from becoming bogged down with private interest earmarks congress maintained its active role by conducting detailed hearings and studies on erp implementation the beneficiaries were required to put together the proposal because the plan targeted changes in the nature of the european economic system the united states was sensitive to european national sovereignty european cooperation was critical to establishing an active commitment from participants on wide range of delicate issues the plan had specific and limited goals increased production trade and stability and all resources were dedicated to meeting those goals furthermore sufficient resources were provided for this purpose 38 conference report on foreign assistance act of 1948 april 1 1948 hrept 1655 on s 2202 discussion of sec 124 39 some articles which discuss

absolute economic recovery of europe and avoid the repeated need for relief programs that had characterized us assistance to europe since the war the countries to be assisted for the most part had the capacity to recover they in fact were recovering not developing from scratch the human and natural resources necessary for economic growth were largely available the chief thing missing was capital aid alone was insufficient to assist europe economically report in october 1949 by the eca and department of commerce found that the united states should purchase as much as 2 billion annually in additional goods if europe was to balance its trade by the close of the recovery program parochial congressional tendencies to put restrictions on the program on behalf of us business were kept under control for the good of the program american businessmen for example were not happy that the eca insisted europeans purchase what was available first in europe using soft currency before turning to the united states the marshall plan fully developed the use of counterpart funds that gave additional leverage to us aid by requiring recipients to deposit local currency funds equal to the dollar assistance in an account for use on projects agreed to by both us and recipient country representatives this method continues to be used in present day agency for international development programs40 technical assistance including exchanges while inexpensive relative to capital block grants may have significant impact on economic growth under the marshall plan technical assistance helped draw attention to the management and labor factors hindering productivity it demonstrated american knowhow and helped develop in europe positive feeling regarding america both technical assistance and exchanges compose large portion of todays foreign assistance program the foreign policy value of foreign assistance cannot be adequately measured in terms of shortterm consequences the marshall plan continues to have an impact in nato the oecd the european community the german marshall fund in european bilateral aid donor programs and in the stability and prosperity of modern europe all americas chief allies41 40 on much smaller scale than the counterpart funds the plan leveraged private sector investment in recipient countries through the use of us government guaranties it also encouraged us individual and charitable organization participation by continuing the earlier relief effort practice of subsidizing transport of private american donations 41 one plan activity actually remains in operation germany and austria maintain revolving european recovery program funds originally repaid plan money which dispense loans to continued crs24 is it replicable although many disparate elements of marshall plan assistance speak to the present it is questionable whether the program in the main could be replicated in meaningful way the problems faced now by most other parts of the world are so vastly different and more complex than those encountered by western europe in the period 19481952 that the solution posed for one is not entirely applicable to the other some aspects of the marshall plan are more replicable than others the plan was chiefly characterized by its offering of dollar assistance targeted at productivity financial stability and increased trade this however is the aim today of only portion of us economic assistance to the developing countries much of which goes for humanitarian relief or political security purposes surely developing and former communist countries would benefit by receiving large scale aid if it eliminated the necessity of going even deeper into debt to private or public sources such grant aid could make radical policy reforms politically easier to adopt however many developing countries may not possess the human industrial or democratic base to make effective use of such aid and may need long term developmentoriented aid not short term infusion of capital some suggest that in many cases rapid infusion of large scale assistance would lead only to corruption and abuse of aid funds another key feature of the plan was its joint nature both individually and collectively european participants were collaborators with the united states in the plan it can be argued that the administrative systems of many developing countries remain inadequate to formulation and implementation of significant program again longterm targeted interventions of technical assistance may be more appropriate at this stage there are however segments of the developing world that may be in position to benefit from marshall plantype program the advanced developing countries such as thailand and indonesia increasingly possess the appropriate industrial and human resources in these cases however there is nothing in their current status to suggest they are at crisis stage requiring extensive grant assistance rather than loans obtainable through the world bank in addition for many such countries private sector investment has supplanted the necessity for donor assistance more closely fitting the mold of an economically devastated postwar western europe are the nations of central europe and the former soviet union although it could be argued that they were never very well developed to start with these countries possess many basic human and natural resources but are greatly lacking in investment capital and productive economic systems to the extent that marshall plan grant aid was able to alleviate the political cost to european governments of difficult economic policy decisions it is useful model but it should be remembered that jump start infusion of grant assistance was not the only thing that characterized the marshall plan the environmental burden left by its communist 41 continued small business germans in the east are still getting boost from marshall plan in wall street journal january 25 1995 crs25 regimes uncertain access to foreign markets the strains of nationality questions the unknown potential for regional development and host of other issues make clear how the situation in central europe and the former soviet union is distinct from the postwar situation which provoked the marshall plan in the final analysis however even if there exist countries whose needs are similar in nature to what the marshall plan provided the position of the united states has changed since the late 1940s the roughly 133 billion dollars provided by the united states to 16 nations over period of less than four years equals an estimated 88 billion in todays currency that sum surpasses the amount of economic food and military assistance the united states provided to over 146 countries and numerous international development organizations and banks in the four year period 199396 62 billion in 1948 when the united states appropriated 4 billion for the first year of the marshall plan outlays for the entire federal budget equalled slightly less than 30 billion for the united states to be willing to expend 13 of its budget that would be 203 billion in fy1996 on any one program congress and the president would have to agree that the activity was major national priority nevertheless in pondering the difficulties of new marshall plans it is perhaps worth considering the views of the eca administrator paul hoffman who noted twenty years after secretary marshalls historic speech that even though the plan was one of the most truly generous impulses that has ever motivated any nation anywhere at any time the united states derived enormous benefits from the bread it figuratively cast upon the international waters in hoffmans view today the united states its former partners in the marshall plan and in fact all other advanced industrialized countriesare being offered an even bigger bargain the chance to form an effective partnership for worldwide economic and social progress with the earths hundred and more lowincome nations the potential profits in terms of expanded prosperity and more secure peace could dwarf those won through the european recovery program yet the danger that this bargain will be rejected out of apathy indifference and discouragement over the relatively slow progress toward selfsufficiency made by the developing countries thus far is perhaps even greater than was the case with the marshall plan for the whole broadscale effort of development assistance to the worlds poorer nations an effort that is generally but i think quite misleadingly called foreign aid has never received the full support it merits and is now showing signs of further slippage in both popular and governmental backing under these circumstances the study of the
