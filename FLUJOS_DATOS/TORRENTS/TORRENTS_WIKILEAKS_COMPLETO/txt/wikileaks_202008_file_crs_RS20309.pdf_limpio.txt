education for children with disabilities when the states wer providing education for children without disabilities as result the states were unde r considerable pressure to pr ovide such services and they lobbied congress to assist them3 congress responded with the grant program still contained in idea but also delineate d specific requirements that the states must follow in order to receive these federal funds the statute provided that if ther was dispute between the school and the parents of the child with disability the child must stay put in h is or her current educational placement until the dispute is resolved revised stay put provision remains in idea issues relating to children with disabilities who exhibit violent or inappropriat behavio r have been raised for years and in 1988 the question of whether there was n implied exception to the stay put provision was presented to the supreme court in honig v doe although the supreme court did not find such an implied exception it did find4 that ten day suspension was allowable and that schools could seek judicial relief when the parents of truly dangerous child refuse to permit change in placement in 1994 congress amended ideas stay put provision to give schools unilateral authority t remove child with disability to an interim alternative educational setting if the child was determined to have brought firearm to school in 1997 congress made significant changes to idea and attempted to strike careful balance between the leas local education agency duty to ensure that schoo l environments are safe and conducive to learning for all children including children with disabilities and the leas continuing obligation to ensure that children with disabilitie s receive free appropriate public ed ucation this current law does not immunize child5 with disability from disciplinary proce dures but these procedures may not be identical to those for children without disabilities in brief if child with disability commits n action that would be subject to discipline school personnel have the following options suspending the child for up to ten days with educational services provided conducting manifestation determination review to determine whether there is link between the childs disability and the misbehavior if the childs behavior is not manifestation f disability long term disciplinary action such as expulsion may occur except that educational services may not cease if the childs behavior is manifestation of the childs disability the school may review the childs placement and if appropriate initiate change in

agenda with s 254 th violent and repeat juvenile accountability and rehabilitation act of 1999 which passed the senate on may 20 1999 and hr 1501 the child safety and protection act which passed the house on june 17 both of these bills cont ain amendments offered on the floor relating to discipline under idea essentially these amendments would change section 615 of idea to eliminate the requiremen ts regarding disciplinary procedures for children with disabilities wh carry or possess gun or firearm senate or weapon house to or at school n school premises or to or at school functions the senate passe d amendment 355 offered by senators frist and ashcroft by vote of 74 to 25 the7 house passed amendment 35 offered by representative norwood by vote of 300 to 128 8 under the senate amendment school personnel could discipline child with disability who possessed gun or firearm at school in the same manner as child without disability could be disciplined child with disability who is disciplined under thi s amendment would be able to assert defense that the carrying or possession of the gun or firearm was unintentional or innocent this provision could h elp to address the problem of child with limited mental capacities who had someone place gun in his or he r backpack however the exact imp lications of this provision are somewhat uncertain since it is not specified to whom or when this defense would be asserted during debate senator frist stated that this defense would be made to the schools principal or teacher and that the due process procedure applicable would be the same process available t every student 9 the house amendment contains similar provision except that it uses the ter m weapon instead of gun or firearm and contains an additional sentence stating tha t school personnel may modify the disciplinary action on c asebycase basis the senate amendment defines firearm to be the definition at 18 usc 921 which readshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20309crs4 20 usc 1412 141310 20 usc 141511 145 cr s5529 may 19 199912the term firearm means any weapon including starter gun which will or i s designed to or may readily be converted to expel projectile by the action of n explosive b the frame or receiver of any such weapon c any firearm muffler r firearm silencer or d any destructive device such term does not include an antique firearm the house amendment does not contain definition but would apparently use th definition of weapon already contained in section 615k of idea 20 usc 1415k there is some ambiguity about the applicability of the defini tion however since the house amendment states that actions taken pursuant to t his paragraph shall not be subject to the provision of this section other than this paragraph apparently the section referred to is section 615 and the intent of this provision in the amendment would be to eliminat ideas due process procedures the amendments further state that the idea provision regarding the continuation of educational services during an expulsion or suspension would not be applicabl although the local educational agency may choose to continue to provide educationa l services to the c hild in location determined by the local education agency educational agencies would not be considered in violation of the idea requirements regarding state or local educational agency eligibility for funds because of the provision of discipline and10 services r assistance under the amendment and actions taken under the amendment are not subject to other procedural safeguard provisions of idea11 the senate and house amendments include conf orming changes relating to citations to section 615 of idea similarly in the senate amendment subsection would be added to the gunfree schools act stating that notwithstanding any ther provision of 20 usc 8921 the section shall be subject to the amendment contained in section 615 of idea debate on the house and senate amendments both the house and sen ate amendments were the subject of emotional debate the general theme sounded by proponents of the mendments was that recent incidents of gun violence in the schools necessitated the changes in idea to allow school officials mor control over discipline the opponents of the amendments argued that the disciplin provision s in idea had been carefully crafted in the 1997 reauthorization and that th result of the amendments would be more criminal behavior by having children wit h disabilities who had possessed weapons without supervision and educational services senate debate the frist ashcroft amendment was the subject of extensive debate in the senate senator frist stated the amendment would change existing law which h described as allowing one child in special education class who brings gun or bomb to school to betreated preferentially compared to another child who does not have disability or is not in special education who brin gs gun or bomb to school tying this12 issue to recent school shootings senator frist further observedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20309crs5 id 13 145 cr s5690 may 20 199914 145 cr s5689 may 20 199915 145 cr s5684 may 20 199916 145 cr s5687 may 20 1999quoting from letter from the national association f17 state boards of education it should also be noted that an amendment proposed by senato r harkin also passed the senate wi th s 254 this amendment which does not specifically address idea would require school personnel to ensure that immediate appropriate interventions an d services including ntal health interventions and services are provided to child removed from school for any act of violence including carrying or possessing weapon at school fund s would be authorized to support this program 145 cr s5534 may 19 199918clearly the way we have set up this federal ly mandated disciplinary procedure with this loophole sends students mixed message about guns in schools it basically says if you are in special education you are going to be treated in special way if you bring gun into school but if you are not in special education you are going to be treated lik everybody else an d you are going to be expelled what mixed message when we are talking about guns when we are talking about the shootings the 27 deaths in ou r classrooms and schools that we have witnessed we must respond 13 similarly senator ashcroft described the amendmen t as school safety issue he also14 stated this is bill that provides for equity simply saying that principals an d superintendents should have the power without interference from the federa l governmen t to remove students from school who come to school with firearm n explosive or gun15 senator harkin disagreed with this characteri zation of the amendment he noted that under current law school authorities can unilaterally remove child with disability first of all for the first 10 days and provide ser vices whatsoever second if it is found that their actions were not manifestatio n of their disability then of course he is treated in the same manner as nondisabled children and can be kept out in an alternative settin g forever senator harkin also argued that the amendment would make the schools and16 communities less safe as children would be out on the streets with educational services and quoted from numerous letters from police and prison authori ties as well as the national pta and the national associa tion of state boards of education the common theme in these letters was concern about denying children with behavioral problems educationa l services since this was seen as shifting the problem to the neighborhood and street s surrounding the school 17 senator jeffo rds also opposed the fristashcroft amendment agreeing with senator harkin that current law allows for removal of child with disability who has disciplinary problem although educational services must be provided after ten days senator jeffords observed the basic question is in the final analysis should the school have to afford an alternative education situation and pay for it 18 house debate the house debate was similar to that in the senate

the amendment clarifies that19 school personnel can modify any d isciplinary action on casebycase basis mr talent20 supported the amendment and observed that he had heard from teachers and othe r educators in his district that they need the authority to remove violent children from the classroom including children considered disabled under idea21 representative scott opposed the amendment arguing that it guts an histori c bipartisan legislative act which was signed into law just 2 years ago he als o22 emphasized the importance of continued educational services for children stating i know of public policy benefit whic h can be achieved by sending these children into the street without any educational services even if they are being involved with weapons h contended that there was deterrent effect to the cessation of education and tha t research indicates that children with disabilities who do not receive educational services are less likel to be employed and more likely to be involved in crime mr owens also23 opposed the amendment referring to it as backdoor ambush of children wit h disabilities24
