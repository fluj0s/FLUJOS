to enter into treaties with foreign nations tribes retain sovereignty over their own internal affairs4 t h i s sovereignty however is subject to complete defeasance by congress5 which enjoys nearly plenary power to legislate in the field of indian affairs6 justice john marshall famously likened the unique status of indian tribes to domes tic dependent nations and their relationship with the united states to ward to his guardian7 the supreme court has refined these ideas over the last two centuries to describe the limited authority that tribes have retained as those inherent powers of limited sovereignty which has ne ver been extinguished8 this inherent sovereignty doc trine reflects the fact that indian tribes were at one time independent and selfgoverning societies9 that existed prior to the united states constitution and much of their authority over their own internal affairs survived their assimilation into the united states because this power existed before the constitution it does not spring from that docum ent but is rather power retained from the tribes days as sovereigns10 the supreme court has defined tribes inherent powers as those powers not inconsistent w ith the tribes domestic dependent status11 as the court put it exercise of tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal selfgovernment or to control internal relations is inconsistent with the dependent status of the tribes and so cannot survive without express congressional delegation12 the inquiry into whether tribe is exercising its inherent authority then must focus on whether tribes attempted exercise of authority falls within that part of sovereignty which the indians lost by virtue of their dependent status13 this distinction between tribes inherent authority and that authority which was divested upon the tribes assimilation into united states territory is central to the conflict that faced the supreme court in lara also central to the conflict in lara was the distinction between members of the tribe and outsiders ie indians who ar not members of the tribe and nonindians the inherent sovereignty that tribe enjoys over its internal affairs clearly extends to members of that tribe but does not ex tend to nonindians even when they residehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32361crs3 14 oliphant v suquamish indian tribe 435 us 191 210 1978 15 see

question of authority over nonmember indians however has been the subject of some wrangling between the judicial and legislative branches and lara represented an opportunity for th supreme court to clarify this area of indian law billy jo lara an indian was arrested by bureau of indian affairs bia officers on the spirit lake indian reservation in 2001 for public intoxication in the course of his arrest lara who is not member of the spirit lake nation struck one of the officers and subsequently pled guilty to three violations of the spirit lake tribal code15 lara was later charged in federal court with assaulting federal officer and moved to dismiss on the ground that his havi ng to stand trial in both tribal and federal court for the same offense violated the d ouble jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment16 the fifth amendments double je opardy clause states that person shall be subject for the same offen ce to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb the supreme court has limited th protections of the double jeopardy clause however by holding that it does not apply to person who violates the laws of two independent sovereigns nd thus commits crime against each17 the deciding factor in whether this dual sove reignty doctrine applies is whether the two prosecuting entities derive their power from the same source18 so in lara if the spirit lake nation prosecuted mr lara pursuant to its inherent authority authority which as discussed above doe s not derive from the constitution then there was double jeopardy problem when the federa l government which does get its power from the constitution also prosecuted mr lara on the other hand if the spirit lake nation traces its power to prosecute nonmember indian to delegation from congress then that power springs from the constitution and mr lara was tried twice in violation of the double jeopardy clause duro and the icra amendments of 1990 in duro v reina 19 the supreme court was confronted with this same question of whether or not indian tribes have inherent authority to assert criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians the court citing the historical record and concern for the personal liberties of nonmembers who could be punished by government in which they have part found that tribes do not possess the inherent authority to assert criminal jurisdiction over nonmembers20 the court noted however that congress has the power to delegate such author ity if it so chooses21httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32361crs4 22 25 usc 1301 et seq 23 25 usc 13012 24 25 usc 13014 25 see hr conf rep 102261 at 3 1991

of indian tribesto exer cise criminal jurisdiction over all indians23 emphasis added congress also amended the definition of indian to include all indians subject to federa l jurisdiction under th major crimes act24 congress specifically included the phrase inherent power to declare that this power was not being newly delegated to the tribes but rather had always been with them25 so as mr laras case came before the eight circuit the court had very difficult inquiry before it in order to determine whether the double jeopardy clause had been violated the court had to ascerta in the source of the power the spirit lake nation sought to exercise to make that determination howev er the eighth circuit had to first rule on whether congre ss acted impermissibly in overturning duro the eighth circuit opinion the primary question for the eighth ci rcuit was whether the supreme courts holding in duro was based on the constitution or federal common law the supreme court has the final say in interpreting the constitution26 and congress cannot overturn such an interpretation without amending the constitution itself27 conversely congress is free to overturn j udicial determinations of federal common law which is based in neither the constitution nor statute with such constraint28 the eighth circuit found that duro was grounded in the constitution and that the distinction between trib inherent and legated powers is of constitutional magnitude and therefore is matter ultimately entrusted to the supreme court29 in reaching this conclusion th court reasoned that the question of tribes inherent powers requires ascertainment of first principles regarding the position of indian tribes within our constitutional structure of government30 the court went on to find that because the decision in duro was constitutional one congress could not change it by st atute and therefore the ruling in duro thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32361crs5 31 id at 640 32 id at 644 quoting judith resnik

nonmembers stands the only option open to congress after duro the court continued was to delegate criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians to the tribes after construing the icra amendments as just such legation the eighth circuit concluded that the spirit lake nation was ac ting under this delegated au thority ultimately derived from the constitution and therefore the fede ral prosecution tracing its power to the same source violated th double jeopardy clause31 the dissent argued that the decision in duro was not constitutional but rather federal common law evidenced by the fact that the supreme court analyzed history and governmental customs rather than the constituti on in reaching its decision according to the dissent the supreme court was forced to do this because in the few places that the constitution mentions indian tr ibes it is only to clarify that they have extraconstitutional status32 without any statute statin g whether indian tribes had criminal jurisdiction over nonmember indians the dissent reasoned it acted as commonlaw court using whatever sources were relevant and readily at hand to ascertain the applicable legal principles and to answer the question before it33 what congress did when it enacted the icra amendments according to the dissent was not to delegate newlycreated authority but rather to restore part of the inherent sovereignty that the supreme court had rroneously stripped away as the dissent put it congress merely relaxed comm onlaw restriction on power previously possessed34 since duro was common law decision congress clearly had the power to overrule it said the dissent especially in light of the plenary control that congress enjoys over indian tribal sovereignty35 the ninth circuit opinion in united states v enas in united states v enas 36 an earlier case dealing with facts very similar to those in lara the ninth circuit found the duro ruling to be an interpretation of federal common law that congress had the power to

and say the law is but it cannot say that the law was never x or always y37 second the court was very concerned with the distinction between i nherent and delegated authority which also brought potential separation of powers pr oblems into play as the court put it although the line between inherent and legated powers is fuzzy one we are nonetheless required by supreme court preced ent to recognize this line and after applying duro s historical narrative to consid er the respective powers of congress and the courts with regard to this dispute38 with this required distinction in mind the court asked rhetorically if power first created by congress tomorrow could be designated as inherent what power could ever be delegated put simply none39 but the court ultimately determined that in the limited context of federal common law congress has the power to overrule the supreme courts interpretation of legal history40 the majority added an important qualification at the end of its opinion however stating that if this were question of constitutional history the icra amendments would have been impermissible41 the supreme court opinion both the federal government and various indian tribes filed briefs with the supreme court in opposition to the eighth ci rcuits holding the united states was primarily concerned with preserving its intere st in seeing that violators of federal law are punished in manner befitting their crime s the united states pointed out in its brief that while tribes may prosecute all offenses committed by indians on their reservations the punishment for any such offense is limited to one year imprisonment 5000 fine or both42 often therefore the government continued tribal prosecution of nonme mber indian even if successful could not result in sentence that adequately vindicates federal interests43 the united states also argued in its brief that criminals could benefit from possible race between the tribal and federal governments to prosecute an offender echoing the supreme courts concern in an earlier case the united stat brief stated that non member indian would have great incentive to enter prompt plea in tribal prosecution thereby gaining prot ection from federal prosecution44 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32361crs7 44 continued prospect of avoiding more severe federal punishment would surely motivate member of tribe charged with commission of an offense to seek to stand trial first in tribal court were the tribal prosecution held to bar the fe deral one important federal interests in the prosecution of major offenses on indian reservations would be frustrated 45 wheeler 435 us at 331 the problem would of c ourse be solved if congress in the exercise of its plenary power over the tribes chose to deprive them of criminal jurisdiction altogether but such fundamental abridgem ent of the power of indian tribes might beundesirable 46 justice breyer wrote the majority opinion in which four other justices joined while justices kennedy and thomas each filed separate opinions concurring in the result but departing significantly from the majoritys rationa justice souter filed dissent in which justice scalia joined 47 in fact of the four opinions written in this case majority two concurrences and one dissent only justice souter in his dissent devoted more than couple of sentences to the inherent vs delegated authority distinction that had been so central to prior decisions to justice souter the majority essentially strippe d this longstanding distinction of any real meaning which he found troubling as justice souter put it principles of stare decisis are particularly compelling in the law of tribal ju risdiction an area particularly susceptible to confusion and confusion i fear will be

misleading and that previous case law directs slightly different analysis specifically he read duro and wheeler to hold that while tribes possess certain degree of sovereignty conflict with federal policy can operate to prohi bit the exercise of that sovereignty the proper question then is whether the spirit ke nations exercise of authority over nonmember conflicted with federal policy united

congress might be forced to choose between the stat of affairs mentione d above and divesting the tribes of some or all of their criminal jurisdicti on over nonmember indians in an earlier case the supreme court had recognized that such an option would eliminate the double jeopardy problem but also give rise to new ones in that it would frustrate the tribal interests in maintaining order and preserving traditional tribal customs regarding transgressions45 on april 19 2004 the supreme court hande d down its decision overturning the eighth circuit46 the majority did not frame the issue before the court as one of conflicting interpretations of federal common law or even of inhe rent vs delegated authority47 rather justice breyer writing for the majority framed the issue thusly

br oad legislative authority with respect to indians the legislative branchs long hi story of relaxing and restricting indian authority and the limited nature of the chan ge in tribal authority embodied in the icra amendments49 very significant in the majority opinion was the courts characterization of the precedential effects of wheeler oliphant and duro these holdings reflect the courts view of the tribes retained sovereign status as of the time the court made them50 the majority essentially viewed the courts decision in duro as snapshot taken at specific time and drawn from specific sources one of the most important of which was legislation when cong ress enacted the icra amendments it changed the landscape that was the subject of the earlier snapshot51 while according to the majority congressional legislation tops the list of sources to which court must look when considering inherent tribal sovereignty noticeably absent from this list is the constitution the majority held that previous cases did not set forth constitutional limits that prohibit congress fromtaking actions that modify or adjust the tribes status rather continued the majority the courts prior cases make clear that the constitution does not dictate the metes and bounds of tribal autonomy nor do they ggest that the court should secondguess the political branches own determinations52 duro and those cases that came before it then were not constitutional decisions but rather judicial constructs and as the majority put it we do not read any of these cases as holding that the constitution forbids congress to change judicially made federal indian law through this kind of legislation53 because the tribe exercised its inherent authority which does not spring from the constitution the second federal case was pr osecuted by separate sovereign and did not violate double jeopardy significantly the major ity left open two questions first whether the due process clause of the constitution

to that of the supreme court majority delegation would still come into play in those situations wher congress does not have the power to restore aspects of tribal sovereignty united states v billy jo lara 324 f3d 635 645646 2003 arnold j dissenting it is not clear how ever under what circumstances such situation could arise permitting tribes that lack certain constitutional protections specifically the right to counsel in their courts to prosecute nonmember indians54 and second whether the fact that the icra amendments subject all indians to tribal jurisdiction violates the equal protection clause55 conclusion the supreme courts holding in billy jo lara preserves congresss ability to allow tribes to prosecute nonmember indians while retaining the federal governments authority to prosecute those sa defendants it seems likely that the courts holding also in essence eliminates the longstanding distinction between inherent and delegated aut hority in that congress now clearly has the power to classify authority as i nherent at its choosing56
