of the americas in miami 34 countries in the wester n hemisph ere agreed to complete negotiations to create free trade area of th americas ftaa later than the year 2005 since the summit two approaches have emerged for promoting hemispheric free trade the first approach involves the expansion and deepening of subregiona l groupings such as mercosur the southern cone common market and th proliferation of bilateral free trade agreements most all countries of the wester n hemisphere except the united states have been active in this process the second approach entails formal negotiations to construct the ftaa b progressively reducing barriers to trade and investment under this approach th trade ministers from the 34 countries agreed on the str ucture organization and venue for the ftaa negotiations at meeting held march 17 1998 in san jose costa rica and the negotiations were officially launched by the heads of state at the secon d summit of the americas held april 1819 1998 in santiago chile there are at least two different perspectives on how much overall progress has been made over the past four years in advancing hemispheric free trade som observers maintain that the official launching of the negotiations at santiago combined with the proliferation of subregional groupings and bilateral free trad agreements are all strong evidence of accelerating hemispheric integration other observers hold that the formal ftaa negotiations are likely to lose momentum r drag on interminably and that hemispheric integration may be evolving in manner that is hurting us interests if one ass umes hemispheric free trade is desirable objective several majo r hurdles stand in the way of moving more rapidly in that direction the mos t importan t obstacle is absence of fasttrack procedures for implementing trad agreement s tacit assurance that congress will not demand changes in trad bargains st ruck by the president is considered key to persuading us trade partners to engage in substantive negotiations in addition vast differences in size an d interests of the negotiatin g countries combined with the possibility that new round of multilateral trade negotiations may be launched in the near future could undermine the ftaa negotiations while the vision of hemispheric free trade was put forth by president bush eight years ago the amount of popular support in the united states for this goal remains unclear 1996 public opinion poll found that 57 of the american public wa s opposed to new free trade agreements with latin america while 1998 poll found 36

opposition to the proposal status of movement toward hemispheric free trade the objective of establishing hemisphe ric free trade area was formally adopted at the december 1994 summit of the americas held in miami at the summit president clinton and 33 other leaders of the western hemis phere agreed to complete negotiations to create free tr ade area of the americas ftaa later than the year 2005 in addition the leaders agreed to make concrete progress toward tha t objective by the year 2000 1 if the ftaa were established in 1998 it would have 34 members cuba is not included with 757 million consumers the population would be more than twice the 370 million that comprise the now 15nation european union the ftaa would also have combined economic output of more than 9 trillion with the 7 trillion us economy accounting for more than 75 if the total while the summit produced declaration of principles and plan of action that provided some general guidelines for the negotiations n either document provided blueprint or precise plan for achieving the ftaa subsequently hemispheric free trade is being promoted through two different approaches or processes2 the first approach involves the expansion of existing subregional agreements such as mercosur the southern cone common market or the andea n communi ty this approach entails adding countries to existing agreements with view towards eventually combining or amalgamating the agreements into large r accord through direct negotiati ons under this approach the clinton administrationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97514crs2 president bush unv

agreement nafta southward beginning with the accession of chile3 the second approach at tempts to harmonize diverse provisions and rules of the various existing regional groupings and potential members with view toward s eventual convergence into an overarching or general agreement this process f formal ftaa negotiations entails acceptance of tariff and nontariff obligations by various subregiona l groupings and countries with an eye over time toward blending these provisions into comprehensive free trade agreem ent under this approach the trade ministers from the 34 countries agreed on the principles and framework for the negotiati ons the san jose declaration in march 1998 and the negotiations wer officially launched by t he leaders at the second summit of the americas in santiago chile in april 1998 there are at least two different perspectives on how much overall progress has been made over the past two years in advancing hemispheric free trade som observers rgue that the process on balance is ontrack and others judge that the process is offtrack progress in expanding subregional groupings since th summit of the americas most countries in the western hemisphere with the exception of the united states have been actively involved in expanding sub regional groupings mercosur led by brazil has been the most active at th same time number of countries have negotiated additional bilateral free trad agreements with mexico and chile leading the way over the past three years mercosur which consists of argentina brazil paraguay and uruguay has reached free trade agreements wit h bolivia and chile that are designed to serve as steeping stones for full membership into mercosur mercosur has also signed an agreement with the andean community to negotiate free trade deal by 2000 and it continues to explore negotiating trade agreement with the european union eu the main obstacle to beginning negotiations is th insistence by some u members to exclude the cereals beef and sugar sectors from the negotiations these are all sectors in which mercosur countries are ver competitive4 mercosur hopes to expand its membership to all of south america

growing web of free trade agreements have entailed trade and non trade obligations that are deeper and more rigorous than those undertaken b mercosur and its free trade partners for the most part mexico has negotiated agreements that are relatively equivalent to its nafta obligations5 chile which envisions itself as bridge between asia and south america an d europe and south america has been similarly active on bilateral basis it s concluded agreements with mercosur mexico colombia venezuela canada and ecuador and intends to start similar negotiations with central america the united states is the major exception to this trend of expanding free trad agreements in the he misphere while the administration initially expected to pursue hemispheric in tegration actively under this approach beginning with an invitation to chile to negotiate accession to nafta at the summit of the americas the absence of fasttrack authority has prevented movement in this direction from taking place although negotiations with chile were formally launched in july 1995 chil subsequen tly suspended its participation because the clinton administration did not have fast track authority situation that chile feared could force it to negotiat twice with the united states once with the executive branch and once with th congress 6 the rapid increase in free trade accords in the hemisphere an

1998 while number of decisions were made at all the meetings the most significant prepa ratory work occurred at the san jose ministerial at the san jose meeting the 34 ministers responsible for trade in th hemisp here unanimously recommended that the leaders formally launch th negotiati on of the ftaa at the second summit of the americas in santiago s provided by the san jose declaration min

chair will provide overall direction and management to th negotiation s consisting of the 34 vice ministers for trade the first meeting of the tnc will be held later than june 30 1998 the ministers elected to establish nine ini tial negotiating groups which cover all the tariff and nontariff barrier issue areas identified by the leaders at the miam i summit of the americas these groups are market access agriculture services government procurement investment intellectual property subsidies competitio n policy and dispute settlement in addition the ministers cr eated two committees and consultative group committee on electronic commerce comprised of bot h government and private sector experts was established to make recommendations on how to inc rease and broaden the benefits to be derived from the electroni c marketplace committee on civil society was established to receive input at the hemispheric level from labor and environmental grou ps and academic consumer and other nongovernmental groups and consultative group on smaller economies was established to bring to the atte ntion of the tnc the interests and concerns of the smaller economies the united states miami will provide the venue f or the negotiating groups and the administrative secretariat supporting those meeting during the first three years the last four years of the negotiations will be held in panama and mexico the san jose declaration contains general principles for the negotiations s well as general and specific objectives in addition to transparency during th negotiations the ministers agreed that the ftaa should improve upon wto rules and disciplines whereve r possible and appropriate this provision was an attempt to ensure that any final agreement will break down the most serious trade barriers in the region and provide single set of rules for hemispheric trade it was agreed tha thttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97514crs5 bilateral and subregional agreements such as nafta and mercosur can coexist with the ftaa only to the extent that the rights and obligations under those agreements are not covered or go beyond those of the ftaa it was also agreed that th negotiations will be single undertaking in the sense that signatories to the fina l ftaa agreement will have to accept all parts of it ie cannot pick and choos among the obligations as expected president clinton and 21 other presidents and 12 prime ministers of the western hemisphere agreed at the santiago summit in april 1998 to launch the trade negotiations in accordance with the san jose declaration the first meeting of the nine negotiating committees took place in miami during september 1998 movement toward free trade assessments differ widely on whether this combined movement towar d hemispheric free trade is ontrack or offtrack the former basically positive perspective maintains that solid foundation and str ucture for ftaa negotiations has been agreed to and that ongoing efforts to expand subregional groupings ar acceleratin g hemispheric integration the latter mostly skeptical perspective holds that the united states lacking fasttrack authority has been unable to provide th kind of leadership that is necessary to ensure that the ftaa negotiations procee d according to schedule or in manner that is supportive of us interests those who see positive developments over the past three years point to th accompl ishments of the san jose trade ministerial and the second summit of th americas in getting the ftaa negotiations ff to an official start while some critics doubt much progress can be made in the neg otiations until the us obtains fasttrack negotiating au thority others point out that the absence of fasttrack may have made the us negotiating position more compromising and diplomatically effective to date this view holds that brazil and other latin countries ma not have agreed at santiago to begin formal ftaa negotiations if the united states had not been willing t change its original negotiating positions on agriculture and some other issues the ontrack perspective also points to continuing trend of greater market opening at both the bilateral and subr egional level as contributing to an expansion of trade flows in recent years intrahemispheric trade has been growing more rapidly than exports to the rest of the world this trade growth in turn has bolstered th econom ic performance of the countries of the region and enabled latin america n leaders to negotiate with the united states more confidently as well as to embrace the longterm goal of hemispheric free trade those who judge that the process is offtrack make several points the first is that the united states lacking fasttrack authority has not been able to promote its preferred approach the expansion of nafta to hemispheric integration instead it has been relegated to th sidelines as other countries and subregional groups have continued to reach preferential agreem ents these agreements in turn are said to be discriminating against us exports and making it more difficult to eventuall negotiate comprehensive hemispheric free trade agreement in the continuin g absence of fasttrack this view also holds that the ftaa negotiations will momentum or drag on interminably httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97514crs6 for full discussion see schott jeffrey j ed restarting fast

proposal by george holliday report 97876 ehurdles those who identify the creation of the ftaa as desirable objective cite two major hurdles to rapid movement in that direction these are the absence of fasttrack authority and divergent interests of key countries involved in the negotiations fasttrack authority many observers doubt that formal ftaa can be negotiated by 2005 in th absence of an extension of fast track authority from the congress such authorit allows the administration to negotiate trade agreement with assurances that th legislati on implementing the agreement will be treated under special procedures strict time limits on consideration and bars on amendments increase the probability of passage tacit assurance that congress will not demand changes in trade bargains and compromises struck by the pre sident is considered indispensable for persuading us trading partners to engage in substan tive negotiations while foreign countries in the past have agreed to begin trade negotiations without fasttrack authority in place it is considered unlikely that they would offer sensitive concessions in trade talks if they were unsure that us negotiators could live up to their end of the bargain 9 fast track authority was first adopted in 1974 and it has been renewed fiv times however since its expiration in 1994 efforts first by the clinto n administration and second by the house republican leadership have bee n unsuccessful in winning its renewal president clinton tr ansmitted to congress draft fasttrack bill in the fall of 1997 the proposal and sub sequent versions reported out10 of both th house ways and means and senate finance committees prove d controv ersial lacking the votes for passage the president on november 10 199 7 elected to suspend efforts to gain its passage in the 1 session of the 105 congressst th the most rece nt attempt to pass fast track bill occurred on september 25 1998 when the house defeated hr 2621 by vote of 180 to 243 the inability to obtain bipartisan majority in favor of fasttrack bill s stemmed primarily from divisions on the treatment of labor and environmenta l standards in future trade agreements many democrats maintain that future trad agreements should contain strong labor and environmental sta ndards particularly with developing countries that maintain tight control over labor markets and lax standards on environmental protection many republicans believe that these issues should be addressed in different fora and ways without n arrowing of the gap concerning the proper relationship between labor and environmental standards and internationa lhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97514crs7 for example venezuela and colombia two frequently mentioned candidates in the past11 are now experiencing considerable problems venezuela is struggling to return to path of economic reform and revitalization and colombia is deeply troubled by guerilla and drug related violence and corruptiontrade efforts to pass an extension of the fasttrack authority may continue to prove difficult in the future the terms of any potential fasttrack consensus of course could have direc t consequences for the ftaa and us relations with lat in america on the one hand fasttrack extension that entailed strong labor and environ mental provisions in future trade agreements could encounter strong opposition from ftaa negotiating partners most latin american leaders have made clear that they view any labor r environmental prov isions that are enforceable by trade sanctions as being potentially protecti onist and have vowed not to negotiate such agreements similarly fast track extension that contained authority only for multilateral negotiations coul d obviously gut the ftaa pro cess on the other hand fasttrack extension that was accompanied by measures to help american workers adjust to increased competition could help build domestic political support for the ftaa divergent country interests even if fasttrack negotiating authority is renewed in some form movemen t toward hemisp heric free trade likely will be constrained by the divergent interests of two key countries in the hemisphere mexico and brazil in addition there i s growing concern that the possible launch of new round of multilateral trad negotiations could effectively divert the attention of negotiators and countries away the ftaa process both mexico and brazil appear to have an interest in goslow approach to the ftaa negotiations mexicos interest in prolonging the negotiations i s straightforward preferential integration wit h the us economy through nafta has been major boon to its trade and eco nomy at least in the shortrun it has clear cut commercial interest in seeing that the value if its preferential access to the us market is not eroded by the creation of hemispheric free trade area 11 for brazil timeconsuming and extended negotiation would provide it wit h significant advantages not the least of which would be an opportunity to expan d mercosur into larger south merican trade bloc buttressed by the diplomatic support provided by larger mercosur brazil could be better positioned t negotiate with the united states from position of strength this is particularl important because brazil together with arge ntina wishes to extract from the united states concessions limiting washingtons use of unfair trade practices remedies ie antidumping and co untervailing duties and to improve its access to the us market for agricultural products in addition because mercosur currently protects number of sectors such as financial services telecommunications and government procurement longer period of t ime would provide these sectors with more leeway and capacity to adjust to increased import

negotiations under the aegis of the world t rade organization wto could also divert the attention of key countries from the ftaa process wto ministerial meeting scheduled for 1999 is expected to decide whether and when to initiate new round opposition while the vision of hemispheric free trade was put forth by president bush eight years ago and subsequently embraced by president clinton the amount of popular support in the united states for this goal remains unclear for example publi c opinion poll taken in 1996 found that 57 of the u s public is against new free trade agreements with latin america while 1998 poll showed 36 opposition 13 sources of opposition within the united states can be seen in controversies relating to the bene fits and costs of hemispheric free trade as well as to the efficacy f regional free trade arrangements in supporting us interests benefits and costs of hemispheric free trade the debate over the be nefits and costs of hemispheric free trade tends to divide along economic and geopolitical considerations tho that emphasize the economic benefits and costs often view hemispheric free trade as an end in itself while thos who emphasize geopolitical costs and benefits tend to view hemispheric free trade as means to achieve other objectives economic benefits and costs the clinton administration and mos t supporters of hemispheric free trade emphasize the extent to which movement in this direction will help expand us exports which in turn will create more and bette r paying jobs the statistics cited in support of this contention include the following exports over the last 5 years have accounted for nearly 40 of us economic growthhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97514crs9 see congressional testimony of regina k vargo deputy assistant secretary of commerce14 for the western hemisphere before the subcommittee on international economic policy of the house international relations committee on april 29 1998 exports support an estimated 113 million us jobs and over 14 million of these jobs were generated by increased exports over the last 4 years exportrelated jobs are good jobs paying 1316 more than non traderelated jobs us exports to the western hemisphere includ ing canada and mexico have accounted for twothirds of us export growth in 1997 us exports to latin america and the caribbean the 31 other countrie s which the us does not have free trade agreement with have increased by 150 since 1990 making this region one of the the fastest growing markets for us exports as result the us n ow sells more to brazil than it does to china and more to chile than it does to india because latin america and the c aribbean have relatively higher trade barriers than the united states tariffs that are four times higher american companies will have the most to win from reciprocal reduction of barriers beyond the potential direct gains from freer trade proponents see dange r for us exports and investments arising from the movement toward s preferential trade agreements in the region without us participation the cite free trade agreements that chile has concluded with canada mexico and mercos ur as contributing to an estimated 500 million in lost us exports the effect reportedly is due to the fact that us exporters are subject to price disadva ntage imposed by the 11 chilean duty that chiles preferential hemispheric free trade partners do not have to pay 14 opponents and skeptics can respond that supporters overstate the potentia l benefits and underestimate or ignore the potential costs regarding the potentia l benefits they make the argument that latin america and the caribbean excludin g mexico because it is already member of nafta represen t relatively small market for us exports in 1997 for example the region accounted for only 9 or 6 3 billion of total us exports although it may be fastgrowing market the relatively small trading relationship the united states has with these countries indicates tha t hemispheri c free trade could have only modest impact on economic activity including export growth in the united states as result opponents can argue that movement in this direction is not going to create large num bers of exportrelated jobs concerning the dangers of inaction opp onents can point out that the trade data to date do not support t he assertion that the united states is losing market share as result of being excluded from preferential trade agreements for example in th case of chile which has negotiated pre ferential trade agreements in recent years with mexico

enforceable by the threat of us trade sanctions can lead to loss of us jobs put downward pressures on us wages and divert investment capital abroad i n particular many democrats labor unions and environmental groups are reluctant to support new trade agreements on the grounds that the nafta is working to lower the standard of living of us workers and encouraging businesses to relocate i n mexico to take advantage of lower wages and weak enforcement of environmental laws 16 opponents als point to the huge turnaround in the bilateral trade balance with mexico going from 14 billion surplus in 1994 to 175 billion deficit in 1997 as sign that the agreement is having negative impact on employment in the united states huge increase us imports from mexico is estimated by opponents t

primacy in todays trade debate while the clinto n administration justifies its support for hemispher ic free trade as well as for fasttrack extension primarily on building p rosperity at home through export expansion it also has made the case that stronger trade ties support broader us interests as well but the administration according to some crit ics has failed to consistently and forcefully
