the united states that the incapacity of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on the united states one of the findings of the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protec tion established by president clinton in 1996 was the need for the federal gove rnment and owners nd operators of the nations critical infrastructures to share information on vulnerabilities and threats however the commission noted that owners and operators are reluctant to share confidential business inform ation and the government is reluctant to share information that might compromise intelligence sources or investigations among the strategies to promote information sharing was proposal to exempt critical infrastructure information from disclosure under the freedom of information act the freedom of information act foia was passed to ensure by citizen access to government information nine categor ies of information may be exempted from disclosure three of the nine exempti ons provide possible protection against the release of critical infrastructure information exemption 1 national security information exemption 3 information ex empted by statute and exemption 4 confidential business information cong ress has considered several proposals to exempt critical infrastructure information from foia generally the legislation has created an exemption 3 statut or adopted the exemption 4 dc circuit standard prior to passage of the homeland secu rity act pl 107296 the house hr 5005 and senate s 2452 bills differed significantly on language providing foia exemption differences included the type of information covered and exempted from foia the scope of the protec tions provided the authorized uses or disclosures the permissibility of disclosures of related information by other agencies immunity from civil liability preemption and criminal penalties the homeland security act pl 107296 section 214 provisions regarding th exemption of criti cal infrastructure information from foia adopted the house language in its entirety public interest groups question the nece ssity of foia exemption suggesting that existing foia exemptions provide sufficient protections they also argued that the house language which passed was t oo broad and would allow wider range of information to be protected including information previously available under foia they favored the more limited protections proposed in the s 2452 public interest groups also expressed concern that the provision which bars use of the protected information in civil actions would shield owners and operato rs from liability under antitrust tort tax civil rights environm ental labor consumer protection and health and safety laws owners and operators of critical infrastructures insisted that current law did not provide the certainty of protec tion needed while they viewed the senate language as workable compromise they favored the protections in hr 5005

gton dc october 1997critical infrastructure information disclosure and homeland security introduction and background leading up to the passage of the home land security act of 2002 pl 107296 debate ensued regarding the exemption of critical infrastructure information from the freedom of information act 5 u sc 552 both the house and senate versions of the homeland security act hr 5005 and s 2452 respectively contained language exempting such in formation but the two versions were significantly different final passage of the act included the house language sections 211 215 of pl 107296 this report discusses the differences in language and some of the arguments and concerns expr essed by both supporters and critics of the exemption certain socioeconomic activities are vital to the daytoday functioning and security of the country for example transportation of goods and people communications banking and finance and the supply of electricity and water these activities and services have been referred to as compone nts of the nations critical infrastructure domestic security and our ability to monitor deter and respond to outside hostile acts also depend on some of these activities as well as other more specialized activities like intelligence gathering law enforcement and military forces serious disruption in these activities and capabilities could have major impact on the countrys wellbeing in july 1996 president clinton established the presidents commission on critical infrastructure protection pccip1 the commission was tasked with assessing the vulnerabilities of the countrys critical infra structures and proposing strategy for protecting th em in its final 1997 report2 the commission stated that the twoway sharing of information is i ndispensable to infrast ructure assurance and that increasing the sharing of strategic information within each infrastructure across different sectors and between sectors and the government will greatly assist efforts of owners and operators to identify their vulnerabilities and acquire tools needed for protection according to th commission the exchange of information is also necessary to develop an analy tic capability to examine information about incidents vulnerabilities and other intelligence information to determine whether events are related and can be used possibly to recognize or predict an attackhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31547crs2 3 exemption 3 exempts from disclosure inform ation specifically exempted by statute as long as the statute leaves di scretion on disclosure and that the

protecting americas cr itical infrastructures presidential decision directive 63 may 1998 available at http wwwciaogovres ourcepaper598pdfthe commission also noted that there is reluctance on the part of the private sector and the government to share information related to vulnerabilities or incidents needed to plan for and effect adequate pr otections the private sector is reluctant to submit information to the government related to vulnerabilities or incidents that might damage its reputation weaken its competitive position lead to costly investigations be used inappropriately or expose it to liability as result of disclosure by the governme nt of confidential business information the government is reluctant to disclose threat information that might compromise intelligence activities or investigations the first objective of the commissions recommended strategy for action was to promote partnership between gove rnment and infrastructure owners and operators that would increase the sharing of information relating to infrastructure threats vulnerabilities and inte rdependencies the commission pr oposed developing an information sharing and anal ysis center isac that would consist of government and private sector representatives working together to receive information from all sources analyze it draw conclusions about vulnerabil ities or incidents within the infrastructures and in form government and private sector users it also recognized that in order to facilita the exchange of information the private sector would need assurances that its c onfidential information would be protected the commission noted that this might require that legal vehicle be established within the critical infrastructure information sharing mechanism that would protect confidential information and examined the ra mifications of different approaches and strategies related to the federal governments protection of private sector information it briefly discussed some pros and cons associated with the creation of foia exemption 3 statute for critical infrastructure information under exemption 3 of the freedom of information act foia 5 usc 552 information protected from disclosure under other statutes is also exempt from public disclosure under foia3 in response to the commissions report pr esident clinton released presidential decision directive 63 pdd634 the directive instructed the national coordinator for security in frastructure protection and c ounterterrorism and other government officials to consult with priv ate sector owners and operators of critical infrastructures and encourage the creation of private sector information analysis and sharing center as envisaged by the pccip although the directive did not address foia explicitly it did direct th national coordinato r to undertake studies to examine liability issues arising from participation by private sector companies in the information sharing process existing legislative impediments to information

confidentiality protections in connection with the implementati on of pdd63 number of industrial sectors which own andor opera critical infrastructures formed isacs and entered into arrangements with the federal governme nt to share information however the general accounting office reported in ap ril 2001 that very little or formalized flow of information has occurred from the pr ivate sector to the federal government5 according to the director of the nati onal infrastructure pr otection center the organization with which industry is to shar information one of the reasons for this is the uncertainty regarding foia exemptions6 similarly the partnership for critical infrastructure security crossindustry group formed to facilitate communication among industry sectors has stated that it is not clear that any of the existing foia exemptions provide the certainty of prot ection that many companies require before disclosing threat and vulnerability information to the government7 in the

to balance public access to information with the need for safety and security the federal government since its beginning s has delegated to agency heads the basic authority to control the papers and documents of their partments through the housekeeping statute of 1789 federal agencies have kept control of the disclosure of their files13 the administrative proce dure act apa of 1946 had slight

that the reports were commercial that they were provided to the agency on voluntary basis and that the submitter did not customarily release them to the pub lic thus the reports were found to be confidential and exempt from disclosure under exemption 4 the key issue raised by critical mass is the distinction between required and voluntary information submissions in its decision the court did not expressly define the two terms the department of justice has issued policy guidance on the distinction between information required and information voluntarily submitted under critical mass and has taken the position that the submission of records in instances such as the bidding on government contracts is mandatory rather than voluntary35 the basic principles developed by the justice department are that submitters voluntary participation in an activity does not determine whether any information submission made in connection with that activity is voluntary that critical mass determinations shoul d be made according to the circumstances of information submission that information s ubmissions can be required by range of legal authorities including informal mandates that call for the submission of information as condition of dealing w ith the government or of obtaining government benefit and that the existence of agency authority to require an information submission does not automatically mean that the submission is required36 the decision in critical mass has generated great deal of commentary37 in addition there are many cases where courts have applied

information covered and exempted from foia the definition of voluntary submission the other purposes authorized for use or disclosure of the information the disclosure of information with the consent of the submitter the permissibility of disclosures of related information by other agencies immunity from civil liability preemption and criminal penalties issues and concerns the general concerns of the owners and operators of critical infrastructure are that the type and breadth of information they are being asked to submit on vulnerabilities incidents remedies etc if made available to competitors or to the general public could harm their public rela tions compromise their competitive position expose them to liability or disclose sensitive information to terrorists and others who might wish to disrupt the functi on of their infrastructure it was their position that crafting specific exemption to foia in statute ie b3 exemption would provide the greatest gal protections for the information they share they believed that narrowly tailored b3 exemption would eliminate agency discretion to disclose protected in formation in response to foia request in addition given the federal governme nts need to share sensitive business information for homeland security purposes w ith state and local officials owners and operators also sought federal preemption of state and local

with variety of laws ie antitrust tort tax civil rights nvironmental labor c onsumer protection and health and safety laws another concer n centers on perceived lack of clarity on whether information obtained independently by subpoena for example could be used to bring civil suit eg would victim of chemical exposure be precluded from suing if information previously submitted to th department of homeland security was obtained independently from the company by subpoena another argument made by the public interest groups is that existing foia exemptions and case law offer sufficient pr otections to owneroperators they cite exemption b4 which allo ws agencies to withhold commercial information that is privileged or confidentia l if by disclosing that information the competitive position of the provider is harmed or the ability of the government to continue receiving that information is impaire d an exemption from foia for critical infrastructure information they argue w ould promote government secrecy and harm public access these groups are also concerned about provision they say gives the private sector the power to determine what information is to be protected simply by including an express statement of protecti on from disclosure on the submission to the federal government the criminal penalties provided for the unauthorized disclosure of protected information are viewed by some groups as essentially an anti whistleblower provision designed to stifle government accountability another issue raised by the groups is whether submissi on of information to the government will be treated as voluntary in situations where an agency has not exercised its authority to compel submission finally the groups take issue with the provision that preempts state and local free dom of information laws the public interest groups concerned with granting specific foia exemptions have expressed guarded acceptance of the senate version they feel it basically puts into statute recent foia case law regarding the protections afforded confidential information submitted to government agencies under foia exemption 455 representatives from industry responded to some of these concerns by stating that it was not their intent to evade current laws and regulations but that the extra protections are needed before they are willing to voluntarily submit information that might be used against them later either legally or competitively under the existing law companies had assurance that information they share with government agency will be treated confidentially nd agencies are not required to commit to confidentiality at the time of disclosure agencies are not required to initiate the foia exemption process until foia reque st is received when it is received the agency is asked to defend the informations confidentiality and is not required to inform the originator if it believes it has enough informa tion to proceed industry is generally in favor of
