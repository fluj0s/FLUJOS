larry m eig legislative attorney american law division summary on september 13 1999 us district judge approved an agreement to end litigation challenging californias proposition 187 1994 ballot initiative to deny illegal aliens state benefits and to require reporting of illegal alien applicants for benefits to federal immigration officials this agreement effectively continues earlier courtimposed restraints on implementing prop 187 meanwhile federal law enacted in 1996 denies illegal aliens most stateprovided benefits funded in part by the federal government and authorizes california to deny illegal aliens many other benefits that would have been denied had prop 187 been implemented in reversal of policy however california has now restored statefinanced prenatal care for illegal aliens and is also considering easing other restrictions that it had imposed after the 1996 law in november 1994 california voters approved proposition 187 by 5941 margin this initiative broadly denied illegal aliens statefunded services including public education and nonemergency health care it also required state authorities to facilitate the identification and removal of illegal aliens by the us immigration and naturalization service ins the state of californias legislative analyst had estimated that prop 187 would reduce net state outlays about 100200 million per year federal district court temporarily halted prop 187s restrictions on benefits in december 1994 and this freeze was continued under november 1995 preliminary injunction this 1995 decision lulac v wilson also overturned most of prop 187s enforcement procedures the courtordered halt of prop 187 finally became ripe for appeal in march 1998 when the presiding judge issued permanent injunction however new california governor gray davis decided to seek mediated end to the suit rather than to pursue an appeal subsequently the parties to the suit including the state agreed to maintain the effects of the injunction the presiding judge approved the agreement on september 13 1999 and some proponents of prop 187 have stated that they will now try to appeal the injunction on their own while litigation on prop 187 was pending the personal responsibility and work opportunity act prwoa became federal law pl 104193 on august 22 1996 this congressional research service the library of congress crs2 major welfare reform in part denies illegal aliens most federal state and local public benefits not including elementary and secondary education which remains available under the supreme court decision in plyler v doe 457 us 202 existing state laws that allowed benefits contrary to prwoa were preempted but prwoa also authorized the states to enact new laws to provide illegal aliens statefunded benefits after prwoa california officials identified more than 200 programs from which they planned to bar illegal aliens thus prwoa appeared likely to result in curtailing many benefits that would have been restricted under prop 187 with the major and expensive exception of elementary and secondary education nevertheless the 1998 elections resulted in new official attitude toward denying illegal aliens public services california is again giving illegal aliens access to statefunded prenatal care also bills are before the legislature to allow illegal aliens to obtain drivers licenses qualify for instate college tuition and reclaim certain other benefits denied them the past several years at the congressional level frustration over the delayed implementation of prop 187 in part led the house to pass bills twice once during each of the 104th and 105th congresses to put court challenges to state ballot initiatives on faster judicial track the senate failed to take action on the bills however contents of prop 187 prop 187 addressed the following areas public education public elementary secondary and postsecondary schools may not admit student who is not authorized under federal law
