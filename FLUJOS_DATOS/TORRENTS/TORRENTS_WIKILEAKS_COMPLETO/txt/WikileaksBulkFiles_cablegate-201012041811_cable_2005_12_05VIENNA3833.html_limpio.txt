xxxxx told us that austrian authorities welcomed our information and wanted to pursue cases that merited further action they noted that our list of incidents involved several diverse issues some were money laundering cases some involved terrorist financing and others involved proliferation financing this involved different enforcement entities and legal frameworks xxxxx said they would consult with the various austrian agencies with stake in these cases 3 s many of the incidents we discussed were well known to austrian authorities according to xxxxx and in some cases had been the subject of thorough investigations for instance in the case related to russian crime boss semyon mogilevich austrian authorities had investigated the austrian head of raiffeisen investment ag in kiev but were unable to prove that he had knowledge of the illegal transactions therefore austrian authorities would be eager to receive more evidence on this and other cases the austrian financial intelligence unit fiu which resides in the federal criminal office and the financial market authority fma which oversees the banking sector would welcome concrete evidence xxxxx said 4 s some terrorist finance cases concerned entities which are not on the eu or lists and therefore not subject to legal sanctionsxxxxx noted that austria the us and israel had worked for years on the case of the palestinian association of austria pvoe but there was insufficient evidence to support listing the pvoe was now the subject of pending court case 5 sxxxxx said they would review our list of cases with view toward identifying specific information requests however they added that the us financial crimes enforcement network fincen should work closely with the austrian fiu to identify concerns this was especially the case regarding questions arising from suspicious transactions 6 sbu post will continue to pursue this matter with austrian financial authorities kilner
