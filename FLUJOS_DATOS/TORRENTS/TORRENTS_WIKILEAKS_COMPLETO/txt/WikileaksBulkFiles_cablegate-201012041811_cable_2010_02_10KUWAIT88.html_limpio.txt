kuwait 1112 c kuwait 61 classified by political counselor pete odonohue for reasons 14 b and d 1 c ambassador during january 31 luncheon in honor of tony blair at the residence of prime minister shaykh nasser sabah pulled aside foreign minister shaykh dr mohammed sabah and raised ref points concerning irans nuclear program continuing usg concerns and our efforts to address tehrans intransigence which now require greater application of international pressure ambassador also noted washington interest in kuwaits recent highlevel diplomatic engagement with iran pms visit in november ref b iranian parliamentary speaker larijanis visit in january ref c and septel and reports of possible amiri visit later this spring as well as efforts to expand commercial ties including oilgas deals on the continental shelf septel and said that enhanced bilateral cooperation to align our strategies would be welcome the fm took the points on board but declined to be drawn out further on kuwaits strategy for dealing with iran 2 c earlier at the same event ambassador raised reftel points with the fms office director shaykh dr ahmad naser sabah note also the prime ministers end note who asked whether the iranian side had committed in writing to the tehran reactor fuel swap the qom facility inspection and the followon meeting of p5 1 shaykh dr ahmed suggested that the two critical issues are whether irans nuclear program is now so widespread as to be for practical purposes unstoppable and whether tehran has or is close to having the actual wherewithal to construct nuclear device ambassador replied that we are aware of at least three reactors but said the issue of capability was more difficult to judge technical knowhow had to be combined with all the various necessary physical components and there would need to be political decision to proceed she emphasized that the presidents hand is still outstretched to iran but at some point iran will have to face the consequences of its recalcitrance moreover the president was walking carefully considered fine line in dealing with others who wished to take actions we hoped to avoid 3 c dr ahmad took ambassadors point and noted that year or two ago many in kuwait hoped silent targeted strike would take out the troublesome reactor and leave the region more relaxed he suggested that now however iran might have multiple reactors and was so intent on achieving its nuclear goal that matter what the west did iran would get the bomb and any attempt to disrupt it militarily or through tough sanctions would go badly for the west he offered his analysis that iran is very different from iraq if the murshid orders his people to do something like revenge attacks across the gulf striking american interests as well as arab they will do it to person 4 c polcounselor separately alluded to usg concerns raised reftel during january 31 meeting with mfa asia department counselor rashid alhajri during january readout on iranian speaker ali larijanis visit last week to kuwait ref c and septel alhajri in response delivered the goks standard and not particularly convincing talking points on this issue emphasizing the goks clear and unchanging position that iran must abide by and iaea safeguards on its nuclear program and opposes any military options in the gulf alhajri said gok officials invariably stress these points in meetings with iranian counterparts at the same time kuwait is obliged to conduct bilateral relations on variety of issues with its larger neighbor 5 c comment kuwaitis at all levels are deeply worried about the nuclear ambitions of their much larger neighbor but are unsure how to respond they worry that an iran emboldened by nuclear arsenal would assert greater regional hegemony at the expense of kuwaiti interests and would be more inclined to meddle in kuwaiti internal affairs given the thirty percent of the nation that is shia however kuwaitis are equally concerned about military preemption which they believe would not prove decisive and would lead iran to lash out at us interests in the gulf including us military facilities in kuwait and against those states in the region seen as allied with the us kuwaits current limited engagement with iran appears to be motivated by desire to try to lower regional tensions particularly between iran and saudi arabia with kuwait able to distance itself from the message by emphasizing that it is speaking on behalf of the gcc in its capacity as gcc chair for 2010 6 u comment continued at the same time kuwait more parochially is seeking way forward to secure iranian agreement to tap gas reserves in the disputed continental shelf kuwait needs the gas which it has little of domestically to fuel more and cleaner power plants to meet growing electricity demand the careful balancing act kuwait is playing was perhaps best exemplified during the visit last week of iranian parliamentary speaker larijani his warning that gcc states should not allow their territory to be used by the us to launch attacks against iran was carried in most local papers on the front page above the fold with prominent coverage given below the fold to comprehensive coverage including photos of the uskuwait military exercise eager mace kuwaits nuanced approach requires careful footwork but pm nasser mohammed sabah former dean of tehrans diplomatic corps and selfdescribed iran expert apparently feels confident he is up to the task and doesnt need much help from the us with the choreography end comment for more reporting
