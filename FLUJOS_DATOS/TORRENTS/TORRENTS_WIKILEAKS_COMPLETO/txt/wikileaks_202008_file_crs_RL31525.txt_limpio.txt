medicare prescription drug benefit summary on december 8 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 was signed into law hr 1 pl 108173 the law adds part d to medicare establishing new voluntary prescription drug benefit that begins in 2006 this report analyzes how the costsharing and premium provisions under part d would affect the amount that beneficiary would pay annually for prescription drugs in addition this report gives examples of how annual cost sharing would differ for beneficiaries with various levels of total prescription drug spending in 2006 under the plans standard benefit standard prescription drug coverage under the plan would pay 75 of drug costs after the enrollee paid the 250 deductible in 2006 after 2250 in total drug spending the coverage limit the enrollee would pay for all prescription drug spending until reaching the 3600 outofpocket protection threshold this threshold would be reached when total spending on prescription drugs exceeds 5100 assuming none of the costsharing is paid for by group health insurance or other thirdparty arrangement medicare would then cover 95 of all additional drug expenses as long as the beneficiary paid minimum of 2 for each generic drug and preferred multiplesource drug and 5 copayment for all other drugs thus for most beneficiaries medicare would not contribute directly to the cost of drugs when annual drug expenses fall in certain range although medicare would contribute directly toward beneficiary drug expenses at levels below and above this range this aspect of the coverage is often referred to as the doughnut hole under medicare part d standard coverage the doughnut hole is between 2250 and 5100 in total prescription drug spending lowincome beneficiaries would not face doughnut hole in their coverage dual eligibles medicare beneficiaries enrolled in their states full medicaid benefits who are also institutionalized would pay premium and have cost sharing whatsoever in 2006 noninstitutionalized dual eligibles with countable income below 100 of poverty would pay premium or deductible but would face 1 copayment for each generic and preferred multiplesource drug and 3 copayment for all other covered drugs until their total annual drug costs reach 5100 in 2006 all other dual eligibles would face 2 copayment for each generic and preferred multiplesource drug and 5 copayment for all other covered drugs until total annual drug costs reach 5100 medicare beneficiaries with countable income under 135 of poverty and countable assets in 2006 of more than 6000 for an individual and 9000 for married couple would have this same level of cost sharing beneficiaries who do not qualify in any of the previous lowincome categories but have countable income below 150 of poverty and countable assets of more than 10000 for an individual or 20000 for married couple in 2006 would be eligible for partially subsidized premium and lower

medicare prescription drug benefit introduction on december 8 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 was signed into law hr 1 pl 108173 the law adds part d to medicare which establishes new voluntary prescription drug benefit that begins in 2006 this report analyzes how the costsharing and premium provisions under part d would affect the amount that beneficiary would pay annually for prescription drugs1 in addition this report gives examples of how annual costsharing would differ for beneficiaries with various levels of total prescription drug spending in 2006 under the plans standard benefit costsharing and insurance insurance acts to reduce uncertainty and individuals exposure to high costs due to catastrophic events such as severe illness in general individuals pay premium and in exchange insurers pay for their covered benefits premiums are paid regardless of whether covered expenses are actually incurred in addition to premiums enrollees may also face costsharing which is the portion of total expenses that enrollees must pay for covered benefits costsharing in health plan generally includes some combination of deductibles coinsurance copayments and limits on individuals outofpocket expenses because these concepts are necessary to evaluate and compare the prescription drug coverage in the proposals they are described in box 1 1 for discussion of other issues associated with prescription drug benefit such as how much risk would be borne by private insurance see crs report rl31966 overview of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 by jennifer osullivan et crs2 box 1 terms used to describe costsharing deductible the amount an enrollee in an insurance plan must pay outofpocket before the insurer begins paying for covered services generally the enrollee must meet this amount each year plans with deductible are said to provide firstdollar coverage coinsurance rate the percentage of covered costs paid by the enrollee the terms of coverage can specify various coinsurance rates for different aspects of coverage for instance before and after threshold of expenses copayment fixed dollar amount that the enrollee must pay for each covered benefit for instance filled prescription copayment differs from coinsurance in that the copayment amount does not vary with the cost of the service however copayments may differ based on the type of drug for example one copayment amount for brandname drugs another for generic drugs coverage limit the total amount of incurred expenses at which the insurer federal government health care plan etc reduces its contributions to the enrollees expenses for example once an enrollees drug costs exceed the coverage limit the enrollee must pay for most or all the additional drug expenses catastrophic coverage to protect beneficiaries from exposure to extraordinarily large expenses insurers may offer catastrophic coverage wherein the insurer for instance medicare or private health plan typically pays all or almost all additional expenses once an enrollee meets the annual outofpocket protection threshold or catastrophic threshold excluding premiums costsharing arrangements pl 108173 establishes medicare part d which includes voluntary standard prescription drug benefit in medicare that would take effect in 20062 variations in the beneficiary costsharing requirements of the plan will affect the level of potential outofpocket costs to individual beneficiaries since participation is voluntary expected outofpocket expenses are likely to be critical factor when beneficiaries consider whether to enroll under part d beneficiary with the standard coverage would pay 25 of drug costs after meeting the 250 deductible in 20063 after 2250 in total drug spending the coverage limit the enrollee would pay for all prescription drug spending until reaching the 3600 outofpocket protection threshold this amount is often referred to as the true outofpocket threshold because according to the language in the conference agreement costsharing paid on behalf of the enrollee by group health insurance or other thirdparty arrangement does not count toward the 3600 this threshold is reached when total spending on prescription drugs exceeds 2 beneficiaries will be able to purchase either standard coverage or alternative coverage with actuarially equivalent benefits plans with different but actuarially equivalent benefits might have other costsharing requirements with slightly different deductibles and coinsurance rates 3 all of the nominal dollar amounts related to the benefit will be increased by the annual percentage increase in average per capita medicare drug expenditures in subsequent years crs3 5100 assuming none of the costsharing is paid by group health insurance or other thirdparty arrangement after reaching this threshold medicare would cover 95 of all additional drug expenses but the beneficiary must pay minimum of 2 for each generic drug and multiplesource4 preferred drug and 5 for all other drugs the congressional budget office estimates that the average monthly enrollee

drug for which there are 2 or more drug products rated as therapeutically and pharmaceutically equivalent by the food and drug administration 5 although the cbo estimate of the average monthly premium is 35 in 2006 many medicare beneficiaries will face different monthly premium amounts for several reasons 1 the drug premiums will be adjusted for geographic variation in the price of drugs 2 beneficiaries premiums will be adjusted up or down to reflect the difference between the approved bid of their prescription drug plan of choice and the national average bid amount adjusted for geographic variation and 3 late enrollment penalty will increase the monthly premiums for beneficiaries who do not have any other creditable prescription drug coverage including medicaid group health plan state pharmaceutical assistance program veterans or military coverage or medigap and fail to enroll within 63 days of becoming eligible for part d crs4 coverage purchased from medicare prescription drug or medicare advantage plan do not count the doughnut hole under part d medicare does not contribute toward the cost of drugs when an some individuals annual drug expenses fall in certain range that is when expenses are above the coverage limit but below the total amount necessary to reach the outofpocket threshold this aspect of the coverage has been referred to as the doughnut hole6 under part d beneficiaries receiving the standard benefit must pay the full cost of drugs once they reach the coverage limit of 2250 and until their true outof pocket payments reach the catastrophic cap of 3600 because of the 250 deductible and the 25 coinsurance up to the initial coverage limit beneficiaries with the standard benefit will have spent 750 outofpocket excluding the premium when total of 2250 in drug costs has been spent assuming none of the costsharing is paid for by group health insurance or other thirdparty arrangement they will have to spend an additional 2850 to reach the catastrophic threshold of 3600 since there is medicare contribution over this range the beneficiary will bear the full cost of drugs from the coverage limit of 2250 until accumulated drug expenses reach 5100 as shown in figure 1 6 some have referred to this as gap in coverage which can be misleading coverage continues to be in effect even when medicare is not contributing directly to the cost of drugs and the beneficiaries outofpocket expenditures accumulate toward the catastrophic threshold while there may be gap in medicare payments there continues to be coverage and beneficiaries continue to have access to negotiated discounted prices crs5 figure 1 marginal beneficiary costsharing by total drug expenditures under medicare part d standard coverage 2006 100 90 80

dual eligibles and whether they are institutionalized9 under part d dual eligibles who are institutionalized would have cost sharing and pay premiums for their prescription drug coverage in 2006 noninstitutionalized dual eligibles with countable income of more than100 of the poverty level would have premium or deductible but would have copayments of 1 for generic and preferred multiplesource drugs and 3 copayments for all other drugs costs from 251 up to 5100 once annual drug costs reach 5100 the beneficiary would pay more for additional prescription drug expenses for the year10 noninstitutionalized dual eligibles with countable income above 100 of poverty and beneficiaries with countable income below 135 of poverty and countable assets of not more than 6000 for an individual or 9000 for married couple would not pay premiums or deductibles but would face slightly different copayments for drug costs of 251 up to 5100 in 2006 these beneficiaries would pay 2 per generic prescription and preferred multiplesource drug and 5 for all other prescription drugs once annual drug costs exceed 5100 these beneficiaries would have additional costsharing those who do not qualify

d medicare is the payer of dual eligibles covered prescription drugs medicaid coverage is not permitted to pay for these drugs or the accompanying costsharing however this is not the windfall to states that it might appear to be in 2006 states must pay the federal government approximately 90 of the costs they would otherwise have incurred if drug coverage for dual eligibles had continued

standard coverage in medicare part d in 2006 for given level of prescription drug expenses beneficiarys outofpocket payments will vary depending on the plans deductible coinsurance coverage limit and outofpocket threshold the cost to the government of providing coverage will also vary depending on these plan characteristics as well as the premium charged to enrollees more specifically if plan is designed to increase the beneficiarys share of the cost the governments share of the cost will decrease each of the following examples assumes that none of the costsharing is paid by group health insurance or other thirdparty arrangement the calculations do not consider reductions in expenditures due to negotiated discounts the effects of formularies and pharmacy benefit managers pbms or the consequences of incentives to use generic medications example 1 enrollee has zero annual drug costs medicare part d standard coverage 2006 premium 420 total payments 420 in example 1 the enrollee does not have any drug expenditures and therefore would pay only the premiums example 2 enrollees annual drug costs equal 50 medicare part d standard coverage 2006 deductible 50 premium 420 total payments 470 in the second example the enrollees annual drug expenditures equal 50 the 50 in drug costs falls below the plans deductible consequently the enrollee pays the entire 50 plus the premiums example 3 enrollees annual drug costs equal 750 medicare part d standard coverage 2006 deductible 250 coinsurance 25 of 500 125 premium 420 total payments 795 equal to total drug expenditures 750 minus the deductible 250 crs12 in example 3 the enrollee has 750 in total annual drug spending this amount exceeds the deductible in part d standard coverage by 500 the enrollee would pay the premiums the full 250 deductible and 25 of the 500 amount example 4 enrollees annual drug costs equal 1500 medicare part d standard coverage 2006 deductible 250 coinsurance 25 of 1250a 313 premium 420 total payments 983 equal to total drug expenditures 1500 minus the deductible the fourth example illustrates enrollee outofpocket spending when the enrollees total drug costs equal 1500 the enrollee would pay the premiums the 250 deductible and 25 of expenses above the deductible example 5 enrollees annual drug costs equal 3000 medicare part d standard coverage 2006 deductible 250 coinsurance 25 of 2000a 500 expenditures above 2250 coverage limit 750 premium 420 total payments 1920 equal to the coverage limit 2250 minus the deductible 250 in example 5 the enrollees cumulative drug costs for the year equal 300012 under part d for this level of total prescription drug spending medicare payments would occur only for the first 2250 of expenses thus the 3000 in expenses generated by the enrollee would exceed the initial coverage limit by 750 the enrollee would pay these excess expenses outofpocket in total the enrollee would pay the premiums as well as the following costsharing 1 the 250 deductible 2 25 of 2000 where 2000 equals the difference between the deductible and the coverage limit of 2250 and 3 the 750 in expenditures exceeding the initial coverage limit 12 cbo projected that in 2006 medicare beneficiaries will spend an average of 3155 annually on drugs not taking into account the prescription drug benefit in part d crs13 example 6 enrollees annual drug costs equal 4500 medicare part d standard coverage 2006 deductible 250 coinsurance 25 of 2000a 500 expenditures above 2250 coverage limit 2250 premium 420 total payments 3420 equal to the coverage limit 2250 minus the deductible 250 in example 6 the enrollees cumulative drug costs for the year equal 4500 the enrollees payments would be calculated in similar manner as in the previous example under part d the total outofpocket costs would be 3420 example 7 enrollees annual drug costs equal 6000 medicare part d standard coverage 2006 deductible 250 coinsurance 25 of 2000a 500 expenditures between 2250 coverage limit and 5100b 2850 coinsurance 5 of 900c 45 premium 420 total payments 4065 equal to the coverage limit 2250 minus the deductible 250 b the level of cumulative expenditures at which enrollee spends 3600 outofpocket is 5100 c equal to total drug expenditures 6000 minus 5100 example 7 illustrates situation in which an enrollees payments exceed the bills outofpocket protection threshold of 3600 excluding premiums in this example the enrollees costsharing would have otherwise exceeded this limit with total drug expenses of 6000 the enrollee would have paid 4500 in costsharing excluding premiums without the plans outofpocket protection13 however because 4500 exceeds the plans outofpocket protection threshold the enrollee would pay only 5 of the spending above the 3600 outofpocket protection threshold with 250 deductible 25 coinsurance rate up to 2250 in total spending and 100 costsharing above the 2250 coverage limit an enrollee would 13 without the outofpocket protection the beneficiary would have to pay 250 deductible 500 in coinsurance up to coverage limit of 2250 and the full 3750 between 2250 and 6000 for total of 4500 crs14 reach the 3600 limit on outofpocket payments once the enrollees drug expenses exceeds 5100 for the year of the additional 900 of spending above the outof pocket protection threshold in this example the enrollee would be responsible for paying only 45 example 8 enrollees annual drug costs equal 12000 medicare part d standard coverage 2006 deductible 250 coinsurance 25 of 2000a 500 expenditures between 2250 coverage limit and 5100b 2850 coinsurance 5 of 6900c 345 premium 420 total payments 4365 note assumes all costsharing applies to the outofpocket maximum equal to the coverage limit 2250 minus the deductible 250 b the level of cumulative expenditures at which enrollee spends 3600 outofpocket is 5100 c equal to total drug expenditures 12000 minus 5100 in example 8 the enrollees cumulative drug costs for the year equal 12000 the enrollees payments would be calculated in similar manner as in the previous example this enrollee would pay 4365 beneficiaries receiving the standard benefit figure 2 and figure 3 illustrate beneficiaries outofpocket payments plus premiums at different levels of total drug spending based on the costsharing requirements listed in table 1 figure 2 displays total prescription drug spending up to 2000 while figure 3 shows spending up to 1200014 the figures assume that all costsharing applies to each plans outofpocket maximum and does not account for the reduced costsharing for lowincome beneficiaries the structure of the benefit and costsharing in part d standard coverage produces many changes in coinsurance rates and outofpocket costs as total annual drug spending increases as can be seen in the kinks and corners in the figures breakeven the breakeven point is the point where the amount that an individual pays for plans costsharing and premiums is equal to what would have been paid in drug costs in the absence of any drug coverage the line in the figure 2 and figure 3 labeled drug coverage represents the amount that an individual 14 cbo projects that 45 of beneficiaries will spend more than 12000 on prescription drugs in 2006 see cbo march 2003 baseline projections not including the impact of part d crs15 would pay if he or she did not have any insurance coverage for prescription drugs the breakeven point is where this line is crossed by the line representing outof pocket spending under part d standard coverage in the figures the line segment to the right of the drug coverage line represent levels of drug spending where the enrollee pays less in outofpocket expenses and premiums than if they had drug coverage the line segment to the left of this line represent levels of drug spending where the enrollee pays more in outofpocket expenses and premiums than if he or she had drug coverage based on the premium and costsharing outlined in part d standard coverage the breakeven point is at 810 in total annual drug spending while the breakeven point is one factor in beneficiarys decision whether to participate in this insurance plan other factors such as attitudes toward risk and uncertainty are also important many beneficiaries will be making their decision about whether to purchase the insurance based on their expected annual prescription drug costs and their attitudes towards risk all other things being equal the higher the breakeven point the less likely beneficiaries will be to join voluntarily crs16 figure 2 annual outofpocket and
