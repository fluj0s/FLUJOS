that the us and eu always have more in co mmon than in dispute and like to point out that trade disputes usually affect small fraction often estimated at 12 percent of the trade in goods and services

impact that exchange rate changes are having on trade flows 11 the economist love the one youre with exchange rates october 20 2007macroeconomic factors such as differences in economic growth rates and exchange rates rather than trade barriers or other structural attributes are generally thought to explain most of the fluctuati on in the useu bilateral deficit for example the reduction in the trade defic it in 2006 and again in 2007 is being driven by decline in the value of the dollar by nearly 40 against the euro and 30 against the british pound since 200210 complaints about the decline of the dolla r and rise of the euro however are being voiced in europe while strong er euro improves the purchasing power of consumers by making imports cheaper and by keeping lid on inflation some governments are worried that stronger currency can stymie exports and exacerbate trade deficits french and italian govern ment leaders have ex pressed more concerns along these lines than german officials di vide that could reflect differences in the competitiveness of these key count ries within the euro zone11 traditional trade barriers tariffs and quotas remain problem in only few selected areas such as agriculture food tex tiles and apparel in these sectors us and eu tariffs still average between 10 and 20 percent ad valorem and help shield domestic producers from foreign competition regulatory cooperation instead of traditional barriers such as tariffs and quotas nontariff and regulatory barriers are increasingly recognized as the most significant trade and investment impediments to the creation of more integrated transatlantic market prompted by this understanding germanys chancel lor angela merkel upon assuming the rotating sixmonth presidency of the eu in january 2007 advocated further liberalization of transatlantic trade and investment barri ers by improving cooperation on reducing nontariff and regulato ry barriers to trade the aim of such efforts is to reduce costs to businesses on both sides of the atlantic improve consumer welfare and facilitate high er levels of economic growth automotive safety standards are one example of how different regulations increase costs for example us c itizen cannot go to germany and purchase bmw or mercedes and import it directly into the united states because it does not meet us safety standards but if us and german automakers had safety standards that were recognized by both the united states and eu they could reduce their costs by not having to produce two different au tomobiles the european commission has estimated that further transatlantic liberalization of these kinds of regulatory barriers could lead to permanent gains of 3 to 35 percent in per capital gross domestic product on both sides of the atlantic there have been number of previous attempts to reduce remaining nontariff and regulatory barriers to trade these have included the new transatlantic agendahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34381crs7

companies heavily enga ged in the transatlantic marketplace argue that the results have not pr oved materially significant in departure from these past efforts that relied substantially on voluntary and nonbinding dialogues among regulators with some political endorsement the merkel initiative proposed creating an overarc hing framework to provide greater commitment on the part of political leader s and greater accountability on the part of regulators according to business europe the eus main business trade association the initiative would require legislators and officials to take into account how new laws and regulations affect the transatlantic marketplace12 merkels proposal also covered issues such as public procuremen t intellectual property energy and the environment financial market s and security and innovation building on and borrowing from the merkel initiative the april 2007 useu summit adopted framework for advancing transa tlantic economic integration the framework affirmed the importance of further deepening transatlantic economic integration particular ly through efforts to reduce or harmonize regulatory barriers to international trade and investment new institutional structure transatlantic economic council tec was established to advance th process of regulatory cooperation and ba rrier reduction the tec is headed on both sides by min isteriallevel appoi ntees with cabinet rank13 given that the two leaders are cabin etlevel appointees the tec is expected to have highlevel political support that pr evious efforts at ec onomic integration may have lacked such clout it is argued is needed to persuade domestic regulators to yield some of their authoritie s or to better coope rate with their counterparts across the atlantic in harmonizing regulatory approaches14 the mandate of the tec is to accelerate ongoing efforts to reduce or harmonize regulatory barriers in part by including broader participati on of stakeholders including legislators in the discussions nd cooperative meetings in particular the framework document calls upon the tec to draw upon the heads of the existing transatlantic dialogues to provide input and

trade atlasexchange the transatlantic business dialogue and the transatlantic consumers dialogue the first meeting of the tec took place on november 9 2007 in washington at this meeting report prepared jointly by the office of management and budget and the secretariatgeneral of the european commission recommended including costs of regulation to foreign businesses in the costbenefit analysis of new regulations15 while business groups see this initiative as an opportunity to resolve and or avoid trade disputes embedded in different regulatory approaches some consumer groups are wary of such efforts to harmonize regulatory activities the transatlantic consumer dialogue for example warned that us costbenefit analyses of new regulations routinely overstate the costs and underestimate the benefits of regulations to the detriment of consumers16 the difficulty of harmonizing regulatory activities or resolving disputes embedded in regulatory differences was also underscored at the tec meeting by failure to resolve longstanding dispute i nvolving us exports of poultry to the eu the eu ban is based on health safety c oncerns regarding the use of several anti microbial agents used by us processing plants but us industry and officials say the health safety concerns are being used as disguised trade barriers concern that is echoed in other useu trade disput

shown in table 3 sizeable portion of useu trade involves goods from the same industry phenomenon economists ca ll intraindustry trade this type of trade is particularly characteristic of large advanced economies that have similar resource endowments nd levels of technology given that both the us and eu produce goods under broadly similarly wage safety and environmental standards each side concentrates on producing narrower range of products at larger scale by exploiting larger production runs of some subset of these goods both sides are able to produce and trade at lower unit costs significant attribute of intraindustry tr ade is that it tends not to generate the strong effects on the distribution of in come that can occur when developed economies trade with lessdeveloped economies as result this kind of trade may prove less politically contentious due to broader sharing of the benefits garnered from rising productivity20 table 3 top useu exports and imports by 2digit

aeronautic defense and space company according to the office of the us trade representative ustr several european governments france uk germany and spain have provided massive subsidies since 1967 to thei r aerospace firms to aid in the development production and marketing of the airbus family of large civil aircraft the us has also accused the eu of providing other forms of support to gain an unfair advantage in this key sector including equity infusions debt forgiveness debt rollovers marketing ssistance and favored access to eu airports and airspace23 for its part the eu has long resisted us charges and argued that for strategic and economic purposes it could not cede the entire passenger market to the americans particularly in the wake of the 1997 boeingmcdonnell douglas merger and the pressing need to maintain fficient global competition the europeans have also countercharged that their ac tions are justified because us aircraft producers have benefitted from huge indirect governmental subsidies in the form of military and space contracts and governme ntsponsored aerosp ace research and development24 the most recent round of this longsta nding trade dispute stems from may 30 2005 wto f iling by the united states alleging that eu member states provided airbus with illegal subsidies giving the firm an unfair advantage in the world market for large

incentives cost air bus 27 billion between 2004 and 2006 as the company either lost sales or had to sell its aircraft at lower prices us trade officials rejected the eu claims that research contracts between boeing and nasa or dod are subsidies as defined by the wto agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures asc m rather than subsidies the us side argued that the contracts under ques tion

purchased 750 million in services from boeing since 1992 not the 10 billion the eu is claiming25 the eu case is in an earlier stage procedurally than the us challenge to alleged airbus subsidies ds316 where an interim ruling may occur by the end of this year the us alleges that airbus received 205 billion in illegal subsidies in the form of launch aid from the governments of ge rmany united kingdom france and spain much of the dispute stems from air buss december 2000 launch of program to construct the worlds larg est commercial passenger airc raft the airbus a380 the a380 is being offered in several passenger versions seating between 500 and 800 passengers and as freighter at the end of 2007 airbus was listing 189 orders for the aircraft26 the project is believed to have cost about 18 billion which includes some significant cost overruns airbus expects that its member firms will provide 60 of this sum with the remaining 40 coming from subcontractors stateaid from european

of the aircraft in each of these instances the subcontractor is expected to receive some form of financial assistance from their respective governments other subcontractors are also taking large financial stakes in the new aircraft the project is also expected to benefit from state and local tax and other incentives most notable among these is 32 billion of such incentives from the state of washington many of these nontraditional funding arrangements are specifically cited by the eu in its wto complaint as being illegal subsidies whether the prospect of protracted wto litigation provides an incentive for the united states and the eu to resolve the dispute bilaterally remains to be seen to date the two sides have wrangled over hos t of procedural issues but have not been negotiating on possible settlement to the dispute in october 2007 airbus americas chairman allan mcartor publically spoke about the value of negotiated settlement that would set the rules for subsidizing the development of large civil aircraft along the lines of the 1992 civil ai rcraft agreement some analysts believe that any airbus negotiating effort along these lines may be driven by the needs of airbus parent eads to complete corpor ate restructuring and find launch aid and other capital to complete deve lopment of its new a350 which is designed to compete with the 787 in addition there may be vi ew that airbus has more to lose than boeing from wto rulings in the pending cases at the same time the impact of the air forces awarding to eads parent company of airbus the contract for the cargo refueling program coul d have some bearing28other analysts speculate that airbus weakened business condition brought on by the delivery delays of its jumbo a380 plane may also be reason why it may be more inclined now to settle the case on the other hand boeing officials continue to publically maintain that they are not interested in settling the case rather they express confidence in the

the products of biotechnology are inherently different than their conventional counterpart s and should be more closel regulated other exports eg corn gluten feed and soybeans also have been adversely affected by negative consumer attitudes in the eu about gmos on february 7 2006 the wto dispute panel in its report ruled that moratorium had existed that bans on eu approved genetically engineered crops in six eu member countries violated wto rule s and that the eu failed to ensure that its approval procedures were conducted without undue delay the dispute panels ruling however dismissed veral other us and cocom plainant claims including claims that eu approval pr ocedures were not based on appropriate ri sk assessment that the eu unfairly applied different risk assessment sta ndards for genetically engineered processing agents and that the eu had unjustifiably discriminated between wto members the panel made recommendations to the eu as to how to bring its practices in line with wto rules nor does the ruling appear to require the eu to change its regulatory framework for approving ge products the panel did not address such sensitive issues as whethe r ge products are safe or whether an eu moratorium on ge approvals continued to ex ist the eu did not appeal the panels decision but announced instead its intention to comply with the decisions of the panel by mutual agreement

widespread opposition to gmos by eu consumers and environmentalists it seems unlikely that us exports of such products would increase in the near term as result of the panel ruling and the useu effort

similar to european gis the eu regulation required that gis from other countries could be registered in the eu only if the country in question accorded protection equivalent to that available in the eu according to the united states this reciprocity provision in the eu eg maintenance of regist ry of names was in viola tion of the national treatment requirement in trips the united st ates complained also about permitting coexistence of names for example budweiser and czech names that in translation are the same as they might confuse consumers and call into question preexisting trademarks rights such as those budweiser has in several eu countries the panel sided with the united states on the issue of national treatment but with the eu on the issue of coexistence rights which th panel said should be limited to gis that already appear on the eu register but not to translations this decision admittedly narrow has particular importance for budweiser which felt threatened by

could flow freely and in which european and us airlines would be ab to provide air services without any restriction including in the dom estic markets of both parties achievement of the eu objective in full would require significant legislative changes in the united states in particular the removal of some existing legal restrictions on foreign owne rship and control of us airlines and cabotage which restricts foreign airlines from making flig hts directly between us cities because these issues remain very sensitive politica lly in the united states the eu accepted that cabotage would not be

states specifically the european commission took legal action against 24 eur opean union member states for failure to implement the necessary laws and regulations to break down national laws that

the financial services markets unification plans at risk according to the european commission in this situation there is risk that member states can face legal action by private parties who might

are judged under the rule of r eason ie method of antitrust analysis under which technical an titrust violation may be saved by balancing the anticompetitive results against any procompetitive effects and in recent years such restraints rarely have been successfully challenged predatory pricing the practice of firm with market power temporarily selling produc t at belowcost price with the intent of driving competitors out of the market or keeping potential entrants out of the market and raising its prices again when those objectives have been largely achieved and it is therefore able to recoup its losses rarely is challenged by the antitrust agencies claims that specific refusals to deal monopoly leveraging or refusals to provide access to esse ntial facilities tend to be met with some skepticism by the antitrust agencies and courts those unilateral practices are not generally prosecuted because either they are not deemed to harm competition or th allegation itself is unprovable consumers are presumed to benefit from the existence of largely competitive markets the impact on excluded competitors is relevant only insofar as it affects the fate of competition the antitrust injury requirement obligates complainants to demonstrate as threshold matter that the challenged conduct has had an actual adverse effect on competition as whole in the relevant market to prove it has been harmed as an individual competitor will not suffice55 it is axiomatic that the antitrust laws were passed for the protection of competition not competitors56 in scrutinizing the effects of firms

the consumer welfare and economic efficiency effects of those actions under this microec onomic model there should not be antitrust intervention unless the activity is likely to diminish aggregate consumer wealth exploitation of monopoly power is not violation of secti on 2 unless there is harm to consumers there is debate among economists how ever about what constitutes consumer welfare or consumer wealth or harm to consumers chicago school economists tend to construe these concepts broadly to include societys wealth as whole that is to include the wealth of both consum ers and producers thus an activity that decreases the welfare of enduser consumer s but increases the welfare of producers by greater amount would be viewed as increasing total consumer welfare in contrast more liberal economists tend to construe consumer welfare and consumer wealth and harm to consumers more narrowly and some argue that antitrust analysis should focus on consumer surplus which measures the effect on enduser consumers only the chicago school approach adopted by the us courts has been characterized by one observer as an outcomeoriented definition of competition and impairment59 with single relevant outcome measure the impact on consumer welfare as that term is broa dly defined it has an impor tant corollary section 2 has not been interpreted to provide protection to smaller rivals from aggressive competition by monopolists unless consumers are being harmed dominance in the eu in contrast article 82 as amended of the treaty of rome that established the european community reads any abuse by one or more undertakings of dominant position within the common market or in substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market in so far as it may affect trade between member states60 pursuant to article 82 ch abuse may consist of directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions limiting

and competitive disadvantage article 82 has been interpreted to be concerned with market effects on competitors as well as on consumers in evaluating dominant firm s actions the eu has tended to employ postchicago school economic models that focus on strategic game theory and are not as skeptical about the potential for co mpetitive injury as are the chicago school models relied on in the united states61 determination of whether there is harm to competition asks whether the practice interferes with and degrades the market mechanism62 one observer has voiced concern th at enforcement of the law under protection of the market paradigm can spill over into protection of competitors63 there is consensus however as to wh ether that has occurred in the eu though case law in the eu has been harsh on dominant firms that employ loyalty rebates bundled discounts on multiple products excl usive dealing tying arrangements refusals to deal and refusals to license while such activities are rarely found to be illegal and in some cases are in effect per legal in the united states64 impact of different laws and philosophies although both the united states and the eu look toward consumer welfare as the hopedfor end product of their enforcement actions65 their philosophies about the be st means to arrive at that goal do not always agree the us monopo lization statute is based on the belief that consumers benefit most when markets function competitively and so focuses on the effects of an entitys actions on competition and markets rather than on effects on competitors66 article 82

dominant firm even monopolis t to be legal or have agreed to settlement that imposed relatively limited restrictions on dominant firm or have approved merger while eu authorities have found those sa actions to be illegal or have imposed far more restrictive settlement terms on the dominant firm or have disapproved merger notable examples include complaints brought against microsoft and the proposed merger be tween general electric and honeywell in 2004 the eu imposed on microsoft bot h conduct remedies and substantial fine for the bundling of its operating syst em and media software the european commission began its investigation of microsoft after receiving complaint from sun microsystems multinational us company that competed with microsoft alleging that microsoft was refusing to

report 462 11232001earlier the eu had challenged and disapproved the proposed general electrichoneywell merger71 which had been approved by the us authorities while eu disapproval did not technically prevent the merger it was likely prominent factor in the decision of those companies not to consummate the merger as it would have prevented the merged entity from doing business within the eu some observers therefore have questioned whether the eu has been using its antitrust laws and policies to protect its businesses from us competition72 alternatively given that the complaints about dominant firm behavior or opposition to proposed mergers often have come fro m us companies that would compete with those dominant or merged firms other observers have accused the complaining firms of jurisdictionshopping when they fail to get the relief they seek from us antitrust agencies or us courts73 third set of observers argues that antitrust enforcement has been minimal in the united states and therefore the eu is playing an essential role in protecting consumers and actual and potential competition74 commentators have identified two factors that may explain why competition law has developed diffe rently in the united states and the eu first until recently many sectors in the european economy we re characterized by large government owned monopolies and as those entities ve moved toward privatization and competitive entry has been allowed there has been concern that those dominant incumbent firms could exploit their positions to limit the effectiveness of competition thus eu co mpetition policy has focused on protecting the market mechanism from practices that might not be viewed as illegal in the united states because they might not have an impact on consumers from this perspective it is historical coincidence that more stringent eu laws are being applied to dominant us firms in contrast although ther were governments anctioned monopolies in the united states notably in telecommunications and electricity markets the firms in those industries were not government tities and comprised much smaller portion of the overall economy than did thei r eu counterparts thus antitrust lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34381crs32 75 congress passed legislation to guide the transition from monopoly to competition in those markets imposing certain requirements on the in cumbent firms that were intended to foster competitive entry for example th telecommunications act of 1996 pl 104104 imposed certain requirements on the bell oper ating companies to provide new entrants access to their networks during the transition the us supreme court ruled in private antitrust challenge that violation of the acts requirements by an incumbent telecommunications firm did not also constitute an antitrust violation since those regulatory requirements exceeded those of the antitrust laws verizon communications inc v law offices of curtis v trinko 540 us 398 2004 for detailed

affairs defense and trade divisionpolicy and enforcement have been less concerned about protecting market mechanisms which are viewed as robust75 second the us antitrust agencies and th courts may have been concerned that markets have been distorted by the high cost of antitrust litigation with resulting losses in efficiency due to certain features that have not been adopted in europe eg private enforcement of the antitrust laws class action law suits extensive rights to discovery and lay juries they th erefore may have pr eferred policies that constrain litigation to this end the us agencies and courts have chosen to carve out safe harbors for certain activities where the dominant firm may in fact be exploiting its monopoly position but where it would be difficult to demonstrate consumer harm76 these are the same activities that often are successfully challenged in the eu eg loyalty rebates bundled discounts exclusive dealing tying arrangements refusals to deal or license prospects77 on balance useu commercial relations are healthy and mutually advantageous while the future course of the relationship is difficult to predict there are major forces both for cooperation and conf lict that will have an important bearing on the direction of the relationship the mo st salient of these considerations are presented below forces for cooperation the forces for cooperation are both ec onomic and political three important factors are integration of markets institutional arrangements and shared interest in maintaining and advancing the multilateral world trading system integration of markets the sheer size and importance of commercial ties is key force for cooperation growin g number of companies in both the united states and europe view the size dyna mism and relative openness of each othershttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34381crs33 markets as critical to their commercial succe ss from the us perspective the eu market is increasingly open standardized and growing from the eu perspective the us remains the largest open market in the world the six to seven million jobs on both sides of the atlantic dependent on tightly integr ated markets give rise to strong and politically active interest groups that lobby in favor of maintaining friendly bilateral tie s reducing regulations and in opposing protectionist proposals the high level of integration of ma rkets both in goods and capital is accompanied by heated competition for market share market forces and competition are driving economic convergence in numbe r of policy areas such as financial services and antitrust enforcement in the process some trade friction and the need for policy intervention may be avoided in the few cases where trad disputes have led to re taliation the high degree of market integration has served as firewall or buffer insuring that retaliation does not become excessive due to the high degr ee of crossinvestment s and intraindustry trade retaliation affecting the largest sectors of useu trade ie machinery electrical machinery optical equipment aircraft vehicles organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals is highly unlikely this is because many of the products in these sectors are used in the production proce ss by the other side thus it becomes impossible to hurt the other without disr upting ones own producer interests and thousands of jobs on both sides of the atlantic institutional arrangements various institutions and annual highlevel meetings are also working to keep the relationship on an even keel beginning in the 1990s the us and eu agreed to an ex panded range of dial ogue and cooperation under the 1995 new transatlantic agenda nta both side s tried to make progress on positive economic agenda achievable in the short run the nta has been followed by number of other specific bilateral initiatives designed to tackle remaining barriers many of which involve regulation ra ther than traditional tariffs or quotas the transatlantic economic council tec is the most recent institution established to reinvigorate efforts to resolve remaining disputes and to deepen the level of economic integra tion whether the tec will prove more successful entity for reducing remaining transatlantic regu latory and nontariff barriers to trade remains uncertain there appears to be little support howev er for any big new policy initiative such as transatlantic free trade area this may be due in large part to continuing differences over agricultural policy in th past such initiatives have been proposed by those who hoped that useu political re lations could be bolstered by grander economic foundation shared interest the two sides share an important interest in promoting an open stable and multila teral world trading system both partners have placed high priority on bringing the longrunning d oha round of multilatera l trade negotiations to successful conclusion while use u differences over agricultural policies continue to affect their ability to exert joint leadership resistance on the part of key developing countries such as india nd brazil to comprehensive doha round package of concessions has been formid able reason for the continuing stalematehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34381crs34 78 related multilateral code the agreement on technical barriers to trade tbt covers other types of regulations such as labeling and packaging given quite similar interests in bolstering the multilateral trading system many analysts say that both sides could cooperate more in ddressing the rising economic challenge posed by china specifically they could work together to persuade china to abide by its wto commitments as well as to pressure china to let the value of its currency be determined by market forces cooperation of this kind could not only support us and eu mu ltilateral trade interests but so promote stronger bilateral ties forces for conflict while the united states and eu cooperate in range of areas to the benefit of both sides differences and disputes of ten attract more press coverage the intractable nature of some disputes embedded in regulato ry barriers differences over the use of the wto dispute settlement system and rivalry could mean that conflict and tensions remain seemingly dur able feature of the relationship intractable problems number of useu trade disputes have focused increasingly on differences in regulation rather than traditional barriers such as tariffs or subsidies regulatory requirements established primarily with domestic consumer and environmental protection or public health concerns in mind are not designed to discriminate between domestic and imported goods and services but they may have the secondary effect of di storting or discriminating against the free flow of international trade which in tur n could lead to disputes for this reason transatlantic regulatory disputes over beef hormones and genetically modified foods can be more bitter and difficult to resolve than traditional trade disputes in so far as both sides feel their actions are justifie d by democratically derived decisions there have been specific challenges raised by the application of modern biotechnology to food production the ur uguay round sanitary and phytosanitary standards sps agreement was designed to deal with this issue it requires countries that impose regulations or trade bans to protect the health of plants animals and people to base such deci sions on risk assessments derived from scientific evidence78 but the sps requirement of sound scientific basis is open to varying interpretations ambiguities in the sps agreement are complicated because many european consumers believe that voidance of production practices associated with biotechnology is value in itself for th consumers scientific studies showing that such technologies do not result in thr eats to human or animal health may not be convincing given these strong views many european officials want leeway to impose trade restrictions on precautionary basis and others want to renegotiate the sps agreement both avenues could open up large loophole for discriminatory trade barriers even if

state interventi on or aid on us sales in third markets cases involving beef hormones and gmos fall in the first category and boeings complaint against airbus in the latter category eu complaints against the us on the other hand tend to involve more technical concerns about us trade or tax law that are inconsistent with wto obligations and that may confer indirect advantages for us firms these varied approaches which have cau sed considerable transatlantic tension particularly in the case of the eus challenge to us tax benefits for exporters have their roots in very different institutional arrangements on the us side private sector concerns are formally considered in the trade policy making process as result denial of market access opportunities is priority concern for us trade policymakers on the other hand some obs ervers maintain that the eu often uses trade for foreign policy purposes by challe nging the united states on wide range of mostly technical issues not only does th is approach allegedly help bolster the european commissions role visavis member states as the protector of eu interests but also promotes its image as leading defender of rulebased multilateralism and global governance79 rivalry straightforward explanation fo r many transatlantic trade disputes may be that the us and eu both aspire to lead in setting rules for global trade and investment including environmental and sa fety rules that impinge on trade the united states may think its rules should pr evail given the historically dominant role of the us economy the eu is itself sy stem of market liber alization and it could use trade to spread its own model of regulation and market integration to the rest of the world if successful european rules on regulations affecting health and safety competition policy government procurem ent and investment will shape future parameters of trade libera lization beyond indirectly challenging the united states for global trade leadership this process of spreading rules and regulations for trade may also be intended to facilitate commercia l success for european companies80 there is also concern that competition between the
