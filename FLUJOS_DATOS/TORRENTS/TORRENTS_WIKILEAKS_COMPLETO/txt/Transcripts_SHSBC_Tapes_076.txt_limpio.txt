shsbc 76 security checking auditing errors lecture given on 26 october 1961 thank you the subject of the lecture today is security checking and this is the 26th of october ad 11 it better be called ad 11 because something new and strange is happening there are some cases breaking up in fine way of course you probably dont think so do you think anything is happening to cases audience yes female voice yes oh you think something is happening to cases isnt that nice isnt that nice is anything happening to your case nothing is happening to your case is that right audience yes tell the truth do you think anything is happening to your case audience yes all right do you think anything is happening to your pcs case audience yes male voice yeah well is your goal to make something happen to cases female voice yes you sure all right okay i want to talk to you why things dont happen to cases there are certain definite fundamentals of processing which must be observed before result is obtained in auditing there are certain safe things you can audit you can audit concepts ideas you can security check and get overts by getting the times an individuals attention was pinned on another terminal on the track you can find the goal and terminal of the pc and run you can run engrams on the goalsterminal line after long run has established that they are on goalsterminal line and that is about all you can do thats just about all you can do successfully to case if you try to do anything else such as run generalized terminal to run mother out of the case while his terminal is tinker if you try to make him create things which are off his goalsterminal line if you try to do many other things having to do directly with terminals and running terminals which are not his goals terminal or if you ask questions too searchingly so that they are repetitive and are newly attracting his attention to terminal which his attention was not on before youre going to get slowdown his bank is going to become more solid and hes going to be upset ill give you an idea your idea of whats wrong with the pc is hes having trouble with his father well your idea stems from the fact that the pc has told you repeatedly that hes always having trouble with his father so you say if i could just get father out of the road then were all set here and we will therefore run father now what have you done to father what have you withheld from father what have you done to father what have you withheld from father what have you done to father what have you withheld from father you see it sounds almost right sounds just like youre going to get away with it and everything is fine and then the pc doesnt recover and things look lot different to the pc all bad you see that because youre saying father father father your attention on father put your attention on father put your attention newly on father put your attention brandnew attention lets search for more things which you have done to father the guy has already given you everything hes done to father you see so put your attention on father put your attention on father put your attention on father and of course that means take your attention off your goals terminal take your attention off your goals terminal thats the one thing he must not do at time must he take his attention off his goals terminal he knows this this is the one thing he knows better than he knows that theres air and sunshine he never found that out yet that theres air and sunshine but he does know that there is this terminal tinker of course he knows it so well that he doesnt know it at all its buried completely down in the further deep reaches of the coal mines yet it is nevertheless there and it is reactive so we can say bluntly what some of these oddities that we have run into occasionally weve piloted our way through them dont think that weve just been making mistakes left and right and front and center weve had things that prevented any casualty from occurring along in this line but lets take look at what you could do that would be wrong lets take list of wrongnesses that an auditor can pull 1 he could disobey the auditors code 2 he wouldnt know his business he 3 he audits pc with screaming present time problem 4 he audits pc when the pc knows he cant communicate with the auditor which is clause 16 of the auditors code after all goes out of twoway comm but thats particularly serious one and he could run the case with tremendous withholds on it and of course this is another violation of clause 16 its violation of the auditors code to run case with tremendous overts undisclosed on the case because the pc is not in twoway comm with the auditor so that would be dead wrong and the other deadwrong thing he could do would be to pick terminal at random and run it ad nauseam and thats thats dead wrong thats the first time youve heard that that was dead wrong this is the first time weve known that was dead wrong before we said only do terminals by assessment and only do this and only do that these are little preventives which kept very much bad from occurring but now i can tell you broadly that you just shouldnt fool with it you just shouldnt run any terminal but the goals terminal of the pc all right now if you cant run any terminal but the goals terminal of the pc where does this leave you on the subject of security checking because youve got to find out what he has done to his mother and what he hasnt done to his mother and what hes withheld from his mother and so forth is that running terminal it is not running terminal as long as its run against the emeter and youre only asking for it every time the meter falls because every time the meter falls the pcs attention is stuck on that other terminal and it is violation of his attention being off his goals terminal and every time your meter falls on security question you have located time and zone on the track where the individual has violated attention must be on the goals terminal this is the basic modus godelpus of the pc this is the stuff of which he is built his attention must be on the goals terminal so every time you get knock on the meter and you say have you done anything to anybody have you withheld anything from anybody you actually find knock on the meter you find reaction on the needle it immediately says his attention is stuck in violation of the goals terminal thats for just security checking that isnt the whats back of every fall you ever get on meter but thats the violation of the goals terminal so on an emeter where you get needle reaction you have violation of goals terminal now if you leave him in violation of the goals terminal you have an upset pc if you find one you got to clear it thats the rule which goes along with it this assumes tremendous importance because here there ive been picking up cases time after time after time where an individual has been left with an uncleared withhold and ive found in every case that hes squirrelly hes thinking unkind thoughts hes wondering about things hes wondering if scientology works or doesnt work hes having an awful time actually he dreams up all sorts of gossip trying to lessen the overts of one kind or another and he just gets into terrible spin and this is an empirical datum this is datum which ive been watching now through auditors reports coming in from central organizations from this particular class and they are just mounting up to be legion they are innumerable this is datum which is being forced upon by constant constant constant observation of that datum and it is not datum which you can ignore any more than i have been able to ignore the datum so i say well all right huh susie ann is in an hpa class and she doesnt know what shes doing and so she misses couple of security checks hahahahahaha so what oh im afraid that an auditor has to learn how to swim perfectly the first time hes thrown in the bay on security check isnt that interesting because frankly you could get blows out of the academy every time student sits down and he picks up the emeter and he says lets see these are the thats the tone arm thats thats thats ahha and so on and he hands it to somebody diffidently and he says now lets see the instructor finally comes around disgustedly and says this is the on button and throw it on whats this moving needle when you turn it on the needle moves move the tone arm needle moves haha hahahahaha hahaha move the tone arm and the needle moves i see what theyre doing when the auditor gets something on the pc he moves the tone arm and that moves the needle now i understand an emeter and he understands it all for two days and then pc actually has stray unkind thought about what hes doing you see one of his fellow students and the needle moves when he isnt touchhing the tone arm broken and during that period of time unfortunately although he has to be practicing in something vaguely resembling meter actions and so forth he is asking people questions and these questions any of them we could then become security check questions and he doesnt know enough at this period of time that hes got to clear it off the needle moved whats he supposed to do well he writes it down on the piece of paper he has needle moved the instructor comes around and says wheres pete and this fellow thats just written it down i dont know he went out and you have the hco squadron of cavalry riding all over the neighborhood trying to round up pete by this time he has socked policeman he has done this hes done that and slept with his best friends wife well somehow or another they get it patched up but that is the immediate consequence of what would happen if he missed security check question we cant ignore the fact that is what happens its just in from every place some of the most confoundedly weird things have occurred you have ever heard of girl in an hgc they missed security check on her she rushes straight out she sees every friend shes got she says all auditors are doing in that organization is sleeping with their pcs and theres all this going on and theres that going on and its all terrible and its awful over there and horrible things are occurring in that organization and then this girl went and wrote whole bunch of letters on the subject and all this in relatively few hours she was the busiest person you ever saw and you know it took the organization about week to round this up they got ahold of the girl and they put her down and had enough sense to realize that the last thing she was doing was unflat that was probably all that was really known about it so they made her do the last thing she was doing and it was hot question on security check and it was something to do with the second dynamic and the auditor had simply gone on you know and not asked any questions about it and then sort of ended the session and it was never going to come up again and boom immediate repercussion so hell hath fury like pc whose withhold isnt pulled it works completely reverse i dont know whether the pc instinctively realizes hes been done wrong or if he has had something reactivated so that he must compensate for it or if he is making trying to make nothing out of the overt by making nothing out of the people who might have gotten the overt so that nobody will believe them when the overt does come up you see but an unpulled overt has horsepower in it it has real horsepower and it drives people to the most confounded excesses you ever heard of i think the excesses of the criminal are simply on the basis of just tremendous numbers of overts against the society and the overts and the withholds the overts which are withhold then become the horsepower which make the criminal not quite that the man goes wrong you see and then who hides it from the society the way we ordinarily look at it i think its quite different i think because the individual is withholding something then you get horsepower i think this is source of explosive reactor fuel of some kind or another so restimulated withhold becomes lighted charge of dynamite and when you ask the pc if he has withhold and then you dont get it you have just the same as stuffed stick of dynamite down his throat and litten the fuse youve lit the fuse and then you say well you dont have anything you see thats it after while in the distance theres dull booommmmm you see and you say whats that it has nothing to do with hahahahaha it has nothing to do with i mean i audited him i tried to help him tried my best but he came to us too late you see you could get off into all sloppy things you realize this psychoanalist always and totally excuses every failed case on that one phrase he came to us too late which i think is quite amusing he believes this too you know he believes it implicitly fellow has been with him five years and he came to too late always ive talked to these birds and they tell with perfectly straight face well three of his patients have committed suicide in the last month and he tells you this quite frankly oh yes they committed suicide in the last month yeah lot of them well theres bessie she came to too late and there was george if hed come sooner i could have done something and then theres mehitabel well long long overdue she should have come to much earlier you say well what were you doing with these patients for that time well they just lay there on the couch and talked well did you ask them any questions well of course i asked them what had been done to them in their childhood restimulate every overt in the bank dont you see boy i tell you you talk about people who have taken peoples lives in their hands look into that field but itd be any field where you didnt pursue the question now the poor old catholic church that i have raised so much the devil with occasionally from time to time the poor old catholic church for the lack of this datum which were talking about right this minute has developed all of its heretics its martin luthers and the lot the boys theyve had all the trouble with they manufactured at the confession box person comes up hes just groveling in the dust you see and hes just got through having intercourse with his sister or something and he scratches on the confession box you see and he says i have something to confess and the priest is sleepy that day you know he says yeah what my and he says well ive done something very and his courage fails him as you see in pcs all the time the guys courage fails him you see and he says well i i heard some nasty gossip about the mayor and the priest says well what was it my well i heard the mayor was sleeping with the aldermans wife and that the alderman and that the alderman has committed incest with his sister and the priest says well thats eightynine and half paternosters and two umpteegahs so tool off now and the fellow says whew and little time goes on and the inquisition all of sudden is called upon to find out what all this is going on over there and whats all this commotion against the true church and all this commotion against the true church is getting more and more commotional well they managed to burn most of them after theyd missed their withholds then they had to burn them but they managed to burn most of them but they missed just enough to cause an overthrow of the catholic church because its longer the dominant church on earth well i forget we in the white race consider ourselves extremely egocentrically as being the races of earth but as matter of fact there are so many other churches elsewhere that are bigger than any church we have anywhere that that was it but one time the catholic church could have numbered up along with some of the great eastern churches and so on and it doesnt anymore but thats it theres your martin luther theres your calvin im sure that it happened right there at the confession box priest didnt have an emeter i think its very poetic justice because he buried most of the knowledge the church buried great deal of knowledge that came out of ancient greece and egypt and so forth they put lot of this knowledge away because they didnt think it was good for people they kept it in the catacombs actually they released aristotle just in the middle ages they suddenly broke out aristotle complete and released it to the scholarly world nobody had ever heard of aristotle and plato before that they broke out plato so as to prove that catholicism was the true religion all of these various things occurred and they sort of shut off knowledge one way or the other and they didnt have an emeter thats thats what it amounts to well what problem are you faced with then youre faced with an immediate heretic he doesnt like you he doesnt like your organization hes going to dream up all sorts of wild tales and lies about you and your organization or about others or something because of the missed withhold and what are you supposed to do then well let caution you against following the policy of our immediate forebears on this particular planet firewood is very costly if only on economic grounds why you shouldnt have to go burn every person you see who has been missed on security check now thats what it would amount to sooner or later youre walking up the line you see youre walking into heavy heavier power position on this particular planet and thats what it would amount to you already have means and ways of cutting down the overts against the group to keep the group from being sundered and keep individuals of the group from being cut to pieces you have that inherently in security check now supposing the security check becomes badly done and overts get missed left and right well the very mechanism which is supposed to prevent dissension and upset and sloweddown cases and all of this sort of thing that very mechanism is the mechanism which restimulates an heresy of some kind or another which eventually brings about an overthrow of the group so its very light thing im talking about now and this has been presented to so many times on so many folders by so many people and it has happened so often that we must conclude that it not that it is an invariable reaction reason to conclude that it is invariable that because somebody has had withhold and it hasnt been pulled that this person immediately tries to destroy everything under the sun moon and stars were not justified in concluding that because its happened many times without repercussion and some auditor got it later or didnt get it at all and the case merely stalled and some director of processing or some auditor someplace noticed the case wasnt moving sooner or later and decided to get ambitious and went back and found the withhold and the only thing that happened there is the case stalled which is an overt enough but nothing happened to the group and nothing happened to individuals but you can count on the fact that it will happen sufficiently often that repercussion will follow the act that in the cumulative centuries it could utterly destroy anything were trying to build up it is not at all tiny mechanism it is big important one you could disobey most of the auditors code and you wouldnt get into terribly serious trouble except pc would be upset and case gains and arc breaks and youd feel unhappy and few things like that but clause 16 stay in twoway communication with your pc is violated the moment that you find that is you tick that you come close to hot withhold and dont get it youre asking security check question you say well have you ever raped anybody and the individual says well people who rape people actually i heard about terrible rape and there was an awful situation occurred over in northumbria and so forth there was number of rapes over in northumbria and i think this is pretty terrible and thats what the needle is falling on and the auditor says well i guess it is pretty terrible and goes on to the next question as i say it isnt invariable that he burns the house down its amusing that the psychoanalyst in freudians in dealing with kleptomania make statements of this character theyre the most generalized sweeping statements you ever wanted to hear in your life its something on the order of every time kleptomaniac fails to steal anything they burn the house down i dont think there are that many houses that statement is part of text its direct quote the bad english in it is not mine every time kleptomaniac fails to steal anything they burn the house down well it isnt of this order of generality its every now and then when you fail to get withhold you set off an atomic bomb and its often enough as group repercussion and its often enough and far too frequent as an individual repercussion because you get stall the individual goes through this cycle the overt having failed to be pulled by the auditor restimulates the necessity for the pc to minimize the overt that he has done by running down the target against which the overt was committed so the pc far from having an overt pulled or having withhold pulled has been tricked into committing new overt on top of the withhold against the people who tried to get it you see the mechanism all right the rosicrucians were trying to get the withhold and they failed to get the withhold the individual would then go natter natter and his withhold then is against the rosicrucians so he immediately tries to blow up the rosicrucians you got the idea they have such mechanism as this but im just giving you an example if his overt is against the etu and hes withholding it like crazy and its the etu that ticks the overt see that tick the withhold but not get it in any way he is liable if its centerline withhold of some sort or another fly into fantastic potpourri of yipyap against the etu dont you see the overts are always against the people who fail to pull the withhold knowing that i think it might put little spurs to your ambition never to miss one because the succeeding overts are always against you you fail to knock out the withhold and you or your group will get the benefit questionable benefit of the succeeding overts and this is one of the primary principles of mental reaction they try to lessen the overt to make nothing of the people who might find out theyve had the overt restimulated so now they have to make nothing of the people to everyone so that nobody will ever believe the people if the overtwithhold is suspected they might have an idea that you see as long as the thing is unpulled it has dynamite the second it is pulled theres dynamite connected with it its just they just throw flounder out on the table you see its very mysterious action this whole thing of pulling withhold you reach down into the pc for this smoldering volcano you know with lava running all along and the villages burning on all the mountainsides everything going to pieces you see and the steam flying out of the sea and youve reached down his throat to pull out this unsavory bombastic object and you drop on the table dead haddock just in the process of it passing from his throat to the middle of the table it goes flop there isnt even cinder have you noticed this cleanly pulled withhold transmutes from the most bombastic explosive manufactured to about the limpest fish ever caught in the process of being pulled it is just nothing the pc sits there and he looks at it and he says what on earth is that and hes mystified theres always little unknow follows this thing which doesnt do him any damage at all i wonder why i was so upset about that he always has this kind of little action you yourself who have had withhold of magnitude pulled on you have probably experienced the same thing you know you just grind and you worry and you search and so forth and youre its well mm ulp oh ill try i dont know well lets see if i can get away with not telling them well actually the truth of the matter is i really have never had anything well im gonna tell him ahemahemmm all right well ill come out with it all right all right i pick my teeth i pick my teeth i pick my teeth what is the matter here theres nothing very important about picking your teeth now why was i so upset about telling the auditor and when youve had big one that youve been sitting on for long time you you can see the partnership in that particular series of reactions it is absolutely feels ghastly just before you hand it out have you had something like this occur some all right now supposing it went this way well tsk on the subject well you ak you got reaction on it you you sure yyour meter is working are you sure your meter is working oh youre not sure your meter is working oh well oh well thats its okay well i feel much better now lets go on to the next question all right thats good and the auditor goes on to the next question and you get outside the door you know and you say should have told him i couldnt have told him uhrrrrrr you get home at night you know wheels start going around and you say god hes lousy auditor well thats terrible horrible things i remember something ron did once lets see hm hm and i heard of an auditor one time who who charged too much for auditing and so forth and see see see see see immediate reaction of that kind of thing on withhold of magnitude thats missed and guy sits around actually hes disappointed hes left sitting on the middle of something its too much for him he can practically feel the steam coming out of his ears and nobody did anything for him about it he basically is disappointed also he knows that it is so forceful and so powerful that if he had told about it there might have been great repercussions on the subject and therefore its much better that he didnt say anything about it and he has really won because you see if it got around that hed picked his teeth oh well i dont know lots of things might have happened the dental association might have gotten onto him and all kinds of things might have occurred they might be so its good thing its good thing lousy auditor and he shouldnt know better and actually truth of the matter is but thats all because the withhold is simply restimulated dont you see and the person is fighting back and forth and hes left sitting on charge of steam dynamite volcanic lava and so on all of which amounts to when he finally gets out and looks at it in the final run why he picks his teeth he picks his teeth he picks his teeth well what was so important about picking your teeth and when youve had seen that mechanism occur youll realize that if you interrupt it before it is displayed youve left the pc with full head of steam and of course the pc is liable to do almost anything do you see this you know you might as well face up to the fact that there are liabilities to auditing there werent liabilities to unsuccessful auditing there werent liabilities to very mild auditing there werent liabilities to simply running out few engrams if you could get your hands on them and so forth there werent any great liabilities to it nor were there any great liabilities to running concepts real mess on that so we got away with that fine now we move over into the heavy artillery and we bring up parks of 155s and german 88s and we string it out along the line and then we put bunch of rocket launchers in the lineup and then we say well thats fine lets take some b47s and line them up over here and put atom bombs in their stomachs and now lets lets go ahead and along about this time youre possessed of sufficient tools that what the stuff you are handling which is the root stuff of human aberration and so on has to be handled as it should be handled thats all now youll go in this basis from one extreme perhaps to the other i dont remember if this was the exact sequence but it makes better telling this way bunch of recruits who were just out of boot school were assigned to ship and they were afraid of ammunition and the main battery was sitting there and they of course were the loaders and they were handling the ammunition and slamming it into the breech they were supposed to you see and theyd pick up long shell you know shell about that long you know with an explosive fuse nose that if you ever dropped it you know itd go rnrnboom and that would be obliteration with magnitude and theyd pick up this thing you know and theyd theyd pick it up with their you know and hand it to the next one you know you can see in in rapidfire action that shells being passed with that slowness and that care into the breeches of guns you see are not going to obliterate anything its quite the contrary theyre liable to be dropped on the deck and blow everybody in the gun crew to smithereens well i adjudicated that they had been talked to too long about the great care that they must use the great care they must use in the handling of ammunition i assume that they probably had been talked to by fellows from the ordnance department that explained to them these were the nose fuses of the goodygumps and if you ever dropped one why it went blang and so forth and you must always be careful to keep the ammunition in its proper cases and in its proper slots and you must always keep it marked and flashmarked because its all very dangerous its all very dangerous its all very dangerous by the time they got to the ship of course they were afraid to touch piece of ammunition they had familiarity with the ammunition they just had the sensibility that the ammunition was dangerous well i saw this at drill you know that sort of thing theyre trying to whip this gun crew together and so on and at drill it was just this matter of huhnhuhnnhuhoooooooahhhh you got you got it joe you got it joe hahaha oh thank god youve got it joe all right now open the breech very carefully dont hit its nose against anything you know oh god it was terrible so i asked them if they had any dummy shells i asked the gunners mate if he had any dummy shells and he said yeah i got some dummy shells and so i had all the gun crews of this particular type of gun in the main battery around and line up in ring on the foredeck and i took one of these dummy shells and i handed it to them and told them to play catch with it it was the same size and weight as everything it was just what was used in order to demonstrate or drillload something and of course they were very happy with that and theyd catch back and forth and kicked it around and they got so they were theyd throw it so it was spinning to one another and toss it back and forth across about five ten feet of deck you see to one another they were happy with this dummy shell of course not live fuses in it powder nothing and they kept doing this and doing this and i had them do it for two or three days if i remember rightly or maybe day or two and i saw they were at it one morning and they were having fine time playing catch so i went down opened up the magazine had the gunners mate hand real brass case fuseloaded nosefuseset piece of artillery and i said here you go and the first guy in the line they were looking at sort of like snakes you know like birds whod just sighted snake or something you know and i took the first shell and i said here you go and i just threw it to him across the open deck you know the guy caught it god theepteepteept three days they were throwing that live shell with set nosefuse fifteen feet across the deck to one another playing catch with the thing some ordnance officers came down from ordnance and saw this ship lying there alongside of the pier and its gun crew was playing catch with live shell and he went straight up and mile south he had authority over us he pointed out to us though if anybody had dropped it it probably would have been the end of the uss washington which was lying alongside of us and i said i didnt like battleships anyway but he totally was overlooking some of the principles with which we are now totally familiar that person has to become familiarized with dangerous object before he can use it easily and well and not have accidents with it the way you can have accidents with dangerous object is to know it is dangerous and not know there is any way to handle it and if you know dangerous object is dangerous you can always have accidents with it now the actions of an auditor are given publicity on this particular basis because people are generally very nervous about auditing and very nervous about looking into peoples human minds and because everybody knows you mustnt have anything to do with human mind oh everybody knows that some of your friends you say im studying scientology and they say oh well what does that have to do with you say well that just has to do with the human mind and they say oh well you shouldnt i dont know if you ought to tamper with that or not its pretty dangerous situation you mustnt have anything to do with it well why dont you point out to them at that time well you mustnt have anything to do with it dont you think they have an awful lot of casualties with this thing they mustnt have anything to do with you know dont you think its kind of dangerous not to have anything to do with it havent you got one have you got one well dont you have anything to do with your own mind whooouh that would be staggering thing but the guy is liable to go into funk when he realizes that every time he figures out an arithmetical problem he is tampering with the human mind and were liable to err along this line were liable to say were liable to say to people oh well auditing is very easy you cant make any mistakes theres way to make mistake there is nothing you can do wrong and you just sit there and you go through certain theres nothing to it you actually cant do any damage and there is tendency on our parts and on the part of instructors and so forth in order to give students confidence to say that you cant really do anything very damaging or very wrong theres tendency on our parts to do that and that is in the effort of restimulating their courage because well students in an academy and that sort of thing are awfully nervy characters they sit there and they pick up the emeter and wonder if theyre handling thirtymegatron hydrogen bomb youd think to look at them they cant even look at the thing the needle wobbles and they dont even know what its all about they think its dangerous weapon so we say well its not dangerous and theres nothing you can do to hurt anybody and so on and so on well weve actually leaned too far in the other direction all this attitude was possibly perfectly justified in 1956 when we were running tremendous number of concepts and sort of havingness processes and scs and things like that all of which are perfectly valid add to your list of processes early in the lecture objective physicaluniverse processes as safe series but all of these things are valid and they you dont get into danger with them and they dont blow anybodys head off but look for years and years and years now ronnie has been at work and ive been trying to get the hydraulic jacks underneath of the basic core of human aberration to level that any case without paying much attention to the auditor that any case could be resolved fairly easily within some finite period of time well theyre resolving clears now and some of the places are making clears and so on were resolving clears maybe in something on the order of two three hundred hours some top figure its finite period of time last clear made in australia was 118 hours this is finite time you see yes but what have we paid with with what coin have we paid for the speedup hahahaha we have paid for it with stripping the safety precautions off because now we have to run things that run wrong wouldnt spin somebody in but itd certainly make pc unhappy as hell itd certainly mess things up it wont do any permanent or lasting damage but itll certainly make somebody awful sad and itll certainly make them very uncomfortable and done wrong we have moved into strata of processing done wrong that will make somebody awful miserable because youve got hydraulic jacks and all you have to do you see is you just take another little notch on one of these jacks and it puts thirty tons of pressure against this particular engram and the pc says well it isnt resolving and all youve got to do is lean over and put another notch on the thing and put another thirty tons of pressure another inch you see and the pc still says well it isnt resolving and youre dealing with technology that it is very easy just to pick your finger up and just put that jack over another inch its the wrong object you got the jack leaning against wrong target and your pc of course gets very uncomfortable and blows session gets very upset with you and gets extremely disturbed and he acts like nut and part of his shame is the fact that he doesnt know how come he is acting like nut this is mystery to him dont you see youve sat there being nice and sweet and kind and theres youre not doing anything wrong obviously youre sitting there to help him and all of sudden he feels like hell well what is this you didnt do it so he feels guilty every time he gets upset and you have much harder time with it and hes upset of course because something has gone awry in his bank dont you see that gross error has to be entered in dont think that its minor error the auditor would be making you know like running command one time too many itd have to be the wrong terminal and the wrong command run on top of present time problem and an arc break but the auditor because of the processes he is handling and so forth actually can in spite of all this hold pc insession and throw that hydraulic jack an additional notch and of course thats the one notch it shouldnt have been thrown because the whole thing is awry anyhow you see what i mean i mean youre dealing with high horsepower high highly skilled technology and if the technology is wrong or if you do some of the most obvious wrongnesses that can be done youre going to get repercussion and the repercussion is considerable i dont wish to minimize it so im just leveling with you do you see so on the one side we could say oh auditing is easy and anybody could audit and theres nothing you could do to hurt anybodys human mind and so forth well its true theres nothing we can do to permanently injure or damage somebodys mind but oh brother could you give somebody very nasty cold for instance could you give him an awful bad bellyache could you do lot of other things dont you see that would be damnably uncomfortable theyd all fade out in three days or ten days or couple of weeks or something like that but it wouldnt be good now theres sense in saying well you cant do anything you cant hurt anybody and nothing will ever upset the pc and so forth thats an extreme and its dangerous extreme because its not strictly speaking true and on the other hand on the other hand over here we say oh well auditing the mind is very dangerous and there is way possibly that you could really tamper with somebodys mind it ought to be done by an expert call an electrician or something like this the way the psychiatrists are doing these days and you get over to this and you can say well its very dangerous and you shouldnt have anything to do with it at all you see between these two extremes there is the sensible level of yes there are tremendous numbers of things you can do with the human mind if you dont make gross errors now the errors that you can make that will be damaging errors to the human mind are all of them under the heading of gross errors they are glaringly large they are huge they loom up out of the rundown like marble arch up in hyde park i mean theyre big you run into that with car and youd know it was there and if youve got the idea that an auditing error is the size of twig that just fell off tree on rotten row tsk change your mind you see you go over that with car wheel it just goes flick or something like that you hardly know its there and so on auditing errors are not of that order of magnitude the auditing error to produce bad result on the pc has to be absolutely huge and you in running auditors or directing an hgc or doing something in this particular zone or area do good job only when you get your eye off the twigs and start looking at the marble arches that have gotten across the road you know that thats quite interesting its quite an interesting fact that people directing auditing and supervising auditing when they get auditing reports and see that the case is not running well or something like that always look at twigs yeah the little tiny things and they say well are you very sure that youre giving him an acknowledgment every time you know are you very sure youre acknowledging well how is your tr 0 as youre auditing him you know little little things of course the auditors tr 0 has to be good but an auditors tr 0 can be totally out and the case will still make gains its fact and the acknowledgments can be nonextant you can say if youre running goals terminal or something like that youre running some level well how have you helped mugwump how have you helped mugwump and how has mugwump helped you how have you helped mugwump how has mugwump helped you the preclear probably wouldnt notice from one second to the next whether you acknowledged him or not do you realize that hes just so interested in the thing he follows the auditing command and so on he doesnt notice it on the other hand he gets so interiorized into highpower techniques that you acknowledge him perfectly your tr 0 is perfectly and everything is perfect and he never notices that either you get the idea so these are tiny these are tiny youve got to know your trs to be good auditor and the combined effect of all trs out can be rather interesting but lets not when we say something is happening with this case that is wrong go into these tiny things and do you know that you will most often avoid the gross errors you know and its the gross error now whats gross error well was the auditor there for the session now that would be gross auditing error dont you see and you know in directing auditors you almost never ask these burning questions did you have your emeter turned on does it work have you gone into any screaming fits at the pc these are all gross auditing errors you see now when you clear the rudiments do you clear the rudiments gross error is do you ever look at the needle while youre clearing rudiments thats gross auditing error of course how the devil can you audit and find out anything about the pc if youre not looking at the meter and you would be amazed how often this is the auditing error which causes the miss the auditor under training is doing everything but looking at the meter he asks the question and then looks at the meter the meters reaction takes place in tenth of second and he takes half second to look from the question to the meter so he misses all reactions and do you know weve had that going on right here that comes under the beading of gross auditing error its just not doing auditing all right now you read along and this auditing report is just fine and everything seems to be okay about the thing and you just cant understand why this pc isnt making any advances and you say well now are your rudiments all in oh yes rudiments are all in yeah well is youre running the goals terminal on the run youre not overrunning the assessment still getting tone arm action oh yes getting tone arm action you check it all out everything is perfectly beautiful and youre running in some podunk someplace where youve got auditors there you know that havent been very well trained or something like that on the line whole case becomes total mystery and you say well gee we must have some wrong combination or the technology is wrong and we start adjusting the little things and we say that the auditors tr 0 has got to be improved and there must be different command used here and there must be this and there must be that and we fix it all up and we get whole bunch of extraordinary solutions truth of the matter is if we went back and checked it up from beginning to end or if we had motion picture of the session wed find out that the session went along just fine except right in the middle because after the break every day and after they go back into session every day the auditor gives the pc total spinal adjustment now you think im kidding but this kind of thing this kind of thing is the usual the usual gross auditing error it belongs in that category dont you see all right gross auditing error you could actually audit pc on the technology you have today with somewhat of present time problem you could get him through one session and he has bit of present time problem and just kind of bully it through and somehow or another arrive at the other end and hed get little bit of gain itd be almost impossible to miss but you couldnt do it with all rudiments out or not running any rudiments at all you say to the auditor its this pumpkin center that youre running and you say to him well now are you sure you got your rudiments in oh yes sir i got my rudiments in theyre all in and so on and then brilliant stroke of genius comes to you and you say well when youre putting the rudiments in do you put the pc on the emeter he says oh never well how do you know if the rudiments are in well the pc tells so well how does the pc tell you so well i ask him are all your rudiments in now this sounds utterly fabulously idiotic to you but do you know that auditing errors of this magnitude exist and when youre supervising large number of auditors and so on you will always have some people who are just out of the academy who are pretty green that sort of thing and you can just beat your brains to pieces trying to figure out why the technology isnt working the technology always works but is it being applied and the gross auditing error comes in the application of the technology and thats the zone you should look in in order to correct case now we can add to these gross auditing errors leaving withhold in restimulation because then i assure you the case is not going to make any progress we right now have course running someplace in the world and in weeks of run they have only found in number of students goal or two and those they have found goal or two on early they found terminals for youll find this quite common in various places by the way whole group can go sailing along and getting terminals and goals and nothing and so forth we were doing it right here till i finally just got right down and figured out what the devil this was all about and i found out the rudiments were just wildly out and the auditors were actually in games condition on the subject of goals you know i mean just frankly that they were in games condition they were so arc broke on their own goals they were damned if they were going to let anybody else have any goals i think that was about the way it added up something of that sort so by straightening the rudiments out and raising the magnitude of importance of keeping rudiments in why what are we running into now well i was just asking question theres student been here for about two weeks and little bit two weeks and two days and we dont have his goal and terminal im starting to ask questions what is happening because this is not usual now you see weve learned to keep our rudiments in before we do goals and terminal assessments and having learned that why we find our goals and terminals and thats about all there is to it that was the gross error it was just not having any rudiments in it wasnt that we needed new trick methods of finding goals and terminals we just had to have somebody sit there and actually ask for the goals and ask for the terminals and not invalidate any of them and not add bunch of things to the nonsense that was going on keep the rudiments in we found goals and terminals just bangitybang its very easy to do and some of you right here were have experienced that particular gruesome experience and that was gruesome wasnt it you see the light and dark of the situation was too fantastic for words the first course i taught immediately ahead of this course i found all the goals and terms i think they were all found the first few days werent they female voice yes it wasnt very long we did presession 38 first and then we did presession 38 and shook down lot of 37 and 38 wasnt it female voice thirtyseven and 38 too yeah and wed had them we had their ptps and their withholds all off and bang assessment there was just nothing to it just fell in your lap nothing to it well now this unit at great distance from here happens to be running into the same difficulties right this minute and i have sent over cables about get your rudiments in see get your rudiments in get your rudiments in and i dont know whether this will be heard or not because this has to amount to looking at the emeter and ive just had datum from that particular unit that some of the students on that particular course can be forced to stand and look at an emeter which is reacting and be asked what the reaction was and they cant tell you that the needle moved well we look for gross error so i tell them get the rudiments in get the rudiments in get the rudiments in i probably ought to be saying show them an emeter and find out for them where the tone arm is show them which is the knob or black object that wiggles well find out its some gross auditing error you see of that magnitude it always defies your imagination when you run into these gross errors and running great many people great many auditing teams or great many staff auditors or something like that all its great many students it all boils down to the same thing youre just sure that you have dog case that has avoided technology and then you try to do everything under the sun moon and stars you can with technology in order to straighten out this case and you find out the case hasnt advanced for some time because well you see actually were supposed to look at tapes at four oclock and the auditing session is also at four oclock so we of course have been skipping the auditing session the case wasnt being audited i mean this sounds idiotic but that is how idiotic and that is how gross most of these errors are oh yes i always get the rudiments in on the pc yes i always get the rudiments in on the pc thats very good i make sure that the needle is moving when he says he has withholds when he has withholds if the needle moves then i know i can pass on to the next rudiment i know theyre all so stupid and all so incredible that they get missed and you are very often persuaded into being very inventive about technology this is even i have been on the basis of persuading some of being persuaded that you just youve got to think of some new solution thats all because this case just isnt moving you know and then we find out that well he doesnt get audited either tapes are at four oclock and the case is supposed to be audited at four oclock so he just doesnt audit the case but hasnt really had nerve to tell you or something wild like this you know and it comes down to something fundamental the common denominator of all of this is auditing done itll be some degree of that and i wanted to give you the common denominator of it its some degree of auditing done whether they just the auditor never reports to the auditing session at all or after he gets to the auditing session omits some large section of auditing oh doesnt run the goals terminal of the pc decides actually that hes got to get mother out of the way first and he just goes on for ages auditing mother mother mother and we audit more mother and supposed to be auditing tinker and youll get errors of this character and i hate to say it because staff auditors are actually terrific i have lots of confidence in staff auditors ive never had staff auditors balk at doing anything ive never had them do anything but when they followed through results just try their level best to deliver terrific willingness main failure has been is telling them comprehensibly enough what i wanted done so that it could be understood i consider that any main failure because the willingness theres never been any want of that so therefore we come down to simplicity and they can do this and everybody goes off at smart trot and everything is working along fine this way but ive seen some of the wildest miscomprehensions of relayed communication such as this you run the level this actually happened you run the level until the tone arm gets moving and then reassess for the next level and that was the way the auditing direction was interpreted you know you run level long enough to get the tone arm moving well and then you assess for the next level of the prehav scale and you run it man i can tell you that if you did that for about four or five levels the whole case would come down to slow jam and the pc would feel like he was going crazy itd take him about ten twelve days to get over the idea too hed just feel like he was going crazy if you want to audit pc into feeling that theyre nuts dont do terminals run on his goals terminal but just take some kind of general routine 2 run and assess the pc very carefully assess him and find out real live level that good level find his level real good and then audit it and audit it until you get the tone arm moving good see and then just skip it and then do another assessment and ignore the fact that that one is still going and pick up some other level of the prehav scale and then run it dont get rudiments in and run it run it and run it hard and run it hard and run it hard and run it hard and all of sudden the needle will freeze up and the tone arm will freeze up or something well insist that that isnt so good you see that isnt so good that it did that run it little bit longer and dont get in any rudiments need of end rudiments either now on the next line assess again get some other level of the prehav scale and just run that one till you finally get the needle broken loose just get it broken loose and then reassess again and your pc about this time will go hmmrh whats happening everything is going green i have this horrible sensation that this ear keeps tying bowline with this ear i knew i shouldnt have drunk the coffee hell actually have sensation of going mad he wont go mad few days later itll drift out and he will merely spit every time he sees you but that actually that actually is the direct results of not flattening levels of the prehav scale but thats pretty gross auditing error every time you get the needle moving every time you get the tone arm moving well reassess and get another level and when you get the tone arm moving well reassess and get another level never flatten anything and on the prehav scale of course person feels like hes going mad if you do that because youre using one of the most powerful set of boosters you can you talk about thirtyton hydraulic jacks the commands cant help but move his mind around you know he could sit there and resist even doing the command and suddenly he realizes well he does it you see and rrrr rrrrrr its running ship on rocky ocean believe do you see what could happen because the technology is quite adequate to really pushing the thing down the line you see he will do it willynilly and he goes far in much further in than you would ever dream that anybody could be pushed itll all drift off in three to ten days and he will feel fine whether he gets any auditing or not but thats not the point youve wrecked pc and you may have wrecked goalsterminal line and believe it or not this actually occurred in central organization this actually occurred yeah the interpretation of my request was wasnt any backwards reason is as soon as you get some motion in the tone arm you reassess and do new level all right gross auditing errors is what you are dealing with here that is far wide departure now technically there arent too many of these things one would be right now to run any terminal but the goalshave terminal we would consider that very gross auditing error because it would really make mess out of things leading that in term of violence or even worse than that is leaving withhold question unflat that would be gross auditing error we have to move it up to there because it produces gross mess when it is done doing wrong assessment or using an assessment that was done carelessly indifferently or incorrectly and not getting it checked that would be gross auditing error getting or using an assessment that was briefly and carelessly done or even lengthily and carelessly done but use an assessment that you just arent sure of its gross auditing error failing to continue to security check pc as his case advances because again this is quite case damaging and is gross auditing error you havent heard that one for some time have you but nevertheless its very much present right now do you realize the faster the case gains the more withholds are going to come to view and if theres security check to pull them off your case can ball up in knot quick as scat so the auditor who is running the line should think of his withhold point of the end and beginning rudiments and the withhold should be left into the end rudiment also just add another one in there you know add have you told any halftruths untruths and so forth and also add withholds in because your technology is going too fast it gives you another crack so you got an additional one additional crack at it i havent given you new writedown of this because im still redoing the end rudiments youll see it shortly there are two or three things that im questioning and dont know quite what to do with yet but ill know pretty well very shortly thats why i havent issued you new slip on it and the auditor who is running run on goals terminal having found it and hes running run on it and he doesnt pay considerable amount of attention to withholds in beginning and end rudiments is actually guilty of gross auditing error because the withholds are going to appear by the reason of the case is making advance and the case will advance just to the degree that the withholds are off of it and hed say well i got all the withholds off at the beginning of the week and the it was just clean as wolfs tooth and so the rudiments are in so i dont have to pay very much attention to withholds on this particular case just now and then we had two days of marvelous and wonderful gain and everything was just going along beautifully so of course were going to have third day arent we ah thats an unjustified assumption because there is this about withholds the withhold which is not pulled which is restimulated but not pulled can raise hell thats missing security check question can just raise the dickens with case and case advance is also marked by an advance in responsibility and being marked by an advance in responsibility brings to view more overts than were formerly available to security check that is test is case advancing if case is advancing it develops more withholds more withholds come into view if case is advancing now ill give you an example of how case is not advancing weve done security check weve cleaned the rudiments we ask sort of presession 38type of question in the rudiments and what question shouldnt i ask you and weve done good job and weve got the rudiments all clean and hes just had form 3 and everything of this sort we already have his goals terminal we go on goalsterminal run and we run it tuesday and we run it wednesday and we run it thursday we pay more attention to withholds see and we thursday and thurs what the hell happened everything is stuck and so on the pc is very unhappy and appears rather blowy and friday oh well its an arc breaky session its all very upset well what could possibly be wrong with the case well the case advanced thats whats wrong with the case and if case advances it develops withholds now this is how it should run according to some auditors lets look at this one now you get all the withholds off and you get it all straightened out and you run him monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday and you do another security check and youre just very careful of withholds on friday and you make sure theyre all polished up and of the end rudiments and so on and so forth and you dont find any more there are more withholds than there were on monday and you say boy im sure doing good clean job of auditing with absolutely advance of any kind whatsoever its almost unthinkable you could do that these days but it theoretically could happen and if you got gain on the case of any kind whatsoever it will occur then that the case will not raise in responsibility of any kind whatsoever so it will occur then that at the end of considerable period of auditing the person will not have remembered any new withholds of any kind whatsoever because raise in responsibility additional or new withholds that he hadnt remembered before see gross auditing error not to keep the withholds off case while youre running it its one thing that can really stall it down to walk it can just go to sudden thud and so on withholds then make good test of case advance actually you could take short security check and shake case down at an end of short period of auditing and find out whether or not the case was winning you do the short security check at the beginning then you audit him for little while and do the same exact security check at the end and he has remembered nothing new advance in case much more reliable than profile profile is reliable too but itd tell you directly and immediately yeah because in the first place remember that withholds are not relegated to current lifetime only what happens if you start opening up whole track dont you think anybody has got any withholds on the whole track you mean they you mean they lived all these lifetimes right up to this lifetime and so forth and they never had any withholds in those lifetimes they just died by natural acts and causes you see and everything would go along but this lifetime is different in this lifetime they have withholds well you start opening up track and you frankly will see it in running this groups terminal process the individual all of sudden realize he has withhold from certain particular group ughh he didnt tell them that and then it finally occurs to him at the long end of run or something you know im not in that group anymore and this amounts to the fact that i am actually withholding my body and my beingness from that particular group yes i have withhold on that group hell recognize with great clarity that he isnt in the group and therefore is withholding himself from the group he recognizes things like this and they didnt occur to him earlier oh yes well there was the marcab government and there it was and still there yeah i was part of it once and its still there i havent anything on them withhold there isnt anything ive done they wouldnt like its funny you are asking that because actually ive never done anything you know as far as they didnt like i never have never have they get along fine i got along fine with them and theres just nothing you know and its all kind of imaginary anyway and hasnt anything to do with and after youve run the process for while why you come back across the same thing and he says well the marcab government is eeulpt and you say whats that and he ugh well the last time i was there they had warrant for my arrest hahaha haha im not about to go back there and every time of course you run across one of these i am not about to go back there i am not going to there anymore i do not want to be member of that group noooo what become member of that church oh under circumstances well thats silly stupid i mean i dont want anything to do with them you know i mean ruhh and so on of course im totally unemotional about it have withholds from the subject oh i dont have any withholds what made you ask as oh wait minute hahahaha we had treasurer once that robbed the exchequer and took all the cash that was in their account i know that happened and the group was pretty mad about that and then we go through and we mix up and few questions later maybe the next auditing session all of sudden the pc goes back across this church group and he says in little small voice you remember my telling you about the treasurer that embezzled all the money hahaha that was well whats the phenomenon it isnt that he didnt recall it its that it was below his level of responsibility and if his responsibility increases he eventually remembers more clearly what the situation was and takes responsibility for his own overt so actually the number of overts and withholds that show up newly on case havent very much to do with what criminal the person has been everybody has plenty of withholds you can just assume that everybody has got plenty of withholds the question is how many are available at any given instant how many can be pulled or how many are they willing to talk about at any given instant well its direct coordination with the amount of responsibility the case has now ill give you brandnew way of thinking about this everybody has number of withholds lets just say everybody has number of withholds this would be pretty close to fact you see its finite number of withholds 800 billion or something but itd be the same for every person people arent necessarily different from one to the next but that number could be considered more or less constant person to person preauditing before theyre audited all right now what is different what is different is the degree of responsibility the individual can take for his withholds so that you have criminal sitting there and he says yeah i robbed i and i did this and i did that and i did the other thing and i did oh yeah yeah i murdered babies and so on and i just killed my wife and children one time and left home and so on theres not even knock on the emeter well his irresponsibility is down to such level that theyre not even withholds all right he gets some auditing progress and he finds out that out of this whole potpourri of crime one time he was standing outside of bank and he turned the dead guard over with his foot and thats an overt thats real withhold and he hadnt remembered that and now hes telling you and he sort of feels little bit bad about it and hes happy to get it off of his chest then we go on little bit more auditing and we got session or two later and other things are coming and going and so forth and he tells you well wheegh i just realized im wanted in chicago even though that was two lifetimes ago remember that bank guard i said i turned over with my foot actually i shot him you say all right few sessions later youre running across things and so on and youre getting off withholds and so forth and thats fine and the criminal comes back across this point and he says you know that bank guard i told you i shot well the truth of the matter is i shot him when his hands were up and his back was turned to and i read later in the papers that he was the sole support of his wife and children and two aged parents and you say well all right good all right and hes glad to get that off of his chest and then you audit him while and he comes back across this thing later and he happens to be clicking down the line on his various overts and so forth and he says you know that that bank i was told you i robbed in chicago and i was just hood and i was just nobody and so forth actually i was the leader of the gang hahahaha hahahaha hate to have to confess this but i was and we dealt exclusively in bank robberies and we brought about the panic of 1929 yes ahha i hate to have to tell you about that there there it is there it is you see you get the idea perfect pattern of it was pulled by fellow one time i mean pc very famous guy i wont particularly expose parts of his case but he said we had plan one time and this plan well he said it was just bunch of us fellows and we put some people in ice cubes and we got rid of them and you know hehheh just just nothing didnt have anything to do with thinking of anything nothing much going on so we just thought thisd be good thing and it was gay thing to do and we later on i realize it was bad now but we just froze them up in some ice cubes and dumped them in an ocean on another planet and thats all there is to it well on little further questioning why it turns out that well actually there was some plan in it there was some reason they did it and so forth and it went on on this kind of stupid gradient and so forth and we find out that were talking to the fellow who thought up the plan and executed the plan and directed the plan that had to do with the implantations of all planets in this corner of the universe that was just too much overt dont you see it starts out with the basis well bunch of us got together and some people werent behaving very well and just some crummy little people didnt amount to anything very much you know and we just put them in some freezer compartments and we took them over and dumped them in an ocean hahaha funny joke wasnt it you get the difference of magnitude in how these things walk up of course you dont know what series of withholds are going to develop into big ones and what will early remain little withholds but the only thing dangerous about it is not clearing the question that you come to as you go across it so it amounts to one of the greater auditing goofs and it is goof of magnitude the individual that you let sit there and natter natter natter natter natter youre actually ruining his case because youre letting him sit there and lessen the overt lessen the overt lessen the overt lessen the overt and you should realize what hes trying to do hes trying to tell you i have withhold and you never say yes yes but what did you do of that type and kind that would make you feel that way yourself and the individual says nothing and the needle falls off the pin and then you find out well yes as matter of fact and it is quite something else the time you do this and all of sudden it clears and the case starts going clear but by finding things which other people have done on the pc you see getting the motivators and finding that the pcs other things and so forth you worsen case the only thing you ever want is what the pc does and what the pc did but it comes under one of the headings of one of the finer crimes to leave sec check question unflat it can do more damage per case per question than any other single action obviously from the case histories which i have immediately and directly at hand so take it to heart thats something you should never do make sure that its flat before you leave it and then dont think that little later when the person has had lot more auditing that the question if found unflat now was left unflat at the time it was hit it wasnt this is whole new series of withholds coming up under the heading of the same question and you differentiate that particular difference okay audience voices yes mmhm well will that do you any good in your auditing audience voices yes sir all right thank you audience thank you
