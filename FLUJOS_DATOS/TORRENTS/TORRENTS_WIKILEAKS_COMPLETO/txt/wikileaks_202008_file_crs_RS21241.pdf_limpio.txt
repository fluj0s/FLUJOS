problems it has been argued that nahasda has starte d series of discussions that had not taken place before with nahasda allowing tr ibes more control over their operations tribes are creating housing partnerships with nders tribes are educating tribal members about credit saving homebuying and banki ng practices tec hnical assistance and mentoring programs are being put in place to help native americans establish their own programs and institutions several local and regional lenders have developed the expertise to work with native american tribes in addition the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac sponsor programs for lending to native americans while all parties ge nerally agree that nahasda has been successful the program is not without its problems in august 2001 the hud inspector general ig issued report on the implementation of nahasda it s nine findings are that 1 hud has not accurately allocated nahasda funds since incep tion of the program 2 when projects are assisted by multiple programs there are conflicting admission requirements 3 when tdhes contain number of tribes the member tribes do not always benefit equally from their nahasda grants 4 some tdhes struggle because of their unfa miliarity with nahasda requirements 5 some tdhes lack management systems to effectively administer nahasda 6 some tdhes have not developed or complied with all policies and procedures 7 some tdhes have not successfully carried out their affordable housing activities 8 there is inadequate accounting for program income and increases in uncollected rents and 9 tdhes need to submit timely audit reports and they need to use uniform accounting standards nahasda bars federal grants for housing unl ess the property in question is exempt from taxation this requireme nt effectively limits the options of small and urban tribes that do not have large amounts of undevel oped taxexempt trust lands such groups would like to see nahasda amended to relax the taxexempt requirements many tribes have expresse d concern that hud has not ad equately consulted tribes when making regulatory changes to nahasda hud appears to have taken the position that the nahasda requirement for nego tiated rulemaking onl applies to the initial promulgation of regulations while tribes believe that negotiated rulemaking process should also apply to s ubsequent additions or amendm ents to the regulations in the new hud consultation policy set in place st year provision was made to create negotiated rulemaking advisory committee made up of tribal members to advise hud on when negotiated rulemaking procedures ought to be used in addition hud is currently seeking to form negotiated rulemaking committee to address issues with the nahasda grant formula while tribes view these as steps in the ri ght direction they do not view these steps as sufficient hud remains the ultimate decisi on maker and they contend that there is guarantee that hud would follow the recomme ndations of an advisory committee thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21241crs6 preference of tribes is that the statutor language of nahasda be amended to clearly state that negotiated rulemaki ng should be used for all re gulations and rulemaking made under nahasda several tribes argue that they would be able to provide more affordable housing to members if they were able to access ta xexempt financing through title vi of nahasda to do so section 7871 of the in ternal revenue code would have to be amended to accommodate nahasda reauthorization of nahasda as noted above nahasda contai ns three authorizations 1 the authorization of appropriations for block grants for indian tr ibes to carry out affordable housing activities 2 the authorization of appropriations for th subsidy costs of loan guarantees and 3 the authorization of appropria tions for providing training and technical assistance for indian housing authorities and tdhes thes authorizations expired at the end of fy2001 under hr 1873 and s 1210 as introduced in the 107th congress nahasda would be amended to extend these au thorization through fy2006 and other amendments are proposed in either bill title vii of hr 3995 would extend the authorizations through fy2007 and amend nahasda to permit recipients to use percentage of their grant amounts fo r comprehens ive housing nd community development planning activities the subcommittee on housing and community opportunity of the house committee on financ ial services has held hearings on hr 3995 but
