pãìéägkmêçîååé mêééêéçpííéãéåí my name is samuel provance and i come from greenville sc i enlisted in the united states army in nvvu and sought specialization in intelligence in ommo i was drawn to the army by the professional traini ng and good life it promised but also because it provided an opportunity to serve my country the army has stood for duty honor and country in wearing my countrys service uniform and risking my life for my countrys protection it never occurred to that i might be required to be part of things that conflict with these values of duty honor and country but my experience in iraq and late r in germany left troubled by what has happened to the army i saw the traditional values of military service as i understood them compromised or undermined i am still proud to be soldier and to wear the uniform of the united states army but i am concerned about what the army is becoming while serving with my unit in iraq i became aware of changes in the procedures in which i and my fellow soldiers were trained these changes involved using procedures which we previously did not use and had been trained not to use and in involving military police mp personnel in preparation of detainees who were to be interrogated some detainees were treated in an incorrect and i mmoral fashion as result of these changes after what had happened at abu ghraib becam matter of public knowledge and there was demand for action young soldiers were scapegoated while superiors misrepresented what had happened and tried to misdirect attention away from what was really going on i considered all of this conduct to be dishonorable and inconsistent with the traditions of the army i was ashamed and embarrassed to be associated with it when i made clear to my superiors that i was troubled about what had happened i was told that the honor of my unit and the army depended on either withholding the truth or outright lies i cannot accept this honor ca nnot be achieved by lies and scapegoating honor depends on the truth it demands that we live consistently with the values we hold out to the world my belief in holding to the truth led directly to conflict with my superiors and ultimately to my demotion i welcome the opportunity to speak to you today and to answer your questions n aìíómçëáíáçåáålééêíáçåfêèácêééççã i was sent to camp virginia kuwait just before operation iraqi freedom began in february ommp i was the ncoic of the targeting section of the v corps ace analysis and control element it was from camp virginia that we fought the war collecting intelligence nominating targets for destru ction and overseeing deep attacks my responsibilities focused on information systems at the wars end i was placed as section leader in the syscon systems control platoon aìíómçëáíáçåëñêçãäìdüêáäíçmêéëéåí in september ommp i was sent to the abu ghraib prison to replace sgt andreas zivic who had been wounded in mortar attack i replaced him as the nco in charge ncoic of system administration at the prison we first had to recover the site that had been mortared they had been working out of an unprotected and fully exposed tent which was very unsafe as the site had been receivin g mortar fire almost every day request had been made to move the operation into the hardened building right next to it prior to the fatal attack the request was denied by col pa ppas there was great deal of sensitivity about what was going on in that hardsite and access to it was severely limited as result of conducting the operations in an unshel tered position two soldiers were killed and numerous wounded some disabled for life and chaptered from the army i later came to understand that this was one of the direct cost s to my unit of the abuses that occurred at abu ghraib i also served as the local security officer until relieved by cw rumminger in january ommq at first there were only couple companies of military intelligence soldiers from the porthreserve and rnvthairborne and handful of computers but then group came from guantanamo bay gtmo cuba to make the place better run as we were told there was conflict between the gtmo sold iers and those who were already at abu ghraib having to do with the way interrogati ons were being conducted and reported i do not remember the specifics of the conflict but in general our people wanted to use the techniques we were trained to use at ft huachuca and the gtmo people had very different ideas after this period the number of civilian contractors who reported in this statement has been redacted at the request of the department of defense to eliminate the names of personnel whose identities have not yet been publicly disclosed increased significantly these contractor s were principally from caci and titan corporations and were functioning as interrogators translators and linguists the interrogators were principally americans but the others were frequently arabspeaking middle easterners but not iraqis in the course of my duties i would see some of these civilians regularly others maybe only once or twice soldiers from other units then came as well as even more civilians i worked the night shift from u ékã until u kã the following morning my nightly routine consisted of making accounts for new users troubleshootin g computer problems backing up the secret shared drive maintaining the secret and top secret network connectivity and manning the topsecret part of the joint interrogation and debriefing center jidc spc leon wilson worked with and handled the day shift jáëíêéíãéåíçñmêáëçåéêëíäìdüêáä i had many discussions with different interr ogators and analysts being the computer guy my job required to interact with most of the team and i often had the time to speak with them personally over time i began to get pretty clear picture of what was being done to the detainees at abu ghraib what i learned surprised and disturbed the first alarming incident i heard about was that some of the interrogators had gotten drunk and then under the guise of interrog ation molested an underaged iraqi girl detainee it could have been worse but mp on duty stopped the m friends of some of the interrogators involved were concerned that col pappas would deal severely with the incident they asked to recite falseh ood about col pappas in the hope that he would be disqualified from serving as conv ening authority i refused to do this i befriended spc hannah schlegel an analyst who was being retrained to be an interrogator many others were being retrained in this same way schlegel told detainees were routinely stripped naked in the cells and sometimes during interrogations she said one man so shamed had actually made loin cloth out of an mre meal ready to eat bag so they longer allowed him to have the mre bag with his food she said they also starved them or allowed them to only have certain items of food at time she said they played loud music barney i love you being the interrogators favorite i was shocked by this and told her i couldnt unde rstand how she could cope with the nudity wasnt it embarrassing or at least uncomfortable schlegel said that this was one of the new practices and they got used to it moreover she got thrill out of being woman interrogating them knowing how much it angered and offended them to have woman in p position of authority and control over men she said they used dogs to terrify and torment the prisoners she also said they depr ived them of sleep for long periods of time this was all part of carefully planned regimen that had been introduced after the arrival of the teams from gtmo schlegel once invited to accompany her to the hardsite where i observed the mps were constantly yelling at the detainees one detainee was being made to repeat his number over and over again i also befriended spc donna menesini who was with the first mp units that set up abu ghraib after the war menesini told that she had witnessed abuses of iraqi people and even seen some of them murdered she said she documented these things in diaries that she sent home to her family in case someone killed her before she made it home to do something about it she particularly mentione d fearing her chain of command her view that anyone disclosing these incidents of buse would face swift and severe retaliation was widespread among soldiers at abu ghraib spc israel rivera an analyst i had known from training at ft huachuca told that he had seen some detainees handcuffed together in contorted positions as punishment for raping boy he also said the interrogators were using the detainees faith in islam as tool to break them and get them to talk he said he was bothered by these practices felt they were wrong but wasnt in position to do anything about it while eating at the dining facility at camp victory spc mitchell an guard told an entire table full of laughing soldiers ab out how the mps had shown him and other soldiers how to knock someone out and to st rike detainee without leaving marks they had practiced these techniques on unsuspec ting detainees after watching he had participated himself in discussions i had with some of my collea gues brutal treatment of the detainees was justified by the fact that they were the enemy and that they belonged here but to my surprise i learned that large number of the detainees had business being there at all ssg schuster who worked in the outprocessing office told that most of the detainees had just been picked up in sweeps for particular reason and that some of them werent even being tracked or registered she also said they were all being kept there indefinitely sometime later i learned that few detainees had been released and they were telling stories on the outside about having been abused while interrogated the accounts at the time involved cigarettes bein g put in their ears and being told that american soldiers would be sent to rape their families i was surprised about these claims q and asked ssg schuster what she thought she said not only were these claims probably true she had good idea just which soldiers would have been involved sgt nathan brown whom i knew from my co mpany told his soldiers guards were being subjected to and made to do things he did not like he said when he and others from pmondgot to the prison they were told th ey could do whatever they wanted to the detainees particularly while making them do exercises practice known as smoking he described an incident in which spc kersey grabbed the ankle of one detainee causing him to hit his head on the floor they all laughed spc elizabeth caudill also from my company gave essentially the same account as sgt brown i was told that spc armin cruz and luciana spencer were relieved from interrogation duty by ltc jordan cruz for being too br utal and spencer for escorting detainee naked in front of the general population unit of guards was formed because the mp s longer wanted to do the things they were being asked to do by interrogators the guards were well known for being extremely rowdy at night drinking bottles of robitussin dm with tablets of vivarin and then partying in dark room full of blinking lights and loud music they were even doing this with one of the civilian interrogators dj whom they worked for directly during interrogations one night they came back with rings on their fingers and i asked where they got them and they said they got them from detainees stephan stefanowicz civilian interrogator requested that i give him access to highly classified information he said it was vital and despite the fact that he had clearance through the brigade s tried to convince he had clearance and demanded i give him this information i declined his reques ts and reported the matter to the brigade s i nevertheless had the impression that civ ilian contractors were being given access to highly classified information notwithstandin g the lack of proper clearance moreover these civilian contractors involved in interrog ation frequently behaved as if they were the superiors of the uniformed military interrogators giving them directions and instructions their presence and activities clearly seemed to undermine or confuse the chain of command at abu ghraib and to undermine discipline and morale i spoke with number of other interrogators and analysts and most corroborated in some way the accounts of abuse and mistreatment i h ave described here most everything i note here was either widely known or openly discussed the community there was very small so even the mechanics and cooks knew lot of what was going on because of these facts r i was amazed that so few soldiers provided accounts of what happened during the official investigations undertaken by mg taguba and then mg fay in october ommp one day i noticed that delegation from the red cross was at abu ghraib performing some sort of mission word got around that the red cross had been very critical of what they saw at the prison i hoped that this would lead to some changes however shortly after their visit ltc jordan spoke to our unit telling us of the red cross visit he said they had made many co mplaints about the conditions in which the detainees were held jordan said by contrast their conditions were far better off than they were under saddam hussein the message seemed to be that nothing was going to change that everything was going on ju st the way the command authority wanted in december ommp spc wilson and i were in col pappa s office fixing his printer col pappas and his staff captain were discussing staging mock fast rope attack in which assault troops would repel down ropes from helicopters in the middle of the hardsites as christmas present for the tainees they laughed together about it saying it would scare the bejeezus out of the detainees i thought they were joking at the time but it further convinced that they had an attitude of indifference or even hostility towards detainees and that they wanted to use fear and intimidation as the main tools against them later i read mg taguba s interview with col pappas and learned that he in fact staged this exercise and defended it to mg tag uba as necessary to prevent possible prison uprising qüéqöìäfåîéëíáöíáçå watching afn one day in january ommq i saw general ricardo sanchez talking about an investigation into what happened in the abu gh raib prison regarding abuses in this way i learned that an investigation had been commenced on january on ommq i was interviewed by criminal investigation divi sion cid investigators at abu ghraib days later we were told to go see cid investigators in group s while there we each were given generic questionnaire asking stions about detainee abuse and some photographs based on what i already knew and suspected i thought the focus of this investigation was going to be on interrogators and interrogations both military and civilian because i had answered some of the questions yes i was called back to see cid i got worried when the jidc leadership announced to everybody who was being called back for interviews i noticed very few others were called back which implied they had nothing to say as result the other soldiers there felt that i must be in trouble or s was telling on those who were there was great deal of tension within the unit at this time and concern about disciplinary measures that might be taken because of the abuse that had gone on on the other hand many felt confident that what was being done was consistent with new policies that had been introduced and that they would be protected i was interviewed by cid agent ryan bostain when called back i told the cid investigator everything i knew at the time and could remember i was surprised that while i was providing information based on things other soldiers had told many of those soldiers were not talking to cid i was concerned about this i had considered making formal written complaint about what i had heard as early as october ommp i didnt do this at this time for veral reasons one was that much of what i knew involved hearing accounts from other soldiers rather than things i observed directly but more than this everything i saw and observed at abu ghraib and in iraq convinced that if i filed report i wouldn t be listened to that it would be covered up i thought that the best case was that i would be considered troublemaker and ostracized but that potentially i might even place my life in danger even when the cid inquiry began and i started to cooperate wi th the investigators i was worried that something might happen to in february ommq i was redeployed back to heidelberg germany and reunited with my company the company took leave for month mìääáåíáçåçñíüéäìdüêáämüçíçë on april ou ommq i learned that cbs sm minutes and the new yorker magazine were publishing photographs of detainee abuse from abu ghraib i understood immediately that these must be some of the photographs which had triggered the cid investigation in the following days this story was in the news papers everywhere none of the things which came out in those days were surprising to and they could not have been surprising to any of the soldiers i knew who served at abu ghraib at this time because they were things the soldiers had heard seen or done themselves i thought that the truth would finally come out but i was disappointed to see that only those few mps in the pictures were being investigated and that there seemed to be an effort to exclude the personnel from the process as much as possible in the following days i saw secretary rumsfeld appear on television many times in washington before senate committee and then in iraq t explaining that this was all the work of few bad apples he appeared to be setting up the mp personnel to be scapegoated and to be denying that what happened at abu ghraib was the result of policies and decisions that he and others high up in the chain of command had put in place this struck as extremely dishonest and i was shocked by it cáêëítêåáåöëäçìííüéjéçá nsg palenik gave daily briefs to the morning formation about this time he began to vilify the news media he said that soldier was to speak with the media under any circumstances he said few in the omrth brigade had already done so anonymously and as result other soldiers were looking for them an other time he referred to it as the web of abu ghraib working its way to the company maj hall an officer in the analysis and co ntrol element ace informed that the next day i was to be interviewed by general in darmstadt he told that the scandal w u l d p r b b l b s b d s m l i n d t h t v n t h u g h h c u l d n t t l l m n t t speak to the press he strongly advised i not do so fåíéêîáéïïáíüdéåéêäcó on may n ommq i was interviewed by mg fay in darmstadt germany i went with spc jerry rush and spc elizabeth caudill to darmstadt there were few other soldiers from b pmo bn but i was surprised how few soldiers from my unit were there or otherwise involved in the investigation each of us wa s interviewed by mg fay our statements were dictated by his assistant and when they had been typed up they were brought back in for review edits and signature i was called in last mg fay explained that he was conducting an investigation into allegations surrounding abu ghraib he then began asking questions related to my knowledge of the geneva conventions my military intelligence and particularly interrogation training my interaction with ltc jordan certain mps photographs and anything i had personally witnessed i was asto nished by the fact that he never asked question about the interrogators i answered his questions to the best of my ability after doing so i told him that i didnt unde rstand why he had questions about the interrogators i volunteered that most of what i knew or had heard came from them he was not interested i repeated that i had hear d number of very troubling accounts he looked annoyed by this but then he invited to share some details with him i then u shared with mg fay much of the account that i just wrote in this statement mg fay was clearly very unhappy to have all this account he pulled out my statement to cid from january and quoted back to the passage in which i said i was glad something was being done because what had been going on was shameful he then said he would recommend administrative actio n against for not reporting what i knew sooner than the investigation he said if i had reported what i knew sooner i could have actually prevented the scandal i was stunned by his statements and by his attitude jáëíêéíãéåíçñdéåéêäwäêåçüáëpçå spc james gehman was informed that he would be interviewed by mg fay i told gehman that it was most likely because i d mentioned his name in connection with the interrogation of general hamid zabar an iraqi flag officer and his nsyearold we had interrogated his together the was incorrectly reported as having been nt years old i told him the account i had give n namely that general zabar had been mistreated and his taken prisoner to get him to talk gehman then he corrected saying it was in fact the generals nsyearold who was abused to get the general to talk explaining it in detail he promised that he would be sure to give mg fay complete account which he did i was extr emely uncomfortable about the way general zabar had been treated but particularly the fact that his had been captured and used in this way it struck as morally repr ehensible and i could not understand why our command was doing it later gehman told he had been reinterviewed about this incident twice by cid investigators who had cautioned him and tried to persuade him to change his account it was clear that the investigators were very concerned about the incident on may p ommq i was placed as the eucom european command ncoic within the asi all source intelligence platoon on may q ommq mg tagubas ëéåêéílåçñçêå report was leaked soldiers in my company told that my name was on the internet listed on this report i realized that i had now been publicly identified as witness some thing i never expected to happen but i was completely shocked to find out i was the only soldier listed as witness torin nelson being the only civilian i could not understand how it was possible that other soldiers failed to give accounts of what they did or saw on may ommq i gave telephonic testimony at spc megan ambuhls article po proceeding from patton barracks heidelberg germany the hearing was in baghdad i v gave my testimony and both my name and portions of my testimon were reported in the news the next day something else i did t expect to happen i was surprised when i discovered that my testimony ran contrary to the contentions of the prosecutors in ambuhls case i had thought that the prosecut ors were working to reveal what happened and to punish the wrongdoers after this experience i was increasingly suspicious of how the prosecutions were being handled they seemed to to be designed to shut people up not to reveal the truth about what ppened and punish all the wrongdoers in particular they seemed focused on trying to shut off the responsibility of those who were higher up the chain of command lêçéêéçíçäépáäéåíäçìíäìdüêáä on may nq ommq i was ordered by cpt hedberg not to discuss abu ghraib while off duty i received phone call from cpt hedberg he told it was urgent that i come in to see him in his office when i arrived he handed written order not to speak with anyone in anyway about abu ghraib he said that he didnt want to ask him any questions or say anything only to read the or der and sign it i was very disturbed by this order i told him that my name was now in the papers in connection with the abu ghraib case what was i supposed to do when i got call from my mother asking if her was an abuser in response he repeated that i was not to ask questions or say anything only to read the order and sign it he presented this as an order nsg palenik was there i did as he ordered immediately afterwards i asked other soldiers who were at abu ghraib in my company if they had received any similar written orders and they all said to this day i know of other soldier who was at abu ghraib to receive any similar written orders i am convinced that the order was issued because i was speaking honestly and candidly about what happened and because of concern that the information i was providing would be circulated in the media and to congress fåíéêîáéïïáíü_kéïë my mother told that abc news had tried to contact through my former wife in south carolina i made mental note of it at the time but understanding what sensitive issue this scandal and investigation was i did not respond later however i became convinced that massive effort was under way within the military to cover up what had nm happened at abu ghraib and to scapegoat handful of mps i was particularly concerned that higher ups whether policymakers or officers with responsibility for abu ghraib were being held to account for what happened i considered this to be highly dishonorable i remembered reading the speec h of holocaust survivor who was saved when her camp was liberated by american sold iers one of those soldiers took care of her married her and took her back to america she summarized the lesson of her life with these words thou shalt not be victim thou shalt not be perpetrator above all thou shalt not be bystander after what had happened at abu ghraib i was haunted by this thought i felt i owed duty to those wh were suffering abuse and just as much to my fellow soldiers who were trapped suffering and degraded by the implementation of these new policies that duty was to speak matter the consequences that i might suffer i decided to do so on may ns ommq i was again contacted by abc news and asked to talk about both what had happened in abu ghraib and in the investigation i agreed my interview with reporters brian ross and alexandra salmon was aired on abcs world news tonight with peter jennings on may nu ommq fåíéêîáéïïáíüpéåíçêdêüã on the morning of may on ommq lindsey graham the senator representing my home state of south carolina called at home the conversation i had with senator graham marked the first time representative of our government was in touch with asking serious focused questions which made clear that he was determined to get to the bottom of what had happened although we had on ly brief conversation senator graham covered wide range of topics with and he was particularly focused on the role of in the abuses at abu ghraib and the specific techniques or procedures which had been used speaking with senator graham made feel that my abc news interview was having positive effect that now something would be done the stonewalling would stop and the truth would come out after the call from senator graham i was contacted repeatedly by staff members of the sena armed services committee requesting clarification and further information on the matters i discussed i had strong sense that immediately from the time senator graham first contacted my command was aware of my communications with him and congressional staff from this point forward my relations with my unit got progressively tenser nn cäööéçipìëééåçéçpéåìêáíóäéêååé on may on ommq i was administratively flagged and my topsecret clearance suspended by ltc norwood in wiesbaden germany i met my assigned jag lawyer cpt stanfield and i reported to ltc norwood in his office were several people all in my chain of command who were sitting behind later i learn that sgm allen cpt hedberg and msg mcmillan were present so that they could each sign document as witnesses if i re fused to do so ltc norwood read da qurs that flagged and suspended my clearanc then asked to sign it i told him that my lawyer had instructed not to si gn anything until it had been reviewed by counsel and said i did not want to disregard this instruction ltc norwood got very angry and demanded that i sign it i repeat ed my lawyers instruction and then ltc norwood dismissed csm fast then came to few minutes later saying all you had to do was sign it when i got back to my company i turned in my security badge and reported to the headquarters platoon the flag was pending the outcome of mg fays investigation and its basis was violation of an order issued to you by your company commander the suspension of my topsecret clearance was due to the claim that my reliability and trustworthiness had been brought into question and that i was now vulnerable to influence and pressures from outside agenciesorganizations that may be contrary to the national interests and the procedure nr investigation into abuses i was told that cid wanted to question regarding the interview given to abc news but they were referred to my jag lawyer i never heard from them again sfc keller my platoon sergeant up to may ommq prepared an ncoer permanent evaluation report for sergeants i was to re ceive block under duty in the army values column because i had disobeyed di rect order i protested this to her and msg mcmillan he was third party to the counse ling but they said it didnt matter an order was an order even if it was wrongly given i then asked how she could do this since i was longer in her platoon later that day sfc keller called and said she realized i was not in her platoon that the counseling was getting shredded and that my ncoer to be read by ltc jones was going to be good and fine i still have copy of the now shredded document when ltc jones read my ncoer he made point of telling that the work i did at abu ghraib was ve ry good and that he was proud of my performance he appeared to be aware of the risks i was taking and was offering moral support in early june ommq sgt kashmir mcclean told that leaders in the ace were delivering briefings to soldiers in which i was harshly attacked my statement to abc news was described as lie and they claime d that it would be used as propaganda by the enemy in sum they were labelling as traitor sgt curtis gehman later confirmed this account i understood what th ey were doing as demonstration to other soldiers who had been at abu ghraib if you speak up about what really happened you will be cast out and targeted on august or ommq the mg fayltg jones report was released nsg palenik gave the analogy of soldier whose only job is to turn screws and says he should only talk about turning screws nothing else this was unders tood by everyone as reference to and my willingness to answer the investigators questions freely sgt morseberger approached later at the motor pool to ask how the screwing is coming along even though the fay report was completed i remain flagged and my clearance suspended on september n ommq i was requested to come to washington dc by member of the senate armed services committee to assist in preparations for hearing on the fayjones report the pentagon delayed my flight according to nsg palenik inhibiting the goal of my travel i was to leave that friday and had tickets to do so but was told i couldnt leave until monday as result my time with senate staff was cut down to just the qu hours one day before the hearings and the day of the hearings themselves i missed meetings that had been set over the weekend to assist staffers in preparations for the hearing on my return major soller the battalion ex ecutive officer openly mocked one of the senators and likened my trip to herbie goes to washington movie oéçìåéçáåoåâ in july ommr i was given an article nr and reduced in rank for disobeying direct order namely the order not to speak about what happened at abu ghraib during the initial reading ltc gorton the convening auth ority said that if i had demanded court martial i could have faced nm years in prison my flag
