udiciaryhousegovoversightaspxid164commerce clause the commerce clause grants congress the power to regulate interstate commerce congresss authority to regulate interstate commerce has been described as plenary and limited only by other constitutional provisions3 on the flip side of the issue the supreme court has long held that the states may not unduly burden interstate commerce in the absence of federal regulation this restriction is founded in what is referred to as the dormant commerce clause state ta x provision does not violate the dormant commerce clause if four qualifications are met 1 the activity taxed has substantial nexus with the state 2 the tax is fairly apportioned to reflect the degree of activity that occurs within the state 3 the tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce and 4 the tax is fairly related to benefits provided by the state4 in the cuno case the only issue with respect to the commerce clause was whether the tax incentive was discriminatory there is simple definition of the term discriminatory instead the supreme court has provided general principles which are then applied to the specific tax at issue for example the court has declared that fundamental principle of the commerce clause is that states may not impose tax which discriminates against interstate commerce by providing direct commercial advantage to local business5 another general rule is that state may use its tax system to encourage intrastate commerce and may compete with other states for interstate commerce so long as the state does not d iscriminatorily tax th products manufactured or the business operations perfo rmed in any other state6 the supreme court has not addressed whether an investment tax credit similar to the one at issue in cuno is discriminatory thus the district court and court of appeals were left to look at the general principles found in the courts decisions and analogize the ohio credit to the tax credits in the prior cases as shown by the opposite outcomes of the two lower courts discussed below it is possible to come to different conclusions about the meaning of the supreme courts prior cases th decisions by the district court and court of appeals broadly represent two view points of the courts jurisprudence7 the district courts decision represents the idea that the purpose of the commerce clause is to prevent economic protectionism by the states ie to prevent states from helping instate businesses by penalizing outo fstate businesses the c ourt of appeals decision represents the view that the clauses purpose is to encourage free trade by limiting the states ability to use its taxing power to co erce taxpayers into conducting business in that state as seen in the two opinions there is support in the supreme courts prior decisions for both interpretations the s upreme court in holding that the plaintiffs lacked standinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22186crs3 8 cuno v daimlerchrysler 154

ddress whether the tax credit violated the commerce clause cuno v daimlerchrysler district court the us district court in granting the defendants motion to dismiss the case for failure to state claim held that the investment tax credit did not violate the commerce clause8 the court began by describi ng what it believed were the two types of state taxation schemes the supreme court d found to be discriminatory9 the first was that states could not tax goods imported from other states without imposing tax on instate goods and the court found this was not an issue with the ohio credit the second was that states tax could not be based on the propor tion of businesss activities carried on in that state to the am ount carried on in other states the court described the ta x scheme in westinghouse electric co v tully10 as the paradigmatic example of what was not allowed under this second rule11 in westinghouse the supreme court held that new york corporate tax credit that lowered the effective tax rate on companys income as its subsidiarys exports from new york increased relative to those from other states was discriminatory the district court in cuno noted that the new york and ohio credits were similar in that an increase in new york activity increased the new york credit and an increase in ohio activity increased the ohio credit however the court distinguis hed between the two cases although an increase in activity conducted outside new york decreased the new york credit an increase in activity conducted outside ohio did not decrease the oh io credit based on this distinction the court held the ohio credit was not discriminatory12 sixth circuit court of appeals the plaintiffs appealed the district courts decision the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit held that the investment tax credit violated the commerce clause and reversed this part of the lower courts decision13 the court began by rejecting the defendants argument accepted by the district court that prior supreme court opinions had held that only two types of taxes were unacceptable those that functioned as tariffs and those that determined the taxpayers effective tax rate using both instate and outofstate activities the court characterized this view as primarily concerned with preventing economic protectionism and the court rejected it because it rests on the distinction between laws that benefit instate activity and laws that burden outofstate activity14 the court described this distinction as tenuous because the supreme court had stated that virtually every discriminatory statute can behttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22186crs4 15 id 16 id at 744 17 id 18 id at 74445viewed as conferring bene fit on one party and detriment on the other in either an absolute or relative sense15 instead the court of appeals compared the ohio tax incentives with state tax schemes that the supreme court had found to be discr iminatory because they involved state using its taxing power to encourage investment in th state at the expense of investment in other states the court looked at three cases boston stock exchange v state tax commission 429 us 318 1977 where the court invalidated part of new york securities transfer tax new york imposed tax on transfer of securities if taxable event occurred in the state since new york was the only state that taxed securities transfers the tax placed new york brokers at disadvantage the state created incentives to encourage new york sales if sale occurred in new york then nonresidents were taxed at lower rate and both residents and nonresidents c ould not be taxed above certain amount the court of appeals quoted the supreme court as finding that the incentives foreclosed taxneutral decisions and that new york was improperly using its power to tax an instate operation as means of requiring other business operations to be performed in the home state which was wholly inconsistent with the free trade purpose of the commerce clause16 maryland v louisiana 451 us 725 1981 where the supreme court invalidated louisiana severance tax credit that favored instate natural gas producers the appeals court quoted the supreme court as finding that since the credit favored those who both own offshore gas and engage in louisiana production nd that the obvious economic effect of this severance tax credit was to encourage natural gas owners involved in the production of offs hore gas to invest in mineral exploration and development within louisiana rather than to invest in further offshore development or in production in other states the credit unquestionabl discriminated against interstate commerce in favor of local interests17 westinghouse electric corp v tully which was discu ssed above in the section on the district courts opi nion and was distinguished by that court the court of appeals quoted th supreme court as stating that the tax scheme penalized increases in the export shipping activities in other states which meant it placed discriminatory burden on commerce to its sister states18httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22186crs5 19 id at 74345 20 id at 743 21 daimlerchrysler v cuno 04 1704 and 041724 2006 us lexis 3956 2006 22 the issue of standing was broug ht up by the state of ohio when it asked for banc review of the panels decision see the state of ohios petition for rehearing at 910 cuno 386 f3d 738 the court denied the motion to review the case banc cuno 2005 us app lexis 1750 6th cir 2005 23 262 us 447 48687 1923the court of appeals found the ohio cred it to be analogous to these other tax incentives in that the credit by reducing businesss preexisting franchise tax liability coerced businesses into making instate investments19 business with activities in ohio would be subject to the states franchise ta x regardless of whether the business made an investment in new property eligible for th tax credit the business could however reduce its existing franchise tax liability by making new investments that would qualify for the tax credit on the other hand if th business chose to make the new investments outside of ohio it could not reduce its ohio franchise tax liability this meant in the courts view that ohio was using its power to tax to coerce businesses subject to the ohio franchise tax to expand in ohio rather than in another state20 as result it held the credit was discriminatory supreme court ohio and the other defendants ppealed the decision as it related to the investment tax credit to the us supr eme court in 2006 the court held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case in federal court and vacated and remanded that part of the court of appeals opinion for dismissal21 the issue of standing had not been addressed by the court of appeals22 it was briefly an i ssue before the district court after the defendants asked for the case which the plaintiffs had initially brought in state court to be removed to federal court the plainti ffs used their potential lack of standing as one reason why the suit should not be removed but the district court in approving the removal stated that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the tax credit under the municipal taxpayer standing rule that rule derives from supreme court case massachusetts v mellon 23 in which the court indicated that municipal resident could have standing to cha llenge the illegal spending of money by municipality because of the special relationship that arose between the resident and municipality due to the laters corporate status the distri ct court apparently felt that the cuno plaintiffs had standing to challenge the state investment tax credit because they had standing to challenge the other benefits provided to daimlerchrysler specifically property tax exemption provided by an ohio munici pality as authorized under ohio law before the supreme court the cuno plaintiffs claimed they had standing due to their status as ohio taxpayers who were injured because the credit reduced the funds available in the ohio fisc to be used for lawful purposes and therefore imposed disproportionate burden on them the supreme court in re jecting their claim began by noting that standing is an integral part of the cas or controversy requirement in article iii of the us constitution and requires plaintiffs show personal injury fairly traceable to the defendants allegedly unlawfu l conduct and likely to be redressed by the requestedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22186crs6 24 cuno 2006 us lexis 3956 at 18 quoting allen v wright 468 us 737 751 1984 25 id

their taxpayer status to ch allenge an expenditure of federal funds25 this is because such taxpayers injuries are 1 not particularized to those plaintiffs but rather common to the general taxpaying public and 2 hypothetical because whether they will occur or be redressed depe nds on future actions by legislative body the court concluded that the same reasons for denying st anding to federal taxp ayers applied to deny standing to state taxpayers including the plaintiffs in cuno26 the court also rejected the plaintiffs contention that there should be an exception to the general rule disallowing taxpayer standing for commerce clause challenges similar to the exception that exists for establishment clause challenges27 the court distinguished between the two situations noting that the injury in taxpayer suits alleging violation of the establishment clause was th taxing and spending itself and that the injury could be redressed by enjoining the taxing and spending ac tivity without requiring further legislative action28 the court also reasoned that allowing an exception for commerce clause suits would lead to the creation of exceptions for any constitutional provision that implicates governments ta xing and spending powers and thus be inconsistent with the general rule that disallows taxpayer standing finally the court rejected the argument that the plaintiffs had standing to challenge the investment tax credit under the theory of supplemental jurisd iction which would ve allowed them to challenge the investment tax credit because they had standing as municipal taxpayers to challenge the property tax exemption provided to daimlerchrysler by an ohio municipality stating that the plaintiffs mu st have standing for each claim presented29 legislation intr oduced in the 109th congress the economic development act of 2005 h r 2471 and s 1066 would give states the authority to offer incentives like the investment tax credit struck down by the sixth circuit in cuno the act would generally allow the states to provide discriminatory tax incentives that are for an economic development purpose including any legally permitted activity for attracting retaining or expanding business activity jobs or investment in state some incentives would not be allo wed including those that depend on state of incorporation or domicile requi re the recipient to acquire or use services or property produced in the state are reduced as direct result of an increase in outofstate activity result in loss of compensating tax system require reciprocal tax benefits from another jurisdiction or reduce tax not imposed on apportioned interstate activities the act would apply to all qualifying tax incentives regardless of their date of enactment
