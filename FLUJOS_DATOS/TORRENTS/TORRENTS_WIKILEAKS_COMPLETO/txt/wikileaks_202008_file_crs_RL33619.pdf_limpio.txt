other fi rms for calendar year 2005 broadbased vat in the united states would have rais ed net revenue of pproximately 50 billion for each 1 levied most other developed nations rely more on broadbased consumption taxes for revenue than does the united states vat is shifted onto consumers consequently it is regressive because werincome households spend greater proportion of their incomes on consumption than higherincome households this regression however could be reduced or even eliminated by any of three methods refundable credit ag ainst income tax liability for vat paid allocation of some of vat revenue for increased welfar spending or selective exclusion of some goods from taxation from an economic perspective major revenue source is better the greater its neutrality that is the less the tax alte rs economic decisions conceptually vat on all consumption expenditures with single rate that is constant over time would be relatively neutral compared to othe r major revenue sources vat would not alter choices among goods and it would not ffect the relative prices of present and future consumption but vat cannot be levied on leisure consequently vat would affect households decisions concerning work versus leisure the imposition of vat would cause onetime increase in this countrys price level but vat would not necessar ily affect this countrys future rate of inflation if the federal reserve offset the contractionary effects of vat with more expansionary monetary policy if the united states continued its policy of flexible exchange rates then the imposition of vat would not significantly affect the us balanceoftrade there is conclusive evidence that vat would change the rate of national saving more than another type of major tax increase the high revenue yield from vat would cause administrative costs to be low measured as percentage of revenue yield in comp arison to other broadbased consumption taxes vats have produced relatively good compliance rates whether or not federal vat would encroach on the primary source of state revenue the sales tax is subject to debate federalstate vat could be collected jointly but state would lose

zealand japan mexico and south korea in orde r to examine different aspects of vat it is important to understand th concept of valueadded tax including the types of vats the different methods of calculatin g vats and exemption versus zerorating concept of valueadded tax valueadded tax is tax levied at each stage of production on firms value added the value added of firm is th difference between firms sales and firms purchases of inputs fro m other firms in other wo rds firms value added is simply the amount of value firm contribut to good or service by applying its factors of production l and labor capital and entrepreneurial ability7 another method of calculating firms value added is to total the firms payments to its factors of production types of vat there are three types of vats that differ in their tax treatment of purchases of capital inputs plant and equipment under the consumption vat capital purchases are treated the same way as the purchase of any other input the purchase price is deducted at the time of purchase this tax treatment of capital purchases is equivalent to expensing under the income vat the vat paid on the purchases of capital inputs is amortized credited ag ainst the firms vat liability over the expected lives of the capital inputs under the gross product vat deduction for the vat on purchases of capital inputs is allowed against the firms vat liabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33619crs3 8 numerical examples with explanations of these three methods of calculating vat are shown in appendix 9 an exception is the final retail stage where policymakers have the option of including or excluding the vat from the retail sales slip 10 for comprehensive explanation and analysis of methods to calculate vat see value added tax methods of calculation by james m bickley crs general distribution memorandum available from the authorall 29 oecd nations with vats use the consumption type the consumption vat is the type usually advocated for th is country indee d most vat advocates intend to shift tax burdens from capital in come to consumption furthermore consumption vat is simpler to compute because firms do not have to separate expenditures for capital from other expenditures methods of calculating vat there are three alternative methods of calculating vat the credit method the subtraction method nd the addition method8 under the creditinvoice method firm would be required to show vat separately on all sales invoices9 each sale would be marked up by the amount of the vat sales invoice for seller is purchase invoice for buyer firm would calculate the vat to be remitted to the government by threestep process fi rst the firm would aggregate vat shown on its sales invoices second the firm w ould aggregate vat shown on its purchase invoices finally aggregate vat on purch ase invoices would be subtracted from aggregate vat shown on sales invoices and the difference remitted to the government the creditinvoice method is calculated on transactions basis under the subtraction method the firm calculates its va lue added by subtracting its cost of taxed inputs from its sales ne xt the firm determines its vat liability by multiplying its value added by the vat rate10 most flat tax proposals are modified subtraction method vats under the addition method the firm calculates its value added by adding all payments for untaxed inputs eg wages and profits next the firm multiplies its value added by the vat rate to calculate vat to be remitted to the government the creditinvoice method is used by 28 of 29 oecd nations with vats tax economists differ in their classifications of the japanese vat both the credit invoice and the subtraction methods have b een discussed for the united states the prevailing view of economists is that th creditinvoice method is superior this method requires registered firm s to maintain detailed reco rds that are cross indexed with supporting documentation vat show n on the sales invoice of one firm is the same as the vat shown on the purchase or der of another firm hence the credit invoice method allows tax auditors to cro ss check the records of firms also each firm has vested interest in insuring that the vat shown on its purchase orders is not understated so the firm can receive full credit against vat liability for vat previously paid thus the creditinvoice thod would seem to be easier to enforce also the creditinvoice method is probably the only feasible method if there are to be multiple tax rateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33619crs4 supporters of the subtraction method maintain that it would have low compliance costs because all necessary data could be obtained from records kept by firm for other purposes still firm would have to make calculations based on these data for example deductible expe nses would have to be separated from nondeductible expenses and so data expressed on an accrual basis would have to be converted to cash flow basis the creditinvoice method would have substantial compliance costs b ecause the amount of vat would have to be shown on every sales invoice and conversely on every purchase invoice on the plus side however the creditinvoice method would yield an additional data base to firms some firms might find these additional data useful in decision making for exam ple records of purchase invoices and sales invoices may improve some firms control over their inventories compliance costs of the creditinvoice method mig ht be partially offset by the value of the vat data base to firms but this va lue has never been quantified the creditinvoice method would have gr eater administrative costs than the subtraction method because of its requireme nts for additional data computations and recordkeeping although there are data on the administrative costs of vat calculated by the creditinvoice method em pirical data are not available on the subtraction method conseque ntly quantitative comparison of costs currently is not feasible the subtraction method would not work administratively if many goods are exempt or if multiple tax rates are levied unless specified otherwise this report will assume that the creditinvoice method is us ed and that the vat is the consumption type exemption versus zerorating none of the vat proposals would require all firms to collect the vat the two fundamental methods of giving special tax trea tment to businesse s in an industry under vat are exemption and zerorating an exempt business would not collect vat on its sales and would not receive credit for vat paid on its purchases of inputs an exempt business would not register with tax authorities and consequently would not be part of the vat system hence an exempt business would not have the usual vat compliance costs and would not impose administrative costs on the government xcept verification of its exemption of course an exempt businesss costs however include any tax paid on inputs because it receives credit for previously paid taxes zerorated business would not collect vat on its sales but would receive credit for vat paid on its inputs this is equivalent to the business being charged zero tax rate zerorated business would be registered taxpayer and consequently would involve the usual compliance and administrative costs zero rated business however would receive refund of any vat paid on its inputs so its costs would not include vat paid at earlier stages the effects on final prices and total vat collected by the government caused by exempting or zerorating firms would vary with the stage of production an exempt retailer would not charge any vat on its sales but it would not receive any credit for vat previously paid on its inputs so its price to the finalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33619crs5 11 table b1 in appendix b summarizes the selective economic effects of exemption and zerorating which were discussed in this sectionconsumer would include all vat paid ex cept that on its own valueadded the government would have collected tax on all the value added in the product except the retailers zerorated retailer would not charge any vat on its sales but it would receive credit for all vat previously paid on its inputs zerorated retailer would not remit vat to the government but it w ould receive refund for vat previously paid by suppliers hence the price of the commodity would not include any vat and the government would receive revenue exempting or zerorating retailer would not affect the linkage or chain of vat collections and credits between differe nt stages of production because retailers are the final stage of production and dist ribution but exempting or zerorating an intermediate stage such as manufacturing of wholesaling would break the chain between firms at differe nt stages of production exempting however causes far more serious break than zerorating for example an exempt manufacturer would not collect vat on sales to wholesaler and would not receive credit for vat paid on i nputs nonexempt wholesaler would not receive credit for the vat paid on the manufacturers inputs included in the price it paid the manufacturer but the wholesaler would remit vat collected on all of its sales so some of the value added in the product would be taxed twice consequently exempting manufacturer or any other intermediate producer would increase total vat collected by the government and the final retail price of the commodity zerorated manufacturer would not collect vat on sales but would receive credit for vat paid on inputs the price pa id by the wholesaler therefore would contain vat the nonexempt wholesaler would collect vat on sales and would not be eligible for any vat credits but the total vat at that point would exactly equal what it would have been had there b een untaxed stage subsequent stages of production would charge vat on sales nd would receive credit for vat paid on inputs as though there had been break in the chain hence zerorating manufacturer or other intermediate stage would change neither total vat remitted nor the retail price on the commodity11 if both zerorated firms and exempt firms operate at the same level of production in the same industry the ze rorated firms would have competitive advantage because their costs ar less by the amount of the vat policy makers may be faced with decision to either zerorate or exempt particular product zerorating is desirable when the objective is to exclude the consumption of the product completely from tax where an exemption is warranted when it is nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33619crs6 12 john f due some unresolved issues in design and implementation of valueadded taxes

practice and problems washington international monetary fund 1988 p 56 14 us congressional budget office effects of adopting valueadded tax washington continuedregarded as feasible or desirable to tax the activity but some tax on final consumption is considered desirable there are two major objections to exemption first cascading results as the exempt firms and their business customers cannot receive input tax credit secondly firms producing both exempt nd taxable including zerorated items must allocate inputs between exempt nd nonexempt categories and this is difficult to accomplish in any nonarbitrary way and to control12 revenue yield in estimating vats revenue yield ec onomists and public officials use the operating assumption that vat would be fully shifted to final consumers in the form of higher prices of goods vat or any other major tax increase would have contractionary effect on the economy unl ess offset by othe r economic policies consequently revenue estima is generally made unde r the assumption that the federal reserve would use an expansiona ry monetary policy to neutralize the contractionary effects of vat also revenue estimate does not take into account the possible shifts in consumption patterns that might be expected if some items are taxed and others are excluded from taxation the potential revenue per 1 rate from vat would vary with the comprehensiveness of the tax base broadbased vat would have limited exclusions while narrowbased vat would have numerous exclusions obviously the broader the tax base the lower the tax rate necessary to raise given amount of revenue furthermore the broader the vat base the more efficient it is the exclusion of goods from taxation changes their prices relative to taxed goods changes in relative prices cause economic distortions consumers tend to substitute lower priced goods for higherpriced goods there are three primary justifications for excluding specific items from taxation under vat13 first the vat would be difficult to collect because sellers of some types of goods and services could easily avoid reporting their sales for example vat would be difficult to collect on ex penditures for domestic services and expenditures abroad by us residents second some goods are excluded on equity grounds since these goods claim disproportiona tely large percentages of the incomes of lowerincome families data on spending patterns do not however suggest that exclusions can have very powerful effect on the distribution of vat14 thirdhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33619crs7 14 continued us

generated concerns among some that vat revenues may finance larger public sect or the issue of vat and the size of government is examined in later section of this report international comparison of

eu21 sweden norway icela nd and switzerla nd had retail sales taxes at the national level but eventually switched to vat22 according to the oecd the spread of value added tax also called goods and services tax gst has been the most important development in taxation over the last halfcentury limited to less than 10 countries in the late 1960s it has now been implemented by about 136 countries and in these countries including oecd member countries it typically accounts for onefifth of total tax revenue the recognized capacity of vat to raise revenue in neutral and transparent manner drew all oecd member countries except the unite d states to adopt this broad based consumption tax23 policy insights can be obtained by exa mining the experiences of other nations however just because other nations exhibit specific tax policy does not necessarily mean that it is appropriate for the unite d states to adopt th is policy economic analysis of optimal taxation suggests that those choices depend on issues of efficiency equity and administrative and compliance costs and should be made in the context of the overall tax and spending structure th considerations may vary from one country to another equity major topic concerning any proposed ta x or tax change is the distribution or equity of the tax among households ther are two types of equity vertical and horizontal vertical equity concerns the tax treatment of house holds with different abilitiestopay horizontal equity concerns the degree to which households with the same abilitytopay are taxed equally both vertical and horizontal equity may be affected by the measure of abilitytopay and the tax period abilitytopay the most common measure of abilitytopay is income24 proponents of income as measure of abilitytopay argue that sa ving yields utility by providing households with greater economic security federal data are more readily available on different measures of income than different levels of consumption for example the federal government reports levels of disposable income whic h equals consumption plushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33619crs9 25 for comprehensive analysis of the vertical equity of vat see

of adopting valueadded tax pp 3147saving thus tax economists can more easily calculate tax incidence if income instead of consumption is the measure of abilitytopay some arguments for the consumptio n tax base suggest that personal consumption is the best measure of ability topay because consumption is the actual taking of scarce resources from the economic system some economists argue that consumption may be better proxy for perman ent income than is current income see discussion below time period tax incidence usually is measured by using oneyear period data on consumption and income are readily available in oneyear increments and the concept of oneyear period is easily understood bu t many economists be lieve tax incidence is more accurately determined by measuring consumption and income over households lifetime li fetime income and consumption ar affected by the life cycle concept and transitional compone nts of income according to this life cycle concept household makes current consumption deci sions based on its expected future flow of income averaging its consumption over its lifetime for example common life cycle is low income in the households early years high income in the households middle ears and low income in the households retirement years young household may sa ve small percentage of its income in order to acquire consumer durables in its middle years this household may save high percentage of its income while its income is highest finally during its retirement years this househol d may save small percentage of its income in order to maintain its consumption level thus annual consump tion tends to be more stable than annual income over the households life cycle although many economists prefer the c oncept of lifetime in come federal data are not collected on lifetime basis c onsequently economists have developed life cycle models in an attempt to measure equity but the distributional results from these models are subject to widespread debate vertical equity25 if disposable income over oneyear period is the measure of abilitytopay then vat would be viewed as extremely regressive that is the percentage of disposable income paid in vat would decrease rapidly as disposable income increases in most discussions of ta x policy both oneyear period and annual disposable income or some other annual income measure are used consequently the vat is viewed as being extremely regressive for example cbo calculated the annual incidence of 35 broadbased vat for 1992 cbo found that all families would have paid 22 of their income in vat the

the fourth quintile and 15 on the highest quintile26 if disposable income over lifetime is the measure of abilitytopay vat would be mildly regressive for lower and middleincome households it appears that nearly all savings are eventually consumed27 thus it may be that for the vast majority of households life time consumption and lifetim income are approximately equal highincome households tend to have net savings over their lifetimes consequently they would pay lower propor tion of their disposable incomes in vat than would lowerincome groups but these highly stylized lifecycle models are controversial28 if consumption is used as measure of abilitytopay singlerate vat with broad base would be appr oximately proportional regard less of the time period in other words the percentage of consump tion paid in vat by households would be approximately cons tant as the level of hous ehold consumption rises another equity issue concerns the burde n of vat on different age groups if older individuals on the average consum more out of savings than younger individuals then vat would fall more heavily on the old than the young conversely an increase in the personal income tax would fall more heavily on the young than the old policy options to alleviate regressivity some supporters of progressive taxati on oppose the vat primarily because they believe that it is regressive mechanism is likely to introduce progressivity at higher income levels but critics are esp ecially concerned about the absolute burden of vat on lowincome households the degree of regressivity on lowerincome households however can be reduced by gove rnment policy th ree oftenmentioned policies are exclusions and multiple rates income tax credits and earmarking of some revenues for increased social spending including indexed transfer payments exclusions and multiple rates the incidence of the vat depends on its tax base therefore the regressivity of the vat can be reduced or eliminated by

politically popular at the state level all members of the european union eu exclude some goods from vat on equity grounds also most eu nations have multiple tax rates on equity grounds reduced rates are applied to necessities and premium rates are levied on luxuries despite the existing policies in the eu most tax economists oppose exclusions and multiple rates to reduce regressivity for three reasons first the administrative costs compliance costs and neutrality costs are substantial29 if vat is to raise given amount of revenue then revenue lost from excluding goods must be offset by higher vat rates these higher rates increase the distortion in relative prices and consequently reduce the neutrality of the tax system second the possible reduction in regressivity from exclusion and multiple rates is declining because consumption patterns for different income levels are becoming more similar30 third for one year time period the reduction in regressivity is limited pa rticularly for lowincome households money saved for exclusions is largely offset by higher tax rates needed for revenue neutrality on taxed goods31 tax credits the federal government could allow either flat tax credit or credit that diminishes as income rises in order to overcome the regressivity of vat this credit method could be operated in two ways fi rst an individual could apply the credit against his federal income tax liability thus lowering his liability on dollarfordollar basis if the tax cred it exceeded the individuals tax liability he could apply for refund of the excess cred it taxpayer already due tax refund could increase the size of his refund by th amount of the tax credit household not subject to income taxation could apply fo r tax refund equal to the credit an income tax credit that declines as income increases could reduce regressivity more sharply than flat income tax credit second standalone credit system could be established which would not require an eligible household to file an income tax return in order to obtain refund for vat paid an eligible household would have to submit simple form in order to receive refund standalone credit system may be more

compliance with eitc provisions has been an ongoing issue34 earmarking of vat revenues third option to reduce or eliminate regressivity is to earmark some of the revenue from vat to finance an increase in income tested transfers aaron estimated that an increase in benefits of approximately 5 billion for vat yieldi ng 100 billion could fully protect low income families from paying the vat35 for example 10 percent increase in food stamp entitlements would approximately offset the effect on households eligible for the full food stamp allotment of vat that raised 100 billion in revenue this estimate is based on the fact that 100 billion will be approximately three percent of consumption in 1989 and that food is estimated to absorb about 30 percent of the budget in estimates of poverty thresholds36 many households with low taxable inco mes do not currently receive transfers and would not be protect ed by aarons proposal horizontal equity if disposable income is the measure of abilitytopay the horizontal equity of vat would depend on the time period for oneyear period vat would be very inequitable because households with th same level of dis posable income would have widely differing leve ls of consumption and cons equently payments of vat for lifetime period the vat would have high degree of horizontal equity for low and middleincome households almo st all income is consumed over these households lifetimes conse quently households with th same lifetime incomeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33619crs13 37 henry j aaron the valueadded tax sorting through the practical and political problems the brookings review summer 1988 p 13 38 in economics leisure is any time spent not workingwould have the same leve ls of consumption and the same vat payments37 over their lifetimes highincome households with equal incomes differ in their levels of consumption and consequently vat paymen ts for example assume that two households have 10 million in lifetime income but the first household spends 45 million on consumption and the second household spends 9 million on consumption the second household would pa twice as much in vat as the first household thus for lifetime period the vat is not horizontally equitable for highincome households neutrality in public finance the more neutral is tax the less the tax affects private economic decisions and conse quently the more efficient is the operation of the economy conceptually vat on all consum ption expenditures with single rate that is constant over time would be relatively neutral compared to other major revenue sources for households two out of three major d ecisions would not be altered by this hypothetical vat first this vat would not alter choices among goods because all would be taxed at th same rate thus relative prices would not change in contrast other taxes such as excise taxes wh ich change relative prices would distort household consumer choices by encouragin g the substitution of untaxed goods for taxed goods but hypothetical income ta x on all income would be neutral in this respect second vat does not affect the relative prices of present and future consumption in contrast the individual income tax affects the relative prices of present and future consumption because the income tax is levied on income which is saved and then the re turns on saving are taxed households workleisure decision howev er would be affected by vat or any other tax on either consumption or income38 since leisure would not be taxed any tax increase would fall on the returns to work vat would have conflicting effects on the number of hours worked by each household household would have an in centive to substitute leisure for work because of the relative rise in the valu of leisure to work substitution effect conversely household would have an in centive to increase its hours worked in an attempt to maintain its current living standards income effect thus vat could decrease increase or not ch ange households hours worked for firm the vat would not affect d ecisions concerning method of financing debt or equity choice among inputs unl ess some suppliers are exempt or

more of these types of decisions but vat cannot be levied on all cons umer goods consequently prices of taxed goods will rise relative to untaxed goods furthermore most nations with vats have more than one rate39 multiple vat rates alter relative prices of taxed goods finally vat rates in most nations have tended to rise over time despite these deviations from pure form of vat broadbased vat is relatively neutral compared to most other taxes this neutrality is greater if the tax rate is relatively low but the relative neutrality of vat compared to an increase in the personal income tax is uncertain40 inflation if the federal reserve implemented an expansionary monetary policy to offset the contractionary effects of vat then there would be onetime increase in the price level for example an expansionary monetary policy to accommodate 5 vat on 60 of consumer outlays might directly cause an estimated onetime increase in consumer prices of approx imately 3 there would also be some secondary price effects some goods woul d rise in price because their factors of production especially labor are linked to price indexes ye t if the federal reserve disregarded these secondary price increases in formula ting monetary policy these secondary price increases would tend to be ffset by price reducti ons in other sectors of the economy an examination of vats in the oecd has found only an initial effect of vat on the price level but it is difficult to empirically isolate the effect of vat from other possible causes of change in the price level it has been suggested that the federa l government exclude the vat from price indexes hence existing indexing w ould not have an inflationary effect41 but such an approach might prove unpopular nd it might be contested in court in summary the proper monetary accommodation for vat would probably cause onetime increase in the price level but not affect the subsequent rate of inflation ie cause continual incr eases in the general price levelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33619crs15 balanceoftrade currently all nations with vats zero rate exports and impose their vats on imports this procedure for taxing trade flows is referred to as the destination principle because commodity is taxed at the location of consumption rather than production an alternative would be to apply the origin principle by having all nations levy their vats on exports but not imports all experts on the vat recommend that nations adopting vat use th destination principle in order to be consistent with existing pr actices of other countries the destination principle creates level playing field because imported commodities rise in price by the percentage of the vat but exported commodities do not increase in price for partic ular nation the vat rate on domestically produced and imported products would be the same th vat rate on particular good would still vary among nations simple example demonstrates this concept of level playing field assume nation has 10 vat and nation b s 20 vat exports from nation to nation b would not be taxed by nation but nation b would levy 20 vat on imports from nation thus consum ers in nation b would pay 20 vat regardless of whether their purchased g oods were domestically produced or imported furthermore exports from nation b to na tion would not be taxed by nation b nation would levy 10 vat on imports hence consumers in nation would pay 10 vat on both domestically produced and imported commodities in 1962 the rules applicable to taxation were included in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt under th gatt rules indirect taxes were rebatable on exports but direct taxes were not rebatable taxes which are not shifted but borne by the economic entity on which they are levied are classified as direct taxes from 1962 through 1972 fixed exch ange rate system prevailed and the united states ran deficits in its balanceofpayments us officials complained that the gatt rules favored nations with vats because their exports were zerorated in contrast corporate income ta xes were not rebated on exports in early 1973 the united states and its ma jor trading partners formally shifted to flexible exchange rate system under this system the supply and demand for different currencies determine their relative value if country has deficit in its balanceoftrade this defic it must be financed by net importation of foreign capital but net capital inflows cannot continue indefinitely t hus over time this countrys currency will tend to decline in value relative to the currencies of other nations consequently this countrys balanceoftra deficit will eventually decline as its exports rise and imports fall hence economic theory indicated that vat offers advantage over other major taxes in reduc ing deficit in the balanceoftrade thus us officials ended their complain ts about the effects of gatt tax rules on international trade since early 1973 there have been peri ods when

advantage over other major tax increases in reducing the us balanceoftrade deficit any large us tax increase which reduces the federal deficit could reduce the us balanceoftrade deficit the u s treasury would reduce its borrowing on financial markets interest rates would d ecline and foreign capital would flow out of the united states this capital outflow would reduce the demand for dollars

second issue concerns the effect on th personal savings ra of levying vat compared to increasing income taxes vat would tax savings when they are spent on consumption allowing savings to compound at pretax rate but an income tax is levied on all income at the time it is earned regardless of whether the income is consumed or saved the income tax is also levied on the earnings from income saved conseque ntly some proponents of the vat have argued that choosing vat rather than an income tax to raise revenue would increase the return from saving and conseque ntly raise the savings rate the rate of return on savings howev er has never been shown to have significant effect on the savings rate because of two conflicting effects first each dollar saved today results in the possibility of higher amount of consumption in the future this relative increase in the re turn from saving causes household to want to substitute saving for consumption out of current income substitution effect but higher rate of return on savings raises households income consequently the household s to save less to accumulate some target amount of savings in the future income effect thus this income effect encourages households to have higher current c onsumption and lower current savinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33619crs17 43 crs report 88697 s economic effects of valuea dded tax on capital formation by

method offers the opportunity to crosscheck returns and invoices fo r example vat shown on sales invoice of wholesaler will appear on the purchase invoice of retailer tax auditor can examine both invoices to crosscheck the accuracy of the tax returns of both the wholesaler and the retailer second each firm has an incentive not to allow suppliers to understate vat on their sales i nvoices firm is ab to credit vat paid on inputs against vat collected on sales consequently firms net vat liability will increase if vat shown on its purchase invoices was understated by suppliers third tax auditors can compare information about vat with information about business income taxation which w ill increase compliance with both types of taxes for example the sales revenue fi gure reported on busine ss income tax forms may be checked for consistency with gross vat collected as shown on vat forms also check of cash receipts during vat audit may identify the under reporting of sales firms

many states already levy for example the federal g overnment levied the personal income tax after many states had already imposed this tax also both the federal government and the states impose many of the same excise taxes the federal government relies primarily on income taxes but taxation of income by states has risen steadily over the years60 for fy2003 333 of state tax collections consisted

accounted for 338 of state taxes collected62 hence it can be argued that the states have encroached on the primary source of revenue of the federal government states could continue to levy their retail sales taxes while the federal government levies vat in canada the federal government vies vat and the provinces continue to collect their retail sales taxes joint collection states could piggyback on federal vat to do this states would have to replace their retail sales taxes with vat and adopt the federa l tax base because federal vat would probably have broader base than any state

assumption is made that the raw material producer provides all of his own inputs the raw material producer has sales of 200 plus vat on sales of 20 10 of 200 sales plus vat equal 220 200 20 because
