unsteady progress toward democratization according to many international observers these observers including international organizations such as the council of europe coe the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and the european union eu and some governments including the united states had viewed armenias previous legislative and presidential elections in 2003 as not free and fair1 these observers cautioned the armenian government that the conduct of the may 2007 legislative election would be taken into account in future relations 1 in the may 2003 legislative election 75 of 131 deputies were elected by party lists and the rest by constituencies in the party list voting six out of 21 parties running passed 5 vote hurdle and won seats in both votes the republican party

may 2007 legislative race included constitutional amendments approved in november 2005 which strengthened the role of the legislature including giving it responsibility for appointing some judicial and media regulatory personnel and voice in appointing prime minister2 amendments to the election law increased the legislative term from four to five years and restricted voting by citizens who were outside the country at the time of elections in may 2006 the rule of law party left the ruling government coalition and joined the opposition leaving the remaining coalition members the republican party of armenia and the armenian revolutionary federation in strengthened position new party formed in 2004 the prosperous armenia party led by businessman gagik tsarukyan seemed to gain substantial popularity in march 2007 prime minister margoyan died and president kocharyan appointed thendefense minister serzh sargisyan as the new prime minister sargisyans leadership of the republican party of armenia placed him at the forefront of the partys campaign for seats the campaign the central electoral commission cec of armenia followed an inclusive policy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22675 and registered 23 parties and one electoral bloc impeachment on april 4 for the proportional part of the legislative election in the constituency races the cec registered 119 candidates in seven constituencies candidates ran unopposed campaigning began on april 8 and ended on may 10 the panarmenian national movement the party of former president levon terpetrossyan dropped out in late april and called for other opposition parties to follow suit to reduce the number of such parties competing for votes another formerly prominent party the national democratic union headed by vazgen manukyan refused to take part in what it claimed would be fraudulent election the political campaign was mostly calm exceptions included explosions at offices of the prosperous armenia party on april 11 the arrest of two members of the opposition civic disobedience movement on money laundering charges on may 7 and the use of police force against marchers from the impeachment bloc on may 9 which resulted in some injuries armenian media reported that kocharyan accused artur baghdasaryan the head of the rule of law party of betrayal for allegedly discussing with british diplomat how the west might critique the election under the electoral law the parties and candidates received free air time for campaign messages except for these opportunities the main public and private television channels mostly covered progovernment party campaigning and private billboard companies mostly sold space to these parties the public radio station appeared editorially balanced positive or neutral reports dominated in the media according to oscecoeeu election observers most campaigning appeared to stress personalities rather than programs according to 2 coe european commission for democracy through law

developing the democratic functioning of armenias institutions if it is effectively implemented honoring of obligations and commitments by armenia january 23 2007 crs3 many observers to the extent

the osce coe and the eu the legislative elections demonstrated improvement and were conducted largely in accordance with international standards for democratic elections they praised an inclusive candidate registration process dynamic campaigning in permissive environment extensive media coverage and calm atmosphere in polling places however they raised some concerns over progovernment party domination of electoral commissions the low number of candidates in constituency races and inaccurate campaign finance disclosures observers also reported few instances of voters apparently using fraudulent passports for identification of votebuying and of individuals voting more than once in followon assessment the oscecoeeu observers raised more concerns that votecounting problems could harm public confidence in the results5 3 osceodihr election observation mission interim report 3 april 18 may 2 2007 2 march 29 april 17 2007 1 march 21 march 28 2007 needs assessment mission report

of some formerly prominent opposition parties to win seats raises questions of their future viability these include the peoples party of armenia led by demirchyan the runnerup in the 2003 presidential election the national unity party led by artashes geghamyan and the republic party led by aram sargisyan while the progovernment republican party of armenia and prosperous armenia party argued that the losing parties sealed their own marginalization because they were not attractive to the electorate the losing parties responded that they were outspent and hurt by voter apathy and electoral fraud6 at rally on may 18 the two opposition parties that won seats in the legislature rule of law and heritage joined the impeachment bloc and other opposition parties to call on the constitutional court to void the election the panarmenian national movement which had dropped out the race issued statement alleging that sophisticated methods had been used to rig the vote addressing such accusations cec spokesperson tsovinar khachatrian reportedly gave assurances that the vote count and results were normal she stated that the cec had received only seven complaints and that recounts had resulted in essential changes in the results7 armenian media reported on may httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22675 21 that four cases had resulted in criminal charges but only one involved the falsification of the election results by polling place workers the impeachment bloc and other opposition parties held more rallies on may 25 and june 1 to demand new election implications for armenia since president kocharyan is constitutionally limited to two terms the parties showing well in the legislative election are expected to be best poised to put forth their candidates for presidential election in 2008 the republican party of armenias strong showing places prime minister sargisyan as the front runner for president if he chooses to run8 according to analyst emil danielyan opposition parties may counter by appealing to the cynicism of many armenians about the electoral results and by urging them to support alternative presidential candidates9 some observers suggest that the opposition parties may again fail to cooperate and instead put forward multiple presidential candidates fracturing the opposition vote the election also may be more significant than previous ones because the legislature has been given enhanced constitutional powers according to some observers in calling for the election of progovernment legislators kocharyan warned on may 10 that it is 5 continued 22 2007 the observers tentatively concluded that the final tally of the proportional vote did not appear to affect the election outcome as calculated in the preliminary results but that lack of transparency prevented similar conclusion for the constituency vote 6 natalia leshchenko election 2007 armenia passes electoral test as managed democracy global insight may 14 2007 7 eurasia

run for president cedr april 27 2007 doc cep21006 9 eurasia insight may 15 2007 crs5 important that the new parliament and the president cooperate and that these two state institutions do not confront each other or otherwise the countrys citizens will suffer since the republican party of armenia increased its number of seats to nearmajority in the legislature and the opposition parties lost seats it is unlikely that the domestic and foreign policies of the government will change greatly according to many observers10 there conceivably could be some changes in some policies however as the republican party of armenia seeks to form coalition government reasons for the republican party of armenia to seek coalition rather than form oneparty government include increasing its legislative support and influence in the runup to the presidential race other spurs to forming such coalition may include the plans by the rule of law and heritage parties to use their presence in the legislature to challenge government policies rather than to repeat the failed past opposition strategy of boycotting the legislature such plans may reinforce kocharyans reported view that these parties are not constructive opposition parties and that they need to be countered by legislative coalition11 some observers warn that kocharyan as lameduck president may become less influential in armenian politics and that he and sargisyan could come to clash on personnel and policy issues in coming months other observers suggest that both leaders httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22675 who are comradesinarms of the conflict over azerbaijans breakaway region of nagorno karabakh will cooperate to achieve their future political goals which conceivably might include position for kocharyan in political party or potential sargisyan administration kocharyan and sargisyan may cooperate in negotiations with azerbaijan to settle the nagorno karabakh conflict possibly because sargisyan administration might have responsibility for implementing potential settlement another possible clash between sargisyan and tsarukyan may be mitigated to some degree through powersharing negotiations on forming coalition government russia appeared interested in the outcome of the election by stressing its good relations with the existing armenian government during the height of campaigning in april the russian minister of foreign affairs the first deputy prime minister and other highlevel officials visited armenia group of election observers from the commonwealth of independent states judged the election as free and fair12 european institutions such as the osce coe and the eu appeared poised to accept the electoral outcome as being sufficiently progressive to bolster their assistance and other ties to armenia according to some initial statements the eu council president german chancellor anela merkel seemed to typify this stance when she stated that the elections were on the whole conducted fairly freely and largely in accordance with the international commitments which armenia had entered into and that she was very much in favor of intensifying cooperation with armenia this would breathe new life into the european neighborhood policy and the action plan agreed under it13 10 the constitution specifies that the government resigns when the new legislature convenes the prime minister is appointed by the president after consultation with the legislature and the appointee should enjoy the confidence of majority or the largest number of the deputies providing for party influence 11

interests the bush administration generally viewed the armenian legislative election as marking progress in democratization the us state department reported on may 14 that all and all the armenian election was an improvement over past elections though certainly if you look at what the observers said it did not fully meet international standards while praising the electoral progress the state department also urged the armenian government to aggressively investigate allegations that are there of electoral wrongdoing and prosecute people in accordance with armenian law14 armenias election may rank it with georgia as making progress in democratization in the south caucasus region according to some observers under this view democratization facilitates cooperation so more democratic armenia might be able to deepen ties with nearby nato members in the wider black sea region in the caspian sea region it might serve as an exemplar to local democracy advocates progress in elections

market economies when armenia and the united states concluded compact for 23565 million in mca assistance in march 2006 armenias low standing on political rights as scored by the mca was raised as problem that needed to be addressed following the latest election armenias previous failing score on political rights may be higher if initial election assessments do not fundamentally change bolstering its qualifications as an mca copartner in development according to some observers15 congressional concerns many in congress have supported democratization efforts in armenia as indicated by hearings and legislation including by backing 225 million in cumulative budgeted foreign assistance for democratization about 13 percent of all aid to armenia from fy1992 through fy2006 after the most recent election representatives frank pallone and joe knollenberg cochairs of the congressional armenia caucus sent letter on may 18 2007 to president kocharyan and prime minister sargisyan congratulating armenia on its free and fair election cycle on the house floor representative pallone hailed the first positive assessment of an election in armenia since its independence and stated that it would enhance usarmenia ties and armenias international reputation he also stated that the election demonstrated the effectiveness of us democratization aid and called on millennium challenge
