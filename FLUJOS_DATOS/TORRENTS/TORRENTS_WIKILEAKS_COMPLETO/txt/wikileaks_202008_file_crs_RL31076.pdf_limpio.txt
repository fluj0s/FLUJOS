science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076china selected environmental issues and policies summary chinas robust economic growth in the past two decades has resulted in serious and widespread environmental degradation and pollution over this period china has changed from predominant ly rural economy to much more industrialized and urbanized economy the countrys large population coupled with rapid growth has greatly increased chinas demand for and consum ption of energy water and other natural resources air and water pollution have become severe in many regions and the resulting impacts on resources public health and quality of life are increasingly seen by many chinese officials as threat to gains made in economic development since the 1980s the government has adopted dozens of pollution control and resource management laws and regulations although implementation and enforcement have been problematic as environmental degradation worse ned in the 1990s china accel erated efforts to address pollution problems for human health environmental and economic reasons the governm ents pollution control initiatives have targeted water pollution from industrial and municipal sources and air pollution from various sources including industry power plants coal mines and households in the 1990s the government closed thousands of inefficient polluting factories and small coal mines and power plants strengthened some laws and their enforcement and increased spending on pollution control projects as motor vehicles have become an increasing source of air pollution they too are becoming subject to regulation globally china currently ranks second only to the united states in both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions the government has not focused on greenhouse gas reductions in their own right but on regrets strategies to reduce energy consumption and control pollution chinas greenhouse gas emissions declined significantly in 1998 and 1999 for various reasons including this strategy moreover major success of chinas recent development is that its energy demand recently has grown less rapidly than gdp like the united states china has ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change and has signed but not ratified the kyoto protocol the united states and china have numerous cooperative environmental agreements in place and both the us government and the private sector continue to follow environmental conditions in china with interest and concern as chinas environmental problems are linked with global concerns and as the chinese pollution control efforts create large potential market for us exports although chinas environmental problems remain challenging some significant progress has been made the world bank recently reported that chinas effort to reduce pollution has staved off an abrupt worsening of environmental conditions in general and that its achievements are arguably unprecedente d in any country at chinas state of economic development however the bank and others also anticipate that the environmental challenge facing china is likely to become far greater and more complex over the next decade as growth continues while economic growth will remain the top priority for the government it now appears that environmental issues will be an increasingly prominent concern as well

introduction chinas rapid economic growth in the past two decades has not come without costs particularly in the area of environmental quality and public health over this period china has changed from predominantly rural economy to much more industrial ized and urbanized economy the countrys rapid economic growth has markedly increased chinas demand for and consumption of energy water and other natural resources air and water pollution have become severe in many regions and the resulting impacts on resources public health and overall quality of life are increasingly seen by chinese officials as threat to gains made in economic development state environment officials and researchers recently estimated that the cost of pollution to chinas economy may range from 4 to 8 of gross domestic product gdp other cost estimates have been higher1 in light of these circumstances chinese officials have stressed the need to reduce pollution and improve resource management with goal of making chinas development sustainable since the 1980s the central government has adopted numerous pollution control and resource management laws and regulations in the 1990s the government closed thousands of inefficient polluting factories and small coal mines and power plants strengthened laws and their enforcement and increased spending on pollution control projects additionally environmental protection was raised to the status of national fundamental policy and in 1998 the state environmental protection administration sepa was elevated to ministerial status2 other efforts being pursued to reduce environmental degradation include the adoption of policies to achieve more efficient energy production encourage cleaner production methods and improve the conservation and management of water and other natural resources expenditures on environme ntal protection have increased signifi cantly since the mid1990s and chinas environment minister xie zhenhua recently reported that total investment in environmental protection increased 288 last year to 11 of gdp3 government projections indicate that environmental expenditures are likely to continue to grow significantly over the next 5 years httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs2 notwith standing government officials growing commitment to environmental protecti on china faces environmental and economic development challenges on an immense scale with population exceeding 125 billion and with the annual percapita income of rural chinese at roughly 250 economic development remains the key priority for chinese leaders the environmental challenge china faces is how to continue its economic growth without endangering the sustainability of that growth and the health of its citizens this report finds that chinese officials are increasingly recognizing the need to deal with this challenge and although successes can be found there are many remaining challenges the scale of chinas environmental problems and the countrys efforts to address them are of interest to the united states and other nations for various reasons perhaps primarily because of chinas potential impact on the global environment through its increasing air pollution and projected growth in carbon dioxide emissions and because of its continuing loss of arable land and growing demand for natural resources moreover as china more aggressively addresses its air and water pollution problems it presents potentially large market for pollution control and energy efficient technologies and services this report provides an overview of chinas air and water pollution problems and associated environmental and public health impacts with attention also to the implications of chinas growing energy needs and the issue of global climate change it also reviews chinas policies and laws to address pollution problems and discusses opportunities for and examples of uschina cooperation on these matters multilateral cooperation and assistance on environmental pollution matters are also discussed finally the report briefly looks at environmental technology issues and chinas initiatives to reduce pollution in the power generation automobile industrial and municipal sectors and mentions opportunities for and obstacles to us companies to participate in chinas growing environmental technology market this report focuses primarily on selected major pollution issues that have played key roles in increasing the priority of environment on the national agenda it does not attemp t the much larger task of comprehensively addressing the full array of environmental issues many equally challenging such as toxic waste pesticide concerns waste disposal and others further it does not attempt to cover natural resource issues such as deforestation agriculture and desertification it should be noted that the emissions data and other environmental information reported here are based often on rough estimates or limited monitoring common situation worldwide obtaining rigorous reliable and consiste nt environmental data remains difficult moreover environmental conditions and government monitoring and regulatory actions in china have been in considerable flux in recent years consequently sources used for this paper have reported sometimes seemingly divergent observations and information however the available inform ation does provide broad picture of environmental conditions and of the governments policies and initiatives to address them air pollution overview perhaps more than any other pollution problem air quality concerns may have elevated environmental regulation on the national agenda in china many of chinas cities and rural areas are often cloaked in haze of polluted air and several of the worlds

china4 number of factors contribute to the countrys severe air pollution problems key among these are chinas rapid growth and industrialization its large population and rising incomes its heavy reliance on coal burning as an energy source and its relatively inefficient although improving energy use additionally vehicle emissions which were not significant until recently have become major source of air pollution in large cities and are increasing rapidly because of the adverse impacts on public health quality of life and economic development air pollution problems have prompted broad range of government actions that have led to some notable improvements in recent years nonetheless substantial challenges remain according to chinas state environmental protection administration sepa coal burning is the primary cause of air pollution in china5 with major pollutants of governmental concern and attention being total suspended particulates tsp eg soot dust and fine particles and sulfur dioxide so 2 both of which are important causes of respiratory illnesses coal burning is estimated to account for 70 of the smoke and dust in the air and 90 of the sulfur dioxide emissions in major cities tsp and sulfur dioxide levels were 2 to 5 times the world health organizations whos guidelines in 19956 in 1998 nearly onethird of 322 cities monitored in china exceeded the who guideline for sulfur dioxide and only 1 in 20 cities met the who guideline for total suspended particulates7 coal burning in industrial boilers and small household stoves is responsible for large portion of particulates especially those most damaging to health these inefficient boilers and stoves also are responsible for most so 2 and nitrogen dioxide 2 emissions8 in northern china where coal has been used for residential space heating particulate pollution has been especially severe according to 1997 world bank report household stoves accounted for just 15 of coal use in the mid1990s but were the source of 30 of air pollution in chinese cities similarly industrial boilers consumed 33 of the nations coal but accounted for an even larger percentage of pollution9 as result of its coal consumption china has become the worlds top emitter of sulfur dioxide which is key cause of acid precipitation in addition to local adverse public health and welfare effects of so2 emissions acid precipitation is transported long distances and has caused significant damage to crops and natural resources in china in 1999 sepa reported that acid precipitation was widespread and significant problem in nearly

the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide chinas carbon dioxide emissions are second only to the united states primarily because of the countrys heavy reliance on coal as an energy source analysts have projected that china would likely surpass the united states as the number one emitter of carbon dioxide within two decades however chinas energy consumption declined markedly between 1997 and 1999 thus altering projections chinas energy use and carbon dioxide emissions are again increasing consequently china will remain very significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions see climate change section below although air pollution reports usually focus on the densely populated industrialized eastern cities chinas western region also experience s severe air quality problems according to the us embassy in beijing weekly air quality data reported in the chinese press consistently show pollution levels to be highest in western cities officials attribute this situation largely to airborne soil from the surrounding arid countryside this is major problem also in beijing which suffers from severe episodes of such dust pollutionand the number of dust storms has increased markedly in recent years the cause of this air pollution is attributed partly to government efforts to move people into western regions introd ucing agriculture and deforestation into the area in an attempt to address the extensive land degradation that has resulted and to mitigate severe flooding problems the government has imposed restrictions on logging in key watersheds and is attempting to return some cropland to forest and grassland however excessive logging continues although the overall rate of logging has declined11 health and environmental impacts and costs the costs of pollution in general and air pollution in particular are substantial having serious impact on human health as well as significant effect on chinas citizens and economy the following preliminary calculations of such costs by the world bank serve to illustrate why chinese officials have begun to take strong actions to address environmental degradation in major cities an estimated 178000 premature deaths occur each year because of pollution indoor air pollution primarily from burning coal and biomass for cooking and heating causes 111000 premature deaths each year mainly in rural areas and roughly 74 million workyears have been lost to health damages related to air pollution each year12httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs5 13us embassy beijing china the cost of environmental degradation in china 14he kebin and cheng chang

crops and forests there totaled 65 million 1999 georgia tech study calculated that reduced sunlight due to sooty air may be depressing yields on 70 of chinas farms by 5 to 30 chinese factories and households emitted more than 23 million tons of soot and industrial dust in 1999 according to sepa more than 80 of children aged 5 to 7 tested in guangzhou in early 2000 had unhealthful levels of lead in their blood studies in other cities have shown elevated blood leadlevels exceeding the who guideline in more than 50 of children exposure to lead can reduce intelligence and cause other neurological problems especially in children and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copdsuch as emphysema or bronchitisis the leading cause of death in china the rate of death from copd is twice the average for developing countries moreover the american chemical society estimated that nationwide more that million deaths annually oneeighth of total deaths were attributable to air pollution between 1990 and 199513 government measures to reduce air pollution because of such adverse impacts as those noted above the national government has taken numerous steps to reduce air pollution particularly in the most seriously polluted areas government initiatives have targeted range of pollution sources including industry motor vehicles power plants coal mines and households one such effort has been to reduce exposures to lead which have occurred primarily in urban areas largely from the combustion of leaded gasoline in 1997 the state council required all sales of leaded gasoline to cease by july 1 200014 several major urban areas including beijing required leaded gasoline to be phased out by the end of 199715 by the end of 1999 70 of the vehicle gasoline consumed in china reportedly was lead free primarily because of the early controls imposed in urban areas other motor vehicle emissions are becoming increasingly serious and government officials at the national and local levels have begun to address these emissions through regulations and other policy initiatives see the transportation section belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs6 16us embassy beijin g china

industrial sources in 1996 as part of the 9th fiveyear plan the state council mandated that all of the more than 238000 industrial enterprises in china meet emissions standards for key air and water pollutants by the end of 2000 or face closure key air pollutants identified in the plan were primarily so 2 and particulates ie soot and industrial dust special attention was given to 18000 large enterprises that accounted for more than twothird s of all industrial emissions also by the end of 2000 47 key cities were to meet national standards for air and water quality in november 2000 us embassy report on environmental conditions in hubei province noted that it is conceivable that all or nearly all factories will meet or at least be said to have met emissions standards without any noticeable improvement in the citys air or water quality provincewide more than 90 percent of factories had met emissions standards by the end of 1999 according to the epb local environmental protection bureau report but as stated above air and water quality were still far from satisfactory16 the situation in hubei might be typical for many areas beginning in january 2001 most provinces and key cities reported that 90 or more of the industries in their jurisdictions had met the standards according to us embassy review of government reports nine areas claimed 99 compliance while shanghai hainan and yunnan reported 100 compliance17 the embassy noted that despite the high compliance rates and the closure of thousands of polluting industries most of the 47 targeted cities still fail to meet applicable standards for air and water quality the embassy offered several explanations for this outcome first the 1996 state council decision that mandated pollution controls did not address mobile sources and automobiles are growing source of air pollution similarly windblown dust and the residential sector are other significant but unregulated pollution sources second the embassy suggested that emissions standards may be too lax particularly for older factories as in the united states older enterprises were given less stringent standards to meet than new ones consequently areas with high concentrations of older industries would still experience significant pollution even with compliance with emission standards third the process of certifying factory emissions is complex and open to abuse fourth the embassy suggested that while authorities have closed hundred s of small obsolete polluting enterprises in recent years they are hesitant to shut down large industries that have thousands of employees some 500 large stateowned enterprises have been given twoyear extension to meet standards moreover the embassy noted that in the past some bureaucrats have distorted statistics to show that targets were achieved18 the embassy concluded that as the easy actions to reduce pollution are exhausted eg most of the industries closed were small backward and losing moneyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs7 19us embassy beijing ninth fiveyear plan environmental report card march 2001 20china state environmental protection administration report on the state

help from society in general in preventing backsliding in the aftermath of last years campaign19 beijing clean air campaign many of the governments pollution control initiatives have focused on major cities in china and particu larly extensive efforts have been made in beijing the nations capital in 1998 municipal officials in beijing undertook major environmental pollution prevention campaign with primary focus on air pollution control and prevention this campaign reportedly was initiated in response to growing public and official concern regarding the capital citys poor air quality and also due to interest in hosting the 2008 olympics since 1998 beijing has earmarked nearly 36 billion for implementing 68 air pollution control measures according to sepa these measure s resulted in significant improvements in air quality by the end of 1999 compared with 1998 so 2 emissions had declined 31 and 2 had declined 72 and total suspended particulates tsp had declined 2020 levels of these pollutants reportedly all declined further during 2000 in addition to aggressive pollution control measures favorable wind patterns also contributed to reductions in pollution levels city officials recently announced new measures for the latest stage of this pollution prevention campaign which include imposing stricter controls on automobile emissions and requiring capital iron and steel the citys largest polluter to curtail operations21 beijing is also taking actions to increase the use of cleaner fuels such as natural gas and lowsulfur coal achievements and challenges although concerns remain regarding the government s efforts to control industrial pollution air quality has improved recently particularly from 1998 to 1999 among the air pollution control initiatives within the 9th fiveyear plan the national government required the closure of small dirty coal mines sepa reported that by the end of 1999 31200 illegal and unreasonably located coal mines had been closed and the production of high sulfur content coal was reduced by more than 22 million tons similarly numerous small power plants cement plants refineries and blast furnaces were closed because of their inefficiency and relatively high pollution levels22 table 1 shows the reductions in estimated sulfur dioxide and particulate emission levels from 1998 to 1999 table 2 illustrates changes in reported

in china 1999 according to world bank analysis china was able to continue its economic growth in the late 1990s while achieving significant reductions in industrial and urban air and water pollution the main reason identified for this achievement was reduction in pollution among township and village industrial enterprises tvies which from 1989 until 1995 had increased the amount of pollution they generated by 123 in that same period countyandaboveowned enterprises caoes which are primarily stateowned enterprises soes had reduced their pollution load by 92 from 1995 to 1998 the average decrease in pollution rates were 396 for tvies and 225 for caoes world bank analysts suggested several factors that may have had an effect on pollution reduction economic stagnation regulation notably the closure of thousands of highly polluting tvies and restructuring in the industrial sector eg gradual shift from highly polluting industries such as cement making to less polluting industries such as electronic and telecommunications industries23 table 2 ninth five year plan total emissions of major pollutants targets and achievements millions of metric tons pollutant 1995 actual 1999 actual 2000

urbanbased pollution reductions in so2 and particulate emissions in the late 1990s were attributed mainly to stronger command and control interventions particularly towards tvies and fuel shifting

growth and continuing rapid urbanization are key among them moreover financial issues overlay these challenges 1997 world bank report estimated that china would have to spend 21 of gdp 21 billion annually to reach us air quality standards of the early 1980s by 2020 according to the chairman of the environment and natural resources committee of the national peoples congress qu geping china would need to spend 40 billion to meet chinese standards for just three pollutants 2 so2 and particulates in 46 key cities26 chairman qu geping further noted that the greatest obstacle to overcome in improving chinas air quality is the countrys dependence on coal27 which is likely to remain chinas primary energy source for the foreseeable future the government has recognized that its technology for coal energy production and use has been comparatively backward28 and is looking both domestically and abroad for technical and financial assistance and foreign investment to addre ss this problem multilateral institutions and bilateral technical assistance are playing significant roles see discussion on multilateral and bilateral cooperation below for the10th five year plan covering 2001

effort to do more to improve air quality china strengthened its national air pollution law in 2000 the objectives of the amendments are to improve enforcement address critical air quality problems in key urban areas and make greater use of marketbased methods for cutting emissions the new provisions increase penalties for violations broaden the scope of the law clarify authorities and call for incentives for clean and renewable energy31 among the major changes the law prohibits pollutant emissions that exceed national standards and imposes compliance deadlines and higher fines for excess emissions previously such emissions were legal provided that polluters paid fees on them32 also the law addresses mobile sources for the first time and emission control systems will be required on new and existing vehicles as an overarching change the amendments broaden the focus of the law from controlling the concentration of pollutants emitted from individual sources to include controlling the total volume of pollutants entering an airshed when fully implemented the amendments are intended to stabilize total air pollution emissions at 1995 levels by 2010 if emissions reductions reported in recent years are sustained many areas could meet this goal without much additional reduction in pollution however air pollution remains severe relative to international

strategy will likely involve further use it has been projected that chinas carbon dioxide co2 emissions will exceed those of the united states by 202038 further with chinas rapidly growing economy and resulting demand for power projections estimate that chinas greenhouse gas emissions could increase sevenfold in the next 25 years39 however new data suggest that between 1997 and 1999 china s energy consumption dropped approximately 13 while greenhouse gas emissions dropped by approximately 1740 the decrease in energy consumption mostly in the form of coal was caused by many factors including improvements in efficiency household fuel switching primarily from coal to natural gas and economic reforms41 greenhouse gas emissions dropped more quickly than

chinas energy use and greenhouse gas emissions have started growing again it seems unlikely that chinese greenhouse gas emissions will actually exceed us emissions by 2020 either way chinas share of world greenhouse gas emissions will likely continue to grow recent analysis by the pacific northwest national laboratory projected that under moderate growth scenario chinas overall energy use is expected to increase by just over 80 percent by 2020 coal use will likely increase by twothirds while growth in petroleum natural gas hydroelectric and renewable energy sources will be considerably higher how and where coal is used will affect emissions widespread use of desulfurization equipment for example could reduce the risk of acid rain even as coal use rises but it will do nothing to check growth in carbon dioxide emissions42 chinas domestic policy in general china has not focused on greenhouse gas reductions in their own right but on regrets strategies those that have benefits in other areas in addition to emissions reductions to reduce consumption and control pollution43 pollution mitigation strategies include closing older less efficient coalfired plants and replacing them with significantly more efficient plants as well as research into clean coal technologies such as integrated coalgasification combinedcycle igcc and fluidized bed plants chinese leaders have also committed to expanding natural gas nuclear energy and hydropower production in the country in 1998 power output from fossil fuel power plants grew by 13 while nuclear and hydroelectric output grew by 55 and 6 respectively while more expensive these fuels would allow china to limit its consumption of coal and cut pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions however especially for hydroelectric and nuclear power plants capital costs are extremely high in addition of concern are the drawbacks to these techn ologies such as waste disposal for nuclear energy and population relocation for hydroelectric power to reduce domestic coal consumption and improve air quality beijing has banned the use of coal by industrial and household consumers within the city44 further in 1995 the chinese government had encouraged the use of shaped coal briquettes in domestic furnaces as opposed to raw coal45 to replace household coal use china is expanding the natural gas network other initiatives to improve air quality and efficiency include higher efficiency consumer goods and improved emission controls for factories and power plantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs13 46logan et climate action

primarily because of downstream flooding related to deforestation forested areas could potentially serve as carbon sinks mitigating carbon dioxide emissions however the success of forest expansion has been questioned as some argue that while forested landmass has increased forest density has decreased leading to decrease in the actual number of trees one problem is that while many new trees have been planted husbandry has not been as successful leading to dieoff of large number of planted trees as noted above while chinas greenhouse gas emissions are relatively high and expected to grow significantly china has had some progress in reducing its greenhouse gas emissi ons largely through improvements in energy efficiency in the early 1980s the chinese government committed itself to energy conservation mainly to deal with energy shortages46 since that time although energy consumption has increased energy intensity47 has dropped significantly energy consumption has nearly tripled since 198048 while energy intensity is approximately 50 lower today than it was in 198049 major success of chinas developmen t is that unlike most developing countries the countrys energy demand has grown less rapidly than gdp50 as part of its official longterm plans the chinese government has set the goal of 5 to 6 annual economic growth51 there are concerns that greenhouse gas emissions resulting from improved efficiency will be erased with significant increase in energy use expected with continued development increased energy consumption in the natural gas electricity and transportation sectors will be major part of this increase as consumer goods such as automobiles become more common and as household energy demand increases52 chinas international policy on the international side china has been active in efforts to control global climate change both china and the united states have ratified the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc which contains voluntary legally nonbinding commitments that parties to the treaty will try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000 further both china and the united states have

committed in the unfccc to make and report efforts to reduce their emissions this disparity between the obligations of developed and developing countries has been one of the major factors in the opposition of the us senate and the bush administration to the kyoto protocol chinas position remains firm that the first international ly mandated steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be made by developed countries and china does not intend to make international commitments at this time however it has strongly criticized the us decision to pull out of the kyoto protocol negotiations china participates in bilateral and multilateral efforts to study the effects of global climate change to transfer and use more efficient technology and to develop coordinated national climate change plan chinese activities include policy studies conducted with the world bank and asian development bank currently china is working with japan on methane emissions reductions from cokegas utilization and is negotiating projects with other countries54 the united states also participates in bilateral and multilateral projects with china through the us country studies program the united states works with developing countries including china on assessing emissions climate change risk and potential mitigation strategies in addition the us exportimport bank exim bank has partnered with the chinese government on clean energy initiative to improve efficiency and reduce emissions however the us agency for international development usaid which has made climate change an environmental priority is forbidden by the us foreign assistance act 22 usc 2151 and other restrictions from providing assistance to china55 opportunities for us business with chinas economy developing so rapidly there are many opportunities for us businesses even without us participation in the kyoto protocol which would allow developed nations to claim reductions in co 2 emissions if they assist developing countries to install clean technologies56 key area for us businesses is in nuclear hydroelectric and renew able energy development the united states is the largest producer of nuclear and hydroelectric power thus us businesses have experience with these technologies though not necessarily focused on exports per further because of the high capital costs for these technologies there could be opportunities

industrial boilers lighting and other goods in addition us businesses could participate in transit and distributed generation projects within china transportation sector transp ortation will continue to play key role in both chinas development and environment currently mobile sources contribute approximately 45 to 60 of nitrogen oxide nox emissions and approximately 85 of carbon monoxide co emissions in the countrys cities57 this is largely due to poor emissions control on mobile sources without new emissions controls these emissions would increase dramatically as chinas economy expands china plans to further expand its growing highway system especially in the poorer areas of western china in fact this expansion is key component of chinas development strategy for the its western provinces58 an increase in highways will lead to an increase in the number of vehicles on the road especially as passenger vehicles become more accessible however new strategies already in place for emission controls alternative fuels and transit will help alleviate some of the potential problems of transportation growth in china further bicycles national symbol will continue to play key role especially in urban areas motor vehicles the number of motor vehicles in china is small compared to the united states there are approximately 16 million cars trucks and buses in china compared to approximately 210 million in the united states59 in terms of vehicle ownership density this disparity is even higher about 785 vehicles per 1000 people are operated in the united states compared to about 10 per 1000 people in china further relatively few of these are passenger vehicles approximately 20 in china compared to approximately 97 in the united states however this relatively small number of vehicles especially passenger cars understates their current and projected growth as well as their environmental impact between 1994 and 2000 the number of motor vehicles grew from 24 million to more than 16 million60 between 1985 and 1995 passenger vehicle growth rates averaged 18 per year and chinas minibus and taxi fleets grew from insignificant numbers to 100000 and 585000

future first in the mid1990s the state planning commission began to promote the household car62 if realized car in every household could put hundreds of millions of passenger vehicles on the road in addition to trucks and buses second factor is that chinas accession into the world trade organization wto could greatly increase the availability of cars in the chinese market current tariffs on cars range from 80 to 100 and given wto membership these would be reduced to 25 by 2006 greatly reducing the cost of imported vehicles63 in addition tariffs on auto parts would drop from 4050 currently to 10 by 2006 moreover import quotas would be phased out by 200564 in order to make cars more affordable the chinese government is removing 238 separate fees on vehicle purchase and ownership that add as much as 40 to the cost of car65 further installment buying is taking hold in the chinese car market the expansion of installment buying should make cars more affordable for consumers66 because of these changes approximately 70 of households in guangzhou and shanghai wish to purchase passenger cars in the next ten years according to china auto news67 across the country 70 million households report that they believe they could afford private car68 with growing vehicle population the environmental effects of motor vehicles could grow significantly in fact the potential environmental effects of passenger cars has become major concern in china and has spurred interest in transit system development the environmental performance of most vehicles in china today is comparable to vehicles in the united states in the 1960s and 1970s69 further pollution control standards have not been strongly enforced in many places however china has taken major steps to improve motor vehicle emissions as of 2000 leaded gasoline was phased out and in 1998 china introduced catalystbased emissions standards for all new passenger vehicles70 these initiatives will significantly reduce

significantly more stringent than the current national standards current us standards meet or exceed the euro ii standards so american car manufacturers should have little trouble building cars to meet the standards72 however european manufacturers who are familiar with the euro ii test procedures will likely have at least small advantage in producing these vehicles in addition to emission controls on motor vehicles major municipalities such as beijing chongqing and shanghai are implementing requirements for liquified petroleum gas lpg and natural gas vehicles and fueling stations73 beijing has the largest natural gas bus fleet in the world and several other cities are planning to convert thousands of taxis and buses to natural gas over the next few years for example the city of haikou in hainan province plans to spend 36 million to install natural gas systems in 5400 buses and cars74 in addition china is participating in united nations development programme undp project to test and demonstrate fuel cell buses these plans are aimed at reducing vehicle pollution as well as curbing petroleum use and greenhouse gas emissions opportunities for us businesses with the opening of markets and the tightening of emissi on standards there are likely to be many opportunities for us companies in china in fact the us and foreign commercial service in beijing estimates that by 2001 the market for emission control and emissions monitoring equipment will grow to 270 million per year75 the retrofit of pre1998 vehicles will lead to growth in the catalytic converter market in china us emissions control manufacturers have had experience over the past 30 years in equipping american cars with such devices and could likely take advantage of growing demand in china especially with the cuts in auto part tariffs as part of wto accession the increasing market for cars could also allow us auto manufacturers to play larger role in the chinese auto market while one possible disadvantage for us manufacturers is that china has chosen to adopt european emissions standards chinese standards lag behind both european and american standards so it is unlikely that us manufacturers will have significant problems making vehicles compliant as stated above according to the chinese government alternative fuels will play role in chinas pollution control strategy this is another potential area of opportunity for us companies although they are not widely used in the united states alternative fuel vehicles are growing in their use thanks to supportive governme nt

plays in chinese transportation it may prove easier to expand infrastructure for natural gas and other alternative fuels in china than it has been in the united states although not environmentally related other opportunities for us companies related to transportation include auto insurance and vehicle financing mass transit the growth in motor vehicles has led to greater congestion and longer commute times in chinese cities because of congestion and poor bus performance between the mid1980s and mid1990s chinese commuters began switching to other forms of transportation in the case of more affluent citizens these included personal vehicles taxis and minibuses poorer commuters switched to bicycles or walking in shanghai the percentage of commuters using bus transit dropped from 24 to 15 between 1986 and 199576 the movement away from bus transit has led to vicious cycle in which vehicle congestion leads to slow bus service causing commuters to seek out other means of transportation thereby further increasing congestion while bus ridership is declining rail transit is expanding the chinese government sees urban rail systems as key to maintaining economic growth and limiting urban pollution in the mid1980s the government stated that rail shoul d be the primary mode of transportation in urban areas however in 1995 to combat inflation the chinese government placed moratorium on most light rail projects this was lifted in 1999 and several projects were started or revived77 the china communications and transportation association estimates that more than 157 billion will be invested in rail transit over the next five years currently subway systems operate in four cities beijing tianjin shanghai and guangzhou rail transit systems are planned in cities such as chongqing shenzhen and nanjing opportunities for us businesses while transit projects currently are required to use at least 70 domestically manufactured locomotives and other equipment municipal governments such as beijing allow foreign companies to invest in and manage rail projects78 in addition to investment opportunities for us companies include construction locomotives and cars and control systems although the opportunities for trade in equipment are constrained bicycles in chinese cities the bicycle plays key role in transportation in fact the bicycle is seen as national symbol and until recently it was the primary mode of urban transportation there are between 400 and 600 million bicycles in the country many planners see bicycles as way of reducing pollution however for many in china

such as shanghai bicycle use surged again between the mid1980s and mid1990s80 but both bicycle production and use have dropped since the mid1990s in the early 1990s bicycles accounted for approximately 60 of trips in beijing that number is now down to 4081 increasing automobile ownership along with growth in taxis and subways has led to this decline in 1998 annual bus car and truck production in china were up 318 47 and 23 respectively annual bicycle production declined 15582 adding to the decline in bicycle use is the fact that in some cities they are off limits on major streets during rush hour this ban has made daily commuting by bicycle impractical for many workers despite the decline in the bicycle because of such high ownership levels and continued use it will

from municipal industrial and agricultural sources have exacerbated water scarcity problems in many areas of the country more than half of chinas 668 cities experience chronic water shortages and

urban and suburban areas without adequate investment in water supply infrastructure and increased use of pesticides and fertilizers combined with continued reliance on sewage irrigation102 industri alization has been especially rapid among chinas township and village industrial enterprises tvies which are more than 50 locally owned and now account for more that 55 of rural gdp key issue researchers have identified here is that industrial growth among tvies has occurred outside of the central government environmental management systems and is only regulated to the degree that local bureaus and authorities choose to exercise such authority103 although tvies became subject to state laws in 1996 and 1997 enforcement was quite lax consequently most of the tvies have lacked wastewater treatment facilities and have discharged more wastewater and more highly polluted wastewater than the formerly dominant stateowned enterprises recently industrial wastewater treatment rules have been enforced more aggressively especially in urban areas according to sepa in 1999 872 of industrial wastewater received some treatment and 667 of wastewater discharged attained standards104

increased from 37 in 1978 to 135 in 1996 while the percent of municipal wastewater treated increased from 14 in 1978 to 131 in 1996105 nearly 83 of wastewater remained untreated in 1996 by late 2000

degradation in china diseases compared to conditions existing in 1949 at that time more than onehalf of the population died from infectious and other nondegenerative diseases before reaching middle age statistic not uncommon for developing countries in contrast statistics from the chinese ministry of health show that by the mid 1990s infectious diseases had declined markedly and were the cause of death for just 00004 of the population annually107 this progress is particularly notable given that china has the worlds largest population and continues to be one of the worlds poorer nations nonetheless chinas deteriorating water quality that has resulted from its rapid urbanization industrialization and intensive agricultural practices is threatening to undermine some public health gains recent studies suggest that chinas severe water pollution is increasing the traditional health risks of infectious diseases as well as the modern risks of illnesses associated with exposures to industrial chemicals in drinking water108 in addition to public health concerns the economic and ecological effects of water pollution also are being felt in china the us embassy in beijing recently identified several direct and indirect costs of water pollution red tides abnormal algal growth caused by marine pollution caused more that 120 million in losses to the fishing industry in the bohai yellow and south china seas in 1999 according to the ministry of agriculture fishermen in hebei province filed suit in november 2000 claiming wastewater from upstream paper mills in henan province killed 3 million worth of fish toxic spills killed 2 million kilograms of fish in two rivers in anhui province in july 2000 costing local fishermen 15 million in lost catch reports indicate that perhaps 1000 incidents occur nationally each year109 the us embassy noted the general concerns that water pollution spreads diseases reduces agricultural output and imposes costs on industries that use water in their production processes while such concerns are shared by all countries china faces these water pollution problems on very large scale government measures to reduce water pollution in response to the widespread deterioration of water resources the national government adopt ed several strategies in the 1990s these include increasing the number and capacity of municipal wastewater treatment facilities more aggressively controlling industrial wastewater pollution especially among tvies and using sewage irrigation projectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs25 110jim stover chinas

quality of water resourc will seriously undermine chinas growth prospects and threaten its political stability water shortages increasing flood damage and rampant pollution threaten to undermine both shortand longterm modern ization goals it is uncertain moreover if sufficient fresh water will be available in the coming decades to accommodate chinas growing water demands for agriculture industry energy development and domestic supply115 in november 2000 chinas state council issued circular setting goals for urban water conservation and pollution control the circular set goal for cities with populations of 500000 or more to be treating at least 60 of sewage by 2005 and for all cities to be treating at least 60 of sewage by 2010116 the 10th fiveyear plan increases the number of key cities targeted for pollution control from 47 in the 9th fiveyear plan to 100 all of the targeted cities are expected to meet national water and air quality standards by the end of 2005 researchers have noted that for china to meet its wastewater treatment goals the country will have to overcome several financial and institutional hurdles key challenge is that municipal governments have had little or experience with sewage treatment projects moreover operation and maintenance costs and training typically have not been factored into project costs china has relied and continues to rely heavily on foreign aid to fund wastewater treatment projects117 while noting accomplishments over the past five years study by the chinese central government the world bank and others project that water pollution control will become much more complex over the next 10 years and that it is likely that water quality in rivers lakes and ground water will deteriorate in many areas the authors noted that in many of chinas stressed river basins huge gap exists between the ambient standards for designated water uses and the actual standards that are likely to be achievable within any reasonable planning timeframe pollution sources that require increased attention include municipal wastewater discharges and agricultural nonpoint source pollution especially from intensive livestock production units as well as continuing efforts to reduce industrial water pollution118httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs27 environmental policies in china in response to worsening pollution problems environmental concerns have been expressed as national priority in government policies and documents much more often over the past several years as environmental pollution grew to uncomfortable and unhealthful levels and as severe flooding was tied more directly to deforestation in the upland areas recent chinese policies and official pronouncements began to reflect this increase in priority for environme ntal protection in many cases laws are on the booksand have been for some timeto control pollution but enforcement has been problematic the government has identified number of areas where environmental protection laws need to be strengthened or revised and this process is underway for example amendments to the air pollution control law last year added numerous requirements and strengthened enforcement authority at the provincial and local levels one conspicuo us impediment to more effective environmental management has been the decentralization of enforcement activities as well as lack of resources at the national provincial and local levels and the relatively weak system of legal recourse or other methods to achieve implementation of environmental protection laws in general however while review of major chinese policy documents shows increased mention of environmental priorities and the earlier reluctance to acknowledge environmental problems has faded these policies also clearly demonstrate that economic development goals remain preeminent and would be likely to prevail in any perceived conflict with environmental goals working in favor of stronger environmental protection is the slowly growing perception that environmental deterioration has become problem in economic terms 10th five year plan the document that most comprehensively outlines economic and social priorities for china is the five year plan the 10th five year plan adopted on october 11 2000 retains primary emphasis on economic development but also includes significant references to the importance of environmental more often translated as ecological protection sometimes acknowl edging the need to improve the current situation the plan identifies main objectives as relatively fast economic growth doubling gross domestic product between 2000 and 2010 establishing social security system and improving the participation of state owned enterprises soes in the international economy achieving these goals would enable according to the plan improvements in jobs incomes and material conditions and ecological construction and environment preservation will intensify the plan clearly states development is the overriding principle key to addressing all the problems in china and generally includes environmental concerns as the final item in lists such as main assignments for the strategic adjustment of the economic structure that include improving performance and returns of agriculture industry and services coordinated development between regional economies expediting urbanization and special efforts to improve the infrastructure and the ecological environment essential for achieving sustainable development under speeding up industrial transformation controlling pollution is goal along with increasing labor productivity the plan specifically targets closing factories and mines that waste resourcesand cause serious pollution httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs28 119for more information on the earth summit see crs report 92374 enr earth summit summaryother references to environment in the 10th five year plan include water conservancy and great efforts to address such problems as flooding insufficient water resources and water pollution the plan states with respect to energy development we shouldoptimize the mix of energy resources make their use more efficient and intensify our efforts in preserving the environment improving the ecological environment is key feature in the section on development of western china in big way another section promotes greater degree of urbanization stressing the role of markets and investment and an emphasis on medium and small cities there is mention of environmental concerns in the urbanization section section 10 of the plan is strengthen management of the population and resources emphasize ecological projects and protection of the environment it begins implementing strategy of sustainable development has bearing on the vital matter of the survival and development of the chinese nation population issues are emphasized first followed by rational use of resources and urging protection and development of water land mineral forestry grassland marine and other such nation resources in keeping with the law prospecting for resources is encouraged strengthening ecological construction and curbing deterioration of the ecology is identified as goal along with environmental protection the plan states we should strengthen the overall control of air water garbage and noise pollution in the cities and achieve obvious improvements in the quality of the environment in the larger cities it goes on to say the environmental protection industry should be developed vigorously strengthening research and development on key industrial protection technology and processing equipment improving environmental and climate monitoring systems is mentioned as are perfecting and strengthening environmental protection laws and regulations and strengthening law enforcement and oversight in commenting on the plan premier zhu rongji stated the importance of the period for achieving the goals of the planeconomic and social development economic restructuring improving the socialist market economy and opening to the outside world environmental improvement was not among these top goals however among the remaining problems not to be ignored was worsening ecological environment in some localities his comments on improving peoples livelihoods included major emphasis on increasing the level and scope of consumption with mention of improving the quality of the environment chinas agenda 21 on sustainable development at the 1992 united nations conference on environment and development unced in rio janeiro popularly known as the earth summit 40chapter action plan for environmentally sustainable development was agreed upon by the worlds leaders119 each nation made voluntary commitments not legally binding to engage in carrying out the goals of agenda 21 named for actions needed into the 21st century as the action plan was called china was one of the first countries to take up the challenge of formulating an agenda 21 for its own developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs29 in 1994 china completed its priority programme for chinas agenda 21 first tranche prepared by the state planning commission and the state science and technology commission this document outlined the executable projects that would serve as the fundamental means for implementing chinas agenda 21 and that would be integrated into successive fiveyear plans beginning with the 9th possibly reflecting expectations of developing countries that financial assistance might later be provided by developed countries for agenda 21 which has not happened to any appreciable degree china prepared extensive lists of possible projects related to the very broad term sustainable development more than 500 proposals were suggested by various line ministries of the state council local governments industrial sectors academic institutions and other organizations the priority programme spells out 9 priority areas that encompass 62 projects the priority areas are as follows capacity building for sustainable development which includes revamping legislation and enforcement policies education and training and public participation in sustainable development with an emphasis on environmental issues sustainable agriculture which includes management of water resources development of biological pesticides and green foods and demonstration projects related to the strategy for sustainable agriculture cleaner production and environmental protection industry including introduction of clean technologies in principal industrial

priority program for chinas agenda 21 makes it clear that these are projects and areas in which investment will be sought from wide variety of sourc including multilateral agencies bilateral programs and private foreign investment in its report in 2000 the uschina business council reported that the center for chinas agenda 21 indicated that international support had been secured for 36 of the original projects identifie d in the priority program and that support for another 33 was under negotiation120 representative projects associated with some of the priority areas are in the cleaner

chemicals radioactive pollution and natural resources management the agenda 21 program noted although china has signed more than 20 international treaties on the environment and resources the domestic legislation to implement these treaties has not yet been enacted see below for discussion of chinas environmental laws and regulations transcentury green project another extensive list of environmentrelated projects compiled by chinas government and proposed for potential foreign investment was unveiled at the 1997 uschina environment forum established to facilitate us china

sewage treatment in 17 different cities or communities industrial wastewater treatment for 15 cities or enterprises urban solid waste treatment and industrial waste treatment for 14 cities or industries air pollution control in 18 different plants or areas according to the uschina business council chinas state environmental protection agency sepa has reported that by the end of 1997 some 113 of these projects had been completed with total investment at 13 billion with international investment of 995 million in addition onethird of the total 523 projects were reportedly underway with investment in them of 214 billion of which 290 millionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs31 121ibid p 5859 122china state environmental protection administration state of the environment 1999 website

projects and 602 of total investment for these projects122 chinas laws and regulations on environment as discussed elsewhere in this report china has enacted wide array of laws addressing most of the environmental issues that have been of concern over the years additionally beginning in 1998 the newly reorganized state environmental protection agency sepa promulgated an extensive array of decisions and regulations to strengthen or create controls of wide variety of pollutants and concerning numerous activities such as environmental standards measurement environmental impact assessments hazardous waste incineration and many others in 2000 the air pollution control law was greatly expanded and strengthened as noted in the discussion of air quality number of additional laws are reportedly in the drafting stage or being discussed including clean production law new marine environmental protection law radioactive pollution prevention law and others123 it remains problematic to determine the level of implementation and enforcement for laws and regulations in china the decentralization of many governmental functions and continuing reports of corruptionalong with reports of crackdowns on corruptionmake compliance very hard to determine the uschina business council report notes the disconnect that often occurs between the laws on the books and compliance with them as chinas rapidly expand ing body of environmental legislation grows more sophisticated the gulf widens between what is mandated by law and how laws are actua lly implemented as in many other areas of chinas legal system environmental laws often reflect vision far removed from reality 1998 sepa investigation of local compliance levels for example revealed that about onethird of the firms inspected were operating in accordance with the law one third were not using any environmental protecti on equipment at all and about onethird operated their environmental technology inefficiently ie only during inspections124 the report noted several reasons for these discrepancies first among them the decentralized bureaucratic structure in which enforcement of environmental laws and regulations is carried out primarily by provincial and local level environmental protection bureaus epbs which report to provincial or local government authorities not to sepa therefore development priorities of the local governments may often take priority over environmental protection laws other obstacles to enforcement include conflicts of interest arising from funding for the epbs which comes from fines collected and the fact that the epbs often have commercial subsidiaries that provide technologysometimes encouraging inappropriate use of them irrational pricing mechanisms that often make paying fines morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs32 125baldinger environmental trends and policies in china p 9attractive than investing in pollution control technology and unrealistically high legal stand ards or compliance timeframes other major obstacles cited are the lack of environmental experience and traditions among the public and among operators of industrial and other facilities as well as the relatively weak system of tapping into public concerns and the relative lack of legal recourse for public concerns in general it seems clear that the chinese government has significantly increased efforts to mitigate environmental deterioration and both laws and regulations are being upgraded while compliance remains problematic efforts are also underway in the government to increase understanding and support for environmental improvement and laws among the public and among industry and economic officials improvements in environmental quality especially air quality have been noted as plants have been closed often in line with environmental mandates and as the government takes some strong environmental steps governmental organization for environmen tal protection as environmental problems worsened during the first half of the 1990s the government also responded by reorganizing some of its environmental functions many experts on china place the turning point in the mid1990s in particular from 1996 onward the us china business council observed in its report the real turning point in official attitudes toward the environment however came in 1996 when both president jiang zemin and then premier li peng delivered speeches at chinas fourth national environmental protection conference for the first time the government included environmental protection projects and targets in the state plan and unveiled ambitious schemes to attract foreign investment125 as discussed below the environmental functions of the government are organized across number of agencies and organizations lines of authority among these however can be difficult to ascertain partly because of the complex and somewhat impenetrable interrelationship between official government structures and the communist party hierarchy as well as the complexity of the lines of authority between the national and lower level governmental entities state environmental protection agency sepa the agency with most direct responsibility for environmental protection and pollution control is chinas state environmental protection administration the highest level administrative environmental authority at the national level it superseded the previous national environmental protection agency nepa and was elevated to ministerial status in 1998 as part of government restructuring but at the same time was cut back to 200 to 250 employees 30 reduction in staff it operates with very limited funding and human resources sepa issues standards and regulations and is responsible for enforcement although its elevation to ministerial status may have been intended as signal to both chinese and foreign constituencies that the environment has been elevated as political priority the reduction in staff and resources may create additional problems in its operations the environment and natural resources protection committee of the national peoples congress npc and the state council this committee is the primary legislative entity for environmental issues drafting legislation that is later considered by the standing committee of the npc essentially the working body of the npc the statehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs33 126ibid p 11council is the primary administrative secretariat for decisions of the npc and as such is the body to which ministerial bodies such as sepa report thus the council has key responsibilities for approving wide range of environmental targets priorities and plans as well as sepas budget state development planning commission sdpc the sdpc has key role in comprehensive social and economic planning and development including coordination of the fiveyear plans that outline the priorities and the framework for chinas economic strategies it has responsibility for developing the lists of priority projects for investment including infrastructure the sdpc develops major policies on such environmental issues as climate change and for renewable energy and gas utilization it also plays key role in project approval at local provincial and national offices and thus would be centrally involved environmental projects per as well as decisions on the extent to which environmental factors are taken into account in other major projects the state economic and trade commission setc is key player in formulating national economic policies and objectiv for communications commerce trade and industrial technology including domestic environmental protection technology in the government reorganization of 1998 this ministry also absorbed former ministries of key relevance to environmental issues including the former ministry of coal industry ministry of chemical industry and it oversees the offshore oil corporation former ministry of electric power and the state bureau of technological supervision126 the setc also has responsibility for approving technological expansion and renovation especially for state owned enterprises soes which would have import for related environmental impacts and concerns other national agencies according to the us china business council number of other ministries would have key roles in environmental issues connected with their jurisdiction among these are the ministry of construction which oversees urban engineering projects including wastewater treatment wasterecycling desulfurization and energy efficient heating equipment the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation moftec is responsible for approval of all foreign investment subsidiary of this ministry the china international center for economic and technical exchanges manages united nations development program projects and coordinates cooperation with international nongovernmental organizations assisting in the sustainable development area the ministry of science and technology oversees chinas agenda 21 program for sustainable development conducts research on new technologies and funds scientific initiatives other relevant ministries would include the ministry of agriculture the ministry of water resources and the ministry of land and natural resources provincial municipal and local governments as noted above the interplay among the national level ministries and between the national officials and the implementing authorities at the lower levels of government is complex and often presents difficulties in the enforcement of environmental protection laws and policies there is paucity of human and financial resources available for environmental protection activities at all levels making stringent enforcement efforts problematic as in most nations there are competinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs34 127this report is available at httpwwwusembassychinaorgcnenglishsandtestnews0112htmpriorities between the nationallevel ministries responsible for economic development and those with environmental responsibilities often the economic development interests are seen to be in conflict with and prevail over environmental protection goals according to conversations with chinese officials at both levels it is not unusual for there to be differences in environmental priorities and competing perspectives at provincial and local levels when the national environmental officials attempt to assure implementation of environmental goals they may encounter resistance or apathy at the lower levels to the extent that such implementation is either greatly slowed or obviated corruption is reportedly major problem connected with the governments environmental protection efforts according to february 12 2001 communication from the us embassy in china the state accounting bureau recently found serious problems in the collection management and use of waste emission fees in 46 key cities the bureau found false accounts and mismanagement of funds totaling rmb 986 million 120 million or some 27 of the total budget some chinese environmentalists believe that corruption at all levels of government is chinas biggest environmental problem127 it remains difficult for china as for most nations to resolve conflicting environmental economic and social needs in order to enforce environmental requirements in february 2 2001 communication the us embassy in china reported an article in china daily jan 22 2001 that indicated 520 strategic stateowned enterprises that were facing december 2000 deadline to meet pollution standards or be closed have been granted possible 2year extension by the sepa because widespread noncompliance among these very large companies would have resulted in closings involving largescale potential layoffs sepa made the decision to allow appeals for 2year extension such extensions would have to be approved by both local and sepa authorities sepa reportedly indicated that those soes that have not made any efforts to reduce pollution would be closed however many

commitments under only few all of these efforts involve the scoping of environmental needs in various areas and the engagement of private sector entities to implement all or part of the activities being funded global environment facility the global environment facility gef was established in 1991 to provide incremental funding through grants for projects that would enable the accomplishment of goals related to the gefs four priority areas biological diversity global climate change international waters and stratospheric ozone depletion the gef is administered by the world bank with joint responsibilities by the united nations development programme undp and the environment programme unep since gef funding is not meant to meet the costs of an entire project but to add to planned projects in order to fund the extra cost that enables the accomplishment of the gefs goals the amount of money for each project is much smaller than those from other institutions the gef is funding 12 projects on climate change in china ranging from 10 million to 25000 they focus on such projects as methane recovery and utilization commercialization of renewable energy participation in the climate change treaty process energy conservation and policy development there are 5 gef projects in china on biological diversity including variety of conservation efforts there are also 5 projects in the international waters category focused mainly on pollution prevention and control in coastal and marine areas ranging in cost from 185 million to 52 million138 world bank the world bank lends extensively in china but only relatively small number of lending projects are identified under environment by the bank its current list of environmental projects in china include 16 projects not including the gef projects it administers many for specific regions or cities the lending levels range from 349 million for the beijing environment project to 50 million for an environmental technical assistance project139 in the energy category the bank listed 29 lending projects of which 3 were renewable energy one was for energy conservation 8 were for hydroelectric and 8 were for thermal power others included power marketing projects and more general power development140 overall the bank reported cumulative total of lending in china since it resumed membership in 1980 at 35 billion as of june 30 2000 of this some 19 was for energy projects primarily thermal and hydroelectric power and 12 was for urban water supply urban development and environmental improvements141 in its current

environmental sector update to support preparation of the next fiveyear plan particularly in environmental activities proposed for the western and central areas in strengthening the environmental dimensions of investm ent programs in china and promoting increased cooperation on environmental issues both within china and with the donor community142 the world bank has been active in conducting studies and compiling statistics on environmental problems in china and continues to be significant source of related information see numerous citations in this report for example in february the world bank sponsored workshop in bangkok fighting air pollution from plan to action which brought together city leaders from large cities across asia including beijing and shanghai world bank regional clean air initiative for cities in east asia was launched to continue information and idea sharing among these cities and donors the world bank is cooperating with other multilateral donors on this project including the governments of the netherlands and japan and the ford motor company asian development bank adb the adb has provided loans to china since 1986 when china joined the bank in its country highlights section of its most recent annual report143 the adb reports that as of 1999 china had received 79 loans with cumulative total of 53 billion in contracts for 1999 eight loans for six projects were approved totaling 13 billion of which the adb categorized 102 million as environmental improvement the nature of its environmental work in china was characterized by the adb as follows for environmental protection and natural resource management adb loans andor technical assistance addressed priority areas targeted by the government such as water pollution control of some major river basins and air and water pollution control in major cities of six loan projects approved in 1999 two projects suzhou creek rehabilitation and shanxi environment improvement had environmental improvement as primary objective institutional strengthening of agencies involved in environment and natural resource policy planning management and enforcement is key feature of adbs capacitybuilding

market for china to achieve national goals for industrial wastewater treatment sewage treatment air pollution control and energy efficiency investments in environmental infrastructure must expand significantly the governments intent to address widespread environmental degradation is reflected as noted above in the environmental objectives outlined for the 10th fiveyear plan report supporting the plan identifies projects for which the government intends to seek funding during this period 20012005 project goals include constructing more than 200 wastewater and sewage treatment facilities and installing desulphurization equipment on 51 coalfired power plants146 the investment required for these and other environmental projects in the fiveyear plan is estimated to be 85 billion or roughly 13 of chinas gross domestic product over the fiveyear period147 moreover chinas growing pollution control requirements would be expected to create demand for additional environmental technologies and services for 2001 in fact the us department of state has included pollution control equipment on it list of best prospects for sales of us goods and services in china148 the following table provides the state departments unofficial estimates of the value of chinas environmental market the authors note that it is difficult to quantify the market because accurate data are scarce and environmental goods and services do not fit cleanly into standard customs classifications149 table 5 chinas environmental goods and services market unofficial estimates in millions of dollars 1998

152baldinger environmental trends and policies in china p31the ability to gain meaningful access to that market is perhaps the key question for interested us companies and the answer appears to be complex and evolving the uschina business council recently reported that the market for pollution control and abatement technologies will be large but the competition to participate in that market will be severe while most environmental infrastructure projects will continue to utilize domestic equipment and be funded locally the prc government is counting on receiving at least 20 percent of total funding from foreign sources multilateral development institutions bilateral government programs nongovernmental organizations and the private sector competition to provide environmental services and equipment an extremely broad category that includes water supply and treatment solid and liquid waste treatment and disposal pollution monitoring and reduction equipment clean energy and energy efficiency investme nts and engineeringconsulting services will be fierce many us companies will be at disadvantage compared to european and japanese firms backed by soft loans and more consistent supportive government policies150 similarly the state department notes that while the overall environmental market in china is growing rapidly only part of it is truly accessible to foreign firms the reasons cited for this situation include lowcost local competition financing and hard currency constraints closed bidding practices and other market barriers however several products viewed as having the best sales prospects are in the air and water pollution control areas these include lowcost flue gas desulfurization systems air and water monitoring instruments drinking water purification systems vehicle emissions control and testing devices industrial wastewater treatment equipment and resource recovery technologies151 research by the uschina business council resulted in similar view of best prospects for the chinese market in march 2000 the council reported that the market for environmental protection equipment and technology was concentrated in several areas sewage and wastewater treatment including treatment of highdensity organic wastewater heavy metals recycling and resource retrieval dust removal equipment desulfurization equipment for coalburning power plants noise pollution contr ol and vehicle emissions controls municipal solid waste incineration equipment and landfills and monitoring equipment152 because of the difficulties in gaining access to the chinese environmental market most large us environmental firms to date have participated primarily in world bank and asian development bank projects the state department anticipates that for several reasons this situation will change first environmental spending is expected to increase in china particularly in the more affluent coastal cities also chinas pending accession to the world trade organization wto is expected to help us exporters by reducing tariffs and discouraging import substitution policies as required of wto members china has committed to provide national treatment to foreign investors whereby foreign firms willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs42 153us department of state fy2001 country commercial guide china p 34 154see for example michael palmer environmental

domestic firms the state department cautions however that changes brought about by wto accession are not expected to be immediate or dramatic in the environmental sector153 finally the recent reopening of the trade and development agency program in china could also help us businesses to compete for participatio n in major infrastructure projects conclusions it is often noted that chinas efforts to address air and water pollution and other environmental problems occur within context of widespread poverty population pressures shortage of natural resources and outdated industrial infrastructure154 the types of environmental issues that china faces are typical for much of the world but what makes china different from most countries is the vast scale of these challenges during the past 20 years the government has enacted numerous laws that address environmental protection and natural resource conservation as overall environmental degradation has worsened in recent years china has accelerated efforts to address pollution problems for human health environmental and economic reasons it has done this while continuing rapid economic growth and in an evolving legal and institutional environment chinas environmental protection efforts have already shown significant results according to the world bank the three most important environmental results have been broadbased and absolute reduction in industrial air and water pollutant emissions during the second half of the 1990s achieved thanks to combination of regulation and industrial reform the reversal of deforestation through massive investments in reforestation and afforestation and reversal of secondary salinization in irrigation areas through major programs of both control and prevention during the 1980s and extending into the 1990s these achievements are arguably unprecedented in any country at chinas state of economic developme nt and provide strong indication that given high level of political commitment real progress can be made 155 although progress is noted the bank anticipates that the environmental challenge facing china is likely to become far greater and more complex over the next decade and the emphasis will have to shift from fighting fires to pollution prevention challenge familiar to all countries chinas continuing industrialization and quickly growing demand for automobiles appliances and other consumer goods will add to the challenges the country faces in controlling pollutio n the opening of chinas markets largely through accession to the wto is expected to increase foreign access to the chinese market and potentially hastenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31076crs43 156us embassy china fighting pollution in sichuan mixed results december 2000 report form us

an important factor in mitigating some of the pollution associated with such growth and might assist in making chinas future development to be less polluting than its past the us embassy in china recently observed that environment has become national priority in china and pollution control is being taken seriously the reasons for this heightened interest are multiple and include recognition by more officials at various government levels that economic progress is being hampered by heavy pollution and by citizens increasingly concerned about the quality of the air they breathe and the water they drink the embassy also projected that additional progress will be made during the next 5 years as new projects come on line as new enforcement and monitoring techniques are adopted and as citizens become ever more interest ed and active on environmental issues156 economic growth will remain the priority for the government however by most accounts it appears likely that environmental problems will increasingly be pursued along with economic progress
