nature of substitute initially passed the senate on april 10 2008 s ubsequently in an effort to expedite consideration and passage of the measur the house and senate engaged in an amendment exchange

110289 on july 30 2008 title iii emergency assistance for the redevelopment of aba ndoned and foreclosed homes of the act as signed by the president appropriates 4 billion in supplemental assistance to states and local governments as defined under the cdbg program based on separate formula to be developed by hud the act directs hud to establish an allocation formula that distributes funds to stat and local governments with the greatest need as measured by the number and percentage of foreclos ed homes in each state or locality the number and percentage of s ubprime mortgages in each state or locality and the number and percentage of homes in default or delinquency in each state or locality the measure gives hud 60 days after enactment to establish formula for allocating funds to eligible states and local governme nts and an additional 30 days to distribute funds to states and local governments formula or allocation elements each state and local government that receives funds will be required to allocat funds within 18 months of receipt and to give priority consideration to areas and metropolitan cities with the greatest percentage of home foreclosures the highest percentage of subprime loans and the greatest likelihood of facing sign ificant rise in the number of home foreclosures although the legislation identifies specific factors to be used by hud to develop formula it does not specify an actual formul other than requiring minimum allocation for each state of 05 if for illustrative pur poses it is assumed that hud assigned equal weights to the three factors then fo rmula to allocate funds under the act would resemble the following sffn sslsln sddn 3 x 4000000000 state allocationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22919crs4 sf number of foreclosures in state fn number of foreclosures nationwide ssl number of subprime loans in state sln number of subprime loans nationwide sd number of delinquencies in state dn number of deli nquencies nationwide under this scenario foreclosures subprime ans and delinquencies in state as share of the nationwide total would be weighed by one third and multiplied by the 4 billion available in funding eligible activities state and local governments could use funds to create financing instruments that would enable them to finance the purchase and redevelopment of fo reclosed homes and residential properties purchase and rehabilitate foreclosed homes and residential properties forsale rent or redevelopment establish land banks for foreclosed homes and demolish blighted structures restrictions limitati ons and prohibitions the act limits the purchase price of home or residential property acqui red by state or local government to an amount less than the homes current appraise d market value the discounted value should be significant enough to ensure that wh the home is sold by the state or local government the purchaser homebuyer will pay below market value for the home or property further when fo reclosed home or property is to be purchased as primary residence by an eligible homebuyer the act would limit the price for which state and local government may resell such property to more than the cost the state or local government paid to acquire and redevelop or rehabilitate the property during the first five years following its enactment the act requires community or state to reinvest all profits in additional sales rentals redevelopment and rehabilitation of foreclosed homes and properties af ter the fiveyear period all profits may be deposited in the us treasury unless hud pproves request to allow community or state to continue to use funds to finance activities eligible for assistance under the act other provisions of the bill would subject funds and revenues ge nerated by activities under this act to the same requirements as funds appropr iated under the regular cdbg program however for the sole purpose of expediting the use of funds under the act hud may issue alternative requirements to those governing the regular cdbg appropriations except for requi rements related to fair housing nondiscrimination labor standards and environm ental review in addition the legislation prohibits funds from being used in economic development projects involving the use of eminent domain limits the income of individuals and families who may benefit fromassistance provided by the act to those whose incomes do not exceed 120 of the areas median income requires state and local government to certify that at least 25 of theamount allocated by the bill will be used to purchase and redevelophttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22919crs5 housing for individuals and families whose incomes do not exceed 50 of the areas median income and requires that each state receives minimum allocation of 05 of the amount appropriated analysis weighing foreclosures subprim loans and delinquencies although pl 110289 directs hud to take into account hi gh concentrations of foreclosed homes subprime loans and mortgage delinquenciesdefaults when developing an allocation formula it provides hud broad discretion over how these factors are to be weighted different weighting would result in differing allocation patterns table 1 presents data from the mortgage bankers association mba showing the distribution of foreclosures subprime loans and defaults differs among the states in some cases for example georgia and i ndiana states have the same number of foreclosures 31000 however georgia has nearly twice as many subprime loans 209000 than indiana 124000 in addition georgia has almost onethird as many homes in default 67128 than indiana 49069 therefore if absolute numbers of forecl osures subprime loans and defaults were used to rank states then georgia and indi ana would receive the same amount of funding for foreclosures but different amounts for subprime loans and mortgage defaults on the other hand if states are ranked based on the pe rcent of the total both indiana and georgia represent 33 of total foreclosures in th nation however georgia represents 36 of subprime loans and 40 of homes in defau lt while indiana represents 21 of subprime loans and 29 of
