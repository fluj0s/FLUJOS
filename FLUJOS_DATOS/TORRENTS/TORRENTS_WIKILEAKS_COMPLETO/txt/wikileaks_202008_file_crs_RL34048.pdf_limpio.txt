requested through the army procurement appr opriation typically congress has funded both of these programs in title vi other department of defense programs of the defense appropr iations bill more recently rdte funds have also been requested and appropriated as part of dods separate funding to support the global war on terror gwot these appropriations have been located in title ix of the defense appropriations bill the joint improvised explosive device defeat fund also contains additional rdte monies the joint improvised explosive device defeat ffice which now administers the fund tracks but does not report the amount of funding allocated to rdte for fy2008 the bush administration requested 751 billion for dods baseline title iv rdte roughly 800 million less than the total obligational authority available for title iv in fy 2007 the fy2008 requests for rdte in the defense health program and the chemical agents and munitions destruction program were 134 million and 221 million respectively this years request for the global war on terror included both fy2008 title ix request and fy2007 title ix supplemental request with 29 billion and 14 billion being requested for rdte respectively since fy2001 funding for rdte in title iv has increased from 42 billion to 76 billion in fy2007 in constant fy2008 dollars the increase is roughly 58 historically rdte funding has reached its highest levels in constant dollars dating back to 19489 congress has appropr iated more for rdte than has been requested every year since fy1996 rdte funding can be broken out in couple of ways each of the military services request and receive their ow n rdte funding so too do various dod agencies eg the missile defense agen cy and the defense advanced research projects agency collectivel aggregated within the defensewide account rdte funding also can be characterized by budget activity ie the type of rdte supportedthose budget activ ities designated as 61 62 and 63 basic

the rdte program budget activities 64 and 65 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components g the joint strike fighter or missile defense systems for which an operati onal need has been determined and an acquisition program established budget activity 67 supports system improvements in existing operational systems budget activity 66 provides management support including support for test and evaluation facilities st funding is of particul ar interest to congress since these funds support the development of new technologie s and the underlying science assuring adequate support for st activities is seen by some in the defense community as imperative to maintaining us military superiority this was of particular concern at time when defense budgets and rdte funding we re falling at the end of the cold war as part of its 2001 quadrennial review dod established goal of stabilizing its base st funding ie title iv at 3 of dods overall funding congress has embraced this goal the fy2008 st funding request in title iv is 108 billion about 25 billion less than what was availa ble for st in title iv in fy2007 not counting st funding requested as part of the gwot request furthermore the st request for title iv is approxima tely 22 of the overall baseline dod budget request not counting funds for the global wa r on terror short of the 3 goal the ability for the administration to meet its 3 goal has been strained in recent years as the overall defense budget continues to rise in the fy2007 defense authorization bill pl 109364 sec 217 congress reite rated its support for the 3 goal extended it to fy2012 and stipulated that if the st budget request does not meet this goal dod submit prioritized list of st projects that were not funded solely due to insufficient resources within the st program basic resear ch 61 receives special attention particularly by the nation s universities dod is not large supporter of basic research when compared to the national institute of health or the national science foundation however over half of dod s basic research budget is spent at universities and represents the major contribution of funds in some areas of science and technology such as elect rical engineering and material science the fy2008 request for basic research 14 billion is roughly 140 million less than what was available for title iv basic

appropriations committee re ported its version of hr 3222 see srept 110155 on september 14 2007 th net effect of the committees recommendations was to reduce title iv rdte by approximately 102 million

budget priorities throughout nasa are being driven by the vision for space exploration announced by president bush in january 2004 and endorsed by congress in the nasa authorization act of 2005 pl

discontinuing its use by the united states by 2017 returning humans to the moon by 2020 and then sending human s to mars and worlds beyond to replace the space shuttle and carry astrona uts to the

increases for programs related to the vision and modest increases or even decreases for other programs the request for constellation systems the prog ram responsible for developing orion and ares i was an increase of 518 million or 203 relative to fy2007 the request for the international space station was an increase of 466 million or 263 meanwhile among programs not focuse d on space exploration the request for science was an increase of 145 million or 27 and the request for aeronautics research was decrease of 163 million or 227 in the final appropriation congress provided smaller increases than requested for constellation systems and the international space station larger in crease for science and smaller decrease for aeronautics research the effect of the vision on science f unding is of partic ular congressional interest for example the house repor t said that the requested budget would sacrifice future missions of discovery to pay for present efforts while the senate report expressed concern that nasa science is being left behind rather than being nurtured and sustained s upport for earth science has b een particular concern in both congress and the scien tific community although the fy2008 request included increased funding for earth science and projected further increases in fy2009 and fy2010 relative to previous plans most of the increases were to cover cost growth and schedule delays in existing missi ons in astrophysics the fy2008 request deferred the space interferometer ssion sim beyond fy2012 the house provided 180 million more than the request for science including 60 million for new earth science missions and 50 million increase for sim the senate provided 102 million more than the request for science with the bulk of the increase

base of 137 billion to the fy2003 level of 271 billion the annual increases for fy 1999 through fy2003 were in the 1415 range each year the research advocacy co mmunity had originally urged that the nih budget grow by about 10 per year in the postdoubling years for fy2004 and fy2005 however congress gave nih increases of between 2 and 3 levels which were below the biomedical inflation index for those two years the advocates modified their recommendation to 6 for fy2006 and to 5 for fy2007 maintaining that such increases would be needed to keep up the momentum of scientific discovery made possible by the increased resources of the doubling years instead the nih appropriation for fy2006 d eclined 03 marking the first decrease in the agencys budget since 1970 the fy2007 final level was 20 increase over fy2006 compared to projected biomedical inflation index of 37 for the year for fy2008 the final funding level is 045 above fy2007 whereas the advocacy community had urged 67 increase in the appropriation as step towards reversing the decline in nihs purchas ing power that has occurred since fy2003 the fy2008 funding represents an estimated 11 decrease from fy2003 in inflationadjusted terms the agencys organization consists of the office of the nih director and 27 institutes and centers the office of the director od sets overall policy for nih and coordinates the programs and activities of all nih co mponents particularly in areas of research that involve multiple in stitutes the individual institutes and centers ics each having focus on particular diseases areas of human health and development or aspects of research s upport plan and manage their own research programs in coordination with the offi ce of the director as shown in table 5 congress provides separate appropriation to 24 of the 27 ics to od and to buildings and facilities account the other three centers not included in the table are funded through the nih management fund fina nced by taps on other nih appropriations the fy2008 presidents request was developed prior to congressional completion of the fy2007 appropriation nd most of the institutes and centers wound up approximately leve lfunded from their fy2007 amounts several of the ics that received increases from congre ss in the fy2007 cr were dropped back in the fy2008 request to levels closer to their fy2006 funding for example the national center for research resources ncrr was given 34 million extra in fy2007 for oneyear shared instrumenta tion grants the fy2008 request decreased the ncrr budget by 19 million the biggest institute the national cancer institute would have been cut by over 10 million 02 in the request the second largest the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid would have been increased by 229 million 53 over fy2007 but only 28 million of that amount was for niaid programs the other 201 milli on of the increase was for transfer to the global fund to fight hivaids tuberc ulosis and malaria mentioned earlier the house and senate laborhhseducation appropriations bills in contrast would have increased funding for most of the institutes and centers over theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34048crs16 fy2007 levels by between 14 and 17 for the house and between 22 and 25 for the senate somewhat larger increases would have gone to several ics in both bills including ncrr and niaid in the fy2008 final appropriation increases for most of the ics were considerably be low 1 and three ics were decreased the two biggest changes in the request and in the appropriation were in the buildings and facilitie s account and in the office of the director many of the laboratories animal facilities and office buildings on the nih campus are aging and are in need of upgrading to stay compliant with health and safety guidelines and to provide the proper infrastructure for the in tramural research program the budget requested 136 million for buildings and f acilities bf an increase of 52 million 63 the final appropriation include d 119 million for bf an increase of 35 million 42 for the office of the director the pr esident and congress handled the funding in two different ways with the presid ent requesting 530 million 51 drop in the account and the appropriation giving 62 million 59 increase the difference reflects change in the way congress funds the nih roadmap for medical research which is set of transnih research ac tivities designed to support highriskhigh impact research in emerging areas of science or public health priorities the initiatives are funded through commo n fund that until fy2007 was supported partially in the od appropriation and partially by contributions from each ic at fixed percentage the original fy 2007 roadmap total of 443 million required 332 million from the institutes and centers 12 tap on their budgets and 111 million from the directors discretionary fund the final fy2007 cr however appropriated 483 million and placed the entire sum in od boosting that appropriation and allowing the ics to use ll of their funding for their own programs without the roadmap tap for transnih re search for fy2008 the request divided planned total of 486 million for the roadmapcommon fund between the ic budgets 364 million 13 tap and od 122 million the house and senate bills supported the common fund entirely in od with the house bill providing 25 increase to 495 million and the sena providing 10 increase to 531 million the final amount in pl 110161 was 496 million also in the od account for the first time in fy2007 was 69 million for the national childrens study this longter m 25 year envir onmental health study was proposed for cancellation in the fy2007 request the multiagency study mandated by the childrens health act of 2000 pl 106310 plans to examine the effects of environmental influences on th health and development of more than 100000 children across the united states follo wing them from before birth until age 21 the overall projected cost for the w hole study is about 27 billion for fy2007 both appropriations committees directed nih to continue with the study and the cr provided the 69 million the fy2008 request again included funding for the study but the final appropriation provi ded 1109 million to od for its continued support the nihs two major concerns in the face of tight budgets are maintaining support of investigatorinitiated research th rough research project grants rpgs and continuing to nourish the pipeline of new investigators the fy2008 request concentrated resources on supporting re search grants planning to fund 10188httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34048crs17 competing rpgs one of the highest numbers ever however th expected success rate of applications receiving funding would have remained at about 20 and scientists with noncompeting continuation grants would not have r eceived inflationary increases for their costs both committee reports indicated that their funding would have supported larger numbe r of grants than the request and would have funded some increases in the aver age costs of grants the explanatory statement for pl 100161 says that it pr ovides funding for low percent increase in the average cost of new as well as noncompeting grants several efforts were focu sed on supporting new inves tigators to encourage young scientists to undertake careers in re search despite the di scouraging financial climate and to help them speed their transition from training to independent research the request and the bills included increases for new types of awards such as the pathway to independence the directors bridge awards and new innovator awards in the common fund the directors pi oneer awards to encourage high risk research were also supported as were clinical research training and the new clinical and translational science awards in the final appropriation the explanatory statement indicates that th pioneer new innovator and bridge awards were funded at fy2007 levels and that the pathways to independence program received funding at the level of the presidents request the biodefense research portfolio was slat ed in the request to increase slightly by cycling onetime extramural construction costs into other research areas the senate bill as reported included legislative language on human embryonic stem cell research expanding access to stem cell lines and tightening ethical guidelines for their use to avoid controversy howev er the provisions were dropped before the bill went to the floor nih and other public health service agencies within hhs are subject to budget tap called the phs program eval uation transfer section 241 of the phs act which has the effect of redistributing appropriate d funds among phs agencies the fy2008 appropriation kept the tap at 24 the same as in fy2007 nih with the largest budget among the phs agencies becomes the largest donor of program evaluation funds and is relatively minor recipient at the end of the 109th congress the house and senate agreed on the first nih reauthorization statute acted since 1993 the nih reform act of 2006 pl 109 482 the law made managerial and orga nizational changes in nih focusing on enhancing the authority and tools for the nih director to do strategic planning especially to facilitate and fund crossin stitute research initiatives it

across industries opponents of the program cited it as pr ime example of corporate welfare whereby the federal government invests in applied research activities that they emphasize should be conducted
