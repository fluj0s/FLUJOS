for business loans in the us economy in traditional supply nd demand framework that takes into consideration the alternate ways to fina nce business and various ways for those controlling capital to invest business large or small with project it thinks will meet its profit requirements consider s internal and external funding sources many times these businesses weigh borrowing money debt against selling an ownership stake those with money to i nvest the current owners friends of the current owners banks pension funds hedg funds trusts mutual funds etc examine the financial returns and risks on loan compare what one company offers against the offers of other firms and examine alternatives to business loans such as consumer loans or government bonds this report analyzes the factors influencing the decision to finance for businesses in general and for small businesses in particular demand for capital business undertakes the projects expected to most increase its value it does this by proceeding with the projects that have the greatest riskadjusted rate of return risky project should be anticipated on average to produce greater yield than riskless inve stment such as us treasury bonds to compensate for the probability of loss or less than expected profit when there are large number of projects that are expected to be profitable after adjusting for risk company will desire to borrow more money than when it finds fewer projects that are profitable after adjusting for risk as the economy fluctuates the supply and demand for loans changes when the economy is growing rapidly typical co mpany will find many more projects that would be profitable than when the economy is growing slowly or even shrinking changes in specific business sectors incr ease or decrease the supply and demand for capital in those business sectors all economic sectors consumers businesses and government at times compete with each other to borrow for various purposes businesses borrow long term to finance plant and equipment and s hort term to obtain working capital to meet payrolls or finance inventory business borrowing is sensitive to interest rates other loan terms such as the life of the loan any collateral and any other restrictions and the economic outlook interest rates matter because the cost of borrowing can be critical in determining whether project will be profitable the economic outlook is more important for longterm borrowing because of its impact on projects profitability frequently these two factors work together an increase in

food other factors influencing business demand are the cost of investme nt goods the durability of the goods and tax treatment of investments businesss alternatives to finance project may depend in part on its size banks other corporations individuals and g overnments make loans many of these lenders have minimum and maximum size loans that they will make some loans could be too small for large lender to process and service some lenders have application or processing fees that could make borrowing small amounts uneconomical these concerns are one reason that the small business administration sba created the microloan program large loans could exceed the financial capacity or legal limits on lending firms can sell bonds to the public in so cases by private placement the advantage to those who purchase bonds is th at unlike many business loans they can be sold in the secondary market for some companies there is ready liquid market for bonds the disadvantage of bonds is that they have high fixed costs as result bond issues typically are for tens of milli ons of dollars this size makes it uneconomical for small businesses to issue bonds consumers and governments compete with businesses to borrow money consumers frequently borrow to purchase hom and consumer durables such as cars and large home appliances1 consumers also borrow to meet short term needs or shortfalls in income in general house hold income is the largest determinant of consumer borrowing other factors that influence the demand for consumer loans include fluctuations in income seasonal fact ors interest rates and expectations about the future governments federal state local and foreign borrow to allow spending to exceed revenues the federal government is relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates state and local governments especially those required to balance their budgets can be sensitive to interest rates foreign governments are sensitive to the inflation interest and exchange rates supply of capital the same sectors individuals companies or governments that borrow also lend f unds sometimes this is done to take advantage of differences in interest rates and in other cases timing differences are important in general the motivation to save depends on curre nt interest rates current and expected future inflati on and the timing of future income and expenditures sometimes financial intermediaries like banks borrow money for the purpose of lending to others for example one business model used by banks is to offer the federal deposit insurance corporations guarantee to collect inexpensive relatively small deposits that are then combined into much larger loans2httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34400crs3 2 continued accounts in this case they are not

rough deposits in banks and other financial intermediaries in addition to traditional deposits such as checking accounts savings accounts and certificates of deposit consumer s have specialized vehicles like individual retirement account s iras and secti on 529 college savings accounts5 governments use financial intermediaries to lend either short or long term for example tax revenues might be put into certificate of deposit for several months before they are used to pay salaries or ot her expenses foreign governments put their money in other countries for variety of reasons including the desire to hold reserves in stronger currencies and greater security over the last few years many governments have created sove reign wealth funds swfs to invest internationally6 debt and equity an alternative to borrowing to finance projects is to find investors to purchase ownership shares or equity the sbas small business investment company sbic program is designed to stimulate private equity investments and longterm loans to small businesses7 there are numerous differences between debt and equity those who hold debt are contractually entitled to specified interest payments for specified time period the principal is repaid according to the loan agreement if company fails to make its payments lenders can force it into bankruptcy and seize the companys assets to pay off the loan sometimes lenders require collateral to secure the debt company might set aside money in sinking fund that is pledged to pay the interest andorhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34400crs4 8 the sba can

7a or 504 guarantee to reduce the loans risk to level that is acceptable8 the sba seeks but does not require to have the business owners pledge real estate or other assets as collateral9 the sba requires holders of at leas t 20 of the ownership of company to personally guarantee the loan holders of common stock usually just called stockholders have claim on specific amount of money they are entitle d to share of profits usually called dividends but management may decide to retain the profits so that the firm can take advantage of good opportunity microsof ts offer to purchase yahoo is case in point microsoft will use some of its retained earnings and borrow the rest shareholders unhappy with this decision ve little recourse unle ss they can convince the board of directors to change its policy some companies issue preferred stock which combines some characteristics of debt and equity preferre d stock promises to pay cer tain dividend it has lower claim on company revenues than bonds but higher claim than common stock preferred stockholders cannot force firm into bankruptcy for failure to pay dividends but common stockholders cannot receive dividend unless the preferred stockholders are paid lastly in the united states business interest payments are tax deductible corporate profits from which dividends are paid are subject to corporate income taxes how do small and large businesses differ for many purposes the small business ad ministration defines small business as one with 500 or fewer employees sma ll businesses by their nature have fewer employees than large firms they have fewer assets less equipment and undertake smaller projects as result representative small business needs to raise less money than large business in the same i ndustry on the one hand small businesses are unable to take advantag of economies of scale in raising capital such as bonds for example small business borrowing 10000 may pay higher interest rate than large business borrowing 10 million on the other hand large businesses may find only few lenders who can accommodate their financing needs whereas small businesses may borrow from one of many lenders those who are concerned about the ava ilability of credit to small businesses frequently suggest number of reasons that small businesses may pay higherhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34400crs5 10 testimony of federal

thought to be more affected by swings in the economy and consequently are riskier small businesses have higher failure rate than comparable larger businesses and conse quently are riskier potential lenders have harder time assessing how creditworthy small business is there are great differences between small businesses in the same industry and many reasons for borrowing money this variation makes it difficult to develop general standards that can be pplied to small businesses there is limited reliable financial information on many small businesses many sm all businesses are young have short credit history and have not been throug h difficult economy most small businesses are privately owned nd do not publish current detailed financial information many sma ll businesses use staff instead of independent accountants to create financial reports small businesses have less collateral than large organizations to pledge for loan than large business this can lead to borrowers and the small business administra tion requiring owners to use personally owned real estate as collateral financial institutions such as commercial banks that have ongoing relationships with small bus iness are considered by many to have an advantage in lending because of their experience working with the small business the history between small business and the bank that serves it gives the bank information on the owners managers markets and potential of the loan applicant that is not available to other lenders this can lead to better lending decisions and may facilitate monitoring the businesss financial healt h which reduces the risk to the lender likely impact of an economic slowdown on small business borrowing an economic slowdown or recession could have severa l impacts on small business borrowing as lenders become more risk averse they could decline to make loans that they would have made in more prosperous times sbahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34400crs6 loan guarantees might offset this caution and help small businesses to expand an economic slowdown could redu ce the riskadjusted profitable opportunities for small businesse s to invest reducing small businesses demand for loans small businesses might become more risk averse and decide not to undertake projects with risk and pr ofit characteristics that previously would have been undertaken the decline in house prices since 2007 is likely to have reduced the collateral value of any real estate owned by small business and of the business owners home the sba seeks but in general does not require collateral for its guarantees figure 1 below illustrates the supply nd demand for capital during times of economic prosperity and sl owdown the supply curve which shows the amount of capital measured on the horizontal axis th at is available in the economy at the interest rates measured on the vertical axis shifts to the left indicating that less capital is available at the same interest rate the demand curve which shows the volume of loans also measured on the horiz ontal axis that business would take out at various interest rates also measured on the vertical axis shifts to the left illustrating that fewer business loans are desi red at the same inte rest rate economists refer to the interest rate where the suppl and demand for business loans is equal as the equilibrium interest

this depends on the steepness of the supply and demand curves and the amount that each shifts if the supply curve shifts more to the left than is drawn or if the demand curve shifts less to the left than is drawn interest rates could rise in this case although supply and demand have both decreased supply declined more th an demand in both cases however loan volume falls monitoring small business borrowing only limited information on small business borrowing is available the federal reserve conducts survey of small bu siness finances and makes report to congress every five years the most r ecent survey was completed in 2003 and the next is being conducted in 2008 the repor t using the 2003 survey was released in 200611 another source is the federal reserve s senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices which is conducted quarterly in january april july and october12 it asks those surveyed about change s in lending terms to small businesses those with annual sales of 50 million or less it also asks about the demand for small business loans given that the federal reserve does not use the sbas industry based definition of small the re sults are more indicative than an exact measure of what is happening to small business lending as viewed by the sba the federal reserve conducts quarterly survey of business lending on loans made by various types of banks to businesses13 some of the information is broken down by the size of the loan 3000 to 99000 100000 to 999999 1000000 to 9999000 and 10000000 and more the survey is released in the last month of the quarter march june september and december the sbas office of advocacy publishe s annual reports on small business lending the most recent is for 200614 upon request the sba may be able to provide information on the vol ume of loan guarantees conclusion precise economic forecasts are frequently difficult to make forecasting the impact of an economic slowdown or rece ssion on the demand for sba guarantees onhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34400crs8 loans to small businesses is particularly difficult for two reasons first the impact on sba guarantees of declining small busin ess investment may or may not be offset by an increase in lenders seeking to avoid risk second there is only limited information on which to base such forecast
