from jonathan t overpeck jtongdcnoaagov to frank oldfield frankoldfieldpagesunibech subject re finances and futures date thu 4 feb 1999 114309 0700 cc messerligiubunibech domraynaudglaciogujfgrenoblefr pederseneosubcca kbriffaueaacuk hi frank and friends im happy to see the budget looking sound and feel franks suggestions are good ones in terms of money to spend this year building on the swiss paleoclimate course is good idea and of course we should decide on future redie investments at future sscs my gut feeling is that redie will have to continue to be lower priority in the future but that we should stay committed to getting scientists including youngsters from developing countries to our science mtgs makes more sense than training probably given tight budgets thankspeck dear colleagues i now share with you some ideas about our financial situation in pages i think the information should be treated confidentially at this stage and certainly with some discretion during the course of last year it was very difficult to keep track of our financial position from month to month partly because it took our financial contacts in the university of bern an inordinately long time to sort out the financial implications of the osm partly because in the course of doing this they made some understandable but very significant and confusing errors niklaus has now managed to sort these out and we also have our confirmed budget for 1999 which means that we can begin to do some real planning the first significant point is that we are carrying over into 1999 surplus some us15k greater than we began with in 1998 in fact we have been building up our carryover steadily since the beginning of 1996 and it is now around 67k between 13 and 14 or our annual budget and much higher proprtion of that part of our budget that is uncommitted each year whilst i believe it would be unwise to eliminate it entirely i do think we should aim to reduce it significantly provided there is good rationale for the means we choose i have attached summary of how i see things for 1999 you will see that even if we spend all the funds committed to workshops at our pallanza meeting we still have very healthy surplus on past experience i do not think this sum will be exceeded during 1999 even if we have one or two more urgent requests they are more than likely to be offset by delayed workshops so i think this is actually likely to be an overestimate moreover i have assumed that all the money allocated by igbp for synthesis will be spent in 1999 we are under some pressure to do this but the pace of the exercise makes suspect that we may have difficulty at the end of the table i list 3 additional commitments i would like to propose for prioiritizing and i discuss each briefly below 1 redie which you may remember stands for regional educational and infrastructure efforts about which we have so far said very little and done even less in this area one of the ideas gently simmering on the back burner has been the notion of winning support from start to run something like summer school for selected young scientists from developing countries this emerged from an informal discussion between ouselves in the office bruno and roland fuchs the director of start when he was over here on visit at the time he seemed quite keen on the idea but has since been silent matter i still feel it is an idea worth working towards at least up to the precommitment stage and i have been exploring informally the possibility of basing such course in london this coming summer i think we may have chance to do kind of partial trial run thomas stocker and andy lotter first class paleolimnologist here in bern plan to run summer school nearby this year thomas approached some time ago to see if pages could support participation by any overseas students and my reply was very cautious one to the effect that we would normally expect to be approached and have an input at the planning stage and that we would only really consider such possibility in the context of training for scientists from developing countries having discussed the whole thing more fully with him i begin to wonder whether it may offer quite an interesting possibility my plan would be to seek nomination ofapplications from say 3 to 5 young scientists from different parts of the developingformer eastern bloc world represnting each of the pep transects and bring them to bern both for the course and for short period linked into the pages office the ideas behind the latter part of the suggestion would be to support their participation if need be give them some sense of pages and its role in nternational global change scienceigbp etc and solicit feedback and advice about what the shape of an ideal course for developing country scientists interested in pages activities might be i believe that even if we did not have something like redie in our implementation plan it should be an important commitment since we do it is an absolute obligation which we ignore at the risk of serious allegations of bad faith 2 i feel there will be need to follow up my pep ii visit to australia with something positive there john dodson is responding well to suggestions about more coordination and bringing in more colleagues to share the responsibility but i think that if whatever we agree in perth is actually to work there will be need to fund workshop as distinct from minisymposium of thematic andor regional coordinators to get their act together we should offer money for this 3 the difference it has made having cathy stickley based at ucl working for pep iii is fantastic but we risk losing her input unless something can be done im negotiating with esf but it will be over year before their finely grinding mills deliver anything rick and francoise are also going to apply to ec for framework 5 funding but that will be quicker i am seriously considering asking zimmie to help bridge the gap since he did not quite close the door when i last talked this through with him but i feel that if i do this pages might need to put up bit more colateral the more so since we are in credit both 2 and 3 reflect my view that the peps remain an absolutely vital part of the pages structure and need to be supported if that is the only way they can achieve their objectives all three of the above suggestions require some endorsement in principle before i take them any further if we were to spend all the funds envisaged before the end of 1999 our budget credit would be very much reduced probably by too much but i believe the pep funding would probably be paced over longer period and that the other items in our budget are more likely to be marginally under than overspent so i do not feel we are proposing any unreasonable risk i look forward to any reactions members of excomm may have to these suggestions withh all good wishes frank
