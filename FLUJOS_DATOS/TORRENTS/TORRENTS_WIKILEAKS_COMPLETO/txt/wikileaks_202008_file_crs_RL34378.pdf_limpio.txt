the security forces and progovernment gangs of targeting their supporters and family members 11 the government also initiated number of media restrictions and banned demonstrations although opposition supporters launched another threeday protest in midjanuary on january 16 the opposition took to the streets in over dozen locations throughout kenya several people were killed and many more injured opposition supporters have also engaged in targeted attacks against government supporters in number of communities in kenya people have been burned to death and hacked by machetes some observers have described the violence as tribal conflict between the presidents kikuyu ethnic group and the luo and kalenjin ethnic groups indeed kikuyus were principal targets in some areas although the luo and other ethnic groups were also targeted by the security forces and by kikuyu groups kenyan civil society and human rights advocates argue that it is mistake to simply describe the current violence as tribal conflict since the trigger and the reason behind the violence for many kenyans is the rigged elections and what they fear is return to dictatorship opposition leaders and their supporters strongly believe that the election was stolen from them and they consider reversing the current trend in kenya as necessary in order to ensure that the gains made in democracy over the past decade would not be lost some kenyans view the violence in some places as driven by economic factors rather than ethnic or political the victims of some of the violent attacks have been wea lthy or middle class kenyans from diverse ethnic backgrounds the last major ethnic violence before an election was in 1992 in that particular case the violence was triggered over land dispute between the kalenjin and the luo g15g142g141g146g138g157g146g152g151g561g7g143g143g152g155g157g156g561 international efforts to bring negotiated settlement failed in the initial phase of the crisis the african union the

maintained fairly stable political system in region marred by civil strife and political violence although it was governed under oneparty rule until 1992 kenya had relatively open political system

multi party election in almost 26 years president moi defeated opposition candidates by small margin his party the kenya african national union kanu also won majority in the 210seat parliament despite the defeat of several senior kanu officials by littleknown opposition candidates the three major opposition parties the forum for restoration of democracykenya fordkenya fordasili and the democratic party dp each received substantial votes but fell short of expectations in 1997 kenya held its second multiparty elections at the height of tensions between the opposition and the ruling party president moi was reelected with 40 of the votes cast while his nearest rival mwai kibaki won 31 the ruling party kanu won 107 seats in the 222 member parliament 12 seats out of the 222 are appointed by the president while the opposition secured the remaining 103 seats international and kenyan election observers said that while there were some irregularities the results of the elections reflected the wishes of most kenyans the victory by moi was largely due to divisions within the opposition and the inability of the opposition to back single candidate against moi the opposition learned from its mistakes and in 2002 it succeeded in forming and holding together coalition known as narc national rainbow coalition that ousted kanu from power by wide margins narc won 132 seats in parliament compared with kanus 67 while kibaki defeated uhuru kenyatta of jomo kenyatta for the presidency with 62 majority moi had designated kenyatta as the kanu candidate for president in october 2002 prompting raila odinga who had sought the nomination to leave kanu and with other defectors form the liberal democratic party kibakis national alliance of kenya nak courted these kanu defectors and in november 2002 nak and the ldp agreed to create narc nak is itself coalition including kibakis democratic party and 12 other parties which typically have an ethnic or regional base president kibaki announced his cabinet on january 3 2003 consisting of longtime opposition figures and also senior members of kanu president kibaki had to take several factors into consideration in the sele ction of his cabinet members including ethnic balance technical skills and government experience as well as rewarding old and new political allies

serious problem although the kibaki government has taken number of measures to deal with this problem tackling corruption is another serious challenge facing new government in kenya rooting out official corruption may require removing seni or members of the government from power and prosecution of former senior government official s several ministers were forced to resign in 2006 and the kibaki administration faced serious allegations of corruption the resignation of the finance minister in february 2006 for alleged corruption was seen by some as an important step in fighting official corruption in kenya ho wever the clearing of the energy minister from corruption charges raised serious doubt about the governments resolve to fight corruption in early 2005 the governments anticorruption chief resigned from his position arguing that the kibaki government is not serious about fighting corruption and accusing number of senior officials of corruption 13 the united states britain and other donor governments have also made similar accusations14 in october 2006 attorney general amos wako declared that he will not prosecute suspects in the corruption case against angloleasing british firm according to wako successful prosecution will not be possible because of number of material and significant gaps constitutional reform had been the rallying cry for opposition groups prior to the 2002 elections as part of preelection agreement reached among the key players within narc proposed new constitution would create position of prime minister with executive powers reportedly leaders from the main opposition groups agreed that this position would go to raila odinga one of the major political figures within narc the constitutional drafting process was marred by delays changes and serious disagreement with in narc president kibaki and his supporters managed to get draft approved in process seen by some senior members of narc as undemocratic these members campaigned against the draft constitution arguing that the agreement reached earlier was violated and in november 2005 kenyans defeated the draft constitution in national referendum 15 in late 2005 number of senior officials left narc and formed the orange democratic party odmthe defeat of the 2005 draft constitution signaled that president kibaki had lost the support of many kenyans who once gave strong support to narc president kibakis credibility was further shaken in february 2006 by the resignation of three ministers on corruption allegations following these events some observers asserted that president kibaki would struggle to complete his term however the formation of new party narckenya appears to have altered the kenyan political landscape narckenya formally launched in june 2006 replaced narc and demonstrated its political strength by winning three of the five parliamentary seats in the july 24 2006 byelections in september 2007 president kibaki

victory in 2002 had positive impact in kenya as well as in africa generally the smooth transfer of power and the transparency in the conduct of the elections indicated that democracy can flourish in africa for example the power of incumbency and the entrenched clout of ruling party did not stop an opposition victory in kenya the lessons learned from the 2002 kenyan elections are many and could strengthen democracy movements elsewhere in africa kenya is also key player in regional affairs having hosted negotiations on sudan and somalia kenya is home to many refugees from uganda sudan and somalia in recent months kenya has come under criticism from the united nations and human rights groups for barring additional somali refugees the government of kenya handed over more than 40 somalis to the transitional federal government of somalia tfg and the ethiopian government human rights groups ar concerned that some of these individuals would be tortured or killed in addition kenyan muslim
