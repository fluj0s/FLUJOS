foreign investment plays in the us economy and an assessment of possible ac tions foreign inve stor or group of foreign investors might choose to take to liquidate thei r investments in the united states concerns over the potential impact of disinvestment have grown as national governments have become mo re active investors and as uncertainty over the risks associated with securities backed by subprime mortgages has increased volatility in financial markets actions taken by fore ign investors to liquidate their holdings could affect the us economy in number of ways due to the role foreign investment plays in the united states and due to the current mix of economic policies the united states has chosen the impact of any ch action on the economy would also depend on the overall condition and performance of the economy and the financial markets if the economy were experiencing strong rate of economic growth the impact of foreign withdrawal likely would be minimal especially given the dynamic nature of credit markets if withdrawal occu rred when the economy were not experiencing robust rate of growth or if credit financial markets were under duress the withdrawal could have stronger effect on the economy the particular course of action foreign investors might choose to take and the overall strength and performance of the ec onomy at the time of their actions could affect the economy in different ways c ongress likely would become involved as result of its direct role in making economic policy and its oversight role over the federal reserve in addition the actions of foreign investors could complicate domestic economic policymaking foreign investors who decide to liquidate their holdings of one particular ty pe of investment would norma lly need to look for other types of assets to acquire while there are multitude of possible strategies foreign investors could pursue this analysis asse sses the impact of four of the most likely strategies single large foreign investor or group of foreign investors could choose to employ to reduce or withdraw entirely their holdings of us financial assets rapid liquidation of us treasury securities shift in the makeup of

of the inte rnational investment position by james k jacksonforeign ownership of us financial assets implications of withdrawal overview foreign capital inflows are playing an important role in the economy such inflows bridge the gap between us supplies and demands for credit thereby allowing consumers and busine sses to finance purchases at interest rates that are lower than they would be without overseas capital inflows similarly capital inflows allow federal state and cal governments to finance th eir budget deficits at rates that are lower then they would be otherwise these foreign capital inflows allow the nation to support expenditures exceeding its cu rrent output level and finance its trade deficit sharp reduction in those infl ows likely would complicate domestic efforts at making and conduc ting economic policies to date the world economy has benefi tted from the stimulus provided by the nations combination of fis cal and monetary policies and trade deficit foreign investors now hold slightly less than 50 of the publicly held and publicly traded us treasury securities 25 of corporat bonds and about 12 of us corporate stocks1 the large foreign accumulation of us secur ities has spurred some observers to argue that this foreign presen ce in us financial markets increases the risk of financial crisis whether as result of the uncoordina ted actions of market participants or by coordi nated withdrawal from us fi nancial markets by foreign investors for economic or political reasons concerns are also growing that over the long run us economic policies and the accompanying large deficit in its international trade accounts could ve negative impact on global economic developments especially for the ec onomically less deve loped countries some observers are concerned that fore ign investor with significant holdings in the united states or group of foreign investors could engage in an abrupt and largescale liquidation of dollardenominated securities particularly selloff of us treasury securities these observers argue that the vast sums of dollars held and managed by some foreign governments rmed sovereign wealth funds raise the prospects of such coordinated withdraw because the funds potentially increase the ability of foreign governments to instigate rapid withdrawal it is uncertain though what types of events could pr ovoke coordinated w ithdrawal from us securities markets although unlikely c oordinated withdrawal from us financial markets potentially could be staged by foreign investors for economic or political reasons or it could arise from sharp drop in us equity prices as result of an uncoordinated correction in market prices also concerns over the ability of the federal government to service its foreign debt and loss of confidence in the abilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34319crs2 of national us policy ma kers to conduct economic po licies that are perceived abroad as prudent and stabilizing could spur some foreign investors to reassess their estimates of the risks involved in holding do llardenominated assets in other cases international linkages that connect national capital ma rkets could be the conduit through which events in one market are qui ckly spread to other markets and ignite an abrupt seemingly uncoordinated withdr awal of capital such concerns have increased as financial markets have attempted to reprice the perceived risks and uncertainty associated with securities backed by subprime mortgages liquidation of capital could be limited to one segment of the credit markets as one foreign investor or group of foreign investors attempted to adjust the composition of their portfolios withdr awal also could mark major shift in investment strategies by foreign inve stors as they shifted away from dollar denominated securities short of financial crisis events that cause some foreign investors to adjust their portfolios likel would have shortrun negative effects on us interest rates and on the international exchange value of the dollar however should large group of foreign investors ma ke permanent shift in their strategies to limit or to reduce their purchases of u s securities such actions likely would complicate efforts to finan ce budget deficits given the current mix of economic policies the loss of capital inflows would affect us interest rates domestic investment and the longterm rate of growth of the economy such loss of capital inflows would be especially troublesome if it occurred during time when concerns over the rate of growth in the economy were increasing during periods when the rate of economic growth is slowing the federal reserve generally resorts to reducing interest rates to s timulate the economy however the loss of capital inflows would tend to push the federal reserve to raise interest rates to attract more capital inflows congress likely would find itself embroiled in any such economic or financial crisis through its direct role in conducting fiscal policy and in its indirect role in the conduct of monetary policy through its supervisory re sponsibility over the federal reserve some observers are also concerned that recent developments in the financial system have increased the possibility of financial crisis they contend that such crisis could damage the international fina ncial system in the short run and could potentially affect the performance of indi vidual economies the rapid expansion of market activity through the consolidation of equity exchanges and the development of complex financial instruments and hybrid securities that are traded across national borders has spurred some analysts to stion whether the market and financial innovations have outpaced the efforts of regu lators for instance concerns about the risks of subprime mortgagebacked securities has eroded some investors confidence in the underlying stability of some segments of the global financial system as result some observers argue that improvements in the financial system that arise from greater market efficiencies by spreading risk across national borders may be blunted because the underlying risks of certa in widely traded fi nancial instruments have become more difficult to assess consequently some commentators maintain that the risks of domestic financial cr isis spreading across national borders have become more pervasive because of the rapid internationalization of financial services others note that by expanding into financial activities that were not part of the original core business of financial servi ces providers may be exposed to new and additional types of risk for which they are not well prepared according to the imfhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34319crs3 2 op cit global financial stability report p 107there is little empirical evidence to date to determine whether crossborder diversification of financial institutions reduces or increases firmspecific or systemic vulnerabilities2 foreign investment in the us economy capital flows are highly liquid can re spond abruptly to changes in economic and financial conditions and exercise primary influence on exchange rates and through those rates onto global flows of goods and services as indicated in figure 1 these capital inflows are composed of official inflows primarily foreign governments purchases of us treasury securities and private inflows composed of portfolio investment wh ich includes foreigners purchases of us treasury and corporate securities financial liabil ities and direct investment in us businesses and real estate in 1996 total foreign capital inflows to the united states reached over 551 billion but by 2000 foreign capital infl ows totaled more than 1 trillion as indicated in table 1 such inflows were reduced in 2001 and 2002 as the growth rate of the us economy slowed but grew to over 18 trillion in 2007 as the rate of economic growth improved private capita l inflows comprise more than three fourths of the total capital inflows with foreign purchases of corporate securities stocks and bonds being the main component s of these inflows in 2007 official inflows attributed to foreign government s accounted for 22 of total foreign capital inflows down slightly from the share recorded in 2006 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006

19962007httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34319crs4 economists generally attribute the rise in foreign investment in the united states to comparatively favorable returns on investments relative to risk surplus of saving in other areas of the world the welldevel oped us financial sy stem and the overall stability of the us economy these net capital infl ows inflows net of outflows bridge the gap in the united states betw een the amount of credit demanded and the domestic supply of funds likely keeping u s interest rates below the level they would have reached without the foreign capita l these capital inflows also allow the united states to support expenditures exceed ing its current output level and finance its trade deficit because foreigners are w illing to lend to the united states in the form of exchanging goods represented by us imports for such us assets as stocks bonds and us treasury securities such inflows however put upward pressure on the dollar which tends to push up the price of us exports relative to its imports and to reduce the overall level of exports furthermore foreign investment in the us economy drains off some of the income earned on the foreignowned assets that otherwise would accrue to the us economy as foreign investors repatriate their earnings back home table 1 capital inflows to the united states 19962007 in billions of dollars year totalofficial

as whole must equal the supply of funds deficit in one sector must be offset by surplus in another sector generally the household sector or indi viduals provides funds to the economy because individuals save part of their income while the business sector uses those funds to invest in plant and equipment that in turn serve as the building blocks for the production of additional goods and rvices the government sector the combination of federal state and local g overnments can be ither net supplier of funds or net user depending on whether the sector is running surplus or deficit

households over the state of the economy the federal reserve has reported4 that in the first quarter of 2008 households experi enced drop in their net worth of 17 trillion as the flow of funds data indicate foreign capital inflows augment domestic us sources of capital which in turn keep us interest rates lower than they would be without the foreign capital indeed economists generally argue that it is this interplay between the demand for and the s upply of credit in the economy that drives the broad inflows and outflows of capital as us demands for capital outstrip domestic sources of funds domes tic interest rates rise relative to those abroad which tends to draw capital away from othe r countries to the united states foreign and domestic sources of funds the united states also has benefitted from surplus of saving over investment in many areas of the world that has provided supply of funds and accommoda ted the overall shortf all of saving in the country this surplus of saving has been available to the united states because foreigners have remained willing to loan that saving to the united states in the form of acquiring us assets which have accommodated the growing current account deficits over the past decade the united states experienced decline in its rate of saving and an increase in the rate of domestic investment the large increase in the nations current account ficit would not have been possible without the accommodating inflows of foreign capital foreign capital inflows while important do not fully replace or compensate for lack of domestic sources of capital capital mobility has increased sharply over the last 20 years but economic analysis shows that nations rate of capital formation or domestic investment seems to be linked primarily to its domestic rate of saving this phenomenon was first presented in paper published in 1980 by martin feldstein and charles horioka5 the feldsteinhorioka paper maintained that despite the dramatic growth in capital flows between nations international capital mobility remains somewhat limited so that nations rate of domestic investment is linked to its domestic rate of saving6httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34319crs8 6 continued argue that shortterm capital flows among th major developed economies are highly liquid perhaps too liquid and seem to be driven as much by shortterm economic events and speculation as they are by longer term economic trends foreign capital and the value of the dollar liberalized capital flows and floating exchange rates have grea tly expanded the amount of capital flows between countries these capital trans actions are undertak in response to commercial incentives or political considerations that are independent of the overall balance of payments or of particular acc ounts as result of these transactions national economies have become more closely linked the process some refer to as globalization the data in table 3 provide

inflows is the impact such capital flows have on the international exchange value of the dollar demand for us assets such as financial secu rities translates into dema nd for the dollar because us

foreign investor or group of foreign investors could employ to reduce or withdraw entirely their holdings of financial asse ts in the united states these strategies include rapid liquidation of us treasury securities shift in the makeup of foreign investors portfolios among various dollardenominated assets rapid shift from dollardenominated assets to assets denominated in other currencies and slow shift in the makeup of future accumulations of assets away from dollardenominated assets to assets denominated in currencies other than the dollar sudden withdrawal from us treasury securities the large holdings of us treasury securities by foreign governments have led some observers to consider the prospect of withdrawal fro m the us treasury securities market by single foreign government at the firs t hint that foreign government was attempting to liquidate all or even larg part of its holdings of us treasury securities the price of such treasury securities likely would plummet in us

rate would push the federal reserve to raise key us interest rates sparked drop in prices in us capital and equity markets where inflation concerns quickly spread to markets in europe and as ia as equity prices fell in those markets as well16 if foreign investor with large us holdings or group of foreign investors attempted to launch withdrawal from us treasury securities investors and other market participants would calculate quickly the expected effects of those intended actions on market prices interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar and would then act swiftly on those anticipated eff ects as result the prices of treasury securities likely would drop sharply while in terest rates would ri because the price of such securities is inversel related to the interest rate in addition the dollar likely would fall in value relative to other currencies because the shift away from dollar denominated assets would increase demand for and the prices of other currencies relative to the dollar consequently the drop in the price of treasury securities and the drop in the exchange value of the do llar would significantly discount the value of any treasury securities that would be so ld and sharply reduce the proceeds for any investor participating in such selloff as result the potentially large financial losses that would attend an attempt to liquidate assets rapidly are likely to dissuade most investors from employing such strategy the drop in the prices of treasury secu rities and the decline in the exchange value of the dollar however probably w ould be shortlived foreign investors selling treasury securities presumably woul d do so in order to acquire nondollar denominated assets such shift in demand from us treasury securities to other foreign securities would drive up the prices of those securities and the exchange value of foreign currencies as result the lower prices for treasury securities and for the dollar would offer other investor s arbitrage and inve stment opportunities to acquire assets that invest ors likely would deem to be temporarily undervalued as result investors likely would move to acquire treasury securities and the dollar which means that demand would increase for both the lowpriced treasury securities and the lowervalued dollar which would dr ive up the prices of both assets such response could significantly blunt or even entirely reverse the initial drop in priceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34319crs12 17 for more information see crs report rs21102 international capital flows following the september 11 attacks by james k jacksonof the securities and of the dollar given the dynamic nature of finance and credit markets and the instantaneous communicati on of information such actions likely would occur within very short time frame for instance fears spread rapidly after the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 2001 that foreig ners would curtail their purchases of us financial assets and reduce the total inflow of capital into the us economy following the attacks foreign government s and private investors did reduce their purchases of treasury securities from preatt ack levels and the value of the dollar fell relative to other major currencies these effects were fully reversed within 30 days however as currency traders forged shortlived agreement not to profit from the attacks and the federal re serve undertook actions on its own and in concert with central bankers and financ ial ministers around the globe to ensure the smooth operation of the international financial markets17 similarly the federal reserve likely would not be expected to sit by idly while foreign investors attempted coordinated withdrawal from us equity markets if those actions threatened to undermine the stability of the markets the overall performance of the us ec onomy at the time of any attempted withdrawal would also influence the ec onomic effect of the withdrawal for instance if the us economy were experi encing robust rate of economic growth the impact of withdrawal by foreign inve stors likely would be minimal both in the short run and in the long run however if such withdrawal were to occur at time when the us economy were not experienci ng robust rate of economic growth or if the us credit and financial markets were under duress such withdrawal may well have more pervasive effect by undermining investors confidence in the stability and performance of the markets and could result in higher interest rates and lower exchange value of the dollar over the short run and prolong the adjustment process in addition actions that chan ge foreign investors assessment of the underlying risks of the financial system or that undermine foreign investors confidence in the stability of the financial system could prod some foreign investors to reassess the composition of their portfolios for instance at the time of the rumored chinese withdrawal from us securities us financial markets already were strained by concerns over the impact of record oil prices and potentially large losses associated with subprime mortgaged backed securities as result the do w jones industrial average of us stocks moved erratically through the end of november 2007 by the end of november 2007 the dow was down nearly 290 points from where it had been following the loss of 360 points on november 7 2007 diversify portfolios among dollardenominated assets another possible course of action some foreign investors could pur sue would be to diversify abruptly the composition of their portfolios by replacing sizeable portion of their holdings of us treasury securities with other dollardenominated assets as foreign investors traded treasury securitie s for other assets the price of treasuryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34319crs13 securities would decline and the prices of other assets would rise as demand shifted away from treasury securities and toward other dollardenominated assets because total demand for dollardenominated assets would remain constant there likely would be little movement in the exchange value of the dollar but the shift of demand would alter the relative prices of various dom estic assets such shifts in demand are not rare occurrence but happen frequently as investors change their evaluations of the relative value of corporate equities corporate bonds and treasury securities and in response to changes in economic polic ies and actions by the federal reserve if foreign investors attempt to alter abruptly the composition of their portfolios away from treasury securities the prices of such securities would fall and the prices of corporate bonds and equities would ri reflecting the shift in demand if investors perceived this shif t in demand and therefore th shift in prices as one time adjustment in the composition of foreig n investors portfolios some investors likely would take advantage of the rise in prices in equities and bonds to sell their holdings and take their profits at what likely would be percei ved to be overvalued prices and conversely buy treasury s ecurities at what they would view as temporarily undervalued prices after these adjustments market prices likely would settle at prices that would be close to or equal to those that had existed prior to the original shift in dema nd by foreign investors shift away from dollardenominated assets another course of action some foreign investors coul d pursue would be to pare down their holdings of dollar denominated assets through relatively swif t liquidation of part of their holdings of dollardenominated assets in this case single foreign investor or group of foreign investors would sell off part of their holdings of such dollardenominated assets as corporate stocks and bonds or treasury securities and possibly even direct investments investments in us businesses and real tate although selling direct investments in this manner seems less likely given the generally longrun strategies investors use in acquiring them if some foreign investors attempted to accomplish such readjustment in their portfolios quickly by liquidating portion of their holdings of corporate stocks and bonds and of treasury securities the prices of those assets would fall given the current pervasiv role foreign investors play in most us financial markets in addition because the foreign invest ors would be liquidating their dollar denominated assets in order to acquire ssets denominated in other currencies the exchange value of the dollar would fall relative to the price of foreign currencies the drop in the prices of dollardenominat ed equities and bonds combined with the lower exchange value of the dollar would er ode the expected profits of any investor selling such securities and likely would attract the interest of other foreign investors who presumably could liquidate their now higherpriced foreign securities and leverage their now highervalued foreig n currency to acquire dollardenominated assets furthermore us multinational firms may well take advantage of the higher valued foreign currency to repatriate part of the profits of their foreign affiliates which would boost the balance sheet of th eir us parent company possibly even using the repatriated profits to acquire thei r own stock such repa triated profits likely would put upward pressure on the exchange value of the dollar because foreign earnings would have to be converted into dollars befo re they were repatriated similarly foreign firms operating in the united states likely would retain their profitshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34319crs14 rather than suffering loss in value by translating those profits into higher priced foreign currencies in order to repatriate their profits back to their foreign parent company presumably such profits could be used to augment investments within the united states slow shift away from dollardenominated assets finally some foreign investors could decide to shif t away from dollardenominated assets by engaging in longterm shift in the rate at which they accumulate such assets such strategy would have the bene fit of avoiding the large shortrun shifts in the prices of financial assets and in the exchange value of the dollar that would attend any attempt by group of foreign investors to make rapid adjustment in the composition of their portfolios decrease in the inflow of capital from abroad would reduce the domestic availability of capital and place upward pressure on credit and financial assets as interest rates would rise to equate the demand and supply of credit for the us economy as whole longterm shift away from dollar denominated assets by foreign investors c ould have slightly negative impact on the economy over the long run given the current mix of economic po licies reduction in the inflow of foreign investment would tend to push down the prices of stocks and bonds and push up interest rates since thos wanting credit would be competing for smaller pool of funds the price of tr easury securities would fall as the federal government would be required to raise interest rates in order to attract domestic and foreign investors to acquire treasury securities which would raise the cost of financing the federal gove rnments budget deficit in addition the shift from dollardenomin ated assets would tend to push up the exchange value of foreign currencies relative to that of the dollar because an increase in demand for foreign assets would also raise demand for foreign currencies the lowervalued dollar would raise the price of us imports pa rticularly of raw materials and manufactured goods which would put upw ard pressure on consumer and wholesale prices and tend to affect mo st negatively those sectors of the economy that are especially sensitive to moveme nts in interest rates the housing and automobile sectors the decline in the international exchange value of the dollar also would tend to favor those industries and sect ors of the economy that export as long as the international exchange value of the dollar remained relatively low compared with other currencies the exported g oods sectors of the economy likely would expand by attracting more capital and labor and the imported goods sector of the economy would decline assuming that ll other things in the economy remained constant conclusions it is not uncommon for investors to adju st the composition of their portfolios as economic and financia l conditions change given the recent surge in foreign investors accumulation of dollars and dollardenominated assets it is not unreasonable to expect that from time to time they will also attempt to adjust the composition of their portfolios between co rporate stocks and bonds us treasury securities and direct investments in us businesses and real estate longterm shift away from dollardenominated assets however could have negative effect on the longterm rate of inves tment productively and the ra of growth in the us economy such shift in the value of the dollar would tend over the long run tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34319crs15 benefit the exported goods sector of the ec onomy but it could also complicate efforts to conduct domestic economic policies although there are numerous other currencies that might attract investors the dollar continues to be the most widely traded currency around the globe which mean s it likely will retain its desirability as an investment asset and as medium of exchange for some time to come also the vast and deep capital markets in the united states combined with the highly developed banking and legal systems continue to make investments in us financial assets attractive to foreign investors desp ite shortrun changes in perceptions of risk or economic performance should foreign investor with large fi nancial holdings in the united states or group of investors attempt to liquidate ab ruptly their holdings of assets such as treasury securities they would experience severe loss in the value of those assets first as they attempted to sell their large holds in the market and then as they attempted to convert their do llar holdings into other currenc ies as result of these losses it seems unlikely that foreign investor with large holdings or group of foreign investors would attempt to liquidate their securities quickly more likely course of action would be fo r foreign investors to adjust the composition of their portfolios slowly over time if only one or few foreign investors enga ged in strategy to liquidate part of their us financial holdings their actions alone are likely to have limited impact on the economy over the short run because market forces would be expected to adjust to attract other foreign investors to replace those who had withdrawn however if broad range of foreign i nvestors for whatever reason decided to reduce their holdings of dollardenominated assets interest rates in the united states likely would rise in response to market fo rces that would place them above the level where they would have been if the foreign capital inflows had remained at their higher levels higher level of interest rates would lead some firms to reduce their level of borrowing and i nvesting and spur some hous eholds to curtail their consumption especially of such inte rest sensitive products as housing and automobiles which usually are financed over long periods of time over the long run the lower level of investme nt by firms could be expected to result in lower rate of growth in productivity and therefore in lower rate of growth in the economy in addition if foreign inve stors were to attempt an abrupt adjustment to the composition of their portfolios that disrupt ed the financial mark ets or the broader economy the federal reserve would not be expected to stand idly by on the sidelines in such circumstances the federal reserve has shown some agility in intervening on its own to stabilize credit markets and to move in coordination with other central banks on december 11 2007 for instance the federal reserve decreased the federal funds rate and the di scount rate on loans between banks by quarter of percentage point to ease credit conditions then on december 12 2007 the federal reserve announced that it would make 40 billion and perhaps more available to commercial banks in shortterm loans to ease domestic liquidity issues and another 24 billion available to europ ean central banks that had become so concerned about potential losse s from us mortgagebacked securities that they had begun to hoard cash and were unwilling to make loans to each other except

markets to ensure stability likely makes prolonged financial crisis arising from liqui dation of financial ssets by one foreign investor or group of foreig n investors unlikely even if those investors are foreign governments
