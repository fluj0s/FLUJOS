of april 2001 between the united states and the peoples republic of china prc involved collision over the south china sea between us navy ep3 reconnaissance plane and peoples liberation army pla naval f8 fighter that crashed after surviving the nearfatal accident the us crew made an emergency landing of their damaged plane onto the plas lingshui airfield on hainan island and the prc detained the 24 crew members for 11 days washington and beijing disagreed over the cause of the accident the release of the crew and plane whether washington would apologize and the prcs right to inspect the ep 3 in the longer term the incident has implications for the right of us and other nations aircraft to fly in international airspace near china this crs report first issued on april 20 2001 includes an update on the later ep3 recovery the incident prompted assessments about prc leaders their hardline position and their claims while some speculated about pla dominance president and central military commission chairman jiang zemin and his diplomats were in the lead while pla leaders followed in stance with more inflammatory rhetoric still the pla is likely to benefit from this incident despite prc claims that the ep3 plane caused the accident it appears that the pla pilot executing close pass in an apparent attempt to impress or intimidate the ep3 crew made fatal error in judgment international law is clear that all aircraft have right of overflight with respect to ocean areas beyond the territorial sea past 12 miles out there are implications for us policy toward the prc and taiwan and defense policy this incident of april 2001 is the third in series of major troubling difficulties since the mid1990s that could have serious implications for usprc relations the standoff raised questions about whether the issues of the incident and arms sales to taiwan should be linked and whether to change the process of annual arms sales talks with taipei further worsening of political ties could negatively affect the business climate in china for us firms and disrupt negotiations over chinas wto accession airborne reconnaissance remains vital component of intelligence collection for military and other national security purposes observers speculate that the chief benefit to the prc from inspecti ng the ep3 would be to gather information about us targets and degree of success that could enable them to prepare countermeasures to hinder future us surveillance efforts the incident has potential implications for us military surveillanc operations in at least four areas operational strain on the ep3 fleet conditions for conducting airborne surveillance missions in the future the need for escorts or other protective forces and using unmanned air vehicles uavs

publicly reported that there was collision between us and prc military aircraft the prc said that the collision occurred at 0907 that morning beijing and local time 104

of the prcs hainan island over the south china sea the prc issued the announcement about 13 hours after the collision from the beginning the prcs statements blamed the us side for the collision the prc foreign ministry claimed that the ep3 suddenly turned toward the pla fighters and that the ep3s nose and left wing collided with the pla fighter causing it to crash the prc also accused the ep3 of entering chinas territorial airspace without permission and landing at lingshui airport on hainan island at 0933 26 minutes later when the us plane made its emergency landing while detaining the 24 us crew members on the island the prc declared that it made appropriate arrangements for them4 the new george w bush administration faced its first major foreign policy crisis and us interests focused on the return of the crew in hawaii on the morning of april 1 2001 about 18 hours after the collision admiral dennis blair commanderinchief us pacific command cincpac in hawaii issued press statement and held press conference5 he reported that the ep3 surveillance aircraft was on routine operation in international airspace over the south china sea about 70 miles off hainan island when it was intercepted by pla fighters and one of them bumped into the wing of the ep3e aircraft the ep3s pilot declared mayday and safely made an emergency landing at lingshui on hainan island admiral blair declared that the plane has sovereign immunity and the prc may not board it or keep it he expressed frustration at the lack of cooperation from the prc in returning the crew and the plane and at the prcs denial to the crew of phone calls to us officials or families the crews last message from the plane to the pacific command simply said weve landed and were okay blair said that the prc did not notify the american side but that us representatives contacted prc officials who then reported that the crew members were safe while saying that us reconnaissance operations and the plas interceptions are routine adm blair revealed that the pla fighters engaged in pattern of increasingly unsafe behavior he disclosed that us officials had already protested to the prc that pla pilots starting several months ago displayed flying professionalism that was dangerous to them and to us planes moreover adm blair responded to and disputed the prcs version of events that the us aircraft abruptly turned into the pla fighter and caused the collision he stressed that an ep3e is about the size of say 737 it flies generally about 300 knots the chinese aircraft is about like an f16 its fighter aircraft it flies at about twice that speed big airplanes like this fly straight and level on their path the ep3e according to blair was just chugging along in broad daylight as deputy secretary of state richard

servicemen and women and they need to come home the message to the chinese is we should not let this incident destabilize relations17 meanwhile the pentagon indicated that the 1998 military maritime consultative agreement not commission between usprc militaries loose framework to talk about how to avoid incidents at sea and in the air might provide basis for discussing the collision and administration officials hinted at progress through intensive diplomacy in both capitals18 moreover us officials began to provide information and photographs showing that the plan pilot who was lost

china it was on an overt reconnaissance mission and the plane was unarmed without fighter escorts they point out that aircraft of all countries have the right to fly in international airspace commonly recognized as 12 miles beyond the coast point obscured by the prc they also say that the prc itself has flown reconnaissance missions in international airspace china has at least one yun8 reconnaissance plane33 speaking after the crews release from china and ahead of the april 18th meeting deputy secretary of state richard armitage listed the first us priority as asserting to the prc the right of countries to fly in international airspace armitage stressed that we have right six other countries in asia including the prc fly reconnaissance flights in international airspace second armitage stressed that the united states seeks the return of its ep3 plane our point of view is that it is an 80 million aircraft its ours and that the chinese have responsibility to return it to us third armitage noted that the united states has an interest in productive positive relationship with the prc he said i think we will want to see if there is way we can talk about the recent problems we have had in nonpolemical setting to try to make sure we dont conflict in the future34 update on the ep3s recovery and payment issue after the ep3 crews safe return the united states and china negotiated the return of the us plane with prc cooperation us technicians from lockheed martin manufacturer of ep3es arrived on hainan to assess the damaged aircraft on may 1 after the us military on may 7 resumed reconnaissance flights off chinas coast with an air force rc135 the prc declared that it would not allow the ep3 to fly home on its own however the pentagon said on may 15 that the ep3 is definitely repairable to be flown and that would be the united states preferred option as the simplest fastest and least expensive way to recover the plane still on may 29 the us embassy in beijing announced an agreement whereby the ep3 would be disassembled and transported back to the united states on large russian an124 cargo plane35 on june 13 the us pacific command announced that it began

with pla officers from beijing not local officers at lingshui on hainan showing the centralized nature of critical decisionmaking in china there was remaining issue over payment for costs involved in the incident vice president cheney had told fox news sunday on april 29 that the united states was prepared to pay only for legitimate costs associated with recovering the ep3 such as transportation costs according to the pacific air forces briefing the prc tried but could not run up the bill and the runway at lingshui airfield already had existing defects on june 30 the prc billed the united states about 1 million for what us officials called highly exaggerated charges including expenses associated with the detention of the us crew37 on july 17 congressman lantos introduced hr 2507 to prohibit payment to the prc for costs for the crews detention or the aircrafts return until the prc first reimburses the united states for our costs on july 18 representative delay offered an amendment to the fy2002 commerce justice and state approp riations act hr 2500 prohibiting the use of funds to negotiate or pay the prc for costs associated with the crews detention or the ep3s return while confirming that the prc had asked for about 1 million on august 9 the department of defense announced that it independ ently arrived at fair figure for services rendered and assistance in taking care of the aircrew and some of the materials and contracts and whatnot to remove the ep3 itself and was sending the nonnegotiable amount to the us embassy in beijing the amount of 34567 fell far

chinese pilot reveled in risk new york times april 6 2001assessments of the collision incident the incident prompted number of assessments about the prc leadership and its various claims about the aircraft involved and the collision prc leadership and decisionmaking39 the incident raised questions about the hardline noncooperative approach of the prc leadership from the beginning of the standoff including the unreasonable detention of the us crew for 11 days and the ep3 for longer some say that china took positions in an expected way for countries to react taking advantage of situation to further its national interest still the incident prompted range of assessments of beijings decisionmaking and calculations including the following interpretations of course prc leaders faced complicated decisions likely affected by more than one consideration and their interactions remain largely secret strategy to push back us presence one explanation stresses that the prc position was based on its national security strategy including uniting taiwan with the mainland and asserting its role in the region to counter us influence40 this strategy seeks to push the plas defensive line further out to sea while pushing back the us military presence in asia complicate us calculations particularly in taiwan scenario weaken usled alliances especially that with japan and assert beijing as big country with say in the region in this school of thought the fact that the ep3 flew out of the kadena air base in okinawa japan on an intelligence mission makes the incident particularly objectionable to prc leaders who also feel strong historical hostility to japan41 washington and beijing also have very different world views especially with chinas claims to historical territory like the south china sea beijings strategy is to try to gain some greater measure of control in the region and this incident presented an opportunity to try to set rules favorable to china still many doubt that the plan pilot deliberately caused the collision best defense is good offense another explanation emphasizes that prc leaders may well have known that the collision was precipitated by pla actions over several months leading up to the incident wang wei the pla pilot whose fighter collided into the ep3 was already known to us pilots as risktaking pilot42 at his april 13 news conference secretary rumsfeld showed video from january 24 interception by the same f8 fighter that later hit the ep3 on april 1 in the video the fighter is shown flying as close as 20 feet

aggressive interceptions of us aircraft occurred to the south of china but not to the east of china specifying the problem as involving the plan unit on hainan43 the second pla pilot who witnessed the collision may have reported it as caused by wang weis flying too close as an accident or as caused by the ep3 nonetheless his plan unit the pla command and prc leaders may have feared an american backlash for almost killing 24 us crew members and downing the us plane in its first official statement of april 4 about the incident the ministry of national defense mnd only shell for dealing with foreigners while the central military commission cmc commands the pla sought to defend the actions of the f8 fighters saying that it is entirely justified and in line with international law for chinese fighter jets to track and monitor us reconnaissance aircraft thus in this view the prc faced with mishap about which the united states had warned seemed intent on defending the plas interceptions with an accusation against the americans pla in command there are those who point to power struggles and policy differences between military and civilian leaders one line of reasoning in this school believes that the pla tried to cover up its own mistakes including dangerous maneuvers by its pilot who caused the accident damaged us aircraft and almost killed 24 us personnel and deliberately provided false information to the civilian leaders including president jiang44 based on this view jiang and other top leaders were muddled and confused and may have miscalculated in making accusations against the americans and holding the 24 crew members for 11 days on hainan second line of reasoning in this school views the pla as increasingly influential in pressuring civilian leaders such as jiang into more hardline approaches toward the united states and even playing pivotal role in the prcs foreign policy particularly on questions like taiwan and national security according to this view the pla presented an obstacle to smoother and speedier diplomatic resolution in this incident as shown by some harsh articles appearing in the liber ation army daily during the crisis45 however available indications are that throughout the incident president jiang who is also cmc chairman vice premier qian and the ministry of foreign affairs were in the lead while top pla officers followed in stance with more inflammatory rhetoric and were slow in making appearances still the pla is likely to benefit from the incident with the chance to inspect the ep3 and another

plane incident when meeting brazils continuedamerican rallying point this incident and other international tensions may well show that the beijing leadership is more generally united with hardline views on issues of national security and sovereignty especially on taiwan one early indicator was that jiang felt sufficiently secure in his standing and ability to made critical decisions that he departed beijing as scheduled for latin america on april 4 for 13day trip second as secretary of state powell revealed the prc government wanted to handle the incident through the ministry of foreign affairs46 moreover the followup meeting in beijing on april 1819 to discuss the incident was ultimately not handled on the basis of the 1998 plapentagon military maritime consultative agreement and the prc side was led by the mfa not the pla even as the department of defense represented the united states third although it was military incident the prcs mnd first issued statement on april 4 to condemn the incident and express concern for the lost plan pilot identified as wang wei well after the ministry of foreign affairs and president jiang presented the official prc positions47 moreover the mnds statement did not demand that the united states apologize or stop the reconnaissance flights48 the mnd did not directly challenge the right of the us aircraft to fly where it was intercepted noting that us military surveillance planes have made frequent spy flights in the sea areas close to china for many years and the two f8s took off to conduct routine tracking of the us plane the mnd also charged the us aircraft as entering chinese territorial airspace without approval only when it made its landing on hainan island finally it was not until the morning of april 7 that top pla leader took public position on the incident prc media reported that central military commission cmc vice chairman and minister of national defense general chi haotian visited the lost plan pilots wife and the second pilot in the incident as commissioned by jiang while also blaming the united states chi did not demand that the united states apologize and stop the reconnaissance flights moreover prc television news that day reported chis visit to wang weis wife and vice premier qians letter of reply to secretary powell at the same time49 later on april 8 general chi stated his position calling

prc media reports on zhangs visit did not mention those assurances prc media did not report general zhang as making remarks on the incident until april 9 from wellington and zhang just reiterated jiangs views including the call for an apology52 premier zhu rongji often cited as an accommodating leader favoring ties to the west apparently did not feel the need to make public statement until april 12 after the united states sent its letter and the prc agreed to release the crew53 domestic politics some stress that internal power struggles shape the decisions of leaders especially jiang zemin as he tries to elevate his proteges ahead of the 16th chinese communist party congress in late 2002 and hold onto power perhaps by remaining as cmc chairman past 2002 one observer stressed internationalist leaders in beijing struggled against those with reflexive nationalist instincts54 prc politics today also result in relatively weak insecure leaders unlike mao zedong or deng xiaoping and communist system seeking shields against charges of ineptness this school of thought asserts that us policy has an interest in supporting moderate leaders such as president jiang and premier zhu who favor better relations with the united states even as they are forced to take hardline positions for domestic reasons55 nationalistic public opinion another school of thought believes that

to citizens in contrast to the incident in may 1999 after nato forces mistakenly bombed the prc embassy in belgrade yugoslavia when the prc government condoned if not fueled violent attacks against us diplomatic facilities in china the leadership this time censored inflammatory condemnati ons from discussions on the internet and controlled the governmentowned media and there were fierce demonstrations57 political culture some theorize that differences in political cultures explained the standoff58 while the united states sought businesslike interaction and quick resolution the prc reacted with victim mentality moral indignation and accusations to extract an apology using the formal word daoqia n beijing also demands apologies from japan for suffering during world war ii the prc leadership tried to preserve face and cannot be seen as wrong by its people according to this school of thought leaders in beijing take international disagreements as persona l affronts prefer private personal deals and seek to set principles before practical diplomacy however it was notable that throughout this incident the prc government preferred to work with the americans through normal diplomatic channels although not as promptly as washington and other countries wanted and both sides tried to buttress their positions with respective legal arguments also deputy secretary of state armitage disclosed that early us efforts to resolve the incident quickly through behindthescenes phone calls at high level were unsuccessful armitage said it seems to be the case that when very very difficult issues arise it is sometimes hard to get the chinese to answer the phone he added that we worked it out over time59 reactions to us positions some say that early in this incident admiral blairs press conference and president bushs use of public formal statements from the white house shaped the prcs firm stance including response from president jiangs level and escalations in rhetoric nonetheless admiral blair was responding to the prcs first assertions about the collision some speculate that alternatively more private personal communication perhaps with the hotline set up by the

aggressive interceptions61 us officials believe that while the immediate cause of the collision was an accidental contact made by the f8 fighter the collision was also precipitated by increased aggressiveness in the plas interceptions of us aircraft in international airspace according to the pentagon the pla began its recent pattern of aggressive interceptions of us reconnaissance flights in december 2000 at his news conference on april 13 2001 secretary rumsfeld revealed that since december there were 44 pla interceptions of us reconnaissance flights off the coast of china with six coming within 30 feet and two within 10 feet occurring on december 17 and 19 2000 january 24 and 30 2001 march 21 and april 1 he also reported that the united states lodged formal protest about the aggressive and dangerous interceptions on december 28 2000 he showed video taken aboard one of the us reconnaissance planes on january 24 showing f8 flying very close before that time there were interceptions that the pentagon characterized as common and numerous the us military has flown reconnaissance missions around the world including along chinas coast for the past five decades and has expected interceptions in international airspace62 about one year before this incident on april 27 2000 the pentagon confirmed that two pla f8 fighters approached us air force rc135 reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the south china sea the pentagons spokesperson said that the interception was not at all unusual and nonthreatening toward the us plane with the f8 fighters at considerable distance several kilometers away he also reported that the pla often flew aircraft out to look at us aircraft carriers or other ships passing through international waters near china including the south china sea63 there have also been encounter s at sea reportedly including an incident on march 24 2001 in the yellow sea near south korea in which plan jianghu iiiclass frigate passed as close as 100 yards to the us surveillance ship uss bowditch and pla reconnaissance plane shadowed it64 the problem raises the question of why the prc stepped up interceptions of us reconnaissance aircraft one possible explanation is that the prc retaliated for the defection to the united states of pla senior colonel xu junping who closely handled sinous military relations and apparently presented major intelligence loss for the pla65 however the pattern of aggressive interceptions of us aircraft beganhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30946crs15 66lawrence susan v and david murphy

new york at the end of that month66 another explanation is that the pla flew close interceptions in response to increases in us reconnaissance flights one report said that tensions had been building for almost year before the collision when the us military increased flights in the second half of 2000 with flights 45 times week about 50 miles off chinas coast67 kurt campbell deputy assistant secretary of defense for asia and the pacific from 1995 to 2000 wrote that the united states has stepped up reconnaissance flights along chinas coast68 still the pentagon stressed that the ep 3 involved in the collision was on routine mission missions that us planes have flown for decades third explanation is that individual plan units like the one on hainan or pilots like wang wei took risks on their own in top gun style wang was already known to us pilots as reckless fighter pilot there are pictures of previous close intercepts by the same f8 fighter that crashed and the pentagon reported that aggressive interceptions of us aircraft occurred to the south of china but not to the east of china69 it is clear however that leaders in beijing at least knew about the problem

general information section 6 intercept continuedcause of the collision and flying maneuvers73 the prc government has asserted that blame for the accident lies solely with the american pilot whom it claims initiated an aggressive turn into the intercepting fighter according to the statement of the surviving pla pilot zhao yu he and the mishap pilot wang wei were flying in parallel and about 400 meters away from the ep3 at the same speed when the ep3 abruptly veered toward the mishap pla fighter making it impossible for wang to avoid the collision the surviving pilot alleges the ep3s nose and left wing bumped into wangs jet and the propeller on the ep3s left wing smashed the jets vertical tail into pieces74 the us account of the accident places blame squarely on the pla pilot based on reports from the mishap ep3 crew the pla pilot collided with the ep3 as it was lumbering along on autopilot at 207 miles an hour on straight and level path the collision occurred on the third pass by the pla fighter on previous pass the pla fighter passed within an estimated three to five feet of the aircraft according to one crewman lt patrick c honeck the pla pilot saluted the american crew on his first pass and mouthed something to us on the second75 on the third pass the pla f8 fighter struck the ep3s left outboard propeller as it flew by and subsequently impacted the ep3s radome shattering it debris from this contact was then blown into the propellers of two more engines severely damaging them and sending shards of metal through the fuselage76 the f8 sustained catastrophic damage reportedly broke in half and crashed into the sea presumably killing the pilot by us accounts the pla pilots violated standard intercept conventions and the longstanding principle that collision avoidance responsibility lies with the more maneuverable intercepting aircraft intercept provisions outlined in the international flight information manual call for intercepting aircraft to maintain at least 500 feet while exchanging signals with their targets77 moreover the manual cautions that fighter pair must use every precaution to avoid startling intercepted aircrew or passengers constantly keeping in mind that maneuvers considered normal to fighter aircraft may be considered hazardous to passengers and crews of nonfighter aircraft finally the manual directs fighterinterceptors to cautiously withdraw from the aircrafts vicinity the element leader breaks gently away from the intercepted aircraft in shallow dive to pick up speed the wingman stays well clear

april 6 2001 fbis 82written by david ackerman legislative attorneythe prcs account of the incident seems implausible for number of reasons first pla pilots have history of harassing ep3 crews with highspeed flybys at close range according to secretary of defense donald rumsfeld in recent months there have been 44 pla interceptions of us surveillance and reconnaissance flights off the coast of china six of these were within 30 feet two were within 10 feet79 photographs taken by other ep3 crews indicate that the pla mishap pilot wang wei had closed to within 10 feet of american ep3s on previously intercepts in one photo he was seen displaying his email address to the american crew in december and again in january the american government lodged formal protests with the prc citing safety concerns regarding actions taken by pla pilots on several occasions pla pilots had overtaken ep3 aircraft from the stern at high speed passing underneath and abruptly pulling up in front of the american aircraft at close range80 the practice known in some pilot circles as thumping is essentially an aerial tweak intended to cause consternation to the victim as he is suddenly confronted with the noise jet wash and the jet in unexpectedly close proximity second jet fighter even one of limited maneuverability shadowing slow propeller driven aircraft 400 meters 1300 feet away should have easily been able to avoid conflict with it finally given recent us concerns over previous close intercepts by pla fighters it is highly unlikely that the ep3 pilot would risked his life and that of his crew by aggressively maneuve ring his unarmed plane into the flight path of an intercepting fighter it appears that on the mishap occasion the pla pilot executing close pass in an apparent attempt to impress or intimidate the ep3 crew made fatal error in judgment several factors may have contributed to the collision first since the stall speed of the pla fighter is much higher than the ep3 the pla fighter pilot would have experienced significantly reduced control authority operating at or near the relatively slow speed of an ep3 second it is possible the mishap fighter encountered air flow disturbances caused by his wingmans jetwash or boundary layer airflow of the ep3 flying imprudently close to the ep3 the pla fighter may not have had the control authority to avert collision weather does not appear to have been factor according to the surviving pla pilot there were few clouds in the sky and visibility was over ten kilometers81 selected issues under international law82 the collision of us navy surveillance aircraft with pla jet fighter over the south china sea the subsequent landing of the us plane in prc territory and the detention of the crew have raised number of legal questions among the questionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30946crs20 83for more thorough treatment of these issues see crs collision of us and chinese aircraft selected legal considerations rs 20876are whether the us aircraft had right under international law to be where it was when the collision occurred whether it had legal right to enter chinas airspace and land on hainan island after the collision whether the us aircraft is immune under international law from entry and examination by prc officials and the nature of chinas obligation to allow us officials access to the crew83 international conventions concerning aviation and the law of the sea make clear that all nations have full sovereignty over their airspace including the airspace over their territorial seas belt of sea that can extend up to 12 miles from the coast and that government aircraft of foreign states generally have right to enter that airspace without permission international law also is clear however that all aircraft have right of overflight with respect to ocean areas beyond the territorial sea that includes right of overflight in another nations exclusive economic zone eez belt of sea that can extend up to 200 miles from the coast given that the united states and china seem to agree that the collision took place about 70 miles away from chinas coast the right of the us aircraft to be flying in that area does not appear to be in serious doubt china contends however that the performance of reconnaissance in its eez constitutes an abuse of the right of overflight moreover notwithstanding chinas sovereignty over its airspace and the general principle that foreign state aircraft cannot enter such airspace without its authorization international law appears to give aircraft in distress right to enter another nations airspace and to land on its territory this right does not appear specifically to be set forth in any international treaty but exists by analogy to the right of ships in distress to enter national waters and the duty of states to render assistance to such ships it also derives from what have been termed elementary considerations of humanity whether state aircraft in distress are immune from entry and examination upon landing in foreign state appears uncertain however under the law of the sea warships on the high seas are completely immune from the jurisdiction of any state other than their own even if warship is involved in collision on the high seas as opposed to collision while in port or territorial sea it is not subject to arrest or detention even for purposes of investigation except by its flag state moreover while ships generally do not have any right of access to states ports or internal waters ship in distress including warship is generally entitled to enter foreign ports and it does not ordinarily lose its immunity by doing so the argument by analogy thus is that state aircraft involved in collision over the high seas retains its immunity from the jurisdiction of the foreign state in which it lands for reasons of distress even for purposes of investigation that this principle may not be firmly established in international law however is suggested by the conclusion of one respected commentator that in such circumstances the territorial sovereign is entitled to conduct full investigation into the circumstances of the intrusion to inspect and search the aircraft and its contents and to search and question its occupantshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30946crs21 84vienna convention on consular relations supra art 361b 85written by kerry dumbaugh specialist in asian affairs 86 in february 1999 the pentagon issued congressionally mandated report describing the military balance in the taiwan strait as tipping away from taiwan and decidedly in chinas favor by the year 2005 in october 2000 china published national security white paper declaring there are new negative developments in the security situation in asia attributing these developments to the us presence in asia and to encroachments on chinas sovereignty in the south china sea the right of us officials to have access to the crew of the surveillance aircraft seems guaranteed by two conventions on consular relations the multilateral vienna convention on consular relations to which both the us and china are parties mandates that party inform consular officials without delay if national of their state is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending trial or is detained in any other manner it further requires that such officials be allowed to visit the detained national84 but these obligations are triggered only if the detained national requests that his or her consular officials be so informed the bilateral convention on consular relations between the us and china is more specific and does not depend upon request by the detained national under the terms of that convention china is obligated to give notice to us consular authorities of the arrest or detention of any us national later than four days from the date of the arrest or detention the convention further gives consular authorities the right to visit arrested or detained nationals later than two days after official notice of the arrest or detention and at least monthly thereafter neither convention of course prevents notice from being given more quickly or access from being given more frequently implications for us policy the incident raises short and longterm implications for policy regarding china arms sales to taiwan trade with the prc intelligence maritime surveillance and relations with some allies in asia as well as russia policy toward beijing85 this incident is the third in series of major troubling difficulties in recent years that could have serious implications for uschina relations the first was the 1995 96 taiwan strait crisis when china conducted livefire missile exercises off the coast of taiwan to which the united states responded by dispatching two carrier battle groups the second was the accidental nato bombing and destruction of the prc embassy in belgrade in 1999 killing three prc journalists and inflaming anti american passions these three incidents also have occurred against steady drumbeat of other securityrelated issues in recent years that have helped raise mutual tensions amid allegations of prc nuclear espionage in the united states and evidence of substantial military buildup on the southern coast opposite taiwan both sides in recent years have released military assessment reports on each others capabilities and intentions that reflect increased mutual suspicion86 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30946crs22 87private relief bills have been introduced for gao zhan in both the house hr 1385 and senate s 702 88according to press release of april 19 2001 from tibetnet the ussponsored continuedthe nature of the incident has prompted widespread speculation about its longer term implications for uschina relations and for the us view of china many observers believe that the heart of the tensions ultimately concerns the status of the island of taiwan which beijing claims as part of china prc officials in recent years have been increasingly critical of us policy toward taiwan as well as increasingly vocal in insisting on chinas right to use force against taiwan prc military officials also have begun to object more strongly to routine us navy reconnaissance flights over the south china sea since they presume that primary function of those flights is to monitor chinas systematic military buildup along its southern coast but us policymakers particularly some member s of congress likewise have grown increasingly more assertive in defending taiwans interests against what they see as newly hostile china meanwhile most us observers believe that uschina relations already in trouble because of past crises will suffer further as result of the events of april 2001 chinas refusal to assume responsibility for the aggressive actions of its pilot and its reluctance to return the us reconnaissance plane puts extra pressure on us policymakers who have argued that the engagement policy of the past ten years is productive and appropriate approach toward china instead some believe that the hainan confrontation bolsters the arguments of those in congress and elsewhere who for years have encouraged us leaders to be less accommodating to beijing rather than trying to persuade beijing of the advantages of international cooperation this group argues the united states should keep military forces as counterweight to rising prc power in asia remain firm in dealing with economic arms proliferation and other disputes with china and work closely with us allies and friends along chinas periphery in order to deal with future assertiveness or disruption from beijing what is needed now according to this group is reassessment of past us policy toward china in light of recent trends at minimum the policy trends of the past few years mean that china is likely to continue to challenge the us presence and us interests in asia us policymakers will likely continue to face difficult choices as they seek to balance us prerogatives and priorities in asia with chinas rising military power and growing assertiveness chinas actions during the incident also are likely to reinforce broader congressional concerns over the trends in chinas domestic and international behavior members of congress have been especially concerned in recent months over the arrest and imprisonment of number of ethnic chinese scholars who were visiting china but living and working in other countries in the case of ms gao zhan permanent us resident and researcher at american university who has been publicly accused of spying by chinese officials congress is now considering legislation which would make her us citizen87 congress also has passed resolutions calling for the

visit the united states from may 827 2001 arms sales to taiwan90 after the us defense attache first gained access to the crew on april 3 2001 secretary of state powell stated that the two issues of the incident and arms sales to taiwan would not be linked91 nonetheless the detention of the us crew for 11 days on hainan could have affected the political climate in washington as top officials and the president decided on the list of arms sales to taiwan to be announced at annual talks later in the same month on april 2492 while some believe that the united states should respond to the prcs actions by approving robust package of arms that includes aegisequipped destroyers others said that usprc tensions need not be exacerbated unnecessarily still the incident may not have major impact on the bush white house in ultimately deciding on the course it would have taken regardless of the incident based on the taiwan relations act and ongoing studies of taiwans military strengths and weaknesses longerterm question is whether the process of deciding arms sales to taiwan should deviate from intensive decisionmaking only once year usually in april93httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30946crs24

duty in the us harmonized tariff schedule hts which are generally significantly higher up to 10 fold in some instances than those under column 1general ntr treatment these higher tariffs would likely result in higher prices for us consumers of the affected items and subsequently decrease in us imports of various prc products and substitution of products from other countries see crs report rl30225 mostfavorednation status of the peoples republic of china by vladimir n pregelj 99for example representative hunter has introduced bill hr 1467 that would terminate chinas ntr status 100another major contributing factor to reduced uschina investment and trade ties was retrenchment by the prc central government of economic reforms for example the government imposed number of new restrictions on imports in order to improve its balance of trade government imposed austerity measures also diminished the demand for imports in addition the government and sought to limit domestic and foreign investment in order to ease inflationary pressures these measures were largely removed by 1992 after the central government decided to resume economic reform policies if china does not gain wto accession by june 2001 which seems highly unlikely president bush will need to issue waiver under the jacksonvanik amendment in order to continue chinas ntr status for an additional year this action could be subject to congressional vote to disapprove the waiver which would if enacted terminate chinas ntr status98 alternatively congress might consider other legislative vehicles that would either terminate chinas ntr status or add additional conditions to the continuation of that status99 although past congressional efforts to terminate or add additional conditions to chinas ntr status have failed congress has used the ntr renewal process as focal point to debate as well as influence us policy towards china it is unclear how the military aircraft collision incident will affect usch ina commercial ties certain incidents in the past led to shortterm disruptions in us china economic relations but appear to have had little impact on over the long run for example the prc governments

issues103 implications behind the landing of the ep3 on hainan island lies long history of dangerous airborne surveillance missions since the mid1940s the united states has sent reconnaissance aircraft to gather intelligence on military and civilian activities relevant to the nations security interests during the cold war missions along the borders of communistbloc countries provided intelligen ce long before satellites became available few missions even crossed over soviet airspace to gather imagery of bomber and missile bases in striking range of the us mainland according to public statement of the defense department during the years 19451977 total of more than 40 reconnaissance aircraft were shot down in addition to losses in the vietnam war us planes were shot down by the soviet union communist china north korea and eastern european countries in many cases crew members died as result of armed attack some were rescued by friendly forces some were actually returned to us authorities by the attacking countries104 there were seaborne reconnaissance missions as well two of which came under hostile fire the uss pueblo was captured by north korea in january 1968 and the uss liberty was attacked by israeli forces in june 1967httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30946crs27 attacks on us military aircraft in international airspace or over foreign territory have affected relations between the united states and the other countries involved with the extent of damage usually dependent on the overall international atmosphere the most sensational attack was that on u2 flown over soviet territory by an employee of the central intelligence agency francis gary powers in may 1960 it resulted in the breakup of an important fourpower summit and acute embarrassment to the eisenhower administration other losses of aircraft and personnel seem to have been accepted as the hard but necessary cost of gathering information and were not allowed to interfere with the pursuit of other foreign policy goals with the establishment in 1997 of the national vigilance park at fort meade maryland next to the headquarters of the national security agency the federal government has recognized that many citizens paid the ultimate price to acquire the intelligence deemed vital by presidents observers of the us intelligence effort note that attacks by other countries have affected the manner in which collection operations have been carried out after the capture of powers the united states did not send u2 aircraft over the soviet landmass but intelligence collection on the soviet union was accomplished by the reconnaissance satellites that became available in the early 1960s the capture of the pueblo was undoubtedly factor in subsequent decision not to dedicate individual navy ships to sigint missions relying instead on other approaches including satellites airborne reconnaissance remains however vital component of intelligence collection for military and other national security purposes u2s and other surveillance aircraft such as the ep3 are constantly deployed in areas of concern to policymakers especially in critical areas such as the korean peninsula iraq the balkans the middle east as well as the south china sea these aircraft obtain imagery and signals intelligence in areas that are not consistently covered by satellites whose orbits are generally fixed and whose time over any given point is limited observers suggest that the primary mission of ep3 flights over the south china sea is upgrading orderofbattle data about radars and communications links it has been widely noted that reconnaissance aircraft are high demandlow density platforms there are inadequate numbers for the heavy use that is being made of them in recent years considerable attention has been given to the development of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs as reconnaissance platforms but existing uavs have relatively short ranges and limited loitering times more capable uav the global hawk is undergoing tests and evaluation in march 2001 testimony to the senate armed services committee admiral dennis blair the commanderinchief of the pacific command noted shortages in intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance isr platforms including ep3es blair stated that although current isr assets are adequate for routine operations in the pacific theater we do not have the surge capability to monitor crises or cyclical increases of potential adversary activities observers believe that technological innovations including new generation of reconnaissance satellites and the introduction of longrange high altitude uavs may reduce some of the requirements for manned surveillance aircraft they note however that it will be number of years

advantages over uavs in maneuvering to obtain important data defense planners expect that surveillance by manned aircraft will remain necessity given the widespread nature of us national security interests intelligence loss the need for emergency destruction procedures was dramatically underscored when the north koreans captured the uss pueblo in 1968 and acquired large inventory of highly sensitive intelligence materials that the crew had not had time to destroy since that time intelligence planners have been acutely aware of the need to limit the amount of classified information on ships and aircraft assigned missions that could lead to capture there is also far less reliance on paper documents today than in 1968 destruction devices have been installed and the crews have received extensive training in emergency destruction procedures defense department spokesmen have stated that the ep3 crew had about 15 to 20 minutes from the time of the incident until they made an emergency landing on hainan island and some 20 minutes more on the ground before they left the aircraft according to the pilot lt osborn the emergency destruction plan was activated well out well offshore in his april 13th press conference defense secretary rumsfeld noted that the crew went through that destruction checklist and did an excellent job of doing everything that was i believe possible in the period of time they had rumsfeld did not indicate that destruction of classified documents and equipment was complete noting only that the crew completed major portion of their checklist other pentagon spokesmen have declined to provide additional details of the extent of the destruction completed the prc has investigated the ep3 that landed on hainan island and may have removed some electronic surveillance equipment although ep3 aircraft have been operational for many years recent major upgrade known as the sensor system improvement added an array of new hardware and software to track monitor and process targeted radar and communications signals the new systems are designed to collect wider range of signals and to move data faster to sites where more detailed analysis can be undertaken105 equipment is designed according to media accounts with features by which software can be readily erased or zeroized in emergencies if the prc obtained intact surveillance devices attempts at reverse engineering could be made to create replicas for chinas own reconnaissance effort this would not be an easy or rapid process however even though much information about surveillance equipment has been discussed in electronics trade publications observers speculate that the chief benefit to the prc from its inspection of the ep3 would be to gather information about us targets and degree of success that could enable the prc to prepare countermeasures hindering future us surveillancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30946crs29 106written by ronald orourke specialist in

electronic listening posts and navy attack submarines although the existence of the us electronic eavesdropping effort has become public knowledge in recent years the scope of the operation and the number and variety of us assets involved in it may be less widely known one recent press report states that the collision involving the ep3 exposed more than the raw nerves of two wary giants the drama of this aerial collision underscores an important and littleknown postcold war reality americas surveillance network has grown so vast and formidable that in some respects it is feared as much as us weaponry itself the ep3e missions out of kadena air base in japan are an important piece of this worldwide network the kadena squadron has focused on china since 1993 like air force rc135s and army predator drones in other regions the ep3es capture military and government communications along the chinese coastline and help assess the sophistication of radar used by chinese missile units

service such as the navy jointservice regional us military command such as the us pacific command or uspacom the department of defense dod in general or some combination thus while the ep 3e is navy aircraft ep3es do not collect intelligence solely or even principally for the navy if the ep3e involved in the collision was conducting surveillance of one or more plan surface combatants or submarines as some press reports have suggested the primary intended user of the information being collected could have been the navy if on the other hand the ep3 was conducting surveillance of land

protective forces and using uavs for airborne surveillance missions ep3e fleet operational strain the presence of the ep3e on hainan island in china has at least temporarily reduced the number of ep3e aircraft available to us military commanders by 9 percent as result the operational strain placed on the remaining ep3e aircraft and their crews could increase and the possibility that certain ep3e surveillance missions will be gapped ie not conducted could increase this situation will persist until the ep3e in question is either returned and repaired or replaced by the acquisition of another ep3e recent press report states that the loss of the ep3e which will be unavailable for operational use for the foreseeable future puts strain on the already thinly stretched signals intelligence community navy officials decided recently that they needed to replace an ep3e lost in an accident in 1997 and began modifying p3c into the ep3e intelligence configuration of the aircraft but that aircraft wont be available until at least late 2002 forcing the small ep3e community to absorb the additional operational pace it would take almost three years to field another ep 3e if navy officials determine they must replace the aircraft now in china111 the united states can attempt to compensate for the reduction in the number of available ep3es by relying more on other electronic surveillance aircraft or on satellites surface ships or attack submarines these assets however are also limited in number and heavily committed so relying on them more may simply shift the operational strain from the ep3e fleet to other us surveillance forces us electronic surveillance assets moreover are to large degree complementary rather than substitutable assets they perform different aspects of the surveillance mission and therefore might not be able to completely replace the surveillance capability resident in the ep3e satellites for example lack the ep3es ability to focus on particular area

eavesdropping on telephone and radio conversations and other electronic communications satellites cannot be overhead all the time and planes are useful for catching electronic emissions from smaller military sites as well as from exercises timed to evade satellite surveillance112 another report states what airplanes could and can do and satellites cant is monitor radio signals such as high frequency military communications remain on station longer and get closer to allow better reception but most important what airplanes can do is stimulate reaction from the other side whereas ground station or satellite is passive listener aircraft create their own stimuli the ep3e flies track south of chinese airspace and radars are turned on interceptors are scrambled communications networks are activated every flight is potential intelligence bonanza there is nothing like being the diagnostic irritant to collect information says military officer who is specialist in intelligence and

how us and prc aircraft and ships should operate when in proximity with one another or for how us airborne surveillance operations are to be conducted in international airspace off china the ability of the united states to conduct such operations in the future could be either enhanced or degraded on the one hand agreedupon procedures or understandings that require prc intercept aircraft to maintain greater distances from us surveillance aircraft or to avoid potentially dangerous maneuvers while in proximity to us surveillance aircraft could other things held equal enhance the us ability to conduct surveillance of pla forces on the other hand agreedupon procedures or understandings that place jure or facto restrictions or limits on the frequency geographic areas duration or altitudes us airborne surveillance missions or the distances that us aircraft must maintain from prc ships could degrade the us ability to conduct airborne surveillance of pla forces restrictions or limits on surveillance operations near china moreover could serve as precedent for other countries to demand the same restrictions or limits on us surveillance operations in other regions of the world to

recent press report states in the second half of last year the us military stepped up its reconnaissance flights sending planes four or five times week about 50 miles off the chinese coast according to chinese military official he maintained that this was an increase over the years 19971999 when the average had been about 200 flights annually the chinese response has been to scramble jet fighters to intercept and fly alongside about one of every three reconnaissance flights us navy official said according to people familiar with his thinking adm dennis blair the us commander in the pacific has stepped up surveillance flights partly out of the belief that they have deterrent value the more the united states knows about how the chinese military operates the less likely the chinese will be to think they can subdue taiwan with lightning strike most of the 200 or so flights year come out of the us base at kadena on the japanese island of okinawa with about threequarters being navy aircraft

the same issues discussed earlier concerning the limited numbers of these other assets and their potential inability to perform in all aspects surveillance missions previously performed by ep3es potential need for escorts another potential issue arising out of the collision is whether us airborne surveillance aircraft operating in certain areas off china will in the future need to be escorted by us fighters or protected in some other way by nearby us military forces if so this could have potentially significant implications for the us military given the frequency of these operations the united states in recent years reportedly has conducted about 200 airborne electronic surveillance missions per year off the prc coast114 and their duration ep3es can remain airborne for more than 12 hours per mission providing such escorts or other protection could require the repositioning of significant us military forces which could affect us military deployment patterns operational tempo and forcestructure requirements it could also significantly increase the average number of us military forces operating in or near sea areas off chinas coast uavs for airborne surveillance fourth potential issue for us airborne surveillance operations arising out of the collision and the subsequent detention of the ep3s crew is whether the united states should expand or accelerate current efforts to develop and procure longrange longduration uavs such as the global hawk uav as potential substitutes for ep3es or other manned surveillance aircraft the administration is reportedly already considering an expanded or accelerated uav based isr effort as part of its current review of us defense policy and programs115 the ep3 incident might serve to underscore the potential advantages of uavs as platforms that can perform isr missions without putting an air crew at risk of being killed injured or taken into foreign custody according to one press report the shooting down of us ec121

rules and has greatly increased its military power and assertiveness in recent years major national daily the sankei shimbun editorialized that the collision was wakeup call for japan in that it underscored what harsh military reality exists in the areas near japan the editorial chided the bush administration mildly for creating uneasiness over its untested approach to china but also noted that despite the rhetoric both sides appeared to be practicing selfcontrol 119 the incident also has provoked some practical concerns for instance the jda reportedly is highly concerned about the compromise of electronic equipment and coding systems that it shares with the us navy and is evaluating the situation to see if it needs to change both the codes and the equipment120 this incident and other developments in regional relations suggest number of implications for japans future security posture and usjapan alliance cooperation first the japanese government seems more concerned about prc assertiveness than about the deterioration of uschina relations possibly because of confidence that the neither washington nor china can allow the incident to irreparably damage relations japan itself has shown greater willingness to confront china diplomatically over issues such as prc naval intrusions into waters claimed by japan tokyo recently delayed for several months decision to provide the

over islands in the south china sea has intensified prompting manila to pursue hedging strategy with china and the united states on the one hand the philippines has tried to persuade china to agree to multilateral code of conduct that would prohibit any claimant from seizing additional islands and atolls in the south china sea manila has been frustrated by the united states generally neutral stance in the dispute on the other hand manila has cautiously begun to revive its security relationship with washington reversing decline that had occurred since the united states withdrew from military bases in the philippines in 1992 australia125 worried about wider implications for other nations in the region australia expressed concerns about the incident publicly and also directly to pla general zhang wannian who was on visit to canberra prime minister john howard said that i can understand the americans wanting their aircraft and personnel back without interference on april 3 2001 foreign minister alexander downer reportedly told general zhang that australia was concerned about the lost pla pilot and hoped the tragic accident can be resolved quickly diplomatically and calmly australian leaders said that zhang assured them about us consular access to the detained crew126 russia127 the russian government and press maintained relatively low keyed approach toward this incident by april 11 there was little public russian government commentary on the incident on april 4 aleksandr losyukov the russian foreign ministry official who oversees policy toward east asia described the aircraft collision as regrettable and an accident and expressed moscows confidence that the united states and china would find way to resolve their differences over the affair128 an april 2 commentary on russian internet web site run by kremlin insider stranaru linked the aircraft collision to the sinking of japanese fishing ship by us nuclear submarine in february 2001 and blamed both on aggressive us intelligence gathering activities in the pacific129 search of the russian central press however found only one article on the subject that article speculated that the pilot of the f8 was probably at fault in the collision130 russianhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30946crs38 131discussion with russian diplomats april 10 2001 132various russian and prc sources including interfax april 4 2001diplomats in washington stated that moscow officially treated this as strictly bilateral uschina issue although privately we support china131 russias relatively restrained public response to the incident is surprising and noteworthy for several reasons usrussian relations have grown more strained in recent years and if anything tension has increased since the elections of presidents putin and bush in this atmosphere moscow regularly and often sharply criticizes us foreign and defense policies the april 1 collision of the us and prc military aircraft provided an easy target for antiamerican propaganda an opportunity that moscow seems to have passed up this apparent restraint is all the more surprising in view of the fact that one of russias main national security strategies is to forge cooperative bond with china in opposition to alleged us global domination and hegem onism moscow and beijing support one anothers positions visavis washington over such issues as taiwan chechnya yugoslavia nato enlargement national missile defense sanctions against iraq and steppedup us intelligence gathering activities near their borders russian arms sales to china including advanced military aircraft missile systems warships and submarines are key element of their military cooperation russia and china are reportedly preparing to sign tenyear strategic friendship treaty this summer132 which some observers warn could be the harbinger of strategic alliance directed at least implicitly against the united states
