crossstrait stability and not undermining the tough message to taipei there are issues about whether taiwans limite d defense dollars might be better spent on other defensive requirements such as munitions logistics training professional personnel etc another question concerns the impact of only 66 fighters on the military balance in the taiwan strait advocates say that taiwans legitimate

decisionmakers in the military administra tion and congress is whether the united states would go to war with the prc ove r taiwan and the purpose of any conflict the tra did not replace th mutual

needs cooperative china in number of global problems that trends in the taiwan strait are destabilizing and that the united states should limit security assistance as leverage to prevent provocative moves by taiwans leaders the question of us assistance for taiwan s defense involves two aspects intention willingness and capability to assist taiwans selfdefense in march 1996 president clinton deploy ed two aircraft carrier battle groups near taiwan in response to the plas pr ovocative missile testfirings and exercises another question arose in april 2001 when president bush initially said that he would do whatever it took to help taiwan defend hers elf if china attacked supporters have viewed such clarity as needed to prevent miscalculations in beijing and deter attacks against taiwan however critics have argued that bush encouraged provocations from taipei even if the message was not meant for taiwan and weakened willingness in taiwan to strengthen its own defense later when taiwans president chen shuibian dvocated referendums and new constitution president bush said that the comments and actions made by the leader of taiwan indicate that he may be willing to make

toward independence assistant secretary james kelly stated that what the president said has meaning at the time he says it to those listeners we intend to fulfill the defense re sponsibilities under

selfdefense for too long the taiwan relations act has been referenced as purely us obligation under the tra the us is obligated to enable taiwan to maintain sufficient selfdefense but the reality is it is taiwan that is obligated to ve sufficient selfdefense there is an explicit expectation in the tra that ta iwan is ready willing and able to maintain its selfdefense taiwan must fulfill its

reduction in chinas deployment of missiles targeted at taiwan in return for restraint in us arms sales to taiwan128 president bush reportedly did not respond directly to jiangs linkage editorials in taiwan were divided on whether to pursue jiangs offer some argued that confidence building measures such as freeze or reduction in pla missile and other military deployments would improve the chances for cross strait political dialogue and lead to greater stability they said that the united states could explore how the prc might reduce the threat against taiwan such as dismantling missile brigades in verifiable manner since sales of us systems are based on taiwans defense needs they argu ed that jiangs offer represented the first time that the prc offered meaningfully to discuss its forces oppos ite taiwan others said that freeze or redeployment of missiles would not eliminate the prcs continuing and broader military threat against taiwan including mobile missiles that can be redeployed and that the prc shoul d hold direct talks with leaders in taipei instead they argued that jiang did not seek to reduce the plas coercive threat but to undermine the relationship between wash ington
