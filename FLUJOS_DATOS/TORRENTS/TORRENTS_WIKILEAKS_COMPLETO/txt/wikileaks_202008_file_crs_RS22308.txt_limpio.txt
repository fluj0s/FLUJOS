2005 the higher education act hea reauthorization and budget reconciliation processes became intertwined during the first session of the 109th congress each of the aforementioned authorizing

conference report hrept 10962 on hconres 95 the concurrent resolution on the fy2006 budget on april 28 and april 29 2005 respectively the annual concurrent resolution on the budget sets forth the congressional budget when the federal deficit is expected to be large budget resolutions often require reductions in mandatory spending in such instances the budget resolution issues reconciliation instructions that require authorizing committees to report changes to legislation to reduce spending on mandatory programs under their jurisdiction crs2 the fy2006 budget resolution includes reconciliation instructions that direct authorizing committees to report legislation to reduce mandatory spending for the period fy2006fy2010 subsequently these proposals are to be combined in single reconciliation bill by the budget committees under the reconciliation instructions the house committee on education and the workforce is responsible for reduction of 127 billion overall for fy2006fy2010 the senate committee on health education labor and pensions is responsible for 137 billion for fy2006fy2010 the federal family education loan ffel program and the william d ford direct loan dl program are two of the major mandatory programs under each committees jurisdiction each committee has looked to reduce mandatory spending on these federal student loan programs federal student loan programs the federal government operates two major student loan programs the federal family education loan program authorized by part b of title iv of the hea and the william d ford direct loan program authorized by part d of title iv of the hea httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22308 these programs provide loans to undergraduate and graduate students and the parents of undergraduate students to help them meet the costs of postsecondary education under the ffel program loan capital is provided by private lenders and the federal government guarantees lenders against loss through borrower default death permanent disability or in limited instances bankruptcy under the dl program operated through the us department of education ed the federal government provides the loans to students and their families using federal capital ie funds from the us treasury the two programs rely on different sources of capital and different administrative structures but essentially disburse the same set of loans1 the dl program established in 1993 was intended to streamline the student loan delivery system and achieve cost savings while the dl program was originally introduced to gradually expand and replace the longstanding ffel program the 1998 hea amendments removed the provisions of the law that referred to phase in of the dl program currently both programs are authorized and the two programs compete for student loan business in fy2004 these programs provided 521 billion in new loans to students and their parents in that year the ffel program provided 9550000 new loans averaging approximately 4111 each and the dl program provided 3001000 new loans averaging approximately 4279 each mandatory spending on student loans the ffel and dl programs are entitlements funding is provided for these programs on permanent indefinite basis not subject to appropriations the fiscal year cost estimates for both programs under terms of the credit reform act of 1990 are calculated 1 for detailed information on the array of ffel and dl program loans see crs report rl30655 federal student loans terms and conditions for borrowers by adam stoll for thorough discussion of how the loan programs operate see crs report rl30656 the administration of federal student loan programs background and provisions by adam stoll crs3 by determining the net present value of the costs to the government over the lifetime of new loans disbursed in the given fiscal year under credit reform an effort is made to capture in the year in which credit is provided the multiyear net cash flows associated with new cohort of direct or guaranteed loans this calculation establishes subsidy cost which is the estimated longterm cost to the government of direct or guaranteed loan in calculating the subsidy costs for the two programs the main cost components are the interest benefits to students in the subsidized stafford program the special allowance payments to lenders2 and defaults subsidy cost calculations are highly dependent on interest rate forecasts over the life of the loans and therefore can vary significantly depending on these forecasts in order to achieve savings in mandatory spending on the loan programs congress has often cut loan subsidies or introduced fees to generate funds that offset mandatory spending each year the congressional budget office issues baseline budget forecasting httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22308 estimated spending over 10year period under current law assuming policy changes are enacted over that time period the cbo baseline serves as benchmark for budgetary analyses when legislation that would affect mandatory spending is introduced its budgetary impact is measured against the cbo baseline the current cbo baseline projects that over the 20062010 period the federal student loan programs would guarantee or disburse about 360 billion in new loans costing about 37 billion3 house and senate reconciliation provisions the ffel and dl programs are scheduled to be reauthorized as part of hea reauthorization during the 109th congress as has been noted these programs are being relied upon to produce much of the savings in mandatory spending required by the fy2006 budget reconciliation instructions to the house committee on education and the workforce and the senate health education labor and pensions committee during the first session of the 109th congress the house committee on education and the workforce reported an hea reauthorization bill and the senate health education labor and pensions committee ordered reported an hea reauthorization bill reconciliation provisions were included as part of each of these hea reauthorization bills hr 609 and s 1614 each committee then approved reconciliation recommendations that were sent on to the respective budget committees and included in omnibus reconciliation bills that were adopted in each chamber the house reconciliation 2 the special allowance payment amount is determined on quarterly basis by statutory formula which is tied to financial index and ensures lenders receive at minimum specified level of interest income on loans the special allowance is designed to compensate lenders for the difference between the belowmarket statutorily set interest rate charged to borrowers and market set interest rate that is intended as fair market compensation on the loan asset 3 congressional budget office cost estimate hr 609 college access and opportunities act of 2005 sept 16 2005 crs4 bills student loan provisions produce 143 billion in net savings over the 20062010 period4 the principal savings provisions included in the house reconciliation bill would change the formulas used to calculate borrower interest rates and lender yields on student loans5 eliminate separate formula for lender yields for loans known as 95 floor loans which are supported with certain taxexempt financing raise loan fee that lenders pay to the federal government on all new loans from 050 to 1 raise an annual fee lenders pay on consolidation loans from 105 to 130 for those lenders whose consolidation loans comprise more than 90 of their student loan holdings reduce the level of insurance provided to lenders from 98 to 96 for new loans made on or after july 1 20066 eliminate mandatory funding for dl and other federal student aid administrative costs as of fy20077 reduce guaranty agency retention amounts from 23 to 20 of collections on defaulted loans httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22308 introduce 1 borrower origination fee on consolidation loans and require 1 default fee on ffel subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans that would be assessed to borrowers when loan is disbursed the house reconciliation bill also includes provisions that would increase direct spending among these provisions the principal increases stem from phasedin reduction of borrower origination fees on stafford loans the statutory fee level is 3 in ffel and 4 in dl but would be reduced to 0 and 1 respectively increased borrower loans limits and increased income protection for dependent students in need analysis 4 see congressional budget office estimated budgetary impact of hr 4241 the deficit reduction act of 2005 as passed by the house of representatives novr 21 2005 and for details on individual proposals see congressional budget office cost estimate reconciliation recommendations of the house committee on education and the workforce oct 31 2005 5 under the provisions of hr 4241 new excess interest provisions would be adopted in essence new formula would be in effect for new loans made on or after july 1 2006 which would annually calculate the amount borrower rate was above the special allowance payment sap rate and the difference will be credited to the federal government this in effect would reduce lender yields by insuring they do not receive interest income exceeding the sap rate in addition hr 4241 would make changes to various student loan ratesetting formulas basically it would retain variable ratesetting formulas currently used for stafford and plus loans which under current law would be replaced by fixed rates for loans made on or after 7106 and it would introduce new interest rate options for consolidation loans 6 the insurance percentage paid to lenders and loan servicers receiving exceptional performer designations would be reduced from 100 to 98 7 under these provisions mandatory funding provided through section 458 of the hea for guaranty agency account maintenance fees would be sustained while other administrative activities would become discretionary spending subject to appropriations crs5 s 1932 the senate reconciliation bill which would generate 88 billion in net savings from 20062010 relies on many of the same mechanisms to achieve savings8 however several of the savings proposals are structured differently in the senate bill the principal savings provisions included in the senate bill would change the formulas used to calculate lender yields on student loans9 place limitations on but not fully eliminate separate formula for lender yields for loans known as 95 floor loans which are supported with certain tax exempt financing reduce the level of insurance provided to lenders from 98 to 97 for new loans made on or after january 1 2006 increase the lender origination fee on consolidation loans from 050 to 1 for all loans made on or after april 1 2006 and require guaranty agency origination fee on ffel stafford loans which may be assessed to borrowers when loan is disbursed or paid by guaranty agencies or lenders like the house bill the senate reconciliation bill includes provisions that would httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22308 increase direct spending among those provisions the principal increases stem from the introduction of the provisional grant assistance program progap and the science and mathematics access to retain talent smart grant program each of which would provide grants that would supplement pell grants reduction of borrower origination fees on stafford loans the statutory fee level is 3 in ffel and 4 in dl but as of july 1 2007 would be reduced to 2 in each program increased borrower loan limits and increased income protection for students in need analysis provisions included in pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 reduces mandatory spending by 388 billion over fiveyear period student loan provisions generate 119 billion in mandatory savings over that period10 the principal savings provisions included in pl 109171 would

proposals see congressional budget office cost estimate reconciliation recommendations of the senate committee on health education labor and pensions oct 24 2005 9 while in principle the excess interest provisions included in the senate bill parallel those in the house bill the borrower interest rates with one exception are not changed in the senate bill as they are in the house bill under the senate bill the lone altered rate is the plus loan borrower interest rate set to take effect for loans made on or after july 1 2006 that would be increased from fixed rate of 79 to 85 since the borrower rate is central facet of the excess interest calculations the differing borrower ratesetting formulas relied on in the two bills constitutes significant difference in the two savings approaches 10 congressional budget office cost estimate s 1932 the deficit reduction act of 2005 conference agreement as amended and passed by the senate on dec 21 2005 some of the student aid provisions in the act reduce direct spending while others increase costs 119 billion reflects the projected net savings after new costs are accounted for crs6 change the formulas used to calculate lender yields on student loans11 change the ffel plus loan borrower interest rate set to take effect for loans made on or after july 1 2006 from fixed rate of 79 to 85 eliminate the use of separate lender yield formula that provides minimum of 95 in interest income for new loans for forprofit lenders and for nonprofit lenders with more than 100 million in holdings of such loans the formula would still apply to certain new loans made through recycling by other nonprofit lenders through 2010 reduce the level of insurance provided to lenders from 98 to 97 for new loans made on or after july 1 200612 eliminate mandatory funding for dl and other federal student aid administrative costs as of fy200713 require 1 default fee on ffel subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans that could be assessed to borrowers when loan is disbursed or paid by nonfederal sources and specify that guarantors may assess an 185 borrower collection fee on loans consolidated out of default 85 must be remitted to the federal government httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22308 pl 109171 also includes provisions that increase direct spending among those provisions the principal increases stem from the introduction of the academic competitiveness and science and mathematics access to retain talent smart grant programs which would provide grants that would supplement pell grants phasedin reduction of borrower origination fees on stafford loans the statutory fee level is 3 in ffel and 4 in dl but would be reduced over time to 0 and 1 respectively increased stafford loan annual borrowing limits for first and secondyear undergraduates and for graduate students14 an extension of the expanded loan forgiveness for teachers authorized in pl 108409 increased income protection for dependent students and for independent students without dependents other than spouse in need analysis and lower asset assessment rates for all students in need analysis other changes to the student loan programs include the introduction of moratorium on additional schools entering into ffel school as lender arrangements effective april 1 2006 new loan deferments for military service and the extension of plus loan eligibility to graduate students other changes to student aid programs include the repeal of the 50 rule for distance education and alterations of the simplified needs test and automatic zero rules used in need analysis 11 new excess interest provisions would be adopted for new loans made on or after 7106 this in effect would reduce lender yields by insuring they do not receive interest income exceeding the sap rate 12 the insurance percentage paid to lenders and loan servicers receiving exceptional performer designations would be reduced from 100 to 99 13 under these provisions mandatory funding provided through section 458 of the hea for guaranty agency account maintenance fees would be sustained while other administrative activities would become discretionary spending subject to
