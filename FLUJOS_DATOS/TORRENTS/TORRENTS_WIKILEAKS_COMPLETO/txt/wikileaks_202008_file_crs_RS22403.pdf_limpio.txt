strick us wei ghs north korea offer washington post july 23 2000 in its current incarnation one analyst dis cerns three main goals of the g8 summits 1 exercise political leadership by launching new ideas and resolving problems that cannot be settled at lower leve ls 2 reconcile the interna tional and domestic pressures on policymaking generated by growing ec onomic interdependence and 3 promote collective management between europe nort h america and japan on issues of global political and economic governance3 left out of this agenda are the developing countries developing countries such as china are growing rapidly and are increasingly relevant to the global economy and interna tional security the future role of the g8 may likely be determined by how it decides to engage the developing world there is wide range of views on the g8 to critics of the g8 its meetings represent an expensive photo opportunity for th presidents and prime ministers of the wealthiest nations the july 2000 summit in okinawa japan was deemed success by g8 members based largely on the lack of controversy and the sheaf of joint communiques worked out in advance by their staffs4 an informal group the g8 has actual international enforcement power fo rmal crisis management capacity long term policy making capacity limited continuity and weak capacity to implement many of its prior commitments g8 critics contend that other institutions such as the united nations and the international financial institu tions where developing countries have more influence may thus be better suited fo r addressing intern ational problems others see the g8 emerging alongside the united nations as separate facility for global governance with flexibility borne out of given mandate agenda or bureaucratic infrastructure the members of the g8 can act very quickly and decisively when its members are in agreement g8 members are often the largest shareholders or financial contributors of the more formal international institutions through informal dialogue at the g8 meetings these countries can often set th agenda and priorities of the other institutions on several issues including debt relief for the poorest countries conflict in the former yugoslavia and curbing international terrorist financing the g8 has been able to effectively coordi nate interna tional action organization over the past 30 years an elaborate g8 system has been established at the apex is the leaders summit typically held in the summer and hosted by one of the g8 member countries the g8 presidency rotates annually and follows the following cycle france united states united kingdom russia germ any japan italy and canada the g8 president sets the agenda nd determines if nonmember count ries and stakeholders such as nongovernmental organizations are invited to the summit in addition to its annual heads of state summit the g8 has widespread meetings at the ministerial level the g8 has develope d network of

transnational organized crime final layer is the leaders personal representatives known as the g8 sherpas or guides the g8 sherpas meet in the runup to the summit to prepare the summit agenda and documents following the summit the sherpas meet to review progress on previous g8 initiatives the principal document of each summit is the communiqué or since 2002 the chairs summary the content of the documen t is determined by the host country one commentator has remarked that the co mmuniqué has grown into long unwieldy christmas tree with each country adding its cherished special interest ornament5 in recent years the chairs summary has b een supplemented by various action plans declarations and statements g8 members have large amount of ec onomic and political power individually and can bring that power to bear to advocate for g8 initiatives at the more formal international institutions in many cases when g8 priorities aligned g8 members have demonstrated an ability to wield their significant economic and political clout to policy shifts at multilateral institutions following agreement among the g8 principals two examples are reform of the international financial sy stem which first emerged during g8 finance minister meetings in 2000 and the introducti on of 100 multilateral debt relief for the poorest and most indebted countries which emerged from the 2005 g8 summit in gleneagles scotland6 on other issues such as climate change and energy security where g8 priorities diverge progress has been more limited germanys 2007 g8 agenda reflects an expressed interest in returning to the roots of the g8 summits by placing economic issues at the core of the summit the focus of the forthcoming july meetings is expected to be threefold 1 the st ability of the international economy including issues such as free trade protectionism employment and global imbalances 2 africa good governance sustainable investment peace and security and 3 cooperation with emerging economies and increasing thei r involvement in the g8 process7 evolution of the membership the first summit was held in rambouille t france on november 1517 1975 and included the six major

economic development degrees of resource endowment and political and social systems8 the first summit focused on discussing responses to several international economic crises of the early 1970s primar ily the 1971 collapse of the bretton woods financial system as well as the 1973 yom kippur war and the ensuing oil shock us president gerald ford decided to host s econd conference in puerto rico in june 1976 and invited canada to the m eetings this brought an add itional north american country into europeheavy forum since 1977 th european union participates at the g8 summit and is represented by the president of the european commission and the leader of the country that holds the pr esidency of the european union9 the addition of russia to the g7 russia the most recent member joined in 1997 the addition of russia to the g8 marked the pinnacle of the transition of the g8 from an institution focused on ec onomic issues to one with political issues at its core many analysts agree that russia was added to the g8 in exchange for its cooperation on three pressing issues 1 eastern european entry into nato 2 terrorism and 3 nuclear proliferation in exchange for bein g allowed to join the g7 russia subsequently relaxed its longstated opposition towards poland hungary and the czech republic joining nato10 russias hosting of the g8 summit in 2006 ra ised some concern among members of congress legislation was introduced in the 109th congress expressing the sense of congress that russias conti nued participation in the gr oup of eight nations should be conditioned on the russian government volunt arily accepting and adhering to the norms and standards of democracy hconres 143 nd sconres 14 the house resolution was referred to the house international relations committees subcommittee on europe and emerging threats and th senate resolution was referred to the senate foreign relations committee further action wa s taken on either pi ece of legislation including russia in the g8 has also raised questions regarding the nature of the g8 as forum and how russia fits into it to what extent is russia an open democratic society dedicated to individual liberty and social advancement since the g8 has its origins as group of the largest democra tic economies what role should level of development have in determining membership these questions have yet to be fully addressed by g8 policy makers but their answers will be crucial to the future of the g8 the fact that there is formal g8 charter or membership criteria complicates the issue table 1 presents the gross

stability in one fashion or another the g8 will likely be required to engage china like the inclusion of russia how the g8 engages china could dramatically alter the role of the institution china participated on consultative basis with the g7 finance ministers for th first time at the october 13 2004 outside of the g8 china has been very active in th g20 group of finance ministers and held the g20 presidency for 2005 like the g7 finance ministers meetings the g20 is an informal forum for finance ministers from the industri and emerging mark et countries to seek consensus on international fi nancial and economic matters11 some observers argue that introducing ch ina to the g7 finance ministers albeit initially only as participant may be an effective first step toward eventual g8 g9 membership bringing china into the g8 as bringing in russia would create tradeoffs for the forum china is not democracy has human rights concerns and is often not like minded with g8 members on in ternational economic or secu rity policies although there are often divisions among g8 members th is may make decisionmaking increasingly difficult on the other hand allowing chin to participate in the g8 may create an important informal forum for industrialized mocracies to discuss issues with china and help resolve disputes away from more formal institutions like the united nations or through highly visible state visits the future of the g8 g8 experience with russia and china points toward two possible options for the g8 1 continue to function as an informal fo rum for industrially

include major developing count ries and through the informal g8 plus meetings try to reach consensus among industrial and deve loping nations on international policy concerns during its presidency it appears that germany is gradually pursuing the latter option germany wants to create permanent seats albeit short of full membership for china and other emerging countries at g8 summit meetings12 the united kingdom had supported proposal that would have extended full membership to china india brazil south africa and mexico but this was rej ected by german chancellor angela merkel reportedly due to concerns that an ex panded membership of the g8 would make discussion impossible reflecting concerns she has had during discussions at european summits among the 25 members of the european union13 the g8s current members are often the major shareholders of the international institutions and can use their influence to push policies put forth at the g8 summits when members agree as they did on international financial institution reform and the hipc initiative there are institutional and procedural means to carry out decisions however when they disagree as they have on environment or agriculture issues there is little likelihood that the majority view will be pushed th rough international agencies over the resistance of the minority g8 voices disagreement stands to increase if the g8 expands to include countries such as china that are often at odds with individual g8 members expansion may also undermine the original purpose and flexibility of the group nevertheless some analysts have proposed expanding the g8 david owen former british foreign secretary advocates adding india in 2007 and bringing in china and brazil shortly thereafter14 at the 2006 st petersburg summit british prime minister tony blair suggested that the g8 expand to become the g13 by incorporating brazil china india south africa and mexico colin bradford and johannes linn analysts at the brookings institution have called for eleva ting the g20 finance ministers to the leader level15 regardless of whether the g8 formally expands to include major developing countries or coordinates with them at the margins of other mee tings the cooperation of the developing countries is important for ad vancing many of the issues that the g8 is currently undertaking although the g8 ma be helpful in securing international agreements on some issues of concern to the developed countries alone such as financial regulation among oecd countries successfully addressing most in ternational concerns on issues such as international development security or climate change would require the full participation of the veloping countries themselves
