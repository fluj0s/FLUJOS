of the us subprime housing market in 2007 is testing the ability of the international monetary fund imf in its role as the central international institution for oversight of the global monetary system though the imf is unlikely to lend to the developed countries most affected by the crisis and must compete with other international financial institutions1 as source of ideas and global macroeconomic policy coordination the spillover effects of the crisis on emerging and lessdeveloped economies gives the imf an opportunity to reassert its role in the international economy on two key dimensions of the global financial crisis 1 immediate crisis management and 2 longterm systemic reform of the international financial system the role of the imf has changed significantly since its founding in july 1944 late in world war ii delegates from 44 nations gathered in bretton woods new hampshire to discuss the postwar recovery of europe and create set of international institutions to resolve many of the economic issuessuch as protectionist trade policies and unstable exchange ratesthat had ravaged the international economy between the two world wars as the global financial system has evolved over the decades so has the imf from 1946 to 1973 the main purpose of the imf was to manage the fixed system of international exchange rates agreed on at bretton woods the us dollar was fixed to gold at 35 per ounce and all other member countries currencies were fixed to the dollar at different rates the imf monitored the macroeconomic and exchange rate policies of member countries and helped countries overcome balance of payments crises with shortterm loans that helped bring currencies back in line w ith their determined value this system came to an abrupt end in 1973 when the united states floated its currency and subsequently introduced the modern system of floating exchange rates over the past three decades floating exchange rates and financial globalization have contributed to in addition to substantial wealth and high levels of growth for many countries an international economy marred by exchange rate volatility and semifrequent financial crises the imf adapted to the end of the fixedexchange rate system by becoming the lender of last resort for countries afflicted by such crises current imf operations and responsibilities can be grouped into three areas surveillance lending and technical assistance surveillance involves monitoring economic and financial developments and providing policy advice to memb er countries lending entails the provision of financial resources under specified conditions to assist country experiencing balance of payments difficulties technical assistance includes help on designing or improving the quality and effectiveness of domestic policymaking g25g145g146g157g145g142g155g561g157g145g142g561g11g15g8g501g561 the current financial crisis represents major challenge for the imf since the institution is not in financial position to be able to lend to the united states or other western countries affected by the crisis with the possible exception of iceland the imfs total financial resources as of august 2008 were 352 billion of which 257 billion were usable resources 2 the most the imf ever lent 1 such as the bank for international settlements financial stability forum fsf and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd 2 imf resources that are considered nonusable to finance imf operations are 1 its gold holdings 2 the currencies of members that are using imf resources and are therefore by definition in weak balance of payments or reserve position 3 the currencies of other members with relativ ely weak external positions and 4 other nonliquid imf assets t

at the height of the asian financial crisis was 30 billion the most lent during any twoyear period was 40 billion between june 20012003 during the financial crises in argentina brazil uruguay and turkey3 the imf is wholly unequipped to provide by itself the necessary liquidity to the united states and affected industrialized countries in addition the united states and other western countries along with some middle eastern oil states are the primary contributors to imf resources and it is unlikely that these countries would seek imf assistance the last time that developed countries borrowed from the imf was between1976 and1978 when the united kingdom italy and spain borrowed from the imf to deal with the aftershocks of the 1973 increase in oil prices 4 since the financial crises of decade ago many emerging market economies largely in response to their criticism of the policy conditions that the imf required of countries receiving imf loans have built up extensive foreign reserve positions in order to avoid having to return to the imf should such crisis occur again 5 from level of around 12 trillion in 1995 global foreign exchange reserves now exceed 7 trillion the imf tabulates that by the second quarter of 2008 developing countries foreign reserves were 547 trillion compared to 143 trillion in the industrialized countries6 this reserve accumulation was driven by increasing commodity prices such as oil and minerals and large current account surpluses combined with high savings rates in emerging asian countries7 emerging market foreign reserve accumulation fueled by rising commodity prices and large emerging market trade surpluses and net foreign direct investment flows has led to decrease in demand for imf lending and weakening in the imfs budget position imf lending peaked in 2003 with imf credit outstanding totaling 11029 billion by september 30 2008 outstanding imf loans had decreased by 926 billion to 1772 billion8 since the imf earns income on the interest paid on its loans the decrease in demand for imfs lending led to budget shortfall in 2007 the imf is in the process of seeking authorization from national legislatures to sell portion of gold that the imf holds in reserve to create an investment fund whose profits can be used to finance imf operations congress is expected to face vote in fy2009 on whether or not to authorize this proposal the rise of emerging market countries over the past decade has created new challenges for the imf many emerging market economies argue that their current stake in the imf does not represent their role in the world economy several countries particularly in east asia and south america believe that their new economic weight and status should afford them larger quota and greater voice at the institution in addition many poor countries believe that the imfs quota system is prejudiced against them giving them little voice even though they are the majority of 3brad setser extraordinary times council on foreign relations september 29 2008 it is worth noting that the final rescue packages during the asian crisis totaled many times 30 billion once bilateral assistance was included 4 oxford analytica imf reaffirms role in global economy october 15 2008 5 many analysts believe that the tight monetary and fiscal policies that the imf required of countries accepting imf loans accentuated the immediate ec onomic impact of the crisis while having marginal impact on the countries long term structural reform 6 imf currency composition of official foreign

in 2006 on reform process to increase the quota and voice of its emerging market country members9 while the imf has struggled to define its role in the global economy the global financial crisis has created an opportunity for the imf to reinvigorate itself and possibly play constructive role in resolving or at the least mitigating the effects of the global downturn on two fronts 1 through immediate crisis management primaril balance of payments support to emerging market and lessdeveloped countries and 2 contributing to longterm systemic reform of the international financial system

three year period although this requirement has been breached on several occasions where the imf has lent at much higher multiples of quota 10 while many emerging market countries such as brazil india indonesia and mexico have stronger ma croeconomic fundamentals than they did decade ago sustained decrease in us imports resulting from an economic slowdown could have recessionary effects overseas emerging markets with less robust financial structures have been more dramatically affected especially those dependent on exports to the united states increased emerging market default risk can be seen in the dramatic rise of credit default swap cds prices for emerging market sovereign bonds financial markets are currently pricing the risk that pakistan argentina ukraine and iceland will default on their sovereign debt at above 80 11 on october 26 the imf announced 165 billion agreement with ukraine on october 27 the imf announced 157 billion loan to hungary on november 19 the imf announced 21 billion loan to iceland on november 24 the imf announced 76 billion loan to pakistan12 other potential candidates for imf loans are serbia kazakhstan lithuania latvia and estonia13 imf managing director dominique strausskahn has stressed that the imf is able and poised to assist with crisis loans at the imf annual meetings in october 2008 managing director strauss kahn announced that the imf had activated its emergency financing mechanism efm to speed the normal process for loans to crisisafflicted countries14 the emergency mechanism enables rapid approval usually within 4872 hours of imf lending once an agreement has been reached between the imf and the national government as noted before while normal imf rules are that countries can only borrow three times the size of their respective quotas over three years the fund has shown the willingness in the past to lend higher amounts should the crisis require extraordinary amounts of assistance second instrument that the imf could use to provide financial assistance is its exogenous shock facility esf the esf provides policy s upport and financial assistance to lowincome 9 for background see crs report rl33626

was modified in 2008 to further increase the speed and flexibility of the imfs response through the esf country can immediately access up to 25 of its quota for each exogenous shock and an additional 75 of quota in phased disbursements over one to two years on october 29 2008 the imf announced that it plans on creating new three month shortterm lending facility aimed at middle income countries such as mexico south korea and brazil the imf plans to set aside 100 billion for the new shortterm liquidity facility slf in unprecedented departure from other imf programs slf loans will have policy conditionality15 the imf is not alone in making available financial assistance to crisisafflicted countries the international finance corporation ifc the priv atesector lending arm of the world bank has announced that it will launch 3 billion fund to capitalize small banks in poor countries that are battered by the financial crisis the interamerican development bank idb announced on october 10 2008 that it will offer new 6 billion credit line to member governments as well as increase its more traditional lending for specific projects16 in addition to the idb the andean development corporation caf announced liquidity facility of 15 billion and the latin american fund of reserves flar has offered to make available 45 billion in contingency lines while these amounts may be insufficient should brazil argentina or any other large latin american country need rescue package they could be very helpful for smaller countries such as those in the caribbean and central america that are heavily dependent on tourism and property investments 17 in asia where countries were left choice but to accept imf rescue packages decade ago efforts are under way to promote regional financial cooperation so that governments can avoid having to borrow from the imf in financial crisis one result of these efforts is the chiang mai initiative network of bilateral swap arrangements among east and southeast asian countries in addition japan south korea and china have backed the creation of 10 billion crisis fund contributions are expected from bilateral donors the asian development bank adb and the world bank 18 lastly economic conditions over the past decade have created new class of bilateral creditors who could challenge the imfs role as the lender of last resort the rise of oil prices has created vast wealth among middle eastern countries and persistent trade surpluses in asia have created new class of emerging creditors these countries either have the foreign reserves to support their own currencies in financial crisis or they are potential source of loans for other countries 15 imf to launch new facility for emerging markets hit by crisis imf

revising its emergency lending assistance guidelines to make the imfs financial assistance more attractive to potential borrowers there is role for the imf to play in the broader reform of the global financial system efforts are underway to expand the imfs ability to conduct effective multilateral surveillance of the international economy in addition there are efforts to increase cooperation with the internatio nal financial standard setters as the financial stability forum fsf the bank for internationa l settlements bis as well as in various international working groups such as the basel committee on banking supervision and the joint forum on risk assessment and capital the deepening interconnectedness of the international economy may call for such increased cooperation between the imf which performs global macroeconomic surveillance and the individual global financial regulatory bodies the imf articles of agreement require article iv that the imf oversee the international monetary system in order to ensure its effective operation and to oversee the compliance of each member with its obligations to the fund in particular the fund shall exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policies of member countries and shall adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to those policies countries are required to provide the imf with information and to consult with the imf upon its request the imf staff generally meets each year with each member country for article iv consultations regarding the countrys current fiscal and monetary policies the state of its economy its exchange rate situation and other relevant concerns the imfs reports on its annual article iv consultations with each country are presented to the imf executive board along with the staffs observations and recommendations about possible improvements in the countrys economic policies and practices as the global financial system has become increasingly interconnected the imf has conducted multilateral surveillance beyond two biannual reports it produces the world economic outlook and the global financial stability report four regional
