due to fishery resource disaster resulting from natural causes manmade causes beyond the control of fishery managers to mitigate through conservation and mana gement measures including regulatory restrictions imposed to protect human health or the marine environment or undetermined causes requests usually contain information scribing the alleged fishery failure although guidelines for handling requests ar not codified in rule the secretary typically directs the appropriate regional administrator for nmfs to collect and analyze required information such as the historical context the biological and economic magnitude of the di saster and the relationshi p between underlying causes and the alleged fishery failure2 depending on the circum stances states may provide most of these data and the related analysis the secretary uses the information to determine whether or not the situation constitutes fishery failure once the secretary declares that fishery failure has occurred congress may use the authorization in the msfcma to appropr iate funds for fina ncial assistance to harvesters and other affected parties after funds are appropriated the secretar would make relief available to the affected state or fishing community often through state agencies funding under the msfcma may be used to ddress broad variety of n eeds including assessment of the social and economic effects of the failure assistance to the community and projects to restore the fishery or prevent reoccurrence of similar failure before releasing funds the secretary must also determine that relief activ ities would not expand the size and scope of the failure in that fishery other fisheries or affect fisheries in other geographic regions the federal share of assistance carried out under the msfcma cannot be greater than 75 of the cost of relief activities ifa the ifa was enacted in 1986 to dist ribute federal funds to states for developing interstate fisher research programs under ifa funds are authorized to provide assistance for commercial fisher failure in secti on 308b and section 308d under section 308b the causes of commercial fisher failure or serious disruption to future production due to fish ery resource disaster include natural and undetermined causes in section 308d fi shery resource disasters are referred to as natural disasters the definition of fish ery resource disaster ppears to be broader under the msfcma because humanrelated causes are also included otherwise the process of collecting information and determining whether failure has occurred is similar under both laws ifa funding under section 308b may be used by states alone or by the secretary in cooperation with the states funding may be provided for any purposehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34209crs4 3 eight regional fishery management councils were created by the fishery conservation and management act later renamed the ma gnuson fishery conservation and

required closure of the maine shellfish fishery in 2005 sba evaluated the impact on small businesses and determined disaster declaration was justified the declaration makes affected businesses

disaster declarations since 1994 the secretary of commerce has declared 25 fishery resource disasters during this period cong ress has appropriated nearly 730 million for fishery disaster relief t b l 2 provides list of fish ery disasters and funds appropriated by congress for each fishery resource disasters are diverse both with respect to their causes and scope most declarations have resulted from natural events such as hurricanes floods changes in ocean conditions or algal blooms such as red tide in coastal areas hurricanes may damage fishing industry infr astructure such as vessels docks fish houses and related bus inesses even if the res ource remains abundant harvesting processing and transport to markets may not be possibl until repairs are undertaken and basic services are restored in additi on to the costs of repairs and the replacement of equipment and gear lost fishing time can also be costly the fishery resource may also be directly affected if in addition to damaged infrastructure hurricanes cause damage to oyster beds from silt and debris algal blooms such as red tide are another type of natural event that can render s eafood toxic and result in fishery closures under these conditions fishermen may be completely shut down for months until toxin levels in shellfish decline to acceptable levels declines in fishery resource abundance ma result from several factors such as natural environmental varia tions human effects on the environment and overfishing salmon fisheries are sensitive to natura l changes in oceanic conditions salmon abundance has also been affected where dams irrigation grazing mining and forestry practices have degraded salmon habitat especially for salmon populations in the pacific northwest overfishing has also contributed to fish population declines in several resource disaster cases such as the new england multispecies fishery and the pacific groundfish fishery in these cases fish bundance decreased significantly and stock rebuilding has required substantial decreases in harvest httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34209crs6 table 2 fishery failure declarations since 1994 fishery or region authorit declared appropriation new

buckstate role states are frequently an activ partner throughout the process from requesting the secretary of commerce to declare fishery failure and providing related data to disbursing relief to fishermen and relate d businesses relief funding is often provided directly to states or in cases of regi onal disasters through regional commissions such as the paci fic states marine fisher ies commission for example in 2007 distribution of oregon salmon tr oll fishery relief was planned and coordinated by the state department of agriculture in coope ration with related agencies and nonprofit organizations ch as the oregon salmon commission in addition to matching funds st ate government may also pr ovide funding when federal funds are not available although histor ically such funding has been limited fishing capacity reduction programs many us fisheries are overcapitalized investments in fishing capacity are greater than that needed to harvest the fi shery resource on sustainable basis when fishery resources decline precipitously as in the case of fishery failure effects on the fishing industry are likely to be greater when there is excess fishing capacity operating in the fishery first when excess fishing capacity exists overfishing often occurs and management goals are likely to involve rebuilding of fish populations during rebuilding the fishery is likely to be highly regulated with relatively low allowable harvests second since many fisheries are already overcapitalized and fully exploited there are few alternative fi shing opportunities fi nally the financial effects of any fishery failure are likely to be greater when there is overcapacity because of the larger number andor size of vessels and associated crew participating in the fishery fishing capacity reduction of ten referred to as buyback programs has been prominent feature of several disaster relief programs capacity reduction is usually accomplished through the direct purchase of fishing vessels gear andor fishing permits6 the use and funding of capacity re duction are discussed in section 312b of the msfcma and section 308d of the ifa the general objectives of buyback programs are to provide immediate relief to fishermen decrease the level of fishing ffort to improve the profitability of the remaining fishing fleet and conserve the resource the effectiveness of buyback programs in reducing fishing capacity depends on whether the remaining fishermen have the incentive to continue investing in boats and gear often there is also latent fishing effort boats and gear with permits to fish that are inactive or only marginally utilized in the fishery the exit of some vessels may encourage this latent fishing effort vessels to reenter the fishery resulting in little or net reduction in fishing capacity furthermore the first to accept buybacks may be the least efficient vessels in the fleet this results in fleet reductions that are relatively modest yet expensive because only the oldest and least efficient units are taken out of production httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34209crs10 7 us dept of commerce nati onal marine fisheries service

bay blue crab on september 23 2008 secretary gutierrez determined that commercial fishery failure for the soft shell blue crab fishery19 of the chesapeake bay had occurred under 312 of the msfcma the blue crab population has declined since the 1990s with 41 decline in the value of soft shell blue crabs landings in maryland and virg inia although the cause is uncertain factors contributing to the blue crab population decline are likely to include deteriorating water quality loss of habitat and overfishing20 maryland and virginia adopted new commercial and recreational regulations fo r 2008 to shorten the season in both states limit the harvest of female crabs in maryland and close the winter dredge fishery in virginia the fishery failure determination was made in response to requests by the governors of virginia and maryland based on the decline of the resource and the importance of this fishery to chesapeake bay communities and the regional economy recent administrative actions by

solicited information regarding all aspects of fisheries disaster assistance from the general public fishing industry scientific community coastal communities and federal and state resource agencies partial list of topics identified by nmfs includes defining terms such as commercial fisheries failure fishery resource and fishery resource disaster determining the degree to which those engaged in fishery suffereconomic hardship defining the characteristics or pa rameters of fishery resource disaster the end date of disast er and the information required to request fishery failure or disaster determination and delineating the scope of biolog ical and economic data to be reviewed nmfs plans to use public input to deter mine which issues need to be addressed in developing proposed rule and ultimately final rule issues for congress commercial fisheries are strongly influenced by environmental conditions that may affect industry infrastructure or the abundance and distribution of the fishery resource these changes often take place suddenly in the case of hurricanes and harmful algal blooms within fishing season with little or warning disaster relief programs may help save businesses th at have been devastated and can address severe econom ic fluctuations by providing assistance until conditions return to normal several concerns have emerged that relate to the nature of commercial fisheries and disaster relief programs including 1 timing relief to meet crucial needs 2 relating disaster relief to long term fisheries manage ment 3 defining fishery failure and 4 determining the beneficiaries of relief timing of relief the timeliness of disaster re lief is concern because relief funds are seldom appropriate d in anticipation of disast ers first information regarding the scope of the disaster usually needs to be compiled by the fishing industry state and local governments nd nmfs difficulties in concluding this task can be compounded by the lack of da ta and readily availa ble economic studies in cases such as hurricane katrina it was immediately clear that disaster had occurred and the secretary made determination within two weeks of the landfall of hurricane katrina although the full dime nsions of the disaster and the level and scope of resource needs remained uncertain for months after the disaster many have asserted that some basic aid should have been provided to members of the fishing industry immediately after the disaster httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34209crs16 for the west coast troll salmon fish ery in 2006 immediate questions revolved around whether resource disaster would occur background information fishery landings and economic data we re needed for the secretary to make determination managers and participants were aware of the impending fishery closure before regulations were adopted because the poor condition of the klamath river chinook salmon stock was well documen ted even after regula tions were adopted some questioned whether fishery failure could be declared before the season started and the fishing industry had actually been harmed after fishery failure is declared f unding is dependent on appropriations by congress given the timing of appropriations bills and congressional schedules it can be difficult to appropria funding in timely manner hurricane katrina and hurricane rita fishery disast er funding was appropriate d in june 2006 more than nine months after the gulf fishery failure was declared in september 2005 many in the industry asserted that the greatest n eed occurred immediately after the hurricanes when infrastructure vessels gear and ma rkets were lost to fishermen and other industry participants the west coast tr oll salmon fishery was declared fishery failure in the summer of 2006 but fundi ng was not appropr iated until may 2007 in the shortterm many fishing industr participants believe that the most pressing concern should involve getting re lief to those individuals and businesses most directly and immediately affected by the fishery failure for these needs some have advocated establishing disaster f und with funding appropr iated in advance that could provide assistance on short notice in 2008 congress moved in this direction by appropriating 75 million for fishery disa sters in the consolidated security disaster assistance and continuing appropriations act 2009 pl 110329 longterm management approaches often direct or indirect assistance to the fishing industry is part of relie f program some ve criticized federal assistance because it delays the inevitable readjustment that may be needed for fisheries with excess harvesting capacity critics argue that climatic andor environmental conditions are blamed for fish population declines caused by overfishing most fish populations vary over time and frequently it is difficult to determine the relative importance of the factors that cause these variations features of several programs such as buybacks fisherman training and cooperative data collection fo cus on concerns related to the need for readjustments in fishing fleet size yet when relief is provided even when it includes buyback program greater numbers of fishermen and effort usually remain in the fishery than would be sustainable in the longrun many fisheries managers agree that relief such as vessel buybacks needs to be more clos ely integrated with ongoing fisheries management objectives defining fishery failures the general causes of fishery resource disasters that result in commercial fishery failures are defined by the msfcma and ifa however specific characteristics of fishery resource disaster such as scale timing and extent are not defined since there is set definition of fishery failure or fishery resource disaster the secretary of commerce has large degree of discretion when determining whether fi shery failure has occurred httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34209crs17 22 for more information see crs report rs21312 how many fishermen by eugene h buckfor example in 2007 the governors of maine massachusetts and rhode island requested the secretary of commerce to declare fishery failure for the northeast multispecies groundfish fishery there appears to be general agreement that northeast fishermen have faced continuing hardships during the last several years but disagreement centers on whether this di sruption rises to the level of fishery failure these ambiguities appear to be one of the reasons that nmfs solicited the public for information related to fisher resource disasters in early 2008 who benefits who benefits from disaster f unding is reoccurring point of contention participants such as fisher men and fish processors may be widely dispersed and difficult to locate and track although it is often possible to contact vessel and processing plant ow ners industryrelated labor such as crew members and fish processing employees may be difficult to track in some fisheries crew members are temporary labor that follow fishing opportunities22 because of the transient nature of employment in the fishing i ndustry and seasonal movement of fishing vessels among regions labor statistics regarding the empl oyment of fishermen are either difficult to obtain or may not exist similar problems may occur in related fishery processing and distribution sectors some have voiced the need for better labor statistics that can assist in forecastin g and planning for the effects of different fisheries programs includi ng disaster relief economic effects of fishery disasters on the local community and region are also difficult to quantify services directly related to fishing such as boat repairs dock services and fishing equipment suppliers as well as other businesses indirectly related to fishing are likely to be harmed by losses in the fish harvesting and processing sectors although genera l regional impacts can be estimated using economic models it is often difficult to identify the level of impacts on these businesses because of their dispersed nature and their indirect relationship to fishing many have claimed that broader understanding of these community impacts is needed relatedly some also argue for more deliberate and longterm data collection and planning to link community concerns with marine fisherie s management
