gpm items lecture given on 2 april 1963 well how are you today lets see if youre there how are you today audience fine all right all right this is what this is the 2nd of april or the 3rd or the 5th the 2nd of april ad 13 saint hill special briefing course and we have lot of material here for you today but the first thing id like to show you is the prototype of the new listing meter listing meter and been designing this and fowler and allen have been throwing the nuts bolts and electrodes together and here we have the item the item interesting huh theres new listing meter here huh well whats this all about whats this all about well ill show you better picture here on the other screen there is listing meter now it goes this side down as you list on the paper it goes that side down and youve got two panes of glass here and here and youve got your needle across here and youve got two rows of dots see the two rows of dots there see them now those of course are closest to the paper and it actually fits at about that angle and its on little slittle stick here see this little stick and it tips like this you can see itsee it tips over here the cansthe cans go on here and they plug in over here to the side like that and your wheelyour wheel seeis back here back see the back side and the tone arm reads are inside the dial there and so you get your needle action and your tone arm reads and as you put it down here you take pencil and you put your list underneath this glass you see this thing is hanging up like this and you actually rotate your tone arm over here with your finger and you go on and list and of course as you look at your paper you are looking through the two glasses at the dial dont you see so as you list if that needle twigs ticks rocket reads rock slams or anything else you of course see it without moving your eyeballs any off of what you are writing immediately below it dont you see that see to show you the position theres your paper theres your pencil and you look down through there and you see exactly what youre writing so that you get something like this dont you see and you see that through there and of course you can see your needle your needle swings back and forth across that check mark pretty good huh that is the new listing meter that is prototype of this and this does not replace the mark v this is cheap meter this is very very cheap meter and its skinned down and it only has two sensitivities and you skin this thing down to very elementary meter design and elementary parts and it doesnt cost very much money now the reason why it doesnt cost very much money is its not good enough you know to put good close rudiments in or do sec checking or something like that its pretty good though by the way only mark v will do something like that but its actually good enough for coaudit to put in rudiments with and you actually because these things are cheap you could have lot of them for coaudit you wouldnt want to buy whole bunch of mark vs for coaudit theyd beat them up something terrible what you want is bunch of these listing meters the price of this has not been released at this particular time its going into production as soon as i put in 12 14 hours of auditing with the meter and take any little refinements and so forth that need to be done and there we go now this is all very interesting but what does this do to the mark v well it doesnt do thing to the mark v you need that for various things and this is sufficiently cheap that you just put it in as part of your kit you would also want mark v to audit with man particularly if youre security checking my idea was mark v you know is quite expensive because the components in it are fixed to go forever and all that sort of thing and thats the modern mark v it has really been groomed in that way but this listing meterso some coaudit member has an arc break and busts one of them over somebodys head well you charge him the price of it or something like that then he isnt arc broke mark v youd weep man but you could buyyou see youthey should haveif youre running co audit you should have one of these listing meters for every team that is if youve got 30 people you need 15 listing meters if thats the way youre going to do it and of course thats an awful outlay so ive been laying it on here to get real cheap meter that was beautifully designed but basically one that would do power of good as far as listing is concerned so that you wouldnt miss reads and wouldnt give yourself any agitation or anything like that well thats athats enough of the commercial here the situation with regard to meters is pretty good the us government by the way is sort of running up the white flag over in the states on that thing thats confidential but i could tell you because i know you wont tell anybody itd be very shameful you know if the government had to quit they apparently are okay now todays lecture concerns the gpm and is consecutive to the last lecture which i gave you on the subject of the gpm what do we mean by gpm it is the goals problem mass now you can call it gpm is goal problem mass sequitur g p mgoal problem mass pc postulates goal this gives him problems and he accumulates mass and when hes accumulated so much mass and this thing has gone on and on and its all worn out and its deteriorated in meaning why he postulates another goal and he gets another problem series and he gets another mass now the whole thing was originally detected by the fact that the only thing that would keep pc from progressing in an auditing session was if he had present time problem i deduced from that that there must be something very weird about problems and i kept studying problems until i eventually had this drop out of the hamper the whole existence of the gpm was deduced it was deduced in its entirety before anybody ever saw one which i think is quite interesting because it is considerable triumph for research to have the thing actually exist now nobodys trying to foist this thing off on you if you dont have one if you dont have one why youre pretty lucky also youre not human but anyhow the gpm was deduced mechanism and its on this basis which you find back in 1950 and forwardi dont think this definition existed till about 55 but it was postulatecounterpostulate in other words you cannot have problem unless two people or two things have two opposing postulates or ideas and then you get problem problem is of dual nature it has duality problem does and you have this expressed in the gpm as the terminalwhich means the pcand the opptermwhich means the enemy now why are these things expressed you very often will find proper name actually your name will undoubtedly rocket read in present time when you get to the top of your gpm i had the rather horrifying experience just last night of having my own name rocket read like mad when we had approached it and in actual fact suddenly greeted present time i hadnt seen present time for some time and it was terribly unfamiliar and so on and i didnt like it very much but the pcs present time would be the top of his forming gpm thats his present time now actually he slides up and down this to some slight degree he becomes his last life or this life and he postulates his next life sort of and in postulating his next life or one hoping you know what hes going to become or afraid of what he might become he tends to have an element slightly into the future of the mest universe present time so the gpm that comes right on up to present time mest universe but may exceed it somewhat or may not quite reach it because the pc has his own present time as regulated by the goal problem mass in which he is situated the top of that would be his present time and anything back from the top of that would be his past now you get the oddity that pc could be in his own past and youll find this is rather uniform and consistent now weve known this for years the whole book dianetics the modern science of mental health talks about engrams and somebody being stuck on the time track well thats pc in his own past you see thats time track and thats his time track and its quite different than the mest universe time track it parallels it and it approximates it but it doesnt answer up point for point with the mest universe in other words you can be little bit ahead of present time in the mest universe you can be little bit behind present time in the mest universe with the top of the gpm and then the pc isnt necessarily at the top of his own gpm in other words he got tired forming this thing and for this half lifetime or something like that hes skidded and hes using slightly earlier item of course hes still forming the gpm but its sloppy thing ill give you an idea here heresheres mest universe present time you see now the pcs gpm in which he is situated might be just little bit forward of this present time because he wants to become cowboy in his next life thats not his goal thats just an ambition stemming from the goal to be active and he says well this lifetime thats too tough and he doesnt want anything much to do with it hes being brahhh something or other hes uphes up here he said im going to be cowboy see in my next life and he hasnt become cowboy but he actually youll find little item up here cowboy you got that hes already forming the next item that will become good sound terminal and you will find it and it will run in other words the pcpcs gpm extends up with his hope and this rather tends to make somebody believe that the gpm was all formed 200 trillion years ago and hes just living along this track well thats irresponsibility to end all irresponsibility i was looking at that the other night in other words here he is in pt and hes john doe there he is as john doe and john doe particularly its goal to be activeand he particularly detestsbecause of the goal and so forthactive people see in other words he was active down here but now hes become more sedentary and heres this oppterm now the goal has finally turned around on him hes getting ready to leave this gpm and john doe and he doesnt like active people so this one over here is an idea called active people now this is how thetan doesnt have to think this is sloppy thinking to end all sloppy thinking brother youve really taken the cake the prize the croix guerre all possible decorations for sloppy thinking because what you did was instead of having to analyze bill is an active person joe is an active person august is an active person and therefore antipathetic to because i dont like my goal anymore which is clear down here in the bottom of all this we say herewe just say active people and then that makes group summary that is the big think that tells you that people who think in terms of the peopleno individuals the people theyre nuts you know theyre nuts including khrushchev i dont think id audit khrushchev if he asked to because i think hed be too nuts he believes in thing called the people which means hes dramatizing one of these things and it has nothing to do with people this is the sloppy think do you understand the sloppy think we dont want to have to think about pete we dont want to have to think about gillham we dont want to have to think about george so we just think about people see or men youve seen girls like this youve made pass at some girl sometime or anothernot any of you of coursebut you made pass at some girl or another and she said all men are alike actually this is taken up in book one its quite interesting that we had it so pat all men are alike and you say huh actually shes got something over heremen see now this doesnt doesnt make it necessary remember what i told you about confront in the last lecture well this doesnt make it necessary to confront anything dont you see so that she can then just group classify anything that wears pants as men and one of you girls comes up with pedal pusher and youre just like all other men you see youre wearing pedal pushers or something like that slacks you know well you wear pants so youre man and she never looks to find out if youre man or woman she says all men are alike and therefore youre brutal now somewhere around here were going to have another one called brutal people see we dont have to confront anything we dont have to find out anything about people we dont have to do anything else if people are people theyre brutal people you see the idea we dont have to differentiate at all so this is why we get as such dominant character of the reactive mind and this carries through forward to time i have said advisedly that the thetan is on his own time track just as time but in actual fact the more he lives this thing the more he group thinks in other words he that means different thing in advertising it meansit means number of highpaid executives sitting around getting ideas and thats group think and thats not what i mean classification he thinks by classes he doesnt think in terms of bill or pete or anything so he thinks of time that way so that all time becomes time and every time is instantaneous time so in actual fact as you run the fellow back he cant tell if its yesterday or today or tomorrow or anything hes got all time classified just as he has this whole item here let us say is it all men are alike see and thats just men you know why weve got anotherother items which similarly group everything that has anything to do with the goal he just says well thatsbelongs to certain class of things so therefore thats all that and i dont have to inspect that and actually hes against it because he is being this thing here which is against that class so he is class and he is against class and there are individuations and that carries through and forward to time so there is individuated time in the gpm its quite interesting it all seems like right now you go back hundred trillion years and you may have track with pictures on it which parallels this which is hanging outside the gpm and you say oh yeah that was hundred trillion years ago it seemswell it seems long time ago youre looking at this picture the second you get into this thing called ladies of the court see thats an item in the gpm here would be ladies of the court see and here it is actually oh back here ages ago hundred trillion years ago see and it seems like its right here right here right now right here right now ladies of the court has time differentiation thats because there is differentiation in these things in other words these items are men versus women you see and one item includes all men and the other item will include all women and thetan just says well we dont have to think about this the best thing to do is just to realize that bricklayers are bad people well anybody then could be classified who was bad people would be bricklayer he thinks so too you know hell get twinge theyre bad people they must lay bricks you know its true but thats the nonthink characteristic because theres confront connected with it theres havingness without confront and you get havingness without confront you et this type of classification you understand so therefore as you come up the bank as you come up the bank these items successively entered into formed and so forth are usually postulated from the past into the future like this see here he is now and here he goes into the future and he thinks id like to be cowboy see active people so everythings going to become cowboys up here but he hasnt entered that so its not really nicely heavily formed theres not much mass on it yet because theres livingness and track connected with it but hes going to pass out of this period of present time and hes going to move into something that hes already figured out hes begun to get the inkling here you see thislet us say this item in present time is sedentary people hes begun to get the inkling that sedentary people are capable of holding you back hes gotten this idea here so hell be something on the order of an active person he finds out he cant be quite cowboy so hes going to be an active person facing people who hold you back hes already had these two items up here slightly into the future hes getting an inkling f them but he hasnt lived through them yet theres the way he figures out his bank in other words and therefore you find this bank wildly and widely classified its all its all in classes its all in postulates or concepts and this is why concept therapy was so effective when it was effective if youll remember 1952 something like that by the way the chiropractors down in texas took it upi think theyve still got it we abandoned it for the excellent reason that it apparently had some bug connected with it well the bug connected with it is we were actually pulling the postulate out of one of these gpm items without pulling or confronting the mass out of the item and therefore concept processingi recognized there was something bit wrong with it so i didnt push it anymore now thats what happened now of course you actually couldnt even by concept therapy disarrange this gpm very much but you sure could key somebody in on the back of his own track so there is time identified there is mass identified in these things that is to say he doesnt identify it as 1952 or something like that what he identifies is 1952 is hundred trillion years ago you see thats as far as his differentiation is capable of hes got total identification of two dates he doesnt then confront and single out the identity of single date im sorry for the use of the word identify and identity but english has moved over from differentiating oneness into total confusion of oneness with all other onenesses so you dont have word which actually follows through on that now whats this all about here this means that weve got goal here weve got goal here to be active and the first thing up from that hes simply now living the goal to be active so you have the goal to be active but it has certain enemies and those are probably something like inactive people or being inactive and then he moves up here and hes become somebody with the goal to be active and somebody with the goal to be active of course opposes with people who are inactive so its people who are inactive or something of that sort and then he gets up here little bit higher and hes got an active person or somebody who is active and that opposes of course something banal like somebody who is inactive and then we go up here little bit further and he getshes getting so hes fought these inactive people that what you resist ye become to make biblical utterance out of it because it was never more true of course all the time he has the goal to be active hes fighting inactive things whats eventually going to happen to him as he goes up the line on this terminal column he is going to become less and less and less active and more and more prone to being very sedentary so you get up here at the top you got something like person who hates activity or person who cant move or person who cant be active is usually the type of terminology it has and of course what does it faces it faces as an oppterm active people in other words its total reversal goes through this gpm this is always the case dont get fooled now and say well the case im auditing is different thats just an excuse because you cant find his goal or something the case youre auditing it does just that he doesnt do anything else otherwise he wouldnt be on this time track at this time and he would be in some other universe or something of the sort so thats what were talking about were talking about these conceptual items there is the pcs concept of his own identity based on his goal and his own identity is at first his goal fullout he is his goal and then he becomes somebody that has the goal and then he becomes somebody that represents the goal and then he becomes somebody that isnt getting along very well with the goal and then he becomes somebody who isnt very much in favor of this goal and then he becomes somebody who is against the goal and then somebody who just cant perform the goal at all now on the oppterm side the enemy becomes somebody who is highly antipathetic to this goal becomes somebody who isnt so antipathetic to the goal becomes somebody who isntis kind of neutral on the subject of the goal and eventually somebody who is rather in favor of this goal and then eventually is somebody who would have that goal and be active with that goal and thats the evolution of the oppterm now the evolution of the terminal is the deterioration of the goal the evolution of the oppterm is of course an improvement of the goal he just goes from total wouldnt oppterm wouldnt have the goal on bet to the oppterm is the goal thats nothing to do with the fact that people change but the persons idea who has these ideas change with regard to his opposition and for every one of these pairs you have problem now you could even articulate what the problem is and fool around with it lot but you dont have to actuallyyou bleed the charge the pc sees what it is youve got on the goal to be active youve got this person over here let us say hes come up to point of somebody with the goal to be active and who does he face he faces people who are inactive so hes classified now whats this conceptual thing people who are inactive well this ishe just classifies everything see he just says well joe bill pete mary john oscar government clerks businessmen people who sit down in chairs loafers bums skid row sailors dont move around on ships very much so they must be inactive and so forth and in other words that whole thing is this item people who are inactive sweeping isnt it sees one of these things his hair goes up he says waahhh awful grrrr he doesnt know why see because hes not really articulating it analytically he is simply talking about it hell talk about the next one up but not the one hes in hes already forming the one thats up by forecasting his opinions that which you resist you become so as the person dramatizes his goal and postulates these opposing terminals he of course gradually becomes the opposition eventually becomes an inactive person and there he is at the top of the bank as an inactive person now what happens to him now what happens to him well thats very interesting you can always predict the goal they run off completely one two three four here he is at the top of the bank lets say this is the top of the bank here and here he is an inactive personthis one over here and these are active people over here see so hes opposing those now this is your bank band in here now this thetan with the goal to be active at the top of his terminal line is of course longer capable of doing anything with this goal at all hes got too many overts on the subject you see hes had too many oppterms and so on so he has become the oppterm so hes an inactive person and over here you have active people all right its very easy to predict what hes going to do now thetan in actual fact doesnt live the bank one two one two hes always himself theyre always themselves what he does actually is become this one slightly you get continuous closure and he becomes inactive people and then he becomes the other one slightly so he actually moves on kind of zigzag up the line hes always slightly into the oppterm and out and then slightly into the next oppterm and out and slightly into the next oppterm and out you can see how he would do that because he resists these things he becomes and they monitor his own conduct so therefore you see very clearly here that an active person he was an active person hes become an inactive person whats he going to do when he postulates his next goal youve got active people over here now youd say well maybe he should postulate his own goal back youre going to get something slightly off its going to be something antipathetic about active people that he has learned in the wisdom of his long track experience so hes going to look at that and hes going to find life at this point utterly and completely intolerable hes going to be degraded because of course he has of course denied his own postulate remember that many times said hes denied himself hes denied himself but of course he is his own postulate to be active and here he is being inactive so hes denied himself so he feels very degraded and he doesnt like this so not liking this and havingwanting very little to do with this he wants to get rid of that goal he wants to get rid of that goal and here he has the character you see of an inactive person faced with active people so he solves the problem he solves the problem and he postulates goal up here right here he postulates this goal and that goal is to be quiet you can predict what next goal he willyou cant say what it is but youre going to get something weird going when you try to finally figure out what the pcs next goal is youre figuring it backwards you see from above down below when you go back up the other way you can see cleanly and clearly exactly what that pcs goal would be the next goal he postulates of course is to be quiet obvious second you see it its never anything like to be troubadour nuhuh uhuh uhuh wouldnt have anything to do with to be tank driver see it wouldnt be anything to do to have harem with 19 wives you know now that weve turned loose routine 2 on goal finding i think youre going to see some of these the most embarrassing goal that the pc comes up with of course ticks slightly and some uneducated auditor who doesnt know very much sees that tick doesnt realize that its just embarrassment the fellow giving up to have ato have harem of 17 wives you see something like this you see and he says thats the pcs goal and you know those things never are pcyouve got this bank ityoure trying to find the upper bank or youre trying to find this bankyouve got this bank up here and youre trying to find the lower bank just under it well its not offering you much problem now because weve got mechanisms which find the next goal bang without you having to do thing but hes never here to be singer that goal isnt there see that goal would not bewouldnt even be to dance you see because heres what makes it upthese top terminal oppterm that top terminaloppterm is what makes it up that tells you what the next goals going to be and thats what the next goals going to be its not going to be something else he postulates it all on his own he thinks hes free and clear and he thinks he has been totally disassociated from any influence in having postulated this goal as soon as you run back the bank you see why hes postulated every one of them hell tell you he postulated it free and clear own free will prime postulate had nothing to do with anything then you get back and you find out this goal to be quiet was immediately succeeded by the goal to be active they dont go plus and minus they dont go plus and minus you cant say goal to know the truth would be followed by the goal to know nothing you cant say that that would be the goal to know the truth might be preceded by another type of goal but it would be goal that had to do with secrecy ill tell you such goal to be gambler to be gambler and uuhhh eee oohhhh he doesnt want anybody to know what hes doing only it might be little more frightened than thatto be secretive how about that well thats of course followed by goal something like that to tell people or to teach people or something dont you see but therell be combination in between these but sometimes its more subtle than that sometimes it is simplywell lets say thisto be an executive well thatrare that such goals occur but its to be an executive then its followed inexplicably with the goal to be truthful but when you see the two together you will understand you will understand because of course as manager or as an executive or as government head or something like this there are many things you cant tell people and you eventually get to point where you dont like people who are too broadcast in their opinions so on the us government now has practically thrown the press out of the pentagon and everything theyi think therell be camp eventually in washington as the government goes along its wild career itll be 30 or 40 miles out from the city and itll be inhabited by newsmen and thats as close as theyre permitted to the capitol nobodys permitted to give them news these days so you keep holding back news dont you see you keep holding back news and you eventually get an oppterm you see which has to do with the exact reversal to hold back news and even though you were an outflowing type character to begin with well this will mount up so you get an influence building through three or four gpms dont you see the guy was to be outspoken you see and this is followed by to be reserved you see and so forth and that will eventually deteriorate to the personto never say word because you get the cumulative effect of these things theyre not positivenegative theyre not opposenot oppose that does not work out its just what the person postulated originally and what he became on his experiential track and then what he took on for randomitythese are all determinable from the exact goals that you findand then that sequence lands him in another sequence which of course goes through the same deterioration and that lands him in another sequence each one of those sequences is separate gpm with goal at the head of each one of them these things are not intermixed you can collapse one end of the gpm on the other you can mix them up like dough you can throw four gpms together you can think that one gpm goes ahead of the other gpm when it goes behind it it eventually turns out you can scramble the bank most gorgeously on pc but actually only by finding more goals than you have run i dont mean theres any danger in finding goals ordinarily only one goal fires at time but i proved the other evening that two goals can fire at the same time what youre looking at here is the gradual deterioration of thetan youre looking at the dwindling spiral what he postulates he tries to become but in becoming it accumulates overts on things that arent what he postulates things are bad because he has postulated whats good and then this of course results in deterioration degradation where hes concerned so he postulates new goal this selectsthis preselects out for him his enemies because an enemy is somebody who doesnt have that goal and then he gets deterioration up the line and eventually that goal passes out of his existence and control into the hands of the opptermit looks like in the bank so he postulates new goal and as he goes along the whole consecutive pattern of gpm takes on rather consistent note you dont have somebody with goal to be lady also with the goal to make heavenly voices these would not be the same thing to ait wouldnt be the parts of the same bank why well to be lady as it deteriorates of course goes into other things and it might possibly go up to religious goal of some kind or another we could expect that sort of thing to happen but the truth of the matter is that if youve got religioustype goal creeping in along the line its also wholehog i mean itll be common to all the gpms itll be something about it to be bad to be good to be devilish to get around people to trick people to be honest to make people be honest tothis kind of thing theres consistency running all the way through the thing that has to do with regulating behavior and you could probably get common denominator of all goalsits probably flavored by the first goal the pc ever postulated but you dont have that goal and you wont have that goal for long time so you willthe only thing you will notice is that they aretheyre of family theyre of kind the guy has certain type of activity well this gives you an experiential track for the pc theseon your 2 routine 2gs you keep putting down goals that go out hard youll notice after while that there is consistency you maybe got an axiom 10 thetan on your hands you see and its all on this subject all on this subject one after another axiom 10 axiom 10 or they move up and down maybe the axioms but theyre cousins and bank to bank theyre actually brothers or dichotomies or you can see that theyre similar and the various similarities here can be taken advantage of by the auditor you have to study these things for while and you all of sudden will say yeah what do you know well i was just looking over list goal oppose list just little while ago and i didnt see the terminal or oppterm on it the top oppterm top terminali didnt see them on that goal oppose list but thei looked over an unnulled list which is most likely to achieve the goal and there staring in the face was the top oppterm how do i know its the top oppterm well lets say the goal is to eat jelly cakes whats the top oppterm eaters of jelly cakes of course i mean you knowi mean its very difficult to figure this out see once you know the idiocy of all of this however is what has prevented man from understanding it or having anything to do with it its based on the solid mechanic of postulatecounterpostulate problem guy has problem and you get all the consequences of the overtmotivator sequence the noncommunication the cut communications the withdrawalall of these various thingscant reach cant withdraw must reach mustnt withdraw all of these things are consequent to these masses and theyre in nice little packages all by themselves and they go on up the line to the top now the funny part of the top is that the pc will start exteriorizing from the masses when you get him close enough to present time he can feel himself exteriorize from them mass by mass he all of sudden recognizes that he isnt himself his own name and he recognizes that he isnt this future thing hes liable to do sort of pop an exteriorization pop and even though youve run up to the top of the bank in some way or another when youve really got the top of the bank you can expect the guy to sort of get an idea that hes going pop exteriorizing and hell run something else down the line and hes going to go uhhp and exteriorize and hell start coming out of this thing well hes been in it for long time you run these banks on down to the bottom find the next goal run that on down to the bottom find the next goal run that on down to the bottom find the next goal run that on down to the bottom find the next goal and run that on down to the bottom find the nextthats all there is to clearing the individualists amongst us however have managed to vary the gpm only to this degree the only variation i think you will find in gpms is where they stop ill give you an idea of just that where do they stop where does gpm stop well let us say this is full goal now im not going to draw as many here as you would actually have in goal see this is full goal and heres your bottom of the goal that has an item here too by the way and heres your top terminaloppterm of the next goal you got that heres the top terminaloppterm of the next goal and of course that goes on down this way and this goes this way and here weve got this other bank now the question is how far north in this thing does the pc go does he go this far is this all the items hes got or does he go this far does he go this far all the way or has he been very cute and postulated another goal up on top of this one that only has that many in it huh hoohh so we find this goal and we get this top oppterm and we run the thing down and were running it all out and about this time my god that thing has got lot of mass and its very difficult and its having an awful time running it but you go ahead and you run it out the bottom and you skip this and you try to find the next goal and its all very difficult you can find the next goal but hes dragging an awful lot of mass with him and so forth finally you get bright and you take this goal and try to find out what this goal is and that may be much harder to find than the goal under it and you try to find that goal up there well thats horse of another hue in other words these conditions can exist you can have goal whicha goals problem mass which has maybe four items in it and then full bank hereyou can have full bank and of course if youve got full bank then youve just got nothing but full banks from here on the number of these doesnt particularly isnt particularly significant this is your terminal column this is your oppterm column all right does the thetans bank look like that and are you here or are you here is that where you came in do you still have piece of goal up here well the thing to do is to find the top of this goal with the goal you did find dont let go of the goal you found you find the top here and then come on down and you can ask him on the meter very cute whether or not theres goal above this one and youll get tick if there is and its as simple as that and because youve got this one and because youve got this one you can actually give them questions that figure out what this goal is lets say this is the goal to leave why naturally this oppterm here is to leave well now whatspeople who leave and whats the next one well i dont know possibly the next one is therefore to stay around something like that youre not quite sure what its going to be you cant predict it that it is what it is but you can get various lists and predictions and guess at it and shoot at it and so forth youll eventually get these two terminals if you list upwards you can go all the way through this bank and on repair youll find yourself all of sudden going backwards up into this bank you can go both ways in bank which might be very interesting to you and you can list one all the way to the bottom and then patch it up and find yourself listing the top and all of sudden go wheeep and youll think youre going over here to some lower bank but actually youre not youre landing in that bank you probably are landing in lower bank if you were inexpertly overlisting and that sort of thing youre going elsewhere but youll eventually find this little thing and then up here youll find the pcs pt now heres whats particularly horrible is in this zone of this little truncated bank or in any part of the gpm which is present time is formed that far at the top of the top gpm you will findyou remember hidden standards and things like thiswell youll find all of the pcs hidden standards you will find all of his chronic somatics you will find all of his worries and yaps lie in the few top buttons that are nearest to present time so look at this horrible thing you could come in here run this whole bank get its top oppterm everything else and youre going down this line and the pcs dragging mass along mass turns on easily and hes saying ohhh and so on but when are you going to do something about this lumbosis when are you going to do something about the lumbosis the lumbosis the lumbosisgod youve heardnever heard of anything but the lumbosis after while suspect whats going on you havent got his present time items or otherwise he wouldnt be talking to you about this man the thing to do youll find one of these items ticking or something of the sort is start going back up and see if you can locate just little bit more close to present time now the bank as i say might be in this state whereby theres just little piece of goalitd have regular goal and everythingand then theres whole gpm and then followed in sequence by the remaining gpms or it can be like this this makes life much more interesting now here we have just your regular gpm see but its truncated instead of whole top going over border to little smidgen of goal youve got half gpm now you list most likely and it lands you of course in the bottom of the terminal column huhhuh toward the bottom of the terminal column because of course thats the most likely thing to make the goal and so you say well lets list the least likely and thats going to land you of course in the bottom of the oppterm column and you dont want to be in the bottom gpms are always run from the top down you get as high as you can go in them and run lower dont try to get as low as you can go and run higher you can do it but after youve tried it few times youll realize its much harder to do than from top down but the horrible part of it is is sometimes you have to start below the top and go lower then do patch up realizing something is missing in here find bypassed item and start listing against it and youll find yourself going higher and youll go on up and find the top of the bank so its not impossible but recognize that the hidden standards the ptps the chronic ptps the pcs chronic somatics all of these various things he natters and yaps about and that are the realest to him are contained in these items which are nearest to pt and that it is very difficult to hit those deadon if you have halfformed bank why there isnt any most likely to achieve the goal there isnt any least likely to achieve the goal at the top of the bank lets give you an example its the goal to be excited well of course the least likely to succeed is an unexcited person and that probably is the bottom of the oppterm column for that goal and the most likely to succeed is an excited person and that of course is the bottom of the terminal column oh i think this is getting very interesting because of course we are at the bottom of the goal and we already know whats at the bottom of the goal weve got the goal weve got somebody or something with the goal to weve got the goal itself weve got things at the bottom of the goal and we could always go in at the bottom we want up on the top so on this goal to be excitedthis goal to be excited we have lukewarm person facing lukewarm people thats the pcs present time of course its halfway through the overts have run him down to point of where hes halfway away from the goal and of course the oppterms have moved up to halfway to the goal and youve got middle ground here and youve got lukewarma lukewarm person facing lukewarm people and it doesnt have anything to do with being excited at all do you see what you face there anatomically well trying to get that band trying to get that halfformed gpm is much tougher than to get this one because you can get this one even though the pcs screaming and moaning that he still has mass and henot mass on the items but he still feels bad and hes still worried about agnes hes just worried about agnes all the time and he just cant seem to get unworried about well agnes is rocketfiring oppterm in his present time and you just havent lead up to it yet of course hes worried about agnes he sees her every day shes an oppterm in the flesh you seeyou see what he himself he himself may be terminal or an opptermhe also may be an oppterm so whathow do we find this how do we find this well that gives you problems of course there are many solutions to such problem im just giving you whatthe problems that you face in looking at it so gpm pt for the pc may be at any time of the forming of it it could be the first two items it could be the next six items it could be the it could be all the way to the top it could be two over into the next bank you know i meanwhere whats his position because its the same picture just line up the gpms of three or four goals one after the other and then just cut in anyplace in the first one or two and thats where youll pick up the pc but of course youve got the special conditions of partially formed goal partially formed gpm it all comes under the heading as not very complicated just partially formed gpm and the top of that gpm is present time for the pc thats what youve got to reach and thats what youre listing for in trying to audit somebody youre trying to get to pt and go down that is what your mission is is to get as close as you can to pt as blind strike in and then go down bit and then perhaps move it back up to pt by various mechanisms and then clean it all out and get that little item thats dogged into the future whatever that is and then when youve got that all straight then go for broke going down and you just after that its just aits just sailing breeze theres nothing to it its very simple you can always go down the toughest part of the case is the beginning of the case and thats where youre the most ignorant and where your pc is the least educated the most nervy and the hardest to audit isnt it horrible the way life is but thats why man has never cracked this thing the hardest portion of it to crack was the beginning of it and of course at the beginning anybody trying to crack it has the least knowledge of it and so its operated simply as big doubledoor shutintheface mystery it isnt actually much of mystery itspeople are and they become and they can postulate and they have an opinion about others and thats all based on their pattern of goals and they dramatize these things like crazy now there are many special cases of actions theres various things that can happen when youre auditing its not my purpose in this particular lecture to give you whole bunch of things that can happen or not happen or anything im just talking to you about anatomy how the gpm is formed where you find the pc when you first enter the gpm and it is simply anatomy of the gpm that is quite important to you the more studying you do on this the more experience you get on this the easier it is in actual fact the most worrisome time is when the auditor is the least skilled and the toughest end of the case of course is when the pcs case has not been entered because you dont know where you are in the case and those things are the most difficult ends of it but if you can just get over that big hump the big hump of your own lack of skill at the beginning and the pcs lack of knowingness about where he is or what hes doingthe tough end of the auditing is then overcome because when youve slid over those two barriers of the auditors lack of skill and the pcs unknownness you all of sudden find yourself sitting on high road and its very easy to go down that high road clicketyclicketyclick poppety poppetypop you learn more and more and more you learn more and more about gpms you learn more and more about it and the pc is of course easier and easier to audit and of course the next pc you get ahold of theres not much of hump but youre able to go over that hump because youve gotten more experience the next thing you know you do like i was doing little while ago i looked on list to see if the pcs item was on the list before i nulled it you know that kind of an operation pcs item on this list uhmmm hmm hmm how far formed is this pcs gpm lets see these are the lists hes listing and how well formed are these gpms well his first gpm isoh its not formed yet its only about halfway ah yeah heres an old goal oppose list so its about half formed gpm how would you know that well you dont find anyyou dont find anything thats likely top term or oppterm or top terminal and so forth and its all sort of lukewarm thats what you got youll get so that youre acquainted with it and theres nothing like doing something with it to get acquainted with it and you threw up your hands in horror and said oh my god this thing is so complicated and uhuhhhhh and the pc arc breaks so terribly and its so dangerous if we audit him wrong and that sort of thing well all these things are true all these things are true it is true that it takes long time for pc to be picked up off the pavement and get going and its not something you do in half an hour and its true that youll have bad times and that you will have times when he feels wonderful all day and the next day god almighty why the hell did he ever he never really says why the hell did he ever enter scientology or something like that he always says what the hell did he ever postulate such lousy goal for you know this is the hazards of the business youre at the tough end of the line learn anatomy learn what these things look like get it through your skull what these things are all about and soon as you understand what these things are all about then you understand what youre doing and when you understand what youre doing it falls apart i would say that probably the toughest part as far as im concernedas far as i personally am concernedi should think that the toughest part of clearing is finding goal from my experience the toughest part of it is not auditing items or finding out where you are its tougher to find goal and look what we gotthe ammunition weve got today to find goals so in actual fact if you can find goal accurately on pc i do i wouldnt quail at the rest of it at all okay theres anatomy of this here gpm and i hope you get acquainted with it thank you very much and good night
