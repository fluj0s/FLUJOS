untitled document apr 16 2008 the main line of postulates and agreements there doesnt seem to have been several tracks on which life formed itself up life formed itself up on one main line of postulates and agreements and this one main line of postulates and agreements is scientology and that is what it is not what i make it or you make it it is what it is and these are the things with which we deal and some of us know those things better than others and so there is subject but what subject is it it is the subject of what life has been up to its the subject of the kingpin center postulates on which life has oriented itself and the discovery of those things and their isolation from masses of other material as the important material and then without alteration the delivery of that information to other people has been the study of scientology excerpted from the washington congress on antiradiation confront congress lectures radiation on the whole track an article by l ron hubbard from the washington congress on antiradiation confront lectures practically every whole track incident was done with radioactive materials ill give you the idea of how that is once upon time once upon time spirit being thetan did not make his walls and solids out of this stuff this stuff is simply reflective light lights there and something reflects there dont you see that curtain is visible only so long as light shines on it the curtain itself does not furnish its own visibility now way way back in the early stages of this universe evidently something wasnt considered any good unless it itself provided its own visibility in other words that curtain was good curtain if it radiated if it glowed enough to be seen itself without any reflected light then it was thetans idea of good thing in other words every cubic inch of this particular room on wholetrack waybackwhen idea would have been for every cubic inch of this room to have glowed with brightness and with brilliance and intense radiation you could have warmed your hands at any fireplug with good pleasant sunny gamma but thetans didnt admire material which didnt glow so thats what they got now you have to shine lights on it to get it to gleam do you see how there could be difference here now it is true that radioactive substance diminish in mass thats because they dont like to stay together radioactive substances diminish in mass because they do not like to stay together theres more to that statement than you would notice because the duplicative reaction to radiation is not to stay together disperse in other words radiation disperses or radioactive substance disperses so somebody observing radiation tends to disperse im afraid theres more to it than that particles of radioactive material individuate they become individuals so we see people under the bombardment of radiation individuate and tend to fall away from one another and become individuals they get so convinced of this after while theyre afraid that they gather in large group theyll blow up now we can explain all these things very easily we say well of course they decentralize because if they were close together they could be bombed however thats secondary rationale secondary rationale theyre just radiation disperses so things disperse you got the idea now therefore thetan sooner or later must have conceived some harm to be contained in radiation to react to it and consider that that reaction is harmful and we get one of the basic postulates one of the basic convictions it isnt as basic as conviction itself but its quite basic that something can be harmful this is quite an idea this is terrific idea l ron hubbard excerpted from the lecture insanity scarcity and importances this lecture is available in the washington congress on antiradiation confront lectures successes from listening to the congress lectures the wins that stand out the most are the ones that i had while listening to the first set
