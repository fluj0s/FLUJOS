terrorism list summary cuba was first added to the state departments list of states sponsoring international terrorism in 1982 pursuant to section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 pl 9672 at the time numerous us government reports and statements under the reagan administration alleged cubas ties to international terrorism and its support for terrorist groups in latin america cuba had history of supporting revolutionary movements and governments in latin america and africa but in 1992 fidel castro stressed that his countrys support for insurgents abroad was thing of the past cubas policy change was in large part result of cubas diminishing resources following the breakup of the soviet union and the loss of billions of dollars in annual subsidies to cuba cuba remains on the state departments terrorism list with four other countries iran syria sudan and north korea according to the state departments country reports on terrorism 2005 issued in april 2006 cuba has actively continued to oppose the usled coalition prosecuting the global war on terror and has publicly condemned various us polices and actions the state department report also asserted that cuba maintains close relationships with other state sponsors of terrorism such as iran and north korea and contended that cuba has provided safe haven for members of several foreign terrorist organizations the report also maintained that cuba continues to provide safe haven to us fugitives from justice but noted that cuba has stated that it will longer provide safe haven to new us fugitives who may enter cuba cubas retention on the terrorism list has received more attention in recent years in light of increased support for legislative initiatives to lift some us sanctions under the current economic embargo should us restrictions be lifted variety of trade and aid restrictions would remain in place because of cubas retention on the terrorism list supporters of keeping cuba on the terrorism list argue that there is ample evidence that cuba supports terrorism they point to the governments history of supporting terrorist acts and armed insurgencies in latin america and africa they stress the governments continued hosting of members of foreign terrorist organizations and us fugitives from justice critics of retaining cuba on the terrorism list maintain that the policy is holdover from the cold war and that cuba longer supports terrorism abroad they argue that domestic political considerations are responsible for keeping cuba on the terrorism list and question many of the allegations

prohibits the export or other provision of munitions to country if the government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism1 cubas retention on the terrorism list has received more attention in recent years in light of increased support for legislative initiatives to lift some us economic sanctions under the current embargo should us sanctions be removed variety of trade and aid restrictions would nonetheless remain in place because of cubas retention on the terrorism list at this juncture however sanctions have not been 1 both section 620a of the foreign assistance act and section 40 of the arms export control act have provisions similar to section 6j of the export administration act in which the secretary of state may publish determination that country is supporting international terrorism however the only published determinations by the secretary of state have been those under section6j and constitute what is known as the state sponsors of terrorism list crs2 removed and cuba remains subject to comprehensive us trade and financial embargo pursuant to the trading with the enemy act and the foreign assistance act of 1961 in addition to the terrorism list sanctions imposed by the export administration act section 40a of the arms export control act pl 90629 22 usc 2781 prohibits the sale or export of defense articles and defense services if the president determines and certifies to congress by may 15 of each year that the country is not cooperating fully with united states antiterrorism efforts this list has been issued annually since 1997 and currently includes cuba as well as iran north korea syria and venezuela2 removing country from the terrorism list under section 6j of the export administration act countrys retention on the terrorism list may be rescinded in two ways the first option is for the president to submit report to congress certifying that 1 there has been fundamental change in the leadership and policies of the government of the country concerned 2 the government is not supporting acts of international terrorism and 3 the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future the second option is for the president to submit report to congress at least 45 days before the proposed recision will take effect justifying the recision and certifying that 1 the government concerned has not provided any support for international terrorism during the preceding sixmonth period and 2 the government has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future over the years three countries have been removed from the terrorism list south yemen was removed in 1990 when it ceased to exist upon merging with north yemen iraq was removed from the list in 1982 and again in 2004 after having been added back in 1990 libya was removed in may 2006 although section 6j does not set forth procedure for congress to block the presidents removal of country from the terrorism list congress could pass legislation on its own to block the removal in contrast section 40 of the arms export control act which prohibits the export of munitions to governments repeatedly providing support for international terrorism sets forth specific procedure for congress to consider joint resolution to block the presidents removal of country from the terrorism list in addition both section 40 of the arms export control act and section 620a of the foreign assistance act of 1961 which prohibits most assistance to countries supporting international terrorism provide presidential waiver authority for national security interests or humanitarian reasons 2 us department of state determination and certification under section

administration added cuba to the list of state sponsors of terrorism pursuant to section 6j of the export administration act of 1979 press reports at the time indicated that the commerce department notified congress on february 26 1982 that cuba was being added to the list of countries that sponsor international terrorism but that explanation for the addition was given3 the commerce department published an interim rule in the federal register on april 19 1982 stating that it was amending the export control regulations with an effective date of march 1 1982 to add statement that cuba has been designated by the secretary of state as country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism4 the addition of cuba was not considered significant at the time since the united states already had comprehensive economic sanctions on cuba dating back to the early 1960s as result the economic sanctions associated with being added to the terrorism list would have had practical significance although the administration provided explanation in the federal register notice as to why cuba was added to the terrorism list various us government reports and statements under the reagan administration in 1981 and 1982 alleged cubas ties to international terrorism in addition 1998 state department chronology on uscuban relations and 2003 state department document provide

affairs of the senate foreign relations committee which detailed cubas support for armed insurgencies and terrorist activities in latin america and the caribbean6 the state department asserted in the paper that cuba has encouraged terrorism in the hope of provoking indiscriminate violence and repression in order to weaken government legitimacy and attract new converts to armed struggle the paper maintained that cuba was most active in central america especially nicaragua where it wanted to exploit and control the revolution and salvador and guatemala where it wanted to overthrow the governments7 cuba also was reported to provide advice safe haven communications training and some financial support to several violent south american organizations this included training colombian m19 guerrillas with the objective of establishing peoples army8 the state departments patterns of international terrorism 1982 stated that both cuba and the soviet union continue to provide financial and logistical support and training to leftist forces in the area central america that conduct terrorist activity the report further stated in its efforts to promote armed revolution by leftist forces in latin america cuba supports organizations and groups that use terrorism to undermine existing regimes in cooperation with the soviets the cubans have facilitated the movement of people and weapons into central and south america and have directly provided funding training arms safe haven and advice to wide variety of guerrilla groups and individual terrorists 1998 state department chronology of uscuban relations from 1958 to 1998 notes that the united states added cuba to the terrorist list in 1982 because of its support for the m19 guerrilla group in colombia9 in january 1982 state

documents from 1981 and 1982 described above the state department maintains that cuba was added to the list because of its support for terrorist groups in latin america it contends that cuba was providing support for terrorist organizations at the time including the puerto rican nationalist group known as the armed forces of national liberation faln the farabundo marti national liberation front fmln in salvador and the sandinista national liberation front fsln in nicaragua it also asserts that cuba helped transship soviet arms to nicaragua and salvador for use by terrorist organizations trained antiamerican insurgents elsewhere in latin america and supported insurgencies or war efforts in angola and ethiopia13 current rationale for retaining cuba on the terrorism list

said that it wanted cubas continued mediation with the eln in cuba the 2005 report also maintained that cuba continues to permit us fugitives from justice to live legally in cuba but noted that cuba has stated that it will longer provide safe haven to new us fugitives who may enter cuba the report asserted that the us government periodically requested cuba to return wanted fugitives to the united states but that cuba continues to be nonresponsive the 2004 terrorism report contended that more than 70 fugitives from us justice were in cuba many of the fugitives are accused of hijacking or committing violent actions in the united states including joanne chesimard who is wanted for the murder of new jersey state trooper in 1973 most of the of the fugitives entered cuba in the 1970s the

security press release indicated that ice does not generally deport people to cuba or countries believed to be acting on cubas behalf15 posada had been imprisoned in venezuela for the bombing of the cuban airliner but reportedly was allowed to escape from prison in 1985 after his supporters paid bribe to the prison warden16 in november 2000 posada had been imprisoned and ultimately convicted in

rl32730 cuba issues for the 109th congress by mark p sullivan crs7 the controversial allegations date back to may 2002 when then under secretary of state for arms control and international security john bolton stated that the united states believes that cuba has at least limited offensive biological warfare researchanddevelopment effort and has provided dualuse technology to other rogue states bolton called on cuba to cease all bwapplicable cooperation with rogue states and to fully comply with all of its obligations under the biological weapons convention18 when questioned on the issue secretary of state powell maintained that under secretary boltons statement was not based on new information powell asserted that the united states believes cuba has the capacity and the capability to conduct research on biological weapons but emphasized that the administration had not claimed that cuba had such weapons some observers viewed powells statement as contradicting that of under secretary bolton19 in late june 2003 news reports stated that an employee of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research maintained that under secretary boltons assertions about cuba and biological weapons were not supported by sufficient intelligence20 in march 30 2004 congressional testimony before the house international relations committee under secretary of state john bolton asserted that cuba remains terrorist and bw threat to the united states according to bolton the bush administration has said repeatedly that we are concerned that cuba is developing limited biological weapons effort and called on fidel castro to cease his bw aspirations and support of terrorism bolton went on to add caveat however that existing intelligence reporting is problematic and the intelligence communitys ability to determine the scope nature and effectiveness of any cuban bw program has been hampered by reporting from sources of questionable access reliability and motivation21 the new york times reported on september 18 2004 that the bush administration using more stringent intelligence standards had concluded that it is longer clear that cuba has an active offensive bioweapons program22 an august 2005 state department report to congress indicated that while observers agree that cuba has the technical capability to pursue some aspects of 18 john r bolton beyond

cubas retention on the terrorism list in general those who support keeping cuba on the terrorism list argue that there is ample evidence that cuba supports terrorism they point to the governments history of supporting terrorist acts and armed insurgencies in latin america and africa they point to the governments continued hosting of members of foreign terrorist organizations and us fugitives from justice critics of retaining cuba on the terrorism list maintain that it is holdover of the cold war they argue that domestic political considerations keep cuba on the terrorism list and maintain that cubas presence on the list diverts us attention from struggles against serious terrorist threats cubas stance against terrorism those who concur with the administrations current rationale for keeping cuba on the state sponsor of terrorism list point to strong antiamerican statements made by fidel castro and other cuban officials fidel castro stated that the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states were in part consequence of the united states having applied terrorist methods for years24 cubas subsequent statements became increasingly hostile with cubas mission to the united nations describing the us response to the us attacks as fascist and terrorist and asserting that the united states was using the attack as an excuse to establish unrestricted tyranny over all people on earth25 castro himself said that the us government was run by extremists and hawks whose response to the attack could result in an infinite killing of innocent people26 those who question cubas retention on the terrorism list point out that cuba has ratified all 12 international counterterrorism conventions in27 they further point to cubas expression of sympathy and offer of support to the united states in the aftermath of the world trade center and pentagon attacks in 2001 including the offer of medical and humanitarian assistance and the use of airspace and airports to 23 adherence to and compliance with arms control nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments us department of state august 2005 24 andrew cawthorne cubas castro urges us to keep calm

gratuitous those questioning cubas retention on the terrorism list also contend that cuba has made repeated offers to the united states since november 2001 for bilateral agreement to fight terrorism but that the united states has not responded29 some who question the administrations rationale for keeping cuba on the terrorism list while acknowledging cubas history of supporting revolutionary movements and governments in latin america and africa point to several versions of the state departments patterns of global terrorism report in the 1990s that stated that cuba longer actively supported armed struggle in latin america or other parts of the world harboring members of foreign terrorist organizations in reference to the administrations allegations that cuba hosts members of foreign terrorist organizations some observers maintain that this is line with cubas longtime hostility toward the united states and the remnants of its very active involvement in supporting terrorist groups in the past on the other side some observers maintain that cuba has shed its past as supporter of terrorist and insurgent groups and members of terrorist organizations who reside in cuba do so pursuant to agreements or the acquiescence of the home countries of the terrorist organizations basque eta members some observers maintain the presence of basque eta members in cuba stems from 1984 agreement with the spanish and panamanian governments30 cuba asserts that the eta members have never used cuban territory for terrorist activities against spain or any other country and that the issue is bilateral matter between cuba and spain31 on the other side some observers maintain that after the 1984 agreement some 20 eta members sought by the spanish authorities for killings in spain were known to have found refuge and support in cuba32 moreover the spanish government requested the extradition of an eta suspect from cuba in august 2003 and according to the state department publicly requested cuba to deny eta members sanctuary in november 200333 28 cuban ministry of foreign relations declaration by the ministry of foreign affairs cuba has nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed

cuba xinhua general news service august 2 2003 crs10 colombian farc and eln members with regard to colombian guerrilla group members in cuba the state department annual reports on global terrorism for 2002 and 2003 acknowledged that colombia acquiesced to the presence of colombian guerrillas in the country and has publicly said that it wants cubas continued mediation with the eln in cuba the cuban government maintains that it has been actively involved in hosting peace talks and that its contributions to peace talks have been acknowledged by colombia and the united nations34 on the other hand some observers contend that cubas role in supporting the terrorist activities of the farc was demonstrated by the arrest of three alleged irish republican army ira operatives in colombia in august 2001 one of whom niall connolly had lived in havana as sinn feins representative since 1996 the three went into hiding in june 2004 after they had been acquitted by lower court on charges of training the farc in bombing techniques in december 2004 however they were subsequently convicted of the charges by colombian appeals court in absentia and sentenced to 17 years in prison connolly who has denied being an ira member maintains that he was in colombia to observe the conflict resolution process the three announced that they were back in ireland in early august 2005 days after the ira announced that it was ending its armed campaign35 harboring us fugitives from justice supporters of keeping cuba on the terrorist list point to the more than 70 fugitives from us justice residing in cuba these include such fugitives as joanne chesimard who was convicted for the killing of new jersey state trooper in 1973 charles hill and michael finney wanted for the killing of state trooper in new mexico in 1971 victor manuel gerena member of militant puerto rican separatist group wanted for carrying out the robbery of wells fargo armored car in connecticut in 1983 and guillermo morales another member of puerto rican militant group who was convicted of illegal possession of firearms in new york in the 1970s those who oppose this rationale for keeping cuba on the terrorist list argue that this has nothing to do with terrorism and that many countries eg mexico and salvador harbor fugitives from us justice but are not on the terrorist list36 moreover they argue that cuba has expressed interest in considering negotiation of the mutual extradition of fugitives for example cuba would like to see the extradition of orlando bosch miami resident and luis posada carriles both are accused of responsibility for the bombing cuban airliner in 1976 while posada as described above was imprisoned in panama for several years on weapons charges in plot to assassinate fidel castro opponents of this rationale also point out that 34 cuban ministry of foreign relations declaration by the ministry of foreign affairs cuba has nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of may 2 2003 35 questions remain on the extradition fight that shook the peace process the irish examiner august 8 2006 36 mexico for example reportedly harbors hundreds of fugitives from justice see guy taylor home safe haven for mexican suspects death penalty halts extradition for us crimes washington times january 9 2004 p a1 crs11 cuba has vowed not to allow new us fugitives from justice to live in cuba several years ago it deported two fugitives from justice to the united states us drug fugitive jesse james bell was deported in january 2002 and william joseph harris wanted on child abuse charges was deported in december 2001 comparison with other countries on the terrorism list the level of terrorist activity by countries on the state sponsors of terrorism list varies considerably as noted above in addition to cuba there are four other countries on the list iran syria sudan and north korea iran is considered the most active state sponsor of terrorism while countries believed to be less active supporters of terrorism include sudan and cuba given this wide range of activity some suggest that there should be tiered approach with sanctions calibrated to the degree of support for terrorism while others maintain that any level of support for terrorism is unacceptable and must be met with strong sanctions some suggest that should there be more flexibility in the ability to add and remove countries from the terrorism list in order to bring about behavioral changes in the states that are involved in terrorist activities others believe that there is already sufficient flexibility in the legislative conditions set forth in the export administration act for the administration to add and remove countries according to their behavior for other versions of this document see
