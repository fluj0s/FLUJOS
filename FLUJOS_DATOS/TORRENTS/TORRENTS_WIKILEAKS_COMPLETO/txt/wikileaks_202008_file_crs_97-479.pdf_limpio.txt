approximately 17000 age discrimination complaints were filed annually between 1991 and 19958 the issue of age discrimination has concerned congress for several years prior to the adea section 715 of the civil rights act of 1964 required the secretary of labor to study the issue of age discrimination in employment9 the resulting report surmised that clearcut federal policy was needed to address age discrimination president lyndon b johnson suggested the age discrimination in employment act in his older americans message delivered in early 1967 after passage the adea went through series of amendments to strengthen and expand its coverage of older employees originally the adea only covered employees between the ages of 40 and 65 eventually the upper age limit was extended to age 70 and then eliminated altogether in 1978 as part of the reorganization plan 1 enforcement authority of the adea was transferred from the department of labor to the equal employment opportunity commission

severance benefits generally offered to employe of the institution if certain requirements are met supplemental benefits may be reduced or eliminated on the basis of age without violating the adea

alleged violation occurred generally grievant must file complaint with the eeoc within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act however if the state where the alleged unlawful practice took place has an age discrimination law and corresponding enforcement agency then the time by which grievant must file with the eeoc is extended to within 300 days of the alleged unlawful practice37 charge must be filed with the eeoc within 30 days upon notification that the state agency has terminated its proceedings38 the sixtyday deferral period for filing civil suit also applies to charges filed with state agency unless the state agency proceedings are earlier terminated due to the 60 day deferral period complainant must file with the corresponding state or local agency within 240 days of the alleged discriminatory act to ensure that the charge will be filed with the eeoc within the 300day limit39 in nondeferral states or states without corresponding enforcement agency the grievant must file claim with the eeoc within 180 days of the alleged unlawful practice civil action may be filed until 60 days after filing charge with the eeoc40 however if the eeoc terminates or dismisses the charge even within the 60 day period then the grievant may file civil action within 90 days of receipt of termination when bringing civil case there are two types of discrimination claims disparate treatment and disparate impact disparate treatment occurs when an employer intentionally discriminates against an employee or enacts policy with the intent to treat or affect the employee differently from others because of the employeeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97479crs7 41 in proving disparate treatment based on age the plaintiff can show that age was motivating factor in the employers decision the plaintiff does not have to show that it was the only factor kralman v illinois dept of veterans affairs 23 f3d 150 7th cir 1994 cert denied 115 s ct 359 130 led2d 313 1994 42 507 us 604 1993 the majority states the disparate treatment theory is of course available under the adea as the language of that statute makes clear by contrast we have never decided whether disparate impact theory of liability is available under the adea id at 609610 the facts of biggins reflect growing concern among older workers who are close to the vesting of their pensions the plaintiff walter biggins was fired weeks before he was scheduled to vest under his employers pension plan the plan allowed vesting after ten years of service although the court held that firing an employee to prevent vesting is actionable under the employees retirement income security act erisa 29 usca 1001 et seq west 1985 supp 1996 such firing would not constitute discriminatory treatment on the basis of age id at 612 however the court did not dismiss the possibility of pension status being used as proxy for age the court was not faced with situation where vesting was based on age rather than length of service if vesting were based on an employees age then firing an employee to avoid vesting could possibly result in liability under both the adea and erisa id at 613 43 the courts of appeals for the eighth circuit and the dc circuit have allowed disparate impact claims smith v city of des moines iowa 99 f3d 1466 8th cir 1996 koger v reno 98 f3d 631 dc cir 1996 however the third seventh and tenth circuit

b1 44 411 us 792 1973 45 450 us 248 1981age41 disparate impact occurs when the employers acts or policies are facially neutral but have an adverse impact on class of employees and are not justified as job related and consistent with business necessity according to the court in hazen paper co v biggins the adea explicitly allows disparate treatment claims but the court has yet to decide whether an employee may recover under the disparate impact theory42 this has resulted in confusion for litigants and courts alike as some federal courts of appeals allow disparate impact claims while others do not43 since the adea was modeled after title vii courts look to title vii decisions for guidance on adjudicating adea claims however the unique protections of the adea have not always fit neatly into the title vii framework in cases where the plaintiff is alleging disparate treatment and there is direct evidence of discrimination courts refer to the title vii burden of proof framework established by the us supreme court in mcdonnell douglas v green 44 and texas dept of community affairs v burdine 45 the burden of proof requires the plaintiff to establish prima facie case once the plaintiff by preponderance of the evidence proves prima facie case then the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97479crs8 46 mcdonnell douglas 411 us at 802 47 st marys honor center v hicks 509 us 502 1993 in hicks the supreme court revisited the burden of proof scheme established by mcdonnell douglas and burdine justice scalia writing for the majority held that it is not enough for the plaintiff to show that the employers proffered reason was false the plaintiff must show that the employers proffered reason is both false and that the employers actions were motivated by discrimination 48 burdine 450 us at 255256 49 mcdonnell douglas 411 us at 802 50 469 us 400 1985 51 116 s ct 1307 1996 52 the court agreed with the court of appeals stating twa contends that the respondents failed to make out prima facie case of age discrimination under mcdonnell douglas v green 411 us 792 1973 because at the time they were retired flight engineer vacancies existed this argument fails for the mcdonnell douglas test is inapplicable where the plaintiff presents direct evidence of discrimination the shifting burdens of proof set forth in mcdonnell douglas are designed to assure that the plaintiff has his day in court despite the unavailability of direct evidence id at 121 quoting loeb v textron inc 600 f2d 1003 1st cir 1979 some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the employees rejection46 if the employer rebuts the employees prima facie case the employee may still prevail if he can show that the employers defense is merely pretext and that the employers behavior was actually motivated by discrimination47 while the burden of production shifts to the employer to rebut the employee s prima facie case the burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff at all times48 the confusion occurs when defining what constitutes prima facie case under the adea according to mcdonnell douglas title vii case prima facie case is made when the plaintiff shows 1 that he belongs to racial minority 2 that he applied and was qualified for job for which the employer was seeking applicants 3 that despite his qualifications he was rejected and 4 that after his rejection the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainants qualifications49 the supreme court has attempted to clarify the prima facie case applicable to the adea in its decisions in trans world airlines inc v thurston 50 and oconnor v consolidated coin caterers corp51 in thurston the court held that the prima facie elements of mcdonnell douglas are inapplicable where the plaintiff produces evidence of direct discrimination52 in thurston the court upon finding direct evidence of discrimination then considered the employers defenses while not explicitly stated in thurston it appears that even after evidence of direct discrimination the burden of production shifts to the employer to articulate legitimate reason for the discriminatory behavior if the employer succeeds the employee still has an opportunity to prove the employers proffered reason is merely pretext for discrimination again the burden of persuasion remains at all times on the plaintiff httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97479crs9 53 oconnor v consolidated coin caterers corp 116 s ct 1307 1996 54 116 s ct 1307 1309 1996 55 justice scalia writing for the majority states as the very name prima facie case suggests there must be at least logical connection between each element of the prima facie case and the illegal discrimination for which it establishes legally mandatory rebuttable presumption the element of replacement by someone under 40 fails this requireme nt the discrimination prohibited by the adea is discrimination because of an individual s age consolidated coin 116 s ct at 1310 quoting texas dept of community affairs v burdine 450 us 248 254 n7 1981 56 29 usca 623f1 according to the supreme court in western air lines inc v criswell 472 us 400 1984 the bfoq must be more than convenient or reasonable but must be reasonably necessary to the particular business id at 414 the employer could prove bfoq defense of an agebased qualification due to safety concerns based on either of two ways first the employer could show that it had factual basis for believing that persons over certain age would be unable to perform the job safely in the alternative the employer could show that age was legitimate proxy for the safetyrelated job qualifications by proving that it is impossible or highly impractical to deal with the older employees on an individualized basis idin consolidated coin the court held that prima facie case is not made out by simply showing that an employee was replaced by someone outside of the class the plaintiff must show that he was replaced because of his age53 the court evaluated whether the prima facie elements evinced by the fourth circuit court of appeals were required to establish prima facie case the fourth circuit held that prima facie case is established under the adea when the plaintiff shows that 1 he was in the age group protected by the adea 2 he was discharged or demoted 3 at the time of his discharge or demotion he was performing his job at level that met his employers legitimate expectations and 4 following his discharge or demotion he was replaced by someone of comparable qualifications outside of the protected class54 the court held that the fourth prong replacement by someone outside of the class is not the only manner in which plaintiff can show prima facie case under the adea55 violation can be shown even if the person was replaced by someone within the protected class for example replacing 76 year old with 45 year old may be violation of the adea if the person was replaced because of her age employer defenses to the adea the adea provides several defenses for employers the available defenses strike balance between the ability of employers to conduct their business and the interest of the government in eliminating age discrimination in employment the adea is not violated if the action taken against an employee is due to bona fide occupational

provision for federal firefighters was not bfoq which baltimore could rely on to require mandatory retirement of city firefighters under the age of 7059 the court in western air lines inc v criswell upheld jury instruction given by the fifth circuit court of appeals regarding the bfoq defense60 the court recognized that the adea requires that age qualifications be something more than convenient or reasonable they must be reasonably necessary to the particular business and this is only so when the employer is compelled to rely on age as proxy for the safetyrelated job qualifications validated in the first inquiry this showing could be made in two ways the employer could establish that it had reasonable cause to believe that is factual basis for believing that all or substantially all persons over the age qualifications would be unable to perform safely and efficiently the duties of the job involved alternatively the employer could establish that age was legitimate proxy for the safetyrelated job qualifications by proving that it is impossible or highly impractical to deal with the older employees on an individualized basis one method by which the employer can carry this burden is to establish that some members of the discriminatedagainst class possess trait precluding safe and efficient job performance that cannot be ascertained by means other than knowledge of the applicants membership in the class61 the older americans act amendments provided an exemption to employers where compliance with the adea with regard to an employee based in foreign country would

inapplicable to the eeoc and an employer may not interfere with an employees participation with the eeoc in investigating or pursuing claim of alleged unlawful practices in oubre v entergy operations inc the supreme court considered whether an employee had to return money she received as part of severance agreement before bringing suit under the adea73 the employee received severance pay in return for waiving any claims against the employer the court held that the plaintiff did not have to return the money before bringing suit because the employer failed to comply with three of the requirements of the waiver provisions under the adea74 related issue is the effect of arbitration clauses on adea claims the court held in gilmer v interstatejohnson lane corp 75 that the adea does not preclude enforcement of compulsory arbitration clause the plaintiff in gilmer signed registration application with the new york stock exchange nyse as required by his employer the application provided that the plaintiff would agree to arbitrate any claim or dispute that arose between him and interstate gilmer filed an adea claim with the eeoc upon being fired at age 62 interstate filed motion to compel

arbitration procedure continuedthe lower court held that nothing in the language of the adea or its legislative history prohibited arbitration of adea claims78 the us supreme court agreed since the faa represents federal policy favoring arbitration it is the burden of the person agreeing to arbitrate to show that congress evinced an intent to prevent arbitration79 initially the court did not find that the goal of the adea was hindered by allowing arbitration of adea claims80 in prior decision the court held by agreeing to arbitrate statutory claim party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral rather than judicial forum81 nor would compulsory arbitration interfere with the duty of the eeoc to enforce the provision82 the acts emphasis on informal methods of dispute resolution such as conciliation and persuasion weighed in favor of arbitration instead of against it83 in addition the court found the arbitration procedures of the nyse were more than adequate to safeguard the employees rights under the adea nyses arbitration procedures addressed concerns of bias84 discovery procedures85 the type of relief granted86 and unequal bargaining power87 justice white writing for the majority found that gilmers reliance on the courts decision in alexander v gardnerdenver co88 was misplaced gardnerdenver held that plaintiffs civil action under title vii is not precluded by an arbitration decision handed down pursuant to collectivebargaining agreeme nt89 the cases were found to be distinguishable since gardnerdenver did not deal with enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statutory claims occurred under collective bargaining agreeme nt to resolve contractual rights and was not covered by the federal arbitration act90 ultimately the court found that gilmer failed to meet his burden of showing an intent by congress to preclude arbitration of adea claims the supreme court revisited the issue of mandatory arbitration of statutory antidiscrimination claims in wright v universal maritime service corp 91 in wright httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97479crs14 91 continued for an alleged violation of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 ada id at 39293 wright was longshoreman who was subject to cba between his union and the association that represented several stevedore companies the cba contained general arbitration clause when wright was refused work after returning from an injury he filed suit alleging violation of the ada the employers filed for dismissal of wrights suit for failure to use the arbitration procedures contained in the collective bargaining agreement the fourth circuit court of appeals affirmed dismissal of wrights claim on the basis that the general arbitration provision in the cba was sufficiently broad to encompass statutory claim arising under the ada id at 394 ultimately the court did not address the issue of whether wright had to seek arbitration on the basis that the cause of action wright asserts arises not out of contract but out of the ada and is distinct from any right conferred by the collectivebargaining agreement id at 396 however the court does state that any cba requirement to arbitrate statutory claim must be particularly clear id the court quotes from an earlier case we will not infer from general contractual provision that the parties intended to waive statutorily protected right unless the undertaking is explicitly stated more succinctly the waiver must be clear and unmistakable id 92 id at 396 93 id at

employment discrimination we do not reach the question whether such waiver would be enforceable wright 119 s ct at 397emphasis added 95 section 626b states the provisions of this chapter shall be

in court however the court did not address whether unions waiver of the rights of represented employees93 even if clear and unmistakable would be valid if an employee sought judicial forum in lieu of the unions arbitration procedures94 remedies the remedies available under the adea are patterned on the fair labor standards act95 the prevailing plaintiff may be entitled to employment reinstatement

decision public employees retirement system of ohio v betts 115 which held that bona fide employee benefit plans which were not subterfuge for discrimination were permissible under the adea one of the concerns surrounding the enactment of the adea was the cost to employers of providing employee benefits to older workers the equal benefit or equal cost principle allowed employers to proportionally reduce the amount of money spent on an older workers employee benefits so that the amount spent on the older worker is equivalent to the amount spent on younger worker this principle did not allow employers to reduce or deny benefits because of age but did allow employers to deduct for any increased costs that would make insuring or providing benefits to older workers more expensive it was believed that to not account for increased costs would prevent employers from hiring older workers this is permissible under the adea even if such reduction reduces the amount of benefits an older worker receives the older workers protection act restored the use of the equal benefit or equal cost principle after it had been invalidated by the supreme court in betts in addition the 1990
