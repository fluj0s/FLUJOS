firms summary globalization and technology have been viewed as increasingly prominent influences upon the us economy this perception has led to renewed attentiontowards the pragmatic aspects and policies of multinational patent acquisition andenforcement patent protection has long been understood to be fundamentalmechanism for encouraging the pursuit of technological knowledge particularly for entrepreneurs and small innovative firms recent trends reveal that us industry has come to rely more heavily upon the world s patent systems as compared to other intellectual property alternatives such as trade secrecy although patent protection in single juri sdiction is often ineffective to protect the interests of inventors true global patent system exists if inventors desireintellectual property protection in particular country they must specifically procure patent within that jurisdiction patent rights do not arise automatically insteadinventors must submit applications to national or regional patent office patentexaminers then assess whether the application fully discloses and distinctly claimsa new and nonobvious invention if allowed to issue granted patent provides itsproprietor with the right to exclude others from making using or selling the patented invention patent rights are not selfe nforcing however and those patent owners who wish to compel others to observe th eir intellectual property rights usually must commence civil litigation the patent systems of the united states and its trading partners are linked through handful of international agreements that together comprise theinternational patent regime the oldest of these treaties the paris convention established an international priority system that facilitates the filing of patentapplications in many jurisdictions the patent cooperation treaty built upon theparis convention by establishing further procedural framework for expeditingmultinational patent acquisition

technological advances play in driving the global economy1 as result interest in both innovative enterprises and the international patent system has expandedentrepreneurs and small innovative firms ar generally perceived as major source of innovative products and processes 2 by allowing enterprises to capture the benefits of their research and development efforts the patent system too isunderstood to be fundamental mechanism for encouraging the pursuit oftechnological knowledge 3 globalization trends have brought with them growing international trade increasing flows of information and more distributed manufacturing capabilities4 as result patent protection in singl country is often insufficient to protect inventors to be effective in an increasingly global economy even individual inventors and small firms must often secure patent rights in multiple jurisdictions5 obtaining and enforcing patent rights in many countries can prove demanding endeavor however true global patent system exists inventors who seekintellectual property protection must file individual applications in each country or region where patent rights ar sought this task can be one of significant expense practical difficulty and legal complexity even where patent rights have beensuccessfully procured they are not selfe nforcing innovative enterprises must often invoke civil litigati on in order to compel competitors to respect their patent rightshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31132crs2 6ibid 7tassey gregory the economics of rd policy connecticut quorum books 1997 54 see also congressional research

innovative firm s play role in the technological advancement and economic growth of the united states 8 several studies commissioned by us federal agencies have concluded that such enterprises are asignificant source of innovative products and services for example the national academy of engineering concluded that small hightech companies play criticaland diverse role in creating new products and services in developing new industries and in driving technological change and growth in the us economy 9 t h i s assessment was founded on the ability of small firms to develop markets

firms11 national science foundation report found that entrepre neurs and small firms are six times as effective as larger firms in utilizing research and development expenditures to generate new products12 high technology industries contain an especially large number of small companies according to 1996 sba st udy 94 of high technology companies had under 500 employees and 73 had less than 20 workers these small firmsaccounted for 18 of the total receipt s generated by high technology industries almost forty percent of workers in pr ivate sector high technology businesses were employed by

high tech companies have frequen tly turned to the regime of patents14 the patent system authorized by article i s ection 8 clause 8 of the us constitution serves to encourage the advancement of the useful arts principal effect of patent law in market economy is to provide economic incentives to commit resources towards technological innovation this effect is achieved by granting inventorsexclusive rights to practice the patented invention 15 industrial response to the plant variety protection act of 1970 pvpa is often cited in support of the rationale that patent rights can stimulate invention in field in which proprietary rights were previous ly unavailable the pvpa allowed plant breeders the ability to obtain patentlike protection on novel varieties of plants grownfrom

new varieties were created17 the regime of patents purportedly serves other goals as well the patent system encourages the disclosure of produc ts and processes for each issued patent must include description sufficient to able skilled artisans to practice the patented invention18 when the patent expires ordinarily 20 years from the date the application is filed19 others are given the ability to practice the patented invention although estimates vary one report observed that 8590 of the informationavailable in published patent instruments would not otherwise be publiclyavailable 20 issued patents may also encourage others to invent around the patentees proprietary interest patentee may point the way to new products marketseconomies of production and even entire industries others can build upon thepatentees disclosure to produce their own t echnologies that fall outside the exclusive rights associated with the patent 21 the patent system has also been identif ied as facilitator of markets absent patent rights an inventor may have scant tangible assets to sell or license inaddition an inventor might otherwise be unable to police the conduct of acontracting party any technology or know how that has been disclosed to prospective licensee might be appropriate d without compensation to the inventor the availability of patent protection decr eases the ability of c ontracting parties to engage in opportunistic behavior by lowering such transaction costs the patentsystem may make technologybased transactions more feasible 22 through these mechanisms the patent system can act in more socially desirable ways than its chief legal lternative trade secret prot ection trade secrecy guards against the improper appropriation of valuable commercially useful and secretinformation in contrast to patenting trade secret protection does not result in thedisclosure of publicly valuable information that is because an enterprise must take reasonable measures to keep secret the in formation for which trade secret protection is sought taking the steps necessary to maintain secrecy such as implementing physical security measures also imposes costs that may ultimately be unproductivefor society 23httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31132crs5 24levin et supra note 14 25wyatt sally bertin gilles multinationals and industrial property 139 harvester 1988 26hawkins j

the strength of the learning curve weresuperior to patents in capturing the value of investments 24 in contrast members of the drug and chemical industries attached higher value to patents differences in the perception of the patent system have been attributed to the extent to whichpatents introduced significant duplication costs and times for competitors of thepatentee studies have indicated that entreprene urs and small innovative firms rely more heavily upon the patent system than larger enterprises larger companies often possess number of alternative means for achieving proprietary or propertylikeinterest in particular technology for example trade secrecy ready access tomarkets trademark rights speed of development and consumer goodwill may to some degree act as substitutes to the patent system as sally wyatt and gilles bertinreported in their survey of alternatives to patenting representative of one european corporation opined that multinational corporations could easily cease to use patentsand use other available methods to achieve the same aims 25 however individual inventors and small firms often do not have these mechanisms at their disposal as result the patent system may enjoy hei ghtened importance with respect to these enterprises26 perhaps the best evidence available as to the perceived value of patents is that in the united states the number of filed patent applications and issued patentscontinues to climb 27 in 1995 inventors filed 221304 patent applications at the united states patent and trademark offi ce uspto in 2000 that number had increased to

too frequently attracts speculators who prefer to acquire and enforce patents rather than engage in socially productive activity32 still other commentators suggest that the patent system often converts pioneering inventors into technological suppressorswho use their patents to block subsequent improvements and thereby impedetechnical progress 33 when analyzing these contending views it is important to note the lack of rigorous analytical methods available for an alyzing the effect of the patent law upon the us economy as whole the relationship between innovation and patent rightsremains poorly understood as result current economic and policy tools do notallow us to calibrate the patent system precisely in order to produce an optimal levelof investment in innovation

overseas as practical matter multinational corporations often obtain set of corresponding national patents for each of their significant inventions this report next considers the process of prosecuting and litigating patents overseas focusing on europe and japan but with reference to other patent systemsas well these two systems merit special attention because along with the uspto the european and japanese patent offices receive over 80 of the patent applications filed in the world 59 in terms of the number of patent applications filed us industry is the largest single user of both the uspt and the european patent office and the second largest user of the japanese patent office60 foreign patent acquisition recent years have witnessed substan tial legal harmonization process within the field of patent law as result th similarities have increased between the us patent system and parallel regimes overseas however several notable differencesbetween us patent law and many forei gn patent systems are worthy of mention here deferred examination one distinct aspect of patent practice in some other nations is that examination is deferred following submission of an application in contrast to the uspto where every filed pplication is automatically placed into queue for substantive examination in many other patentissuing states the merefiling of an application does not mean that the patent office will further consider the application inventors who wish their app lications to mature into an issued patent must submit additional requests in order for the patent office to consider theapplication such requests must occur w ithin specified time and be accompanied by the appropriate fee in germany an inventor may defer examination for up toseven years 61 in japan the maximum deferral period was recently reduced from seven to three years62 if request for examination is made in timely fashion the application is deemed abandoned if re quest for examination is seasonably made the novelty and nonobviousness of the application are judged as of the applicationsfiling date supporters of deferred examination regimes observe that they allow applicants the option of deciding to postpone the deci sion to obtain patent protection or not deferred examination regimes may also reduce patent office workloads furthersince all pending applications are published approximately 18 months following theirfiling dates the public has notice of the prospect of granted patent whetherexamination is deferred or not 63 detractors note that

socalled opposition proceedings an opposition is patent revocation proceeding that isusually administered by authorities from the national patent office oppositions often involve wide range of potential invalidity arguments and are conductedthrough adversarial hearings that resemble courtroom litigation although the us patent system does not include oppositions the us patent system has incorporated socalled reexamination proceeding since 1981 somecommentators have viewed the reexamination as more limited form of anopposition 65 under the reexamination statute any individual including the patentee competitor and even the uspto director may cite prior art patent or printedpublication to the uspto if the uspto determines that this reference raises asubstantial new question of patentability with respect to an issued patent then it will essentially reopen prosecution of the issued patent traditional reexamination proceedings ar conducted in an accelerated fashion on an ex parte basis following the american inventors protection act of 1999 an inter partes reexamination allows the requestor to participate more fully in the proceedings through the submission of argument and the filing of appeals 66 either sort of reexamination may result in cer tificate confirming the patentability of the original claims an amended patent with narrower claims or declaration of patentinvalidity 67 congress intended reexamination proceedings to serve as an inexpensive alternative to judicial determinations of patent validity68 reexamination also allows further access to the legal and technical expertise of the uspto after patent hasissued 69 however some commentators believe that reexamination proceedings have been employed only sparingly and question their effectiveness70 legislation introduced in the 107th congress would introduce the more fullfeatured opposition proceedings into us patent law71 priority principle sometimes several persons

individual to complete the invention in the field is irre levant this priority system follows the firsttofile principle76 the international patent community s witnessed an extensive and sometimes emotional debate on the relative merits of the firsttoinvent and firsttofileprinciple 77 supporters of the firsttoinvent princi ple in part assert that the firstto file system creates inequities due to race to the patent office encouragespremature and sketchy disclosures in hastilyfiled patent applications anddisadvantages small entities with less resources to prepare and file patentapplications quickly supporters of the firsttofile principle in part assert that itprovides definite readily determined nd fixed date of priority of invention believe that it would decrease the complexity length and expense associated withcurrent uspto interference proceedings and observe that most of us industry isalready acting on this basis in order to void forfeiture of patent rights abroad although many us trading partners have proposed that the united states shift tothe firsttofile priority principle some observers believe that there is currently us consensus on the advisability of this approach 78 grace period the us patent system essentially provides inventors with oneyear period to decide whether patent protection is desirable and if so toprepare an application specified activities such as publications or sales act to bar the applicant from obtaining patent before the socalled critical date the day one year before the application was filed 79 if for example an entrepreneur first

made by third party even one day before the filing date defeats the novelty of that invention much discussion has occurred over the wisdom of grace period supporters of grace period say that it

what the scope of any allowed claims might be prior to disclosing an invention thus if the applicant was wise enough to maintain the invention that wassubject to patent application as trade secret then he could choose betweenobtaining the allowed patent claims and trade secret status 98 however this secrecy regime has been perceived as imposing costs as well others might well engage in repetitive res earch efforts during the pendency of patent applications unaware that an earlier inve ntor had already staked claim to that technology this arrangement also allows inventors to commence

because civil litigation varies considerably fromnation to nation an exacting analysis of multinational patent enforcement would require lengthy discussion beyond the scope of this report this report insteadpoints to several salient distinctions betw een us and foreign patent litigation that are persistently discussed in the professional literature limited discovery us civil procedure allows for discovery pretrial proceeding through which litigants may obtain information necessary to prove their cases depositions interrogatories requests for production of documents andrequests for admission are among the tools litigants may use to aid in investigatingfacts and defining issues for trial in patent cases patentees use discovery todetermine such matters as the extent of infringing activities accused infringers use discovery to obtain further information as to the validity and enforceability of the patent other nation provides for the extensive pretrial discovery available in the united states 103 under some civil law system s the litigants do little more than exchange papers filed with the court in such regi mes the litigating parties must make use of alternative methods of obtaining information including extrajudicialinvestigational efforts or using the results of discovery procedures availableelsewhere 104 proponents of discovery claim that the av ailability of discovery helps eliminate from trials the element of unfair surprise assures that cases would be decided ontheir merits and mitigates unfairness resu lting from disparities of wealth and power by prescribing means by which less powerful litigants could obtain the informationnecessary to prove their claims detractors assert that discovery has been subjected to abuses that prolong litigation and

especially for process patents where access to the accused infringers production facilities anddocuments may be critical 106 jury system the united states is also the only nation that uses jury system in patent trials although many commentator s have criticized the use of lay jurors to decide patent infringement issues107 others have found many merits to the use of juries and observe the place of jury system within the bill of rights108 in other nations one or more judges or administrative officials decide patent validity andinfringement matters some jurisdictions such as germany have establishedpositions for specialized trial judges who decide patent cases 109 patent validity as an infringement defense in the united states and many common law countries courts that decide infringement matters also mayreview the validity of the asserted patent 110 accused infringers often argue that the asserted patent was improvidently granted in some civil law nations however the courts that decide patent infringement matters may not rule on whether patent isvalid or invalid challenges to patent va lidity are instead exclusively considered by the national patent office or by specialized courts some authorities believe thesesplit proceedings can lead to delay and higher costs 111 court costs it is common practice for cour ts to assess some fee against an individual who commences litigation patentrelated or otherwise in the unitedstates the fee for filing civil case is ordinarily set at fixed amount which iscurrently 150 112 in some foreign countries the filing fee is tied to the amount in controversy for example the fee in japa n is set to roughly 05 of the damages claimed113 because patent cases sometimes involve high stakes some observers believe that these scaled filing fees present barrier to enforcing patent rights attorney fees in the united states each litigating party pays its own attorney fees in many other jurisdictions such as england the losing

othe r sides fees may discourage meritorious litigation115 scope of patent protection subtle but significant distinction between patent systems is the scope of protection court will accord to an issued patentduring enforcement proceedings the scope of proprietary rights is based upon but not limited to the precise wording of the pa tent instrument in the united states court may find infringement even if the accused infringement does not precisely fall within the claims of the asserted patent so long as insubstantial differences existbetween the patented invention and the accu sed infringement us courts refer to this concept as the doctrine of equivalents 116 some observers believe that the scope of protection accorded patent rights differs among the national courts the cour ts of germany and the netherlands have for example been considered to accord patents more robust scope of protection than do the us courts at the other extr eme are the courts of japan according to 1993 report from the us general acc ounting office japan has virtually doctrine of equivalents as that term is used in the united states117 s m commentators believe that more recent deci sions suggest that japanese courts are construing patents more broadly than they once did118 in addition some observers believe that since the late 1990s the us court of appeals for the federal circuit has exhibited trend towards narrowing of patent rights119 the international patent system the patent regimes of the united states and its trading partners are linked through handful of international agreements that together comprise theinternational patent system these international agreements do not create trueglobal patent system in that they do not provide for single patent application and grant procedure that can lead to rights effective worldwide however they do provide inventors with mechanisms for xpediting the acquisition of patent rights in many countries this report discusses the most

signatory state second principle set forth by the paris convention is the independence of different national patents prior to the advent of the paris convention many national laws applied principle of patent depende nce against foreign inventors under this principle domestic patents would expire at the same time any foreign patentcovering the same invention lapsed regardless of the term the patentee wasordinarily due these provisions sometimes worked hardship against inventorswho had obtained patent protection in many countries only to discover thatmarketing the invention was feasible only in some subset of them such an inventorwould prefer to let some patent rights laps rather than incur expensive maintenance fees in world where patent rights depended on one another however allowingone patent to lapse would amount to global forfeiture of patent rights the independence principle established by the paris convention put an end to this situation one significant consequen ce of the independence of national patents is that they must be enforced individually even different national patent instruments with identically drafted descriptions drawings and claims do not stand or falltogether competitor who succeeds in invalidating one national patent may facethe prospect of repeating the effort within another set of national borders similarlythe successful enforcement of patent in one forum may simply signal the start of patent litigation elsewhere 121 the international priority system allows an inventor to file patent application in one paris convention signatory

an advanced treat at the time of its formation in the late nineteenth century however many observers believed that its shortcomingsbecame more pronounced with the passage of time other than the minimal standard of national treatment the paris convention does not provide substantive patent law standards for its signatories to adopt within their domestic patent systems 123 the paris convention further lacks an effec tive enforcement mechanism although one nation could commence an action against nother for paris convention violations in the international court of justice that tribunals lack of enforcement powers made this possibility more theoretical than practi cal in the 120year history of the paris convention such suit has ever been brought124 finally the paris convention requires

requires that member states must provide patentowners with the opportunity for judicial re view of any decision to revoke or forfeit patent 138 part iii of the trips agreement also addresses compulsory licenses compulsory license allows competitor of the patent owner to use the patentedinvention without the patent owners permission 139 although compulsory licenses have played only minor role in the united states patent system140 many foreign patent statutes include such provisions141 these statutes typically require an interested party formally to request th compulsory license from the foreign government competent authorities then deci whether to grant the license as well as the terms of any granted license grounds for granting compulsory licenseinclude the abusive exercise of patent rights lack of domestic manufacture of thepatented product commercialization of the patented good that does not satisfy theneeds of the local market and national emergencies 142 while some accounts suggest that formal compulsory licensing proceedi ngs are commenced only infrequently the mere existence of compulsory licen sing statute may do much to encourage bargaining between foreign

issue must nonetheless accept patent applications these patent applications willessentially be held at the national patent office until it comes time for the patentapplication to be considered pipeline protection is valuable because it allows inventors to establish date of priority of invention although many years might pass between the applicationsfiling date and the date on which it would

technical advances the trips agreement also mandates that wto member states award an exclusive marketing right emr to inventors in specified circumstances theholder of an emr concerning particular

the difficulties associated with obtaining representation before foreign patent office engaging qualified attorneyatlaw to handle foreign patent litigation may also be problematic in contrast to the united states in many foreigncountries few individuals admitted to the patent bar also hold qualifications asgeneral attorneysatlaw some of these problems result from the differing nature of the educational and legal systems in the united states as compared to othercountries in the united states individuals most often obtain their legal education as graduate degree the majority of individuals who have passed the us patent bar examination possess undergraduate degrees in technical disciplines accompanied by law degree as result most indivi duals who have passed the us patent bar have also passed state bar examination and are qualified as general attorneysat law in contrast in many other countries the law degree is obtained at the baccalaureate level having obtained one b achelors

these c oncerns the japanese diet passed new patent attorney law that became effec tive january 6 2001 the diet intended this law to increase the availability of legal services related to intellectual

leading more young people into the field the trainingof patent professionals remains timeconsuming process however and it ispossible that growing demand for patentrelated services may outstrip the

term varied considerably in diffe rent countries once implementation of the trips agreement is complete all wto memb er states will have patent term of at least 20 years from the date the patent application was filed however significant differences remain between the patent laws of the united states and those of other countries187 the effect of three of these differences relating to the priority mechanism grace period and patentable subject matter are discussed below priority principle recall that every patent sy stem except for that of the united states employs firsttofile priority principle under this regime the first patent applicant is presumptively entitled to the patent whether or not he was actually the first individual to complete the invention in the field the us patent systeminstead employs firsttoinvent priority principle which instead awards the patent to the first applicant that actually completed the invention 188 differences between these priority system s could lead to the award of different national patents to different parties on the same invention for example suppose that inventor synthesizes an inventive chemical compound on august 1 2001 and files patent application at the uspto on october 1 2001 claiming that compound invoking the paris convention inventor th files patent application at the german patent office on september 1 2002 suppose further that inventor binvents the same compound on august 15 2001 file s patent application at the uspto on september 15 2001 and then files patent application at the german patent office on september 1 2002 under th is simple example inventor would be awarded the us patent under the first toinvent principle inventor b would obtain the german patent under the firsttofile principle based upon his earlier usfiling date the impact of this legal situation upon such factors as the rate of innovation industry concentration and commercialization of new technologies is difficult topredict in the above example it may be that because neither inventor has exclusive rights in both countries neither would po ssess sufficient incentives to commercialize or further develop the patented technology on the other hand perhaps patent rights in single country would suffice to stimulate both inventors to sell and improveupon the inventive compound and leading to more diverse and competitiveindustry at the time the patents expire grace period although the us patent law allows inventors oneyear grace period to file patent applications other patent systems have more limited graceperiods as result activities such as pub lic uses sales and publications that would defeat patentability in europe japan nd other jurisdictions do not prejudice us patent applicants 189 this distinction may effectively allow more patents to be granted in the united states than in other countries in addition domestic inventorswho take advantage of the full grace period under the us patent law may beprejudiced when they attempt to obtain patent protection overseas patentable subject matter recall that the range of subject matter for which patent protection is available is much broader

story described patents along with copyri ght as belonging to what may be called the metaphysics of the law where the distinc tions are or at least may be very subtle and refined and sometimes almost evanescent192 patent cases sometimes raise advanced technological issues as well as explained by former uspto director q todd dickinson the complexity of some of these applications is almostunimaginable for example we received dna sequence listing as part of patent application that had it been submitted on paper would have totaled more than400000 pages 193 in an environment containing such complex issues it is unsurprising that different national authorities have often di ffered in their judgments of the identical patent issues it is quite possible that th same patent application could be allowed by one patent office examiner rejected on particular ground by second examiner and rejected on different ground by thir d examiner during patent enforcement courts may also take different view of the validity of the patent and the scope ofpatent rights the result may be climate in which entrepreneurship could suffer patchwork of patent rights could make it difficult
