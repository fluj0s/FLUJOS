analyst in income security domestic social policy division social security reform possible effects on the elderly poor and mitigation options summary social security has significantly reduced elderly poverty the elderly poverty rate has fallen from 35 in 1959 to an alltime low of 9 in 2006 in large part because of social security if social security benefits did not exist an estimated 44 of the elderly would be poor today assuming changes in behavior the supplemental security income ssi program also provides benefits to the poorest elderly many of whom do not qualify for social security benefits however despite these programs about 34 million elderly individuals remained in poverty in 2006 the social security system faces longterm financing problem the social security trustees project cashflow deficits beginning in 2017 and trust fund insolvency in 2041 many recent proposals to improve system solvency would reduce social security benefits in the future benefit reductions could affect the low income elderly many of whom rely on social security benefits for almost all of their income such potential benefit reductions could lead to higher rates of poverty among the elderly compared to those projected under the current benefit formula because the lowincome elderly are especially vulnerable to benefit reductions many recent social security reform proposals have included minimum benefits or other provisions that would mitigate the effect of benefit cuts on the elderly poor this report analyzes the projected effects of four possible approaches to mitigating the effects of social security benefit reductions on elderly poverty in 2042 the first full year of projected trust fund insolvency the options are compared to payable baseline which assumes currentlaw benefits would need to be cut across the board to balance social securitys annual income and spending at the point of insolvency the four options examined are 1 povertyline social security minimum benefit 2 slidingscale social security minimum benefit 3 poverty line ssi benefit and 4 povertyline ssi benefit with liberalized eligibility major findings include the following each of the four options would reduce elderly poverty compared to the payable baseline ranging from negligible reduction in the elderly poverty rate for the option to create slidingscale social security minimum benefit to reduction of three percentage points for the povertyline ssi benefit with liberalized eligibility the elderly poverty rate under all of the options would be higher than under the current law scheduled baseline which assumes the current benefit formula can be maintained with reductions the ssi options examined would target the additional spending more efficiently toward the poor elderly than would the social security options the social security options examined would reduce the incomes of some elderly because of interaction effects the ssi options would not create such interactions contents background 1 historical declines in elderly poverty uncertain future 1 elderly poverty has declined over time 1 elderly poverty is lower than child or workingage adult poverty 1

historical declines in elderly poverty uncertain future elderly poverty has declined over time elderly poverty in the united states has declined dramatically over time ultimately reaching an alltime low in 2006 in 1959 when the census bureau began to measure poverty more than third 35 of the elderly those age 65 or older were in poverty by 2006 less than onetenth 9 of the elderly were in poverty1 this reduction in elderly poverty was primarily due to two factors legislative changes that made social security benefits ie oldage survivors and disability insurance or oasdi more generous and strong wage growth that led to higher initial benefits if social security benefits did not exist an estimated 44 of the elderly would be poor today assuming behavioral changes such as saving more or working longer2 elderly poverty is lower than child or workingage adult poverty the poverty rate among the elderly is lower than that for children or for the working age population3 in 2006 9 of the elderly were poor compared to 17 of children and 11 of workingage adults ie ages 18 to 64 in 1969 the poverty rate among the elderly was more than double the rate among workingage adults4 by the early 1990s the elderly poverty rate had fallen below the rate for workingage adults and has remained lower since within each age group poverty rates vary dramatically depending on race sex education levels and other demographic characteristics5 elderly poverty is projected to decline under the scheduled benefit formula elderly poverty is projected to continue to decrease over time under social securitys scheduled benefit formula most of the elderly roughly 90 receive social security benefits under current law initial social security benefits 1 us census bureau historical poverty tables table 3

expected to outpace price growth the rate of poverty should decline among social security beneficiaries all else being equal6 the elderly poverty rate is projected to fall to about 5 by 2042 under the scheduled baseline which assumes changes in the social security benefit formula7 lack of action could reverse historic declines in elderly poverty social securitys scheduled benefit formula is unsustainable with current revenues lawmakers could restore longterm system solvency by increasing revenue eg raising taxes cutting benefits or some combination of the two according to the social security administration if changes are made to social security and the trust funds are allowed to become insolvent scheduled benefits would be reduced and elderly poverty rates could double8 under the payable baseline which assumes action until projected trust fund insolvency in 2041 an acrosstheboard benefit cut to achieve annual balance is projected to result in an 11 elderly poverty rate9 this figure is more than twice as high as the rate projected under the scheduled baseline and higher than the elderly poverty rate today future solvency changes could also increase elderly poverty many recent proposals to improve system solvency would reduce social security benefits in the future10 if social security benefits were cut across the board the poverty rate among elderly americans could be significantly higher than under the currentlaw benefit formula some of the most commonly discussed options to improve solvency could increase the elderly poverty rate to levels almost as high as doing nothing until the trust funds run out during the 2005 debate over social security reform one frequently mentioned solvency option was the price indexing provision from model 2 of the 2001 6 see

projected trust fund exhaustion in 2041 benefits would need to be reduced by about 25 in 2041 rising to 30 by 2081 in order to balance annual income and spending tax increases could also be used to achieve cashflow balance if the changes were undertaken immediately the benefit reductions would only need to be half the size of the projected 2041 cuts social security administration 2007 annual

rl33544 social security reform current issues and legislation by dawn nuschler crs3 presidents commission to strengthen social security11 if such price indexing provision were implemented in 2008 the dynasim model estimates that the elderly poverty rate would increase to 10 by 2042 assuming other changes12 this figure is twice the poverty rate projected under the scheduled benefit formula which would require additional funding to be sustainable in addition the 10 elderly poverty rate projected under price indexing in 2042 is almost as high as the 11 rate projected under the payable baseline another frequently mentioned option was developed by robert pozen one of the cochairs of the 2001 commission and endorsed by president george w bush13 dubbed progressive price indexing this option would implement the priceindexing formula from commission model 2 but would protect some low earners from benefit cuts14 however unlike price indexing progressive price indexing would not restore solvency to the system it could reduce the solvency gap by about 7015 if progressive price indexing were implemented in 2008 the dynasim model estimates that elderly poverty rate would be 8 by 2042 assuming other changes16 this is higher than the 5 poverty rate projected under the current law scheduled baseline which assumes benefit cuts but lower than the 11 rate projected under the payable baseline17 the social security and ssi programs workers and in some cases their families receive social security benefits based on their contributions into the system the supplemental security income ssi program in contrast is meanstested program that does not have work or contribution requirements but restricts benefits to those who meet strict limitations on assets and income as well as other criteria both programs are administered by the social security administration ssa table 1 outlines some of the differences between social security and ssi 11 see presidents commission to strengthen

in addition to federal ssi benefits most states provide supplemental ssi benefits if state supplemental ssi benefits are federally administered they are included in the ssi income limits plus federally administered state supplement if applicable crs5 social security receipt among the elderly has increased about 92 of the elderly currently receive social security18 more people qualify for social security now than in the past because of legislative changes that expanded eligibility and increased workforce participation19 reliance on social security benefits is also increasing in 2006 about onequarter of the elderly relied on social security for all of their income20 ssi receipt among the elderly has declined in contrast to social security only about 5 of the elderly currently receive ssi many poor elderly individuals do not receive ssi either because they do not meet ssis strict asset and income restrictions or because they are eligible but have not enrolled in the program the academic literature estimates that about onehalf to twothirds of qualifying elderly participate in ssi21 substantially fewer people qualify for ssi now than in the past because ssis income limits rise with inflation while many potential ssi applicants receive social security benefits which rise with wages this means that all other things being equal for each year in which wages rise faster than prices fewer social security beneficiaries qualify for ssi ssis resource limits and income disregards are not indexed and thus do not rise at all as result ssis eligibility criteria become stricter over time issues and options related to elderly poverty poverty reduction under current law social security although social security has substantially reduced poverty among the elderly its primary purpose is to replace earnings lost when worker of any income level retires dies or becomes disabled not to reduce poverty22 the social security benefit formula is progressive so lower earners benefits represent greater proportion of their average lifetime earnings than do higher earners benefits however not all of the elderly receive social security benefits and those who do receive benefits do not necessarily receive enough to stay out of poverty as 18 this estimate was calculated by dividing the number of elderly social security beneficiaries reported by ssa in the 2007 statistical supplement by the number of elderly individuals in the social security area in the 2007 trustees report 19 crs report rl32697 income and poverty among older americans in 2006 by patrick purcell 20 ibid 21 for example see paul s davies et modeling ssi financial eligibility and simulating the effect of policy options social security bulletin vol 64 2 september 2002 at

hereafter as elder powers 2006 22 poverty reduction was one of the goals of social security but not its primary purpose upon signing the social security act in 1935 president franklin roosevelt said we have tried to frame law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of job and against povertyridden old age emphasis added crs6 result about 7 of elderly social security beneficiaries lived in poverty in 2006 while about 22 of elderly nonbeneficiaries were poor23 some longterm low earners receive social security benefits that are less than the elderly poverty threshold for example person born in 1943 who earned the minimum wage every year for 40 years and then retired at his or her full retirement age 66 would receive social security benefit that is slightly less than the official poverty threshold for an elderly individual24 at age 62 the age at which most individuals take up retirement benefits the benefit for such worker would be about threequarters of the elderly poverty threshold individuals with limited working histories for example women who take time out of the labor force also frequently receive social security benefits that are below poverty social securitys special minimum one provision of the social security benefit formula that was intended to benefit poor individuals is the special minimum primary insurance amount pia25 the special minimum pia was enacted in 1972 to increase benefits for longterm low wage earners and their families to qualify worker must have at least 11 years of social securitycovered earnings above specified threshold26 the amount of the special minimum pia rises each year with inflation and varies depending on the number of years person works in 2008 the amounts range from 3490 per month for workers with 11 years of qualifying earnings to 72140 for workers with 30 years initial social security benefits rise at the rate of wage growth while the special minimum pia rises at the generally slower rate of price growth thus the amount of the special minimum pia has gradually become smaller relative to minimum pia person could receive under the ordinary social security rules as result the special minimum is paid to small and rapidly dwindling population27 ssas actuaries project that it will be impossible for anyone who becomes eligible for benefits in 2013 or later to receive the special minimum pia28 23 estimate produced using march 2007 current population survey 24 the urban institute minimum benefits in social security by melissa m favreault et

httpwwwcensusgovhheswwwpovertythreshldthresh07html 25 social securitys primary insurance amount pia is the basic benefit amount before reductions and credits are applied this is what beneficiaries would receive if they retired at their full retirement ages 26 annual earnings must be at least 15 of the oldlaw contribution wage base to count toward special minimum pia eligibility in 2008 this level is 11385 which is higher than what is required to earn four credits one year toward insured status 4200 in 2008 27 social security administration social securitys special minimum benefit social

minimum pia actuarial note 143 october 2000 by craig feinstein at httpwwwssagovoactnotespdf_notesnote143pdf crs7 the current law special minimum pia affects very few social security beneficiaries and does not necessarily bring these people out of poverty29 in 2005 approximately 100000 social security beneficiaries less than 025 received special minimum pia30 among these beneficiaries the average social security benefit amount 710 per month was less than the poverty threshold for an elderly individual 781 per month in 2005 supplemental security income ssi the supplemental security income ssi program was designed explicitly to benefit the elderly poor in addition to the lowincome blind and disabled31 its strict income and asset thresholds ensure that ssi benefits go only to the extremely poor unlike social security ssi benefits and eligibility are not based on work so ssi reaches many individuals with limited work histories who do not qualify for social security ssi benefits are typically not high enough to lift recipients out of poverty about four in ten 39 of ssi beneficiaries are poor32 the maximum federal benefit rates for ssi are less than the poverty thresholds for elderly individuals and couples and ssi recipients may only receive limited income other than their ssi benefits33 many poor elderly individuals do not receive ssi either because they do not meet ssis strict asset and income restrictions or because they are eligible but have not enrolled in the program some basic considerations poverty under the baselines when discussing policy options to address elderly poverty it is instructive to take closer look at the poor elderly figure 1 provides projected elderly poverty rates under both the scheduled and payable baselines in 2042 the first full year of projected trust fund insolvency34 these projections were produced by crs using the urban institutes dynasim microsimulation model for more details on the dynasim model and its use in this analysis please see the appendix 29 some beneficiaries receive the special minimum because they are subject to the windfall elimination provision wep which reduces social security benefits for those who also receive noncovered pensions an estimated 12 of beneficiaries who received the special minimum in 2000 also had noncovered pension income ssa special minimum benefit 30 social security administration annual statistical supplement 2006 table 5a8 at httpwwwssagovpolicydocsstatcompssupplement2006 31 upon signing the act that established ssi in 1972 president richard nixon said america has always cared for its aged poor the blind and the disabled and this bill will move that concern to higher ground by providing better and more equitable benefits 32 estimate for 2006 produced using march 2007 current population survey 33 the 2007 federal benefit rate was 623 for individuals and 934 for couples while the monthly poverty threshold was 829 for elderly individuals and 1044 for elderly couples 34 the scheduled baseline assumes the current benefit formula is maintained with reductions the payable baseline assumes currentlaw benefits are cut across the board to balance social securitys annual income and spending at the point of insolvency crs8 the projected elderly poverty rate is 11 under the payable baseline and 5 under the scheduled baseline under the payable baseline few groups stand out as having poverty rates that are substantially above average for example racial and ethnic minority groups have higherthanaverage projected poverty rates 19 for black and hispanic elderly and 21 for asian and native american elderly labeled as other in figure 1 elderly individuals with low levels of education are projected to have three times the overall poverty rate 33 unmarried elderly individuals are projected to have high rates of poverty 21 for never married individuals 17 for divorced individuals and 13 for widowed elderly individuals finally women are projected to have higher poverty rates than men 13 compared to 9 respectively figure 1 projected poverty rates among the elderly in 2042 assuming scheduled and payable baselines 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 sex all all 5 11 men 4

married 2 6 marital 7 status widowed 13 divorced 9 17 never married 13 21 scheduled baseline payable baseline source crs projections produced using the urban institutes dynasim microsimulation model benefit receipt among poor elderly when considering policy change it is also useful to consider what kinds of benefits if any the poor elderly receive social security about 70 of the poor elderly are projected to receive social security benefits under the payable baseline in 2042 compared to 97 of the nonpoor elderly the poverty rate among elderly individuals who receive social security benefits is projected to be 8 under the payable baseline in 2042 compared to 58 among individuals who do not receive social security benefits thus even after accounting for potential acrosstheboard cuts social security is projected to keep many elderly out of poverty and to provide income to most of those who remain poor crs9 ssi fewer of the elderly poor receive ssi than social security however ssi recipients are much more likely to be poor than are social security beneficiaries about 22 of the poor elderly are projected to receive ssi benefits under the payable baseline in 2042 compared to 1 of the nonpoor elderly the poverty rate among elderly individuals who receive ssi is projected to be about 75 under the payable baseline in 2042 compared to about 9 among elderly individuals who do not receive ssi benefits interactions between policy options and lowincome programs when discussing changes to public policy it is important to keep in mind the possible unintended consequences of potential change one of the advantages of microsimulation model such as dynasim is that it brings unexpected interactions between policy options and existing program rules to light social security is complex program and changes to its structure could lead to unexpected results both within the social security program and in the relationship of social security to ssi and other meanstested programs the results presented here show only the interactions that occur within and between social security and ssi as dynasim does not model other lowincome programs also since the official poverty thresholds are based only on money income policy interactions with inkind or quasicash benefits such as medicaid or food stamps would not affect peoples poverty status changes to social security could potentially affect eligibility and benefit levels for various government assistance programs any change to social security benefits could affect ssi eligibility and benefit levels in turn any change to ssi eligibility direct or indirect could affect eligibility for number of lowincome programs including medicaid food stamps and the lowincome home energy assistance program liheap in the most extreme cases an increase in social security benefits could actually make some lowincome beneficiaries worse off because they would lose eligibility for other programs as result ssi changes to social security could affect ssi since ssi eligibility and benefit levels are determined in part using applicants income which includes social security benefits35 the ssi rules stipulate that an individuals countable income cannot exceed the federal benefit amount plus the federallyadministered state supplements if applicable in addition the rules stipulate that the first 20 of unearned income including social security benefits can be excluded from the ssi benefit calculation after that each additional dollar of social security benefits results in one dollar reduction in federal ssi benefits once state supplement payments are factored in an additional dollar of social security benefits could result in reduction of more than one dollar in total ssi benefits thus an increase in social security benefits could cause some people to lose ssi eligibility and cause others to receive less in ssi benefits 35 crs report rs20294 ssi income and resource limits fact sheet by scott szymendera crs10 other meanstested programs changes to social security or ssi could also affect individuals eligibility for other programs36 for example an increase in social security benefits could raise some individuals income above the qualifying thresholds for ssi medicaid food stamps and the low income home energy assistance program liheap an increase in ssi enrollment due to direct or indirect changes could lead to more people qualifying for meanstested programs because in many cases ssi recipients are considered categorically eligible for assistance the following programs for lowincome individuals could potentially be affected by changes to social security and ssi eligibility and benefits medicaid states have three options for determining medicaid eligibility for ssi recipients as of 2008 in 32 states and the district of columbia individuals who are eligible for ssi are automatically eligible for medicaid ssi recipients in seven states and the northern mariana islands are eligible for medicaid but must complete separate application eleven other states have the option to impose medicaid eligibility requirements that are more restrictive than ssi criteria food stamps ssi recipients living alone or in household where all members receive ssi benefits are automatically eligible for food stamps liheap households with member receiving ssi are categorically eligible for liheap so changes to ssi eligibility would also affect liheap eligibility37 effects of policy interactions on the cost of policy options the interactions between changes to social security or ssi and lowincome programs affect not just beneficiaries but the total cost of an option as well for example increased ssi enrollment could lead to higher expenses not just for ssi but also for medicaid the food stamp program and liheap this is because greater number of ssi recipients would mean greater number of people who are categorically eligible for these programs increasing their cost similarly an increase in social security benefits could lead to higher expenses for social security but lower expenses for ssi medicaid the food stamp program and liheap this is because higher social security benefits would increase the total income of some people enough so that they would lose eligibility for ssi and other meanstested programs minimizing the effects of policy interactions if one wanted to increase social security benefits while minimizing effects on ssi eligibility and benefit levels one option would be raising ssis 20 unearned income exclusion which has not changed since 1981 this change would allow greater proportion of social security 36 crs report rl32279 primer on disability benefits social security disability insurance ssdi and supplemental security income ssi by scott szymendera 37 only 15 of federally eligible households received liheap in 2005 crs report rl31865 the lowincome home energy assistance program liheap program and funding by libby perl crs11 benefit increases to be passed on to ssi recipients and allow greater number of recipients to maintain ssi eligibility raising the unearned income exclusion would also allow policymakers to increase social security benefits with fewer effects on beneficiaries eligibility for medicaid food stamps and liheap it would also be possible to raise social security benefits while preserving currentlaw eligibility for medicaid food stamps andor liheap for some ssi recipients without increasing ssis unearned income exclusion legislation could deem current ssi recipients eligible for ssi for the purposes of qualifying for medicaid food stamps andor liheap without actually paying them ssi benefits38 this way ssi recipients who lost ssi eligibility after change to social security would not lose their eligibility to the affected programs such deeming provision would only affect individuals who were already receiving ssi when the policy was implemented not necessarily individuals in the future who could have received ssi under the old rules policy options and their projected effects on benefit levels and elderly poverty the following section describes each of the four options crs modeled it also provides the projected effects of the options on social security and ssi benefit levels and eligibility in 2042 and the interaction between the two programs these four options were chosen to illustrate different approaches to mitigating poverty in benefit cut scenario allowing policymakers to see the potential pros and cons of generic options the details of each option could be modified or combined with other provisions this analysis does not cover potential transition issues nor the cost of the options modeled option 1 povertyline minimum social security benefit the first option would create new minimum social security benefit equal to the elderly poverty line under this option any individual who was insured for social security ie who had enough credits to qualify for worker benefit would be guaranteed primary insurance amount pia at least equal to the singleperson elderly poverty threshold39 some social security beneficiaries could receive this minimum and still be poor under the option since the pia would be equal to the poverty threshold under this option an individual would only get povertylevel benefit if he or she claimed 38 on several occasions in the past when changes to social security benefits would have made some beneficiaries ineligible for ssi congress has deemed such individuals eligible for ssi for the purpose of receiving medicaid benefits 39 to be insured for retirement benefit an individual needs to have at least 40 credits or 10 years of covered work an individual would not have to be eligible for the current law special minimum to qualify for this alternative minimum benefit crs12 benefits at the full retirement age at which unreduced benefits are paid most people especially people with low incomes claim benefits before their full retirement ages and are thus subject to permanent reduction in monthly benefits for example claiming benefits at social securitys earliest eligibility age 62 permanently reduces workers pias by 30 if they were born in 1960 or later finally poverty is family measure not an individual measure so if person receives povertyline benefit but other members of hisher family have little or income that person could still be considered poor in addition some beneficiaries would not receive minimum benefit under this option because they would not qualify for benefits based on their own work records but would receive benefits based on others work eg spouse benefits in which person receives 50 of hisher spouses pia these auxiliary beneficiaries do not have their own pias and in some cases their benefits would be less than poverty projected change in benefits the mean change in social security benefits among all beneficiaries is projected to be about 2 under this option eligibility for social security would not change under the option but the additional income received would disqualify some individuals from ssi as result about 12 of individuals 307000 who received ssi benefits under the baseline are projected to lose their entire ssi benefit among beneficiaries projected to retain eligibility for ssi about 20 would receive lower benefits this effect on ssi benefits dilutes the options poverty reduction effect projected change in elderly poverty the povertyline social security minimum benefit option is projected to reduce the elderly poverty rate by about one percentage point compared to the current law payable baseline reducing the net number of elderly poor by about 494000 individuals in 2042 figure 2 shows the projected effect of this option on the poverty status of elderly individuals living in poor families in 2042 by demographic characteristics an estimated 7 561000 of the elderly poor would be moved out of poverty the option is projected to have bigger povertyreduction effect on some subgroups within the elderly poor than others for example the option is projected to bring 23 of married poor elderly individuals out of poverty but only 12 of each non married group this result might seem counterintuitive since married individuals are less likely than nonmarried individuals to receive higher social security benefits under the option but it reflects the fact that married people can potentially be brought out of poverty by spouses benefit increase about 67000 individuals are projected to fall into poverty under this option increasing the number of elderly poor by about 1 all of these individuals are projected to lose ssi benefits under the option crs13 figure 2 percentage reduction in the number of elderly poor projected under option 1 compared

dynasim microsimulation model option 2 sliding scale minimum social security benefit some policymakers are interested in minimum benefit options targeted at long term low earners as way of rewarding work and reinforcing social securitys ties to earnings40 one such option is provision in senator lindsay grahams 2003 comprehensive social security reform bill that would create slidingscale minimum benefit that would vary depending on number of years of work41 retired worker beneficiaries with at least 35 years of work would be guaranteed pia equal to 120 of the single elderly poverty threshold which would gradually phase out for workers with 10 years of work the minimum required to be insured for retired worker 40 in fact creating minimum benefit equal to the poverty line as in option 1 would also disproportionately benefit people with longer work histories for example about 8 of poor elderly with more than 40 years of work are projected to be brought out of poverty by the option compared to about 4 of poor elderly with fewer than 20 years of work 41 s 1878 in the 108th congress for more details see the social security administration memorandum to stephen c goss chief actuary

even individuals who qualify for minimum pia at the poverty line or higher could still be poor under this option for the same reasons described for the previous option they could be subject to benefit reductions or other members of their families might not have enough income for the enhanced benefit to bring the entire unit out of poverty projected change in benefits overall there is projected to be change in the mean amount of social security benefits under this option eligibility for social security would not change but the additional social security benefits some individuals receive would disqualify them for ssi as result about 2 of individuals 60000 who would have received ssi benefits under the baseline are projected to lose eligibility the model estimates that the option would disqualify more people for ssi than it would bring out of poverty after accounting for changes in both social security and ssi benefits among beneficiaries who retained eligibility for ssi projected 6 would have lower ssi benefits under the option projected change in elderly poverty the slidingscale minimum benefit option is not projected to change the projected elderly poverty rate from the current law payable level of 11 it is projected to have negligible effect on the net number of elderly poor in 2042 figure 3 shows the projected effect of this option on the poverty status of elderly individuals living in poor families in 2042 breaking down the results by demographic characteristics overall about 1 58000 of the poor elderly are projected to come out of poverty compared to the payable baseline the poverty reduction effect of this proposal is not projected to vary dramatically by subgroup each group shows either change or 1 coming out of poverty almost as many elderly are projected to fall into poverty as result of this option as are taken out of it 58000 individuals compared to 53000 individuals respectively many of those put in poverty are projected to lose ssi benefits under the option 42 for example the pia for an individual with 35 years of work would be 120 of the monthly single elderly poverty threshold in the year of eligibility the option would not apply to individuals receiving social security disability di benefits however when di beneficiary is converted to retired worker benefits at his or her full retirement age as required by law modified slidingscale minimum benefit formula would apply which would reflect the number of years the disabled individual was able to work the minimum benefit would be 120 of the poverty threshold for workers with at least 35 times as many social security credits as elapsed years gradually scaling down to minimum benefit for workers with credits equal to the number of their elapsed years this modified scale would also apply to survivor beneficiaries in cases where the worker died before age 62 crs15 figure 3 percentage reduction in the number of elderly poor projected under option 2 compared to

microsimulation model option 3 poverty line ssi federal benefit rates under this option ssis federal benefit rates would be increased to the elderly poverty thresholds for individuals and couples43 the asset thresholds and income exclusions for ssi would remain the same as under current law ie would not increase with inflation increasing the federal benefit rate would effectively liberalize eligibility for ssi since ssis income eligibility thresholds are linked to federal benefit rates some ssi beneficiaries could still have benefits that are less than poverty under the option person could for example receive less than the full federal benefit rate because there is dollarfordollar reduction in federal ssi benefits for unearned income above the thresholds in addition since poverty is determined for families and ssi benefits are paid to individuals or couples person could receive povertyline ssi benefit and still be considered poor if other family members have little or income projected change in benefits an additional 1 of the elderly 913000 individuals who did not receive ssi benefits under the baseline are projected to receive them under this option this is projected to increase ssi participation by 43 in 2007 the monthly ssi federal benefit rate was 623 for individuals and 934 for couples the monthly poverty thresholds were about 829 for elderly individuals and 1044 for elderly couples both of these thresholds rise with inflation crs16 more than third44 among those who received ssi under the baseline all are projected to receive higher ssi benefits which would almost double on average changes in ssi receipt or benefit levels do not affect social security eligibility or benefit levels so there would be change in social security receipt or benefits under this

projections of the effect of this option on the poverty status of elderly individuals living in poor families in 2042 breaking down the results by demographic characteristics overall the number of elderly in poverty is projected to be reduced by about 5 395000 under the option in comparison with the current law payable baseline the poverty reduction effect of this option would vary depending on demographic characteristics for example it is projected to have relatively small povertyreduction effect on individuals with more than high school education 3 44 about 25 million elderly are projected to receive ssi under the payable baseline in 2042 though the model assumes that the proportion of qualifying individuals who take up ssi benefits would not change it is likely that the proportion would increase if ssi were made more generous crs17 and married individuals 3 both of whom are less likely than average to receive ssi benefits on the other hand this option would particularly help the oldest old age 85 or older 7 of whom are projected to be brought out of poverty one is projected to be put into poverty by this option option 4 povertyline ssi benefits with liberalized eligibility the final option modeled would build upon the previous option by retaining the povertyline ssi federal benefit rates and adding on provisions to increase ssis asset limits and income exclusions and index them to inflation under current law ssis asset limits and income exclusions are very strict and do not rise with inflation45 the current unearned income exclusion 20month and earned income exclusion 65month plus half of earnings above this amount were set in 1981 the current asset exclusions 2000individual and 3000couple were set in 198946 the increased asset limits and income exclusions in this option are based on the ssi modernization act introduced by representative benjamin cardin most recently in 200547 this bill would have doubled the earned and unearned income exclusions to 130month and 40month respectively and increased the asset thresholds by 50 to 3000individual and 4500couple the bill would also have automatically indexed these thresholds to inflation projected change in benefits an additional 3 of the elderly 20 million individuals who did not receive ssi benefits under the baseline are projected to receive them under this option this would almost double the number of the elderly who are projected to receive ssi48 among beneficiaries who received ssi under the baseline all are projected to receive higher ssi benefits which would more than double on average changes in ssi receipt or benefit levels do not affect social security eligibility or benefit levels so there would be change in social security receipt or benefits under this option projected change in elderly poverty the option to create povertyline ssi benefit and liberalize eligibility is projected to reduce the elderly poverty rate by about three percentage points compared to the payable baseline reducing the number of elderly poor by about 19 million individuals in 2042 figure 5 shows the estimated effect of this option on the poverty status of elderly individuals living

to be put into poverty by this option summary of results the following section summarizes the results described above showing the projected effects of the options on social security and ssi eligibility benefit levels and poverty rates in 2042 and the interaction between the two programs projected change in benefits in summary none of the options is projected to change eligibility for social security benefits but options 1 and 2 would change the benefit formula overall option 1 is projected to increase the average social security benefit by 2 while option 2 is not projected to change the average social security benefit received as for ssi options 3 and 4 are projected to increase both eligibility and benefit levels both of these changes would dramatically affect the ssi program under option 3 the number of ssi crs19 beneficiaries is projected to increase by more than third while under option 4 the number of ssi beneficiaries is projected to increase by 80 the change in benefit levels for those who would receive ssi under current law would also be dramatic under both option 3 and option 4 ssi benefit payments are projected to roughly double projected change in elderly poverty the overall projected elderly poverty rate under each option is shown in figure 6 below each of the options is modeled with current law payable baseline which is shown along with current law scheduled baseline for comparison each option is projected to reduce poverty somewhat compared to the current law payable baseline ranging from negligible reduction in the elderly poverty rate for option 2 which would create social security minimum benefit for longterm low earners to reduction of three percentage points for option 4 the povertyline ssi benefit with liberalized eligibility it is important to note that the projected elderly poverty rate under all of the options would be higher than under the current law scheduled baseline which assumes benefit cuts figure 6

source crs projections produced using the urban institutes dynasim microsimulation model note the four policy options were modeled with current law payable baseline crs20 both the number and demographic breakdown of individuals who are projected to come out of poverty under each of these options varies substantially overall the number of elderly poor people brought out of poverty would vary dramatically from 1 for option 2 to 24 for option 4 option 1 is projected to bring 7 of the elderly poor out of poverty compared to 5 for option 3 as far as demographic breakdowns option 1 is projected to bring greater proportion of married individuals out of poverty which reflects the fact that married people can potentially be brought out of poverty by spouses benefit increase the povertyreduction effects of option 2 would not vary much by subgroup probably because the impact of the option would be small overall both of the ssi options options 3 and 4 are projected to bring greater proportion of nonmarried individuals and the oldest elderly age 85 out of poverty in part because these groups are more likely to receive ssi program interactions one of the most striking differences between the social security and ssi options is whether and how they interact with other programs both of the social security options reduce eligibility and benefit levels for ssi which in turn can affect eligibility for other benefit programs for option 2 in particular this interaction would offset the poverty reduction effect of the policy both of the ssi options are free of similar interaction effects they each increase ssi benefits without affecting eligibility or benefits for social security however increased eligibility for ssi could affect participation in the food stamp program and other lowincome programs for which ssi recipients are categorically eligible targeting spending toward the elderly poor if one of the objectives of reforming social security were to mitigate the effect of possible benefit reductions on the elderly poor targeting spending would become an important consideration one way to measure such targeting is to compare the estimated effects of potential policy options on the elderly poor vs the elderly non poor other ways of analyzing the targeting of an option include measuring the poverty gap and looking at the proportion of people who fall below given percentage of the poverty threshold eg 150 or 200 of poverty however this report focuses on elderly people who are officially considered poor figure 7 shows the elderly poor the target group for the modeled policy options for each option it shows the proportion of individuals projected to gain income labeled winners lose income labeled losers or stay the same labeled change the income measure shows the projected net change in income under each option including both social security and ssi benefits so these projections reflect the interaction between the two programs figure 8 shows the same measures for the nonpoor elderly crs21 figure 7 proportion of the poor elderly projected to gain or lose income under options compared to payable baseline 2042 100 8 90 27 80

under option 1 which would create new minimum social security benefit at the poverty line about twothirds of the poor elderly 68 are projected to be unaffected there are several reasons poor individuals may not be affected because they dont qualify for social security benefits because they receive benefits based on another persons work record or because they began to receive benefits before the option was implemented as shown in figure 7 projected 27 of the poor elderly would be winners but most arent projected to gain enough income to bring them out of poverty the remaining 5 of the elderly poor are projected to lose income under the option in nearly all cases their increased social security benefits are projected to result in reduced ssi benefits or loss of ssi eligibility among the nonpoor elderly most 84 are projected not to be affected as shown in figure 8 however about 11 are projected gain income under the option and another 5 are projected to lose income for the same reasons outlined above option 2 sliding scale minimum social security benefit under option 2 which would create slidingscale minimum benefit based on years of work about nine out of ten of the poor elderly 89 are projected to be unaffected for the same reasons mentioned in the previous option about 8 of the poor elderly are projected to be winners under the option but most dont gain enough income to bring them out of poverty the remaining 3 of the elderly poor are projected to lose income under the option most of the individuals who lose income under the option would either have reduced ssi benefits or lose ssi eligibility among the nonpoor elderly most 91 are projected not to be affected as shown in figure 8 however about 5 are projected gain income under the option and another 4 are projected to lose income for the same reasons outlined above option 3 poverty line ssi federal benefit rates under option 3 which would raise the ssi federal benefit rates to the poverty line about 63 of the poor elderly are projected to be unaffected as shown in figure 7 this is roughly the same proportion of the poor elderly who live in families where elderly member receives ssi under the option the remaining 37 of the poor elderly are projected to be winners under the option none of the elderly poor is projected to lose income among the nonpoor elderly most 96 are projected not to be affected as shown in figure 8 about 4 are projected gain income under the option none of the nonpoor elderly is projected to lose income option 4 povertyline ssi benefits with liberalized eligibility under option 4 which would raise ssi federal benefit rates to the poverty line and also liberalize eligibility about 59 of the poor elderly are projected to be unaffected as shown in figure 7 this is roughly the same proportion of the poor elderly who live in families where elderly member receives ssi under the option the remaining 41 of the poor elderly are projected to be winners under the option none of the elderly poor is projected to lose income crs23 among the nonpoor elderly most 96 are projected not to be affected as shown in figure 8 about 4 are projected gain income under the option none of the nonpoor elderly is projected to lose income summary of results the ssi options analyzed in this report are better targeted toward the elderly poor than are the social security options among the elderly poor the ssi options are projected to create more winners and losers this is because ssi recipients by definition are mostly poor so any changes to ssi would affect mostly poor people among the nonpoor the ssi options change the incomes of fewer people and cause one to lose income the social security options are projected to cause some people to lose income especially poor people this is primarily because of the interaction between social security and ssi each additional dollar of social security benefits could reduce ssi recipients benefits by one dollar or more after factoring in state supplements and could disqualify some recipients for ssi altogether other considerations in addition to considering benefit levels poverty rates and targeting as examined above policymakers examining the potential effects of social security reform on the elderly poor would likely consider other criteria when discussing policy changes to either social security or ssi the following section briefly summarizes some of these other criteria one important factor not explicitly addressed in this report is the cost of each option which would vary substantially the dynasim model does not produce cost estimates and current cost estimates for these options are not available from other sources49 program design and purpose one possible subject for discussion if policy changes are considered is the original purpose of the programs that could be modified for example ssi was originally designed to benefit the poor and its strict income and asset limits restrict benefits to the poorest elderly as such expanding ssi eligibility or benefits would effectively target additional spending toward the elderly poor social security on the other hand was not primarily intended to reduce poverty but to replace the lost earnings of contributing workers of all income levels changing the social security benefit formula to mitigate the effects of changes on the elderly poor arguably would not target additional dollars as efficiently it also might complicate the balance between adequacy and equity in the social security program 49 dynasim is not social security actuarial model and thus cannot estimate the solvency effect of proposed policy change the dynasim model does not contain all of the information required to produce solvency estimates for example dynasim does not calculate childrens benefits and so complete account of benefit payments cannot be calculated in addition dynasim simulates the population between the years 1993 and 2050 the benefits received by individuals outside of this yearly range would not be included in the calculations for these same reasons longterm cost estimates cannot be calculated crs24 potential scope of changes another possible subject for discussion is the potential scope of policy changes factors such as program participation rates and eligibility restrictions social security participation among the elderly is nearly universal ssi has strict eligibility criteria and its participation rates are far lower as result changes to ssi would likely affect fewer of the elderly poor than would changes to social security some individuals prefer not to receive meanstested assistance and would not participate in ssi regardless of changes other individuals may not qualify even for liberalized ssi program because of asset restrictions this would be particular problem for people with retirement savings as defined contribution retirement plans such as 401ks and individual retirement accounts count toward ssis asset test50 political and fiscal environment finally another potential topic that could be discussed is the prevailing political and fiscal environment in recent years major changes to social security and ssi have been rare for example the last significant amendments to social security were in 1983 ssis income disregards and asset tests have stayed the same since 1981 and 1989 respectively and are not indexed to inflation there are also fiscal constraints on additional spending the federal budget is currently in deficit and is projected to remain so in the future51 in addition social security faces longterm solvency problems ultimately future elderly poverty rates depend largely on how policymakers choose to address social securitys looming solvency problems once those decisions are made the tradeoffs between any options to mitigate the effects of potential benefit cuts would be judged based on their effectiveness efficiency cost and on policymakers judgments about myriad of other factors 50 social security administration defined contribution pension plans and the supplemental security income program policy brief 200601 march 2006 at httpwwwssagovpolicydocspolicybriefspb200601pdf 51 see crs report rl31414 baseline budget projections discussion of issues by marc labonte crs25 appendix methodology this paper examines four possible policy options to reduce elderly poverty the projections in the paper were prepared using the urban institutes dynasim microsimulation model52 the dynasim model projects future social security and ssi benefits by using mix of historical data and projections when interpreting the results of dynasim or any other model it is important to note that projections are inherently imprecise the further into the future one looks the wider the range of possible outcomes population the analysis focuses on all noninstitutionalized individuals who will be age 65 or older in 2042 including those who do not receive social security andor ssi benefits baseline all of the options in this paper are compared to current law payable baseline which assumes that current law benefits are cut across the board to balance social securitys annual income and spending at the point of insolvency currently projected to occur in 2041 this baseline illustrates how such options could work in benefitcut scenario some of the most commonly discussed solvency options are projected to result in poverty rates similar to the current law payable baseline in the year of analysis as discussed above using different baseline or different solvency option would lead to different results year of analysis this report focuses on the effects of policy changes in 2042 the first full year of projected trust fund insolvency analyzing this year shows how various povertyreduction options could mitigate the effects of an acrossthe board cut to social security benefits at the projected point of insolvency assuming action was taken before then this reduction is assumed to bring annual cash flow balance to the system cutting benefits by about 25 in 204253 the figures and accompanying analysis are essentially snapshot of the projected beneficiary population in this single year focusing on different year would lead to different results it is also important to recall that initial social security benefits rise with wages over time while ssi benefits and income limits as well as the poverty thresholds rise with prices since wages are projected to rise faster than prices over time this means that in general the projected prevalence of ssi receipt decreases each year under current law as does the number of people in poverty start year for options all of the options in this report are assumed to be implemented in 2008 the year 2008 was chosen so that the analysis could rely as much as possible on nearterm projections which are more reliable than longterm 52 for more detailed explanation of the dynasim model please see urban institute primer on the dynamic simulation of income model dynasim3 by melissa favreault and karen smith february 1 2004 at httpwwwurbanorgurlcfmid410961 53 according to the 2007 social security trustees report if action were taken before projected trust fund exhaustion in 2041 benefits would need to be reduced by about 25 in 2041 rising to 30 by 2081 in order to balance annual income and spending crs26 projections in addition choosing an earlier start year means that almost all of the elderly beneficiaries in the analysis year 2042 will be subject to the options measure of income many of the results presented in this paper focus on changes in income for the purposes of this paper income includes social security benefits ssi benefits pension payments earnings and the annuitized value of financial assets in modeling these options social security benefits were calculated before ssi benefits this sequence is intended to mimic program rules in which ssi applicants must apply for all other benefits for which they may qualify before applying for ssi as result the interactions between social security and ssi benefits can be seen income is calculated on per capita basis which means that for married couples the income of both spouses is averaged together however in showing poverty status measure of family income is used since the official poverty threshold is calculated on family basis54 poverty thresholds in the us poverty is officially defined using the census bureaus poverty thresholds these thresholds reflect rough estimates of the amount of money individuals or families need per year to purchase basket of goods and services deemed minimally adequate according to the living standards of the early 1960s when the poverty thresholds were developed the thresholds are increased at the rate of inflation55 the 2007 annual poverty threshold was 9944 for an elderly individual and 12533 for an elderly couple56 family is considered poor if its countable money income is less than the poverty threshold for its family type and size57 this report uses the official poverty thresholds appropriate for each individuals family type and size including the thresholds for elderly individuals and couples the thresholds are projected using the intermediate assumptions about future inflation from the 2005 social security trustees report 54 the dynasim model projects nuclear families not households 55 the federal poverty thresholds are an absolute measure of income historically since wages have risen faster than prices the american standard of living has risen over time since the official poverty thresholds are increased with inflation they measure the amount of income necessary to maintain constant standard of living not the amount of income needed to keep up with rising standards of living assuming wages continue to grow faster than prices the disparity between rising real incomes and fixed real poverty threshold will lead to decreasing proportion of the population being in poverty 56 the poverty thresholds for the elderly are lower than those for the nonelderly in 2007 the threshold for workingage people was 10787 for an individual and 13884 for couple us census bureau poverty thresholds 2007 at httpwwwcensusgovhhes wwwpovertythreshldthresh07html 57 the poverty measure counts most sources of pretax money income eg earnings social security pensions cash public assistance interest and dividends alimony and child support among others noncash benefits such as the value of medicare and medicaid public housing or employerprovided health care and nearcash benefits eg food stamps are not counted as income nor are tax payments subtracted from income nor are tax credits added eg earned income tax credit eitc crs27 behavioral changes this analysis assumes that behavioral changes result from the modification of the social security or ssi benefit rules thus policy changes will not automatically alter an individuals work patterns or age at benefit takeup however its likely that if policy changes were implemented individuals incentives and behavior could also change the model assumes that roughly two thirds of individuals who qualify for ssi take up benefits58 for policies with liberalized eligibility criteria such as the ssi options analyzed in this report the same proportion of qualifying individuals is assumed to take up benefits however it is possible that more generous ssi program would also change the proportion of qualifying individuals taking up benefits which is not captured in these projections59 the analysis also assumes changes in state policy as result of policy changes at the federal level however it is possible that federal policy changes in ssi could result in adjustments to state supplements for example 58 as described above the academic literature estimates that about onehalf to twothirds of qualifying elderly participate in ssi 59 for example see elder
