initiative and 671 million to support federal detention and incarceration programs for justice the house bill would have provided 25439 billion 78 increase and the senate bill 25779 billion 93 increase both bills included increased funding for law enforcement assistance for science agencies the fy2009 request included 24474 billion or 47 more than the fy2008 enacted level the house bill included 24628 billion 53 increase for science agencies the senate bill 24673 billion 55 increase for related agencies the fy2009 request included 7840 million or 31 less than the fy2008 enacted level

emergency assistance act other amounts are provided for the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 920 million and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa 300 million for

preparation for 2010 the bureau planned three new initiatives the first of which involved reengineering the census to prepare for shortform only enumeration the shortform questionnaire is designed to gather data from all households for among other purposes the constitutionally mandated reapportionment of the us house of representatives and withinstate redistricting the census longform questionnaire which since 1940 had collected detailed data from sample of households will be replaced by the american community survey acs the acs is an ongoing survey of about 250000 households per month by 2010 it will provide the equivalent of longform data yearly instead of once decade to states and substate jurisdictions data already are available for states and localities with at least 65000 persons second the bureau is making improvements to its master address file maf and topologically integrated geographic encoding and referencing mapping system tiger as described by the bureau director the maftiger enhancement program is multiyear effort to collect and correct the locations of streets and other geographic information 28 because the census involves mailing out questionnaires and having them mailed back to the bureau the accuracy of maftiger is essential for sending questionnaires to the right housing units third the bureau intended to automate fully the precensus address verification and postcensus nonresponse followup nrfu processes address verification will be conducted to improve maf accuracy in the nrfu process enumerators will try to obtain correct data from those who have not completed and returned their census forms due to contract delays significant cost overruns and scheduling and performance prob lems however the handheld computers on which the bureau was relying for both address verification and nrfu will be used only for the former process the bureau will resort to the traditional paperbased nrfu and thus will require additional funds for among other purposes hiring more temporary census workers than originally anticipated the altered nonresponse followup plan could increase the overall cost of the 2010 census from projected 115 billion to between 137 and 145 billion 29 the supplemental appropriations act 2008 pl 110252 122 stat 2323 included an extra 2100 million for the 2010 census in fy2008 and after the bureaus initial fy2009 budget request it sought additional fy2009 funds on june 9 2008 the administration submitted an fy2009 budget amendment requesting almost 5460 million more for the 2010 census to be offset by reductions in other accounts and cancellations of unobligated balances in the partment of commerce and other entities house and senate appropriators deemed the amended request submission untimely although the senate appropriations committee recommended an amount for the bureau that exceeded the original fy2009 request of 2605 billion by 5464 million house appropriators recommended the amount

proposal also stated that the uspto should have full access to all fees collected and that fee increases enacted in 2005 and 2006 and extended through 2008 be continued the draft bill approved by the

fy2007 and mandated the continuation of existing fee increases beginning in 1990 appropriation measures have at times limited the ability of the uspto to use the full amount of fees collected in each fiscal year although over the past several years the uspto has been given the budget authority to use all collected fees this issue remains an area of controversy opponents of this approach argue that agency operations are supported by payments for services that must be financed in the year the expenses are incurred proponents of methods to limit uspto fee usage maintain that the fees are necessary to help balance the budget and that the budget authority given to the uspto is sufficient to cover operating costs 31 this section was written by wendy h schacht specialist in science and technology

its fy2008 appropriation the house committee recommended 17769 billion the senate committee recommended 17814 billion see table 9 for breakdown by appropriations account as directed by congress there are now seven appropriations accounts rather than the previous three in addition change in how nasa accounts for overhead expenses complicates comparisons between fy2009 and previous years in the new system overhead costs formerly included in program budgets are instead budgeted in the crossagency support account this change reduces the stated cost of most programs without affecting actual program content as result amounts expressed in the new system are not directly comparable with amounts expressed in the previous system in table 9 and in the discussion of specific nasa programs that follows all fy2008 amounts have been adjusted for the accounting ch ange to make them comparable with fy2009 budget priorities throughout nasa are being driven by the vision for space exploration announced by president bush in january 2004 and endorsed by congress in the nasa authorization act of 2005 pl 109155 the vision in cludes returning the space shuttle to flight status already accomplished then retiring it by 2010 completing the international space station iss but discontinuing us use of it by 2017 returning humans to the moon by 2020 and then sending humans to mars and worlds beyond the president did not propose significantly increased funding for nasa to accomplish the vision instead most of the funding was to come from redirecting funds from other nasa activities moreover subsequent nasa funding overall has been less than was projected at the time of the vision announcement the funding requirements of the vision thus constrain other nasa programs 57 this section was

the iss and the space and flight support program was 5775 billion requested decrease of 2850 million for the space shuttle was largely offset by requested increase of 2470 million for the iss both changes were consistent with nasas previous projections they reflected the trend toward the shuttle programs completion in 2010 and the planned construction schedule of the iss requested increase for space and flight support resulted mostly from transferring the deep space and near earth networks from the science account the gap between the end of shuttle flights in 2010 and the expected availability of orion and ares i in 2015 raises several issues some analysts are concerned that placing fixed termination date on the shuttle may create schedule pressure similar to that identified as contributing factor in the columbia disaster some question whether the united states should be dependent on russia to launch us astronauts to the iss during the gap period major concern is how nasa will retain its skilled workforce during the transition from shuttle to orion especially if orions schedule slips and the gap lengthens the house committee recommended 5765 billion for space operations including 100 million less than the request for space and flight support nd directed nasa to consider two final shuttle logistics flights to the iss currently manifested as contingency flights as baseline flights house administrative provision would direct nasa to provide report on costs for shuttle retirement and transition activities for fy2006 through fy2015 the senate committee recommended the requested amount 5775 billion 59 executive office of the president national science and technology council national plan for aeronautics research and development and related
