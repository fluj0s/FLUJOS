hr 7 compared with existing charitable choice laws summary this report provides sidebyside comparison table 1 of two versions of the charitable choice act of 2001 title ii of hr 7 with three existing charitable choice laws the table shows how the bill passed by the house on july 19 2001 differs from the original version of hr 7 from the first charitable choice law the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 and from two later laws that extended charitable choice rules to substance abuse treatment and prevention services under the public health service act pl 106310 and pl 1065541 as the table shows the house bill2 refines somewhat the list of programs and activities to which hr 7 rules would apply in new provision it authorizes the secretary of the department administering covered program to require that assistance be disbursed to recipients as vouchers redeemable by religious and other providers chosen by individual beneficiaries if beneficiary objects to the religious character of provider the government must provide assistance of equal value from an accessible and alternate provider that is unobjectionable on religious grounds the original bill required the government to offer assistance from an alternative provider including nonreligious one the bill stipulates that if religious organization receiving direct funds through contract or agreement for provision of services offers sectarian worship instruction or proselytization the religious activity must be voluntary and offered separate from the program funded under the charitable choice act the bill retains the provision which is in all charitable choice laws allowing religious organizations to hire only coreligionists but it deletes provision in the original hr 7 measure that would have allowed religious organization to require its employees to adhere to its religious practices the house bill includes new provision to earmark 50 million annually in justice department funds for training and technical assistance to small nongovernmental organizations in procedures relating to participation in federally funded benefit programs common to both versions of hr 7 but absent from any other charitable choice measure is declaration that funds received by religious organization under the act are not to be construed as aid to religious organizations or an endorsement of religion the table shows that over time charitable choice legislation has grown longer and more detailed as sponsors have sought to draft language to meet disparate concerns that charitable choice might weaken the religious character of participating organizations impair the religious freedom of beneficiaries and erode the wall separating church and state 1 fourth current charitable choice law is title ii of 105285 which applies its charitable choice rules to any program carried out under the community services block grant program these provisions are shown in table 1 of crs report rl31030 2 the housepassed version of

charitable choice housepassed hr 7 compared with three existing charitable choice laws 4 charitable choice housepassed version of hr 7 compared with existing charitable choice laws background charitable choice is set of provisions in law intended to allow religious organizations to provide federally funded services from specifically named programs on the same basis as any other nongovernmental provider without impairing the religious character of the organizations or the religious freedom of recipients charitable choice does not contain special funding for faithbased organizations and it applies only to programs designated by congress the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 put the first charitable choice language into federal law applying it to the block grant program of temporary assistance for needy families tanf3 in 1998 congress extended charitable choice rules to grants under the community services block grant act pl 105285 and in 2000 to grants for prevention and treatment of substance abuse under the public health service act pl 106310 and pl 106554 the 2000 republican platform proposed to apply charitable choice to all federal social service programs in their 2000 platform democrats said they believed that faithbased programs should augment not replace government programs in every instance where this administration sees responsibility to help people it will look to faithbased organizations charities and groups that have shown the ability to change lives said the fy2002 budget press release of the department of health and human services hhs these groups will not replace government but rather partner with it hr 7 as passed by the house on july 19 2001 by vote of 233 to 198 would apply charitable choice rules significantly changed from those in current charitable choice laws to range of nine program areas and activities some of which may overlap with tanffunded activities sponsored by representative watts and introduced on march 29 as the community solutions act of 2001 hr 7 was referred to the committees on ways and means and the judiciary the measure embodies two major components of president bushs faithbased initiative namely tax incentives to expand private giving title i and expansion of charitable choice title ii the ways and means committee dealt with titles i and iii the judiciary committee with title ii as modified by the ways and means committee 3 the 1996 law also applied charitable choice rules to food stamps medicaid and supplemental security income ssi to the extent that they use contracts or vouchers crs2 and passed by the house the tax incentives in title i were scaled back sharply for instance the bush budget proposal to allow tax deductions for portion of charitable donations for nonitemizing tax filers was estimated to cost 84 billion in forgone revenue over 10 years but the smaller version voted by the house is estimated to cost 64 billion as introduced title iii of hr 7 proposed permanent program of individual development accounts financed with tax credits but the ways and means committee substituted language revising and extending an existing ida program and doubling its authorized funding on june 18 2002 the senate finance committee approved revised hr 7 now called the care act which omitted provisions to expand charitable choice but included tax incentives for private giving and ida provisions this bill did not reach the senate floor the hr 7 charitable choice proposal resulted in several congressional hearings the first ever conducted on charitable choice and has aroused much controversy for background and legal issues see crs report rl31043 major arguments of supporters to fund only secular programs discriminates against religious programs it is just as inappropriate for government to favor non religion as to promote one religion over another faithbased programs can attract large amounts of volunteer time staff have sense of mission that inspires those they serve these organizations often help in ways that government cannot providing love as well as services guidance and friendship as well as meal or training charitable choice has been carefully written to protect constitutional values charitable choice rules protect the religious character of faithbased providers they specify that religious organizations shall retain control over the definition development practice and expression of their religious beliefs and charitable choice rules protect the religious liberty of beneficiaries they require that if recipient objects to the religious character of the provider the government must provide an alternate and accessible provider major arguments of opponents charitable choice may lead to unconstitutional use of government funds to promote specific religious practice or belief since money is interchangeable government funds given for secular purpose could indirectly help to fund the organizations religious purposes undermining governmental neutrality toward religion charitable choice rules would require government to decide what is legitimate religion and what is not what is preaching and what is not crs3 direct government grants to religious groups could make churches dependent on government eroding their mission and tending to secularize them and charitable choice promotes governmentfunded discrimination by allowing religious organizations that receive federal dollars for their services to hire and fire on the basis of religious beliefs crs4 table 1 charitable

provisionc in nothing in the charitable explicit provision nothing in this section other law colloquy on the house choice provisions of pl shall be construed to floor before passage rep 104193 is to be modify or affect any watts bill sponsor was construed to preempt other federal or state law asked whether he would provision of state or regulation relating to commit to working to constitution or law that discrimination in craft language that would prohibits or restricts employment section ensure that religious spending of state funds 582e organizations comply with in or by religious state and local civil rights organizations section laws rep watts said he 104k was willing to make commitment to more clearly address this issue in conference under the ccdbg religious providers may receive funding on the same basis as nonsectarian providers however religious providers may use funds for construction generally disallowed for other providers to the extent needed to bring facilities into compliance with health and safety standards use of ccbdg funds for religious activities including sectarian worship or instruction generally is prohibited but this prohibition does not apply to funds received by providers in the form of child care certificates if the sectarian services are freely chosen by the parent providers may not discriminate in admissions against child on the basis of religion with the exceptions of family child care providers and providers who receive ccdbg funds in the form of child care certificates however sectarian providers may reserve unsubsidized slots fo children whose families regularly participate in their organizations activities unless 80 or more of their operating budget comes from federal or state funds including child care certificates in their employment practices providers may not discriminate on the basis of religion if the employees primary duties are to give child care however in considering two or more qualified applicants sectarian providers may give preference to person who regularly participates in the organizations activities also sectarian organizations may require employees to adhere to their religious tenets or teaching and to rules forbidding the use of drugs or alcohol unless 80 or more of their operating budget comes from federal or state funds see crs report rl30785 the child care and development block grant background and funding by alice butler and melinda gish b it appears that provisions of section 703e2 of the civil rights act are subsumed by section 702 c before passage the question was asked on the house floor if state law prohibits discrimination based on particular characteristic and if religious organization would ordinarily based on state law be required to comply with that law would hr 7 change that situation in any way rep watts replied yes hr 7 would change this situation in particular instance if religious organization were to commingle federal funds with state monies it could assert its right under subsection d and of hr 7 against the enforcement of state or local procurement provisions that limited the religious organizations ability to hire staff on religious basis note subsection d concerns the right of religious organization to retain control over its organizational character and autonomy subsection provides that the religious organizations right to hire and fire on the basis of religion under section 702 of title vii of the civil rights act is not affected by its participating in program covered by the act it also provides that any provision in covered program that is inconsistent with or that would diminish the exercise of the religious organizations autonomy under section 702 shall have effect for other versions of this document see
