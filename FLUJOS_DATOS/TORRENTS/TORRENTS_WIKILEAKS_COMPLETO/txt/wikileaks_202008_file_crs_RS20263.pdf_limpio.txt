avoidance of jeopard to them several courts have now held that the relevant regulation and interpretation that result in this conclusion are erroneous and do not carry out the intent of congress hr 1299 in the 109th congress would change the definition of ch and move the time at which critical habitat must be designated for species from being basically concurrent with the listing of the species to the earlier of either three years after listing or one year after approval of recovery plan for that sp ecies this report provides background for considering agency regulations and curre nt legislative proposals on ch and may be updated as circumstances warrant introduction the secretary of the interior acting through the fish and wildlife service fws and the secretary of commerce acting through the national marine fisheries service nmfs have duties under the endangered species act esa1 to preserve and conserve species including by designating critical habitat ch over several administrations these agencies have asserted that ch design ation affords few benefits for species beyond those provided by listing species as endang ered or threatened and taking actions to avoid jeopardizing species continued existence2 several courts have now held that the regulation and interpre tation underlying this view ar erroneous and do not carry out congressional intent proposal s are currently before cong ress that address ch thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20263crs2 3 this report does not address the conserva tion of plant species listed as threatened or endangered 4 16 usc 1531b 5 16 usc 1531b and c 6 16 usc 15325 this language might have supported direct regulation of lands within critical habitat but has not been so interpreted 7 16 usc 15325a 8 critical habitat is defined at 16 us c 1532 5 and see the definition of conserve at 16 usc 15323 as meaning assisting species in reaching the point when they longer need the protections of the act 9 16 usc 1533b6c 10 16 usc 1533b report3 is written as background for considering both the current legislative proposals and the agencies position the preservation of ecosystems is one of the express purposes of the esa4 and all federal agencies must use their authorities to conserve species and the ecosystems upon which they depend5 the protects habitat in many ways including the definition of prohibited take of listed species the purchase of lands cooperative programs with states consultation on federal ac tions or private actions with federal nexus and issuance of incidental take permits ba sed in part on habita t protection the act also requires the designation of critical habitat which is defined as occupied areas with features that are essential for the conservation of the speci in question and which may require special management considera tions or protection6 unoccupied habitat ssential for conservation of species also may be designated7 habitat necessary for conservation means habitat necessary for the recovery of the species not merely its survival8 designation serves several important expr ess purposes and also informs othe r aspects of habitat protection under the act designation of ch may have fewer conseque nces than many members of the public seem to believe but may have more conseque nces than the fws asserts currently ch must be designated at the time species is listed under the unless designation would not be prudent as when vandals or collectors could harm limited habitat or species or if the ch is not determinable9 the appropriate secretary must designate ch on the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into considera tion the economic nationa l security or other relevant impacts of designating particular area as ch the secretary may exclude an area from designation if the secretary determines that the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of inclusion unle ss the secretary determines base d on the best scientific and commercial data available that the failure to designate the area will result in the extinction of the species concerned10 the designation of ch plays several direct and indirect roles under the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20263crs3 11 16 usc 1533g1c direct roles of critical habitat 1 designation forces consideration of both species needs and the impacts of protection designation of ch requires the secretary to consider what habitat is essential for conservation of the sp ecies and also the economic and other effects of including various lternative habitat areas 2 the designation process prov ides guidance for landowners designation of ch results in publication of guidance to landowners through consideration of the need for possible special management and protection of areas within the ch there appear to be public misperceptions that ch designation results in binding federal restrictions on private lands in fact desi gnation forces federal consideration of all aspects of the habitat needs of species and generates guidance to landowners on avoiding penalties under the act but has not been interpreted as authorizing direct regulation guidance typi cally addre sses activities not likely to be viewed as prohibited takes and activities regarding which landow ner may wish to seek additional guidance to avoid takes 3 designation requires cons ultation on fe deral actions designation of ch primarily affects federa l actions but also private acti ons with federal nexus such as federal approval per mit or funding section 7 of the 16 usc 1536 requires each federal agency to insure that any action authorized funded or carried out by the agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of ch emphasis added if an action is likely to jeopardize species or re sult in destruction or adverse modification of ch the action agency must consult with the fws or nmfs consultation entails study of the likely effects of proposed actions bi ological opinion by th secretary on whether jeopardy or adverse modification is likely to result if the action is carried out and suggestions for reasonable and prudent alterna tives to the harmful aspects of the proposed project in order to avoid jeopa rdy or destruction or advers modification of ch all but few projects have been able to proceed following consultation 4 designation provides an opportunity for judicial review in contrast to other agency studies that may be done designation of ch is statutory duty and the actions and nonactions of the fws or noaa fish eries in this regard can be judicially reviewed11 including the adequacy of agency consideration of the habitat needs of the species the economic and other impacts of signation and possible alternatives for ch configuration indirect effects of crit ical habitat designation the designation of ch may also play seve ral indirect roles in the conservation of species while any habitat studies could rve many of these purposes too designation of ch is required and review able federal duty that must include the elements discussed above it also is currently required to preced other actions that logically rest on the information the designation process garners some of the indirect effects of designation of critical habitat arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20263crs4 12 50 cfr 173 this regulation on harm was upheld against facial challenge in babbitt v sweet home chapter of communities for great oregon 515 us 687 1995 13 see 64 fed reg 318721 the designation process provides information for 10 permits and habitat conservation plans section 10a of the 16 usc 1539a authorizes the otherwise prohibited taking of listed species if the taking is an incidental part of otherwise lawful activities and if the permit applicant submits conservation plan known as habitat conserva tion plan or hcp that minimizes and mitigates the impacts that likely will result from the taking adequate knowledge of the habitat needs of the species in question is crucial to nd underlies the process of hcp development and approval and is critical to achieving adequate hcps 2 the designation process provides information for land acquisition decisions similarly the ch designation process provides information to inform decisions on possible acquisitions of prope rties for habitat prot ection purposes under 5 of the 16 usc 1534 3 critical habitat informs the m eaning of harm in the definition of take at the heart of the are its 9 16 usc 1538 prohibitions against take of endangered species take is defined not only as killing listed species but also as harming species harm is defined in regulation as including significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns including breedin g feeding or sheltering12 therefore significant destruction of habitat in general may trigger penalties as practical matter it seems easier to demonstrate significant habitat modification or degradation if the habitat in question has already been found to be critical to the conservation of the species in question 4 the designation process informs development of recovery plans section 4f of the 16 usc 1533f re quires the preparation of recovery plan for each listed species recovery plans provide guidance on what actions including habitat maintenance and restoration are necessary to rec over species here again the ch designation process can pr ovide scientific know ledge of the habitat needs of species and analysis of effects and impacts that could be crucial to an eff ective recovery plan agency interpretation the fws has asserted that designation of ch provides little additional protection beyond that provided by listing and the prohib ition against jeopardy and that designation consumes significant amounts of fundi ng staff time and other resources13 as result fws has given designation such low priority that the agency had completed ch designations for only 36 of listed species as of august 9 2004 however courts havehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20263crs5 14 see eg conservation council for hawaii v babbitt 24 f supp 2d 1074 1078 d hi 1998 in which the court set deadlines for the fws to designate critical habitat

availabl from those organizati ons including american rivers center for biological diversity natu ral resources defense council national wildlife continuedfound that the agency has duty to designate ch14 and that the regulation15 and interpretation on which the fws conclusions rest are erroneous and unlawful under 7 of the federal agencies mu st avoid jeopardizing species or causing destruction or adverse modifi cation of ch however th fws has conf lated jeopardy and destruction or adverse modification of ch by defining the latter phrase as meaning essentially actions that diminish the value of critical habitat for the survival of the species thereby eliminating designation of habitat for recovery and equating hab itat modification with jeopardy the fifth circuit noted that critical habitat is defined in the as habitat which is essential for the cons ervation of the species i recovery and held that the regulation is facially err oneous and does not comport with the language and legislative history of the esa16 the ninth circuit also has held the regulation to be erroneous and contrary to congressional will as the fifth and tenth circuits have already recognized the regulatory definition reads the recovery goal out of the advers modification inquiry proposed action adversely modi fies critical habitat if nd only if the value of the critical habitat for survival is appreciably diminished17 if ch must include habitat necessary for the recovery of species ch designation and consulta tions under 7 of the act would be more meaningful more recently the agencies have excluded areas from designation on the grounds that the areas do not need special management or protection because other habitat management plans or agreements are in effect as result the agencies assert the areas do not meet the definition of ch or design ation is not prudent in light of the non federal efforts or that the benefits of ex clusion outweigh the bene fits of designation because excluding ch would courage the nonfederal efforts18 critics have asserted that often the alternativ nonfederal management re lied upon in reaching these conclusions in some instances is not firm program is too uncertain as to timetables and effects and is unenforceable therefore they also assert failure to designate ch in these circumstances does not comport with the law19

108th congress concerns over national security after september 11 2001 resulted in amendments to the regarding designation of ch one change requires the consideration of impacts on national security during the signation process another precludes designating ch on any lands or other geog raphical areas owned or controlled by the department of defense or designated for its use that are subject to an integrated natural resources management plan prepared unde r 16 usc 670a if the secretary determines in writing that such plan provides benefit to the species20 arguably low threshold to meet legislation in the 109th congress in the 109th congress hr 1299 would change the definition of ch to be areas determined by field studies to be occupi ed and used for essential behaviors plus additional habitat necessary for the survival as opposed to recovery of the species the bill would move the time for designation of ch to the earlier of either three years after listing or one year after approval of rec overy plan and would pr eclude ch designation for any action authorized by 10 incidental take permit 7 incidental take statement the equivalent of 10 pe rmit or under state or fede ral land conservation or species management program that the secretary termines provides subs tantially equivalent protection this last provision appears likel to eliminate ch designations on federal lands such as national forests and the lands managed by blm which have comprehensive land management plans and programs thereby eliminating the current focus on designating ch on federal lands in order to minimize ch on private lands and eliminating consultation with the wildlife agen cies on proposed agency actions the bill also would expand consideration of economic costs and benefits to governments and landowners and require the secretary to designate ch to the maximum extent practicable in addition to the current sta ndard of prudent and determinable this change could result in fewer ch designations
