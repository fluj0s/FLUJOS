consolidation of the foreign affairs agencies as reported th legislation included somewhat different reorganization plan crafted largely b house international relations committee chairman gilman than proposed by th president during floor debate the house rejected an amendment by congressman hamilton that would have provided fewer requirements and greater presidentia l flexibility than the gilman plan prior to final passage and in the face of possibl veto the house approved compromise reorgani zation language worked out between congressmen gilman and hamilton that was acceptable to the administration the senate foreign relations committee marked up and ordered reported it s version of the foreign relations authorization act s 903 on june 13 producing consolidation plan that also diverged in several key ways from the president s initiative provisions that would move more of usaid into t he state department and require the budget for development assistance programs to pass through the secretary of state were elements especially opposed by the admin istration senate floor debate on s 903 produced signi ficant changes to the committeeendorsed consolidation plan house and senate conferees met in late july to work ut differences between the bills but did not come to final agreement mainly because of contention s disagreement over an international family planning provision in the house version of the bill without further moveme nt on hr 1757 efforts were made near the end of the first session to attach modified agency consolidation authority to othe r

late 1996 many close foreign policy observers had anticipated whit house initiative to consolidate us foreign affairs agencies although th administration rejected congressional proposals in 1995 to reorganize thes bureaucracies key executive officials primarily in the state department continued to believe that the merger f acda usia and usaid with the department would make for more coher ent us foreign policy decisionmaking and make better use of scarce resources moreover many believed that in the absence of white hous plan congress would once again target the foreign policy age ncies for reorganization possibly in ways that even consolida tion proponents within the administration would oppose some argued that in order to protect presidential prerogatives to structure the executive branch the white house should construct plan in advance f proposals that might emerge early in the 105th congress indication that agency consolidation issues were under consideration cam during the january 8 1997 confirmation hearing of secretary of statenomine madeleine albright in response to several questions she told the senate foreig n relations committee how important it is for us to have an effective and efficient foreign policy mechanism the secretarydesignate stated that she had an ope n mind on the q uestion of consolidation and pledged to discuss the issue further with the committee in the ensuing weeks however the reorganization issue reportedly becam embedded in broader agenda of state department and white house nationa l security priorities that required

was the view of many close congressional and white house observers that if the presiden t expected congress to consider his priority proposals especially cwc th administration must be prepared to work with lawmakers on advancing ke congressional issues such as reform submission of certain arms control treaties to the senate and foreign affairs agency consolidation labeled as coincidence movement on

consolidation debate in the 104th congress throughout 1995 and into 1996 both the administration and congres s considered options to reorganize the structure of us government foreign polic agencies at issue was how best to tighten the foreign policy budget whil maximizing the effectiveness of interagency coordination in working towar d common foreign policy goals in an everchanging postcold war world critics of us foreign policy management practices charged that these agencies at time s maintained conflicting agendas housed duplicative functions and bureaus and often did not give proper emphasis to national pr iorities such as promoting us economic trade and economic interests abroad after the white house rejected the outlines of state department plan t consolid ate the agencies proposal strongly opposed by usaid acda an d usia senate foreign relations committee chairman helms announced his own initiative on march 15 1995 the original helms plan would have eliminated l three

ated under secretary positions had already passed on june 8 1995 ultimately house and senate n egotiators agreed on plan to abolish one agency to be selected by the president but widely assumed to be acda the president also had to certi fy 1 that his own foreign policy consolidation plans would save 1 7 billion over four years and 2 that the preservation of the remaining two agencie s was important to us national interests president clinton however vetoed the bill hr 1561 in early april 1996 for number of reasons including agenc consolidation requirements that he s aid jeopardized the presidents ability to manage his own executive agencies the house could not override the veto and the issue did not resurface in the 104th congress role of congress in agency consolidation procedural issues at the outset of the white house initiative to consolidate the agencies it wa s clear that congress w ould have some degree of influence over the shape of the plan as well s the power to approve or reject it with several options available t ohttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97538crs5 congress and the executive branch in the approval and implementation procedure for agency reorganizations it was unclear exactly how the process would unfold because the plan included the creation of new state department positions such s under secretaries for arms control and international security and for publi c diplomacy at minimum congress must amend the state department basi c authori ties act pl 84885 as amended to enact these and other organizationa l changes for the broader details of reorganization several scen arios and options were available to the president and lawmakers congressional consideration under presidential reorganizatio n authority an early ption preferred by the white house was the reinstatement of currently dormant presidential authority to reorganize the ex ecutive branch although such authority ultimately requires congress to approve the presidents plan i t provides for far less direct congressional involvement than through the norma l legislative process with the ob jective of achieving greater efficiency in government congress since the 1930s has granted the chief executive authority to issu executive orders and since 1939 plans proposing reorganizations within th executive branch this authority has been issued for temporary periods of time and renewed by congress periodically the most recent reorganization authority expired in 1984 an d presidents reagan bush and clinton did not ask for its reinstatement at the time of its expiration in 1984 the reorganization authority see 5 usc 901912 provided tha t once the president submitted his plan congress must adopt joint resolution within 90 calendar days of continuous session for it to becom effective although the president could modify his own proposal within the first 60 calendar days of continuous session after its submission congress could not amend the chief executives plan lawmakers could only vote up or down on th recommendation one potential problem with this approach was that it largely took the issue out of the hands of the most active proponents fo r consolidation in the 104th congress under the statute that expired in 198 4 such reorganization plans were not referred to the committees of policy jurisdiction in this case the hous international relations and senate foreign relations co mmittees but to the house government reform and oversight and senate governmental affairs panels implementation through normal legislative process without reor ganization authority the proposed foreign affairs agency consolidation would proceed through normal legislative process in recent years the departments of energy education and veterans affairs were created in this fashion under one possible scenario that appeared plausible in may 1997 following the administrations 120day review process the president would draft the necessary legislation to implement the reorganizatio n and submit it to congress for considera tion probably in september or october 1997 congress could th choose to deal with the legislative proposal as either separate bill or incorporate it into omnibus foreign policy legislation as it did in the 104t h congress hr 1561 timing for the latter option ho wever was awkward since the house and senate foreign relations committees were about to act on omnibus foreig n affairs authorization bills action that would come well in advance of the anticipated submission by the president of his formal planhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97538crs6 the

omnibus consolidated and emergency supplementa l appropriations act of 1999 pl 105277 combines elements of both approaches outlined above the statute grants the president authority to draft and submit t congress by december 20 1998 foreign affairs reorganization plan at the same time pl 105277 legi slates certain mandatory elements that must be contained in presidential plan including the abolishment of acda usia and idca and th e1 streamlining of usaid once submitted the president may amend his plan at an time prior to its effective date for acda idca and usaid the required steps must take place by april 1 1999 while usia must be abolished and consolidated by octobe r 1 1999 the authority does not require co ngress to vote on the proposal prior to its implementation but should lawmakers attempt to reject or make significan t modifications to the presidents plan through regular legislation they would most likely have to overcome veto mandatory elements of congressional plans although legislation approved by both the house and senate permitted th president to shape much of the reorganiz ation proposal according to plans developed by executive branch working groups lawmakers established series of items th at must be included in any consolidation scheme drafted and submitted to congress by th president several of the senatepassed mandatory reorganization elements closely followed the house plan but with the addition of few key directives especially those affecting us international broadcasting activities and usaid the revise d reorganization act passed by

for us foreign policy one of the primary goals of reorganizing the foreign policy agencies is to eliminat duplication frequent source of criticism from congress currently each agenc maintains parallel duplicative operations such as legislative affairs administrativ bureaus and press offices additionally some agencies have similarly structure d regional or functional bureaus by eliminating the duplication it is argued mor effectiv streamlined us foreign policy mechanism would result eliminatin g duplication and mer ging similar functions into one agency also would likely improve the coordination among foreign policy regional and functional bureaus thereb improving the efficiency in us decision making and response to world events budget savings was primary force driving foreign policy agency consolidation during the 104th co ngress the congressional budget office had estimated that 3 billion could be saved over fiveyear period with the congressional reorganizin g proposal the administration asserted t hat the vice presidents national performance review npr initiative would save as much whil keeping the agencies independent while budget savings are expected to eventually result from reorganization f agencies the clinton administration did not expect savings to be significant in the ea rly years of plan implementation some in the executive branch claimed that budget saving s were not viewed as the top priority in implementing the white house plan reorganizin g to achieve more effective foreign policy apparatus was the key objec tive they stated merging most foreign policy activities under the state department was expected to give the secretary access to wider array of foreign policy tools such as internationa l broadcasting economic

of state albright sent memorandum to all employees f3 acda state usia and usaid stating that as first step in the reorganization process under secreta ries and assistant secretaries would take on greater responsibility in an effort to decentralize the demands of the secretary of statebe more transpar ent after reorganization the secretary would be able to respond more quickly to moving resources and skilled staff to posts where most needed further consolida ting agencies would reduce the number of voices simplify the message advising the president on any given issue allowing the president to determine and bette r execute foreign policy that is in americas best interest some fo reign policy experts however were concerned that the reorganization of the foreign policy agencies into the department of state would further encumber an agency already burdened with too many layers of management and where too many decisions end up on the secretarys desk integrating the acda and usia woul d further hamper the conduct of foreign policy they argued because the secretary of state would have too many issues to manage also many who follow specific foreign policy activities such as international broadcasting international exchange programs and foreign aid were concerned that those functions would become less efficiently and effectively managed because politicalmilitaryfocused managers would be makin g decisions about priorities resou rce distribution and program funding to some this raised the question of whether the programs would be able to maintain the level f credibility they currently enjoy t hey wondered whether the state department could be reformed adequately and quickly enough to administer the many new program s merged into it3 few issues were not addressed in the administrations reorganizati on plan for example the state departments role in coordination of us government agencie s that admini ster trade and economic issues international exchange programs that are managed by us government agencies outside of the foreign policy agencies an d refugee issues were not raised implications for agencies and their functions arguments for reorganizing the foreign policy bureaucracy ffer from seeming contradiction on the one hand the state department is heavily criticized fo r management wea knesses on the other hand reorganization proposals would likely require the department and the secretary to deal with wide span of control an d additional responsibilitie s nevertheless many believe that state department reform would only

particul arly in the foreign service 5 an archaic information system that is t compatible wi th those at acda usia or usaid and 6 lack of coordination in regional and functional bureaus that undermines consistent policy direction many on bot h sides of the consolidation issue agree that the department s suffered from weak management and has been unable to divest itself of cold wa r operational standards and adopt revised set of mission priorities while the state department has made some foreign policy downsizing efforts in response to recent budgetary pressures the changes have been mostly quantitative with little noticeable change in states policy or management structure and according to the genera l accounting office gao it has strategy for future downsizing efforts4 on their face many of these views of state department ma nagement deficiencies appear to weigh against merging other agencies with the department critics of mergin g other agencies into the department have argue that wellfunctioning organization s should not be moved into what they view as dysfunctional agency that only after the state department fully implements reforms and integrates new policy prioritie s should the idea of super state department be given serious consideration proponents of consolida tion however countered that the goals of reducing the duplication of functions and achieving better policy coordination can only be achieved by merging currently independent agencies with the state department and bringing their missions more directly under the authority of the secretary of state they asserte d that the continuing independence of key foreign affairs agencies contributes to th fractured decision making process and weakens the position of the secretary of state and ambassadors around the world supporters also contended that managemen t reforms within the state department would be pursued in conjunc tion with the agency consolidation and would be

administrations proposal are lacking integrating acda and usia into state will expand the agency horizontally increasing the number f bureaus and under secretaries new bureau for arms control and international securit covering acdas activities and new bureau for public diplomacy covering usia s operations would be established states regional and functional bureaus would remain but would need better mechanisms for coordinating their activities within state and with usaid thus the secretary of state it is argued would acquire the ability to coordinate to establ ish accountability and to have direct access to officials working on all aspects of foreign policy although consolid ating agencies is expected to result in some positions being eliminated reductions in force rifs at the

us interests and democratic values around the wo rld supporters of the reorganizatio n proposal believe that putting internationa l broadcasting in the state departmen t would strengthen the li nk between these activities and us foreign polic objectives numb er of concerns were raised regarding proposals to integrate the us information agency into the departmen t of state one issue addressed wa s usias mandate required by the smithmundt act of 19 48 and zorinsky amendment that bar the usia from operating domestically and propagandizing us audiences on grounds t hat such activities might influence local politics about 80 percent f usias employees come under this law this restriction is in conflict with man department of state activities sta tes activities currently involve providing domestic press and audiences with foreign policy information as well as sponsoring forums and town meetings on behalf of the state department pl 105277 addressed this issue by establishing new under secretary for publi c diplomacy fur thermore the act includes language which would continue to apply smithmundt and zorinsky laws to usia programs after consolidated into state another concern was whether international broadcastings credibility wi th foreign publics in promoting democracy and the us perspective would be weakened if it wer administered by the state departmen t some question whether the selection of news stories to be aired and editing of reports would be affected by ongoing state departmen t activities such as the secretarys travel plans to particular region imminent trade agreements or us government actions to gain cooperation from foreign government some observers believe state department management of us internationa l broadcasting could invite foreign governments to blame the secretary of state for airin g broadcasts viewed by them to be unfavorable the act addressed broadcasting credibility by establishing the broadcasting broa d of governors as an independent entity within the ex ecutive branch effective october 1 1999 the bbg is required to report to congre ss by march 1 each year on radiost free europeradio liberty privatization efforts as

eclining for several years its fy 1999 appropriation is 415 million comparable to the level enacted in f 1998exchanges in building relationships could be compromised if res ources that might have been devoted to exchanges get diverted to shorterterm crises furthermore many nongovernment organizations ngos support international exchange activities of the us government ngos may not have the trust or be as we lcome at state as they were by usia some fear pl 105277 did not specifically address this concern another issue that needed to be addressed was the differing communication system s and operations of each agency since usias mission is to provide information i t maintains an open information system available to foreign publics the stat department on the other hand keeps secure com munication system some experts claimed that keeping both public and secure aspects within one computer system woul d weaken the secure part two separate computer systems may be necessary if th agencies are fully integrated responding to the view t hat consolidation would reduce expensive duplication usia had already agreed that consolidating travel off ices security systems personnel support and overseas warehouses with state would make sense however usi asserted it has already undergone more than any other foreign policy agency massiv restructuring and streamlining effort

nuclear weapons strengthening the nuclear non proliferation treaty and its safeguards ratifying and imp lementing the comprehensive test ban treaty implementing the chemical weapons convention enhancin g compliance with the biological weapons convention and negotiating global ban on antipersonnel land mines 6 many of the concerns raised over acdas integration into the department of state likely have been mitigated however first the current head of acda also serves as the acting under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs closer integration of arms control objectives with other foreign policy an d national security priorities has been underway for some time in addit ion the transition likely will be relatively smooth second the administration remains committed t retaining acdas technical and policy expertise as well as its verification com pliance and legal functions reorganization critics were alarmed at the prospect of losing such capabilities widely seen as indispensable to effective arms control to larger state department culture that did not favor such expertise httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97538crs16 established in 1961 the

that initially there will be very little change in the way the agency operates and how it implements us developme nt assistance policy at present only usaids press office i s slated to be consolidated with state although the white house says that stat and usaid will xplore further options for coordinating or merging othe r administrative and program services usaid currently exists under th authority of executive order 12163 administration of foreign assistance an d related functions and throug h international dev elopment cooperation agency idca delegation of autho rity 1 of october 1 1979 idca wa s created in 1979 as small agency intended t serve as the overall coordinator of us development aid policies and programs usaid which had been established in 1961 within the state department continued in existence after 1979 within idca i n practical terms however idca f unctioned to very limited extent after the idca director appointed by president carter ft in 1981 one has been named to fill the position instead usaid administrators have served in dual capacities as agency hea d and acting idca director the presidents consolidation plan called for abolishing idca but reconstituting usaid as an independent agency although usaid has remained independent of the state dep artment since 1979 the two have maintained somewhat ambiguous association with the usai d administrator always operating unde r the foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state in practice it appears that usaids relationship with the state department both in washington and in the field has rested less on org anizational lines of authority than on informal personal relati onships between the secretary and the administrator their chief deputies in charge of regional and functional bureaus and us ambassadors and usaid mission direc tors posted around the world most observers believe that having usaid fall under the direct authority of the secretary of state will have little or effect on how the agencies interact and that coordination will continue to be driven more by the personal relationships of s enior officials what remains to be seen is whether th white house proposes to continue usaid as an independent agency through law as usaid anticipates or through delegation of authority by way of the secretary of state during 199596 usaid and its administrator brian atwood vigorously oppose d merging the agency into the state department based largely on two grounds the uniqu nature of usaids mission as developme nt agency and the achievements of agency managem ent reforms since 1994 that have not been matched by state departmen thttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97538crs17 administrative improvements in defending their position usaid officials hav emphasiz ed the different nature of missions and problems dealt with by the stat departme nt and usaid state more often focuses on resolving shortterm crise s through diplomacy and political governmenttogovernment relations while usaid in pursuing its development strategies requires longterm sustained ef fort to achieve results that might be compromised by s tate department needs to divert resources for crisis management usaid officials have further noted that for nearly three years the agency has been heavily engaged in organizational reforms and participating as n experimental laboratory in the vice presidents national performance review usaid has closed 26 overseas aid missions terminated relations with governments that were uncooperative development partners and attempted to create results oriented accountability system against which the agency and congress can measure results while still defending usaids position as an independent agency during the mor recent round of interagency negotiations over consolidation plans administrato r atwood reportedly arg ued that whatever the outcome on the merger question three elements of usaid operations must be protected 1 usaid must contin ue to receive its development assistance funding directly and control its own budget rather than havin g the appropriations passed through the state d epartment 2 usaid procurement and other administrative systems must continue for aid projects instead of using states processes and 3 the statu re of the senior official heading us aid programs and the development aid mission itself whether it be within or outside the state department must not be downgraded based on the consoli dation outlines released thus far by the white house it appears that not only will usaid remain independent but that administrator atwoods three requirements have been accommodated nevertheless the outcome of the administrations final plan and the requirement enacted in pl 105 277 for development aid f unding to be allocated to the secretary of state could alter the prelim inary arrangements reached in early 1997 regarding usaids relationship with the state department according to current plans there will be only one minor change for usaid durin g the initial stage of the consolidation proposal some portions of its small press office of about 10 staff with an annual budget of ro ughly 670000 will merge with states press bureau but in subsequent phases of the reorganization the white house says that other issues will be considered that could possibly have more significant impact on usaid programs and operations among the most important issues for future consideration would be efforts to better coordinate usaid and state department regiona l and functional bureaus the creation in 1993 of states global affairs bureau unit that oversees the department s policy formulation of among other things int ernational environment population and democracy building issues established parallel and somewhat overlappi ng office with usaids global bureau the usaid global unit sets aid po licy on these same issues and administer s large amounts development assistance resources reportedly there have been continuing disagreements between state and usaid on policy pri oritization and aid funding allocations especially in the areas of the environment and population whether to consolidate and where to locate state department s refugee and usaidshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97538crs18 usaid contends that transfer of refugee programs from state to its own office of foreign7 disaster assistance would result in staff reduction of 25 and savings of about 20 million similar arguments could be made for shifting usaids disaster office to states refuge bureaudisaster offices has also been an issue in the past on regional issues usai d7 administers us aid programs in eastern europe and the former soviet union but special advisor to the secretary of state plays the lead role in policy formulation and exercises extensive guidance for i mplementing aid programs in the region these are some of the most likely areas administration officials may examine over the next year in search of further ways to eliminate duplication between the two agencies the reorganizatio n text in hr 1757 as passed by the house was generally in line with the white houses april proposal for usaid the bill abolished idc immediately and permitted the president to determine how idca responsibilities woul d be redelegated consistent with white house intentions the legislation required usai d to transfer its press office and certain unspecifie d administrative functions to the state department and come under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state bipartisan agreement on the final r eorganization provision in hr 1757 came after an earlier contentious debate over text that appear ed to move usaid more closely under control of the state department as introduced hr 175 7 transferred idca functions directly to the secretary of state and moved several other usaid functions including nonspecialized procurement travel and transportation facilities management nd security operations to the state department the house early in the debate of hr 1757 had defeated 202224 an amendment b representative hamilton to remove these and other reorganization provi sions opposed by the administration later in the debate however the house under gilmanhamilton bipartisan agreement revised the usaid provisions accommodating administration concerns unlike the house provision nd the white house plan legislation passed by the senate placed the state department in much more direct control of usaid polic making funding allocation decisions and personnel management specifically th bill transferred idca functions to the secretary of state except for those relating to the overseas private investment corp oration which remained with usaid allocated aid funds previously apportio ned to idca to the secretary of state required the reorganization of usaid to occur lat er than october 1 1998 one year earlier than planned by the administration transfered to the state department

government agencies required usaid to detail its personnel upon request on nonreimbursable basis to the department of state the revised reorganization legislation that passed congress on octo ber 21

would trans fer to the state department while the secretary of state would still coordinate us economic assistance policy as the senat recommended the secretary would approve but not design overall
