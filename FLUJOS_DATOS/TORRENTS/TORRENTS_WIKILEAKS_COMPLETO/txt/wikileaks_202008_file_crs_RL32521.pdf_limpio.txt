agricultural targets agroterrorism is increasingly recognized as national secur ity threat especially after the events of september 11 2001 agroterrorism is subset of bioterrorism and is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease with the goal of generating fear causing economic losses andor undermining social stability the goal of agroterrorism is not to kill cows or plants these are the means to the end of causing economic damage so cial unrest and loss of confidence in government human health could be at ri sk if contaminated food reaches the table or if an animal pathogen is transmissible to humans zoonotic while agriculture may not be terrorists first choice because it lacks the shock factor of more traditional terrorist targets many analysts consider it viable secondary target agriculture has several characteristics that pose unique vulnerabilities farms are geographically disbursed in unsecured environments livestock are frequently concentrated in confined locations and transported or commingled with other herds many agricultural diseases can be obt ained handled and distributed easily international trade in food pr oducts often is tied to dis easefree status which could be jeopardized by an attack many veterinarians lack experience with foreign animal diseases that are er adicated domestically but remain endemic in foreign countries in the past five years food defense has received increasing attention in the counterterrorism and bioterrorism comm unities laboratory and response capacity are being upgraded to addre ss the reality of agroterror ism and national response plans now incorporate agroterrorism congress has held hearings on agroterrorism and enacted laws and appropriations with agroterrorismrelated provisions the

terrorism overview of agroterrorism the potential for terrorist attacks agains t agricultural targets agroterrorism is increasingly recognized as national secur ity threat especially after the events of september 11 2001 in this context agro terrorism is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease w ith the goal of generating fear over the safety of food causing econo mic losses andor undermining social stability the response to the threat of agroterrorism has come to be called food defense1 an agroterrorist event would usually i nvolve bioterrorism since likely vectors include pathogens such as viruses b acteria or fungi people more generally associate bioterrorism with outbreaks of human illness eg anthrax or smallpox rather than diseases affecting animals or plants the goal of agroterrorism is not killing cows or plants these are the means to the end of causing economic crises in th agricultural and food industries social unrest and loss of confidence in government human health could be at risk through contaminated food or if an animal pathogen is transmissible to humans zoonotic while agriculture may not be terrorists first choice because it lacks the shock factor of more traditional terrorist targets an increasing number of terrorism analysts consider it viable secondary target2 agroterrorism could be lowcost but highly effective means toward an alqaeda goal of destroying the united states economy evidence that agriculture and food are potential qaeda targets came in 2002 when terrorist hideouts in afghanis tan were found containing agricultural documents and manuals desc ribing ways to make animal and plant poisons3 agriculture has several character istics that pose unique problemshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32521crs2 4 may 2005

geographically disbursed in unsecured environments eg open fields and pastures throughout the countryside while some livestock are housed in facilities that can be secured agriculture generally requires large expanses of land that are difficult to secure livestock frequently are concentrat ed in confined locations eg feedlots with thousands of cattle in openair pens farms with tens of thousands of pigs or barns with hundreds of thousands of poultry allowing diseases to infect more animals quickly concentration in slaughter processing also makes large scale contamination possible the number of lethal and contagious biological agents is greater for plants and animals than for humans most of these diseases are environmentally resilie nt endemic in fore ign countries and not harmful to humans making it eas ier for terrorists to acquire handle and deploy the pathogens live animals grain and proce ssed food products are routinely transported and commingled in the production and processing system these factors circumvent natural barriers that could slow pathogenic dissemination international trade in livestock grains and food products is often tied to diseasefree status the presence or rumor4 of certain pests or diseases in country can qui ckly stop exports of commodity cause domestic consumption to drop disrupt commodities markets and can take months or years to recover the past success of keeping many diseases out of the us means that many veterinarians and scientists lack direct experience with foreign diseases this may delay recognition of symptoms in case of an outbreak and the ability to respond to an outbreak thus the general susceptibility of the agriculture and food industry to bioterrorism is difficult to address in systematic way due to the geographically dispersed yet industrially concentrated na ture of the industry and the inherent biology of growing plants and raising animals in an attack the agricultural sector would suffer economically from plant and animal health losses and the supply of f ood and fiber may be reduced the demand for foods targeted in an attack may dec line eg dairy beef pork poultry grains fruit or vegetables while dema nd for substitute foods may rise economic losses would accrue to indivi duals businesses and governments through costs to contain and eradicate the disease and to dis pose of contaminatedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32521crs3 5 agricultural inputs as defined in 49 cfr 1718 are included in the security plans required in 49 cfr 172800 6 security issues and guidelines fo r

to the currentlyheld notion of food security could affect our social order fear of food shortages m oved further from american psyche as the united states from an agra rian society to the industrial and information age nevertheless food remains an important element of ever yones daily routine and is necessary for survival scope of this report this report addresses th use of biological weapons against agriculture rather than terrorist s using agricultural inputs or equipment in attacks against nonagricultural targets for example the department of transportation issued regulati ons for developing security plans to protect dangerous agricultural materials such as fuels chemicals and fertilizers against theft5 legislation pr oposed in 20052006 hr 3197 hr 1389 and s 1141 109th congress would have restrict ed the handling of ammonium nitrate an agricultural fertilizer that can be converted into an ex plosive another ex ample is the concern over misuse of small aircra ft particularly cropdusters to spread biological weapons6 this report focuses primarily on biolog ical weapons rather than chemical weapons because biological weapons gene rally are considered the more potent agroterrorism threat this report also focuses more on agricultural production than food processing and distribution although the later is discussed for more on chemical and biolog ical weapons see crs

background on chemical biological and toxin weapons and options for lessening their impact by dana shea federal recognition of agroterrorism even before september 11 2001 and the fo cus on terrorist threats that ensued references to agroterrorism andor agricultural bioweapons can be found in the government academia and the press for example the gilmore commission on terrorism in its first report to congress in 1999 noted that biological attack against an agricu ltural target offers terrorists virtually riskfree form of assault which has high probability of success and which also has the

awareness of agroterrorism with hearing of the senate co mmittee on armed services in 19998 however as the 20th century ended agriculture and food production received less attention or some times was overlooked in fede ral counterterrorism and homeland security activities presiden tial directive in 1998 on protecting critical infrastructure did not include agriculture and food agricultu re was added to this list only in december 2003 thus after what many observers claim to be slow start after september 11 2001 agriculture now is garnering more attention in the expanding field of terrorism studies and policies agroterrorism received heightened na tional attention in december 2004 when thensecretary of health and human rvices tommy thompson said in his resignation speech for the life of

implement ed laws and appropriations with provisions important to agriculture the government account ability office gao has studied aspects of food safety border inspections interagency coordination and physical security with respect to agroterrorism the executive branch has responded by implementing the new laws issuing several presidential directives creating terrorism and agroterrorism task

service tourism can be affected of access to certain destinations within the country is limited or perceptions of food or personal safety falter fourth federal and state governme nts could bear significant costs including eradication and containment costs and compensation to producers for destroyed animals depending on the erosion of consumer confidence and export sales market prices of the affected commodities may drop this would affect producers whose herds or crops were not dir ectly infected making the event national in scale even if the disease itself were contained to small region for food types or product lines that ar not contaminated however demand may become stronger and market prices could rise for those products such goods may include substitutes for the food that was the target of the attack eg chicken instead of beef or product that can be certified to originate fro m outside contaminated area eg beef from another region of the country or imported beef for example

december 2003 us beef prices fell but less dramatically than in canada19 consumer confidence in government may also be tested depending on the scale of the eradication effort and means of stroying animals or crops the need to slaughter perhaps hundreds of thousands of cattle or tens of millions of poultry could generate public critic ism if depopulation methods are considered inhumane or the destruction of carcases is questioned environmentally for example during the united kingdoms footandmouth fmd outbreak in 2001 euthanizing thousands of cattle and incinerating the carcasses in huge open air pyres provided poignant television images and difficult public relations situations for the agriculture ministry dealing with these concerns can add to the cost for both government and industry depending on the disease and means of transmission the potential for economic damage depends on number of factors such as the disease agent location of the attack rate of transmission geographical dispersion how long it remains undetected availability of countermeasures or quarantines and incident response plans potential costs are difficult to estimate and can vary widely based on compounding assumptions drawing on the fmd outbreak in the united kingdom in 2001 price waterhouse coopers estima ted that the economic impact was 1389 to 4477 for each of the 26 million head of livestock cattle sheep nd hogs on which indemnities were paid in the uk th impacts exceed the value of the animals because of the number of industries affected by the outbreak ranging from feed suppliers to tourism applying the loss ratios from the uk incident to the larger us livestock industry price waterhous coopers estimates that 75 million animals 53 million cattle 14 million hogs and 800000 sheep might be destroyed in similar scale outbreak in the united stat the resulting economic impact could range from 104 billion to 336 billion using the range of impacts estimated from the

agriculture usda on african swine fever suggested that if the disease were to become entrenched in the us the 10 year impact would be at least 54 billion23 the impact in todays dollars could be much higher however not all assessments agree that the economic consequences of an agroterrorist attack would be large and widespread december 2004 report by the congressional budget office cbo concl udes that the nations economic loss from an agroterrorist attack would probably be small primarily b ecause the food and agriculture industry is well adapted to the prospect of disrup tions from weather pests and occasional health incidents24 the cbo report also suggests that the food industrys experience recalling contaminated lots and the existence of commodity support programs to sustain the incomes of some agricultural producers might keep economic losses within the realm of industry experience and current public plans for detection and response25 such conclusion likely overstates the capacity of traditional farm commodity programs to respond to the scale devasta tion possible in agroterrorism the purpose of farm commodity programs is to suppor t farm income when prices and production vary within normal yeartoyear cycles they were never envisioned to compensate for losses due to agroterrorism or even widespread pest and disease outbreaks the federal farm commodity support prog rams subsidize about 25 agricultural commodities such as corn wheat soybean s rice and cotton these supported commodities represent about onethird of gr oss farm sales the list of commodities that normally do not receive direct support includes meats poultry fruits vegetables nuts and nursery products thes nonsupported commodities account for about twothirds of gross farm

were to be trained to perform inspections in all three areas equa lly without specialization customs immigration and agriculture however due to criticism from usda inspection unions and the agricultural industry dhs cr eated another class of inspectors called agriculture specialists agriculture specia lists work mainly in secondary inspection stations in passenger terminals and are deployed at cargo terminals the cadre of agriculture specialists incl ude former aphis inspectors who decided not to convert to cbp generalist inspectors plus new graduates from the agricultural specialist training program before dhs was created aphis trained its inspectors in nineweek course that had science prerequisites the initial dhs crosstrai ning program announced in 2003 had only 1216

receive two weeks of law enforcement training and can exercise law enforcement authority similar to regular cbp officers however cbp does not necessarily allow agriculture specialists to use the full extent of their law enforcement powers41 the first class of agriculture specialists graduated in july 2004 regular cbp officers receive about 1216 hours of agricultural training during their multiweek program at the federal law enforcement training center fletc in georgia the agriculture module was developed by aphis and provided to dhs although dhs is training new agriculture specialists the

in an agroterrorist attack of the hundreds of animal and plant pa thogens and pests available to an agroterrorist perhaps fewer than coupl of dozen represent significant economic threats determinants of this level of threat are the agents contagiousness and potential for rapid spread and its international status as reportable pest or disease ie subject to internati onal quarantine under rules of the world organization for animal health also commonly known as th oie the office international des epizooties74 widely accepted view among scientists is that livestock are more susceptible to agroterrorism than cultivated plants much of this has to do with the success of efforts to systematically eliminate animals diseases from us herds which leaves current herds either unvaccinated or relatively unmonitored for such diseases by farmers and some local veterinarians once infected livestock can often act as the vector for continuing to transmit the di sease facilitating an outbreaks spread especially when live animals are transpor ted certain animal diseases may be more attractive to terrorists because they can be zoonotic or transmissible to humans75 in contrast number of plant pathogens c ontinue to exist in small areas of the us and continue to infect limited areas of plants each year making outbreaks and control efforts more routine moreover plant pathogens generally are more difficult to manipulate from technical perspective some plant pathogen s require particular environmental conditions of humidity temperature or wi nd to take hold or spread other plant diseases

plants animals and their products every link in the agricultural production ch ain is susceptible to attack with biological weapon traditionally the first defense against foreign animal or plant disease has been to try to keep it out of th country agricultural inspectors at foreign preclearance inspections and at the us borders are the first line of defense82 smuggling interdiction efforts can act as deterrents before biological agents reachtheir target dhs and usda already conduct such in spection and quarantine practices but continued oversight is necessary to determine which preparedness activities and threats need more attention offshore activities include preclearance inspection by aphis of us imports before products leave their port of origin aphis has personnel in at

rity the use of preventive security measures against pathogens on farm s biosecurity includes farm management practices that both protect animals and crops from the introduction of infectious agents and contain disease to prevent its rapid spread within herd or to other farms biosecurity practices include structural enclosures to limit outside exposure to people and wild animals and the cleani ng and disinfection of people clothing vehicles equipment and supplies entering the farm usda promotes such practices for poultry in program called biosecurity for the birds83 most farm specialists agree that livestock farmers are increasingly aware of the importance of biosecurity measures pa rticularly since the fmd outbreaks in european cattle and the avian flu and exo tic newcastle infections in us poultry more farm operators are restri cting visitors or requiring them to wear boot covers or other protective clothing to guard against bringing in disease regardless of the reason for following biosecurity measures terrorism or accidents these precautions help prepare farms against diseases detection and response in the fy2004 consolidated appropriati ons act pl 108199 the conference

damage is proportional to the time it takes to first detect the disease if foreign disease is intr oduced responsibility for recognizing initial symptoms rests with farmers producers veterinarians plant pathologists and entomologists but farmers sometimes are reluctant to voluntarily test crops or livestock for fear of economic loss or pr ofessional stature cooperative extension service agents at state uni versities are receiving additi onal training on recognizing the likely symptoms of an agroterrorism attack effective detection depends on heightened sense of awareness and on the ability to rapidly determine the level of threat eg developing and deploying rapid disease diagnostic tools lessons fro m disease outbreaks including the 2001fmd outbreaks in europe and 200306 spread of h5n1 avian flu globally show that the speed of detection diagnosis and control spell the difference between an isolated incident and an economic nd public health disaster the capacity to respond however is not alwa ys as strong as desired in recent years the number of veterinarians with experience to recognize many foreign animal diseases has declined success in eradi cating many animal diseases in the united states has reduced the opportunity for ne w veterinarians to see such diseases also the number of large animal veterinarians in private practice and within aphis has declined the american veterinary medical association predicts that 7 of usda positions for large anima l veterinarians may go unfilled and 45 of such positions nationwide86 in light of this trend aphi s has initiated

outbreak the costlier and more drastic the control measures become officials gained valuable experience from recent agricultural disease out breaks such as avian influenza in the us canada and asia89 fmd in the uk and citrus canker in florida each one of these epidemics has required the depopulation and destruc tion of livestock and crops in quarantine areas indemnity payments to farmers and immediate suspension of international trade of all lines of defense mass eradication is the most politically sensitive and difficult actions taken in each of these outbreaks have met with varying degrees of resistance from groups opposed to mass slau ghter of animals citizens concerned about environmental impacts of destroying carcases or from farmers who fear the loss of their livelihood during the 2001 outbreak of fmd in the united kingdom the public was clearly opposed to the large pyres of burning carcasses the disposal of millions of chicken car casses in british columbia canada during 2004 also caused significant public debate thus scientific alternatives are needed for mass slaughter and carcass disposal90 judicial roadblocks also can interfere with eradication and control

agroterrorism legislation increasing the level of terrorism prep aredness remains concern not only for agroterrorism but also for other forms of terrorism several bills were introduced in the 109th congress to authorize funding or otherwise improve the level of preparedness or coordination of response to an agroterrori st attack these bill are listed in table 7 and discussed in the context of several issues below the 110th congress may consider simila r bills regarding coordina tion and response activities context from the 109th congress two complementary bills addressing agroterrorism

from the 109th congress sought to provide more concrete congressional instructions and budget authorizations for agroterrorism preparedness however similar results could occur if the presidential directive hspd9 is implemented successfully the presidential directives facilitating agroterrorism preparedness and subsequent administrative actions did not exist when senator akakas bills were intr

federal state local and other agriculture officials regarding agroterrori sm preparedness it would have given the secretary of dhs authority to execute responsibilities mentioned in hspd7 and hspd9 and tasked dhs with coordinating much of an agroterrorism response by communicating equipping and otherwise facilitating em ergency response providers dhs also would have become the lead responder by coordinating with the department of transportation the environm ental protection agency partment of agriculture and department of state dhs would have coor dinated task forces to identify and recommend best practices for state response plans the bill also would have created grant program to help state and local agricultural specialists prepare for agroterrorism by funding conferences and agroterrorism response exercises the congressional budget office estima ted that implementing s 572 would cost 8 million in 2006 and 53 million over fi veyear period of this total 48 million would fund additional sta ff and expenses in the cu rrent dhs dir ectorate for preparedness and 5 million would be for grants to state and local agriculture officials interagency coordination shortly following enactment of the homeland security act and the 2003 transfer fro m usda to dhs of agricultural border inspections and the plum island agricultural research facility concerns over dhs dedication to these agricultural functions began rising moreover concern over coordination between established agencies and dhs is not unique to agriculture nonetheless the issue of improved coor dination between federal agencies with various jurisdictions which agency has primary responsibility and encouraging agencies to seeking adequate consultation from other stakeholders has been raised in many venues and pr oposed legislationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32521crs58 for example the agricultural s ecurity assistance act s 573 109th congress would have established agri culture liaison position in the department of homeland security specifically with the federal emergency management agency fema and in the department of health and human services the bill among other things would have given leadership roles for pr eparedness and response particularly with first responders to dhs s 1532 the agroterrorism prevention act 109th congress would have instructed dhs hhs usda intelligence agencies interior epa and other agencies to coordinate re sponse plans conduct vulnerab ility assessments and expand monitoring and surveillance for agroterrorism the bill also mentioned enhanced intelligence systems and cooperation track ing systems for agricultural products laboratory networks and border inspection tr aining the bill would have directed dhs in coordination with other agencies to assess the need for modernizing or replacing bl3 and bl4 laborat ories with agricultural capacity project bioshield ii s 975 109th congress would have established working group spanning usda dhs hhs and fda to identify and recommend specific actions capacities and limitations regarding agroterrorism preparedness section 2708 of s 975 109th congress would ve compelled dhs to cooperate with usda and other intelligence agencies to improve the targeting of agricultural border inspections while the agencies are working together already toward this goal such legislation woul d further compel the coordination of the departments s 3898hr 6086 national reportable conditions act 109th congress would have created coordinated tification system to single government agency for specific list of diseases conditions and events deemed to be threat to human or animal health or the safety of the food and water supply border inspections once agricultural border inspectors were transferred from usda to dhs some members and i ndustry groups expressed concerns that dhs would concentrate on more immediate or catastrophic homeland security issues such as immigration or radiological threats and neglect agricultural functions some were also concerned that personnel and re sources formerly devoted to agriculture would be shifted to other dhs areas fo r more background see the earlier section on the homeland security act coordination over agricultural border insp ections was raised in the conference report for the fy2007 dhs appropriati ons act pl 109295 appropriators directed dhs

this report wh ich identified several problems concerning interagency c oordination and inspection performance judicial issues both s 573 109th congress and s 975 109th congress would have instructed the attorney genera l to review state and local laws relating to agroterrorism to determine whether any such laws would facilitate or impede the implementation of agroterrorism response plans and whether state court could delay the implementation of such federal response plans s 1532 109th congress would have criminalized acts of agroterrorism by amending title 18 of the us code to define agroterrorist acts and prescribing penalties of fines imprisonment or death the animal enterprise terrorism act p l 109374 enhanced the authority of the department of justice to prosecute and convict individuals committing terrorism against animal enterprises the act defines such acts and prescribes penalties it applies not only to international actors committing agroterrorism in the united states but also to acts commonly c onsidered ecoterro rism that are conducted by parties within the united states against locations such as animal research facilities or confinement livestock operations
