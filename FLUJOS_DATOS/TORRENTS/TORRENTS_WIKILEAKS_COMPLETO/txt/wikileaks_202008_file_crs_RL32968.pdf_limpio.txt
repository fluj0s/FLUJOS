specialist in social legislation domestic social policy divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968child welfare state performance on child and family services reviews summary while child welfare programs are pr imary responsibility of state and local governments the federal government appropriates cl ose to 7 billion annually to support these programs primarily for fost er care and adoption assistance and states are required to meet certain federal policies in order to receive this funding child and family services reviews cfsrs gauge state efforts and ability to achieve the primary goals of safety and permanence fo r children and wellbeing for children and their families the review is intended both to measure state compliance with federal child welfare policy and to strengthen nd improve state child welfare programs the department of health and huma n services hhs conducted the initial round of onsite reviews be tween march 2001 and march 2004 state was found to be in substantial conformity with all of the outcomes and systems assessed some critics of the cfsr argue that while the outcomes reviewed are on target the criteria established to determine state achievement of those outcomes may give misleading information about states performance although much attention has focused on st ates uniform inability to meet all of the federal criteria the reviews also showed certain relative strengths states showed the greatest ability to ensure that children were not exposed to child abuse and neglect and remained safely in their homes whenever appropriate and possible and in preserving their family relationships and c onnections they had the most difficulty in achieving permanent and stable livin g arrangements for children enhancing the capacity of families to meet the needs of their children and in seeing that appropriate mental and physical health services were available to children served information regarding ensuring provision of educationa l services to children was more mixed in addition to reviewing outcomes the cfsr assesses state compliance with federal child welfare policy by examining certain federally required systems states were most likely to be found successful at operating statewide information system maintaining foster and adoptive parent licensing training recruitment and retention and responding to community concerns th ey were least likely to have strong service array or case review system in pl ace ratings of state quality assurance and training systems were more mixed to avoid immediate assessment of penalties for failure to comply with federal policy each state was required to develop program improvement plan pip pip must address each one of the outcomes or systems with which state was found to be out of substantial conformity and must describe the states specific plan for moving toward full conformity with federal policy few states have successfully completed their pips but most are still in the process of implementing them the childrens bureau is preparing for second round of cfsrs and onsite reviews are scheduled to begin in early 2007 this report will descri be the origins and design of cfsrs before turning to its pr

federal child welfar policies and procedures is also assessed through other methods many of these are inte nded to examine only one aspect of federal child welfare policies these include review and approval of the title ive plan and the child and family services plan cfsp partial reviews which look at state compliance with specific provisions eg denial of certa in placements due to race or ethnicity or because of interjurisdictional issues periodic indepth review of sample of foster care cases for which title ive foster care maintenance payments are made see crs report rl32836 child

welfare information system sacwis audits by the office of the inspector genera l and regional office review of quarterly title ive claimschild welfare state performance on child and family services reviews introduction the child and family services review cfsr is the central and most comprehensive component of federal effo rts to determine state compliance with federal child welfare policie s and equally to help ensu re that positive outcomes are achieved for the children and families served by state child welfare programs1 the review intends to gauge state efforts and ability to achieve the primary goals of safety and permanence for children along with wellbeing for children and their families the us department of h ealth and human services hhs began the first onsite reviews in march 2001 and as of march 2004 had complete d the initial round of the cfsr in all states the district of columbia and puerto rico in this report both the district of columbia and puerto rico will be referred to as states many states were found to have substa ntially achieved the goal of safety permanence or wellbeing for majority of the cases reviewed and to have in place systems adequate to achieve positive outcomes for children at the same time the initial round of cfsrs found that states child welfare programs met the criteria that hhs established as demonstrating substantial conformity with all of federal child welfare policy requirements as result all states have or are implementing program improvement plans pips to avoid financial penalties associated with noncompliance states must meet the impr ovement goals established in their pip although the final cfsr regulation states that subsequent full cfsr is to occur in each state two years after the approval of state pip in practice this has been judged impossible eg such time frame would mean that states second round cfsr performance would be based on the same data that are used to assess the success of the initial pip the second r ound of cfsrs is now being planned withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs2 2 for more information see history of federal review efforts in us congress house committee on ways and means

september 2007 this report begins with short history of the legislation and other factors that led to the creation of the current cfsr and then briefly describes how cfsr is conducted and what substantial confor mity with federal child welfare policy means in the context of this review much has b een made of the fact that state was found to be in substantial conformity with all aspects of federal policy reviewed during the initial fy2001fy2004 round of the cfsrs this report seeks to better understand that fact by looking closely at state performance on each of the performance indicators that determined compliance taking apart this general not in substantial conformity finding permits more complex understanding of state performance and the report uses this analysis to identify and discuss those areas in which states showed the greatest inability to achieve compliance with federal policy readers should note that in addition to the text scribing state perform ance tables included in appendices b and c of the report provide detailed ratings information for each state and appendix d presents information on the case characteristics eg age or raceethnicity of child in case being reviewed vis vis outcome achievement finally the report concludes with br ief discussion of 1 how penalties for non compliance are assessed 2 the requirement that states not in compliance with federal policy develop program impr ovement plans pips appendix shows the status of pip implementation 3 some of the criticisms of how the initial cfsr assessed state performance especially with regard to the national standard s and 4 planning for the second round of cfsrs origins of the cfsr with the 1980 adoption assistance and child welfare act pl 96272 congress established the basic framework fo r the current federalstate child welfare programs that legislation created t of federal protections applicable to all children in foster care eg written case plan and regular case review states were required to provide these prot ections without regard to childs eligibility for federal foster care funding if they wished to sure receipt of their full funding for child welfare services authorized under title iv b of the social security act to determine if states were indeed providing these protections to all children and were thus eligible for their full child welfare services allotment hhs created 427 reviews which were named for the section of the social security act that established certain voluntar protections for all foster care children the 427 review process was establis hed without formal regulati ons and it came to be viewed as arbitrary designed only to check polic ies on paper not in pr actice and interested in identifying weaknesses for the purpose of punishment only not for designing improvements2 as part of the social security amendments of 1994 pl 103432 congress required hhs to develop new system of review for state child welfare programshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs3 3 see 45 cfr 135531135537 available at http wwwaccessgpog ovnaracfr waisidx_0245cfr1355_02html hhs discussion of regulations are included in the federal register announcement of jan 25 2000 available at http wwwac fdhhsgovprograms cblawsfed_regfr012500pdf 4 the final regulations provide that such gu ide will be made available to states including any significant revisions during the course of the initial review hhs made several revisions to the manual the procedure manual was under revision at the time of this report the final version of the manual used for the initial round of reviews as of may 27 2005 could be viewed at httpwwwacfdhhsgovprogramscbcwrptoolsindexhtm 5 the regulations provide that to the extent pr actical and feasible the data indicators will match those developed for the annual child welfare outcomes book required by section 203 of adoption and safe families act pl 10589 see 45 cfr 135534b4 and 5that focused on outcomes achieved for children and families and that would replace the older and discredited processdriven reviews the same 1994 legislation also repealed the former section 427 but made each of its formerly voluntary protections part of the title ivb state plan requirements this made the protections mandatory for all foster care children in all states pl 103432 1994 further provided that the newly designed review system must cover the full range of statutory and regulatory child welfare policies and that the criteria used to measure states compliance with specific factors were to be spelled out in formal regulations it added that these regulations were also to detail what the penalties were tie the amount of an financial penalty ssessed to the degree of noncompliance found spend withholding of any penalties while states take corrective action and further re scind the penalties if state ccessfully implemented corrective action finally the legislation required hhs to offer technical assistance to any state needing to take corrective action during the last half of the 1990s hhs consulted with child welfare administrators and conducted 13 pilot reviews in january 2000 the department released its final regulation on the child and family services review cfsr guided in part by the 1997 passage of the adoption and safe families act pl 105 89 hhs established the overall goals of safety and permanency for children and wellbeing for children and families as the overarching aims of each state child welfare program to achieve substantial conformity with federal child welfare policy the final review regulation lists seven specific outcomes that state must achieve and seven specific systems that state must demonstrate are in operation3 cfsr procedures manual was subsequently produced and listed 45 items or performance indicators which were associ ated with the seven outcomes and seven systems and used to guide the review team through an evaluation of the states performance4 hhs also issued separate policy guidance on six national standards the concept of which was outlined in the formal regulations and which were developed as complimentary performance indicators using statewide data5 table 1 provides definitions for certain key terms used in this report httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs4 table 1 brief description of common terms goals overarching purposes of state child welfare programs outcomesdesired results of services provided for children and in certain instances their families the cfsr includes seven outcomes systemspolicies and procedures that must be in place to ensure the states ability to achieve required outcomes the cfsr assesses seven systems performance indicatorsthe three kinds of performance indicators used for the cfsr are case review specific indicators 23 us ed in each applicable case to assess whether an outcome was achieved national standards statewide data are examined in relation to each of the national standards 6 to determine compliance with certain outcomes system review specific indicators 22 used to assess whether required system has been implemented and is functioning substantial conformitythe state is determined to have achieved the desired outcome in 90 or more of the cases reviewed 95 of cases for future cfsrs met the national standards related to specified safety and permanency outcomes and implemented and to be successfully operating each of the required systems source congressional research service crs how is cfsr conducted and what is assessed the cfsr begins with states own assessment of its child welfare programs this selfassessment is followed by an onsite review conducted by team of federal and state investigators the final dete rmination of substantial conformity with specific outcomes and systems is made follo wing the onsite review and is based on information gathered during the onsite review as well as the analysis of statewide data for the period for whic h the state is under review statewide assessment during the statewide assessment state must review and prepare report on all aspects of its program performance including its provision of services to children in foster care and those who have been reported to the child welfare system but who have not been removed from their homes as an important part of this self assessment the state must analyze certain statewide program data and measure its own performance for the period unde r review against established national standards the statewide assessment must include consultation with nonagency and community stakeholders in the system the report prepared from this assessment serves as basis for the states onsite review but does not constitute final determination of substantial conformityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs5 6 the regulations provide that for state to be found in substantial conformity in subsequent cfsr it must achieve the outcome in 95 of the cases onsite review the onsite review conducted by team of federal and state members follows the statewide assessment and occurs simultaneously in three locations in the state including the largest city or metropolitan area it includes intensive review of sample of cases usually to tal of 50 roughly half in fo ster care and half inhome cases and interviews with variety of stakeholders both statewide and local who have particular experience with or knowle dge of the state child welfare programs stakeholders that must be interviewed incl ude children parents foster parents case workers and other service providers in th individual cases being reviewed and with regard to the local or state program more generally the child welfare director case workers foster parents dependency or juvenile court judges guardians ad litem and other representatives of groups that the state consults with to design its child welfare program and services what does substantial conformity mean both qualitative and quantitative information is solicited and analyzed to determine whether or not state is in substantial conformity with federal child welfare policy states were assessed on both the outcomes they achieved and the systems they had in place to achieve those outcomes outcomes state conformity with the seven specific outcomes is measured via case reviews and the national standards these outcomes are children are first and foremost protected from abuse and neglect children are maintained in their own homes whenever possible and appropriate children have permanence and stability in their living situations family relationships and connecti ons are preserved for children families have enhanced capacity to provide for their childrens needs children receive appropriate services to meet their educational needs and children receive adequate services to meet their physical and mental health needs in the initial round of cfsrs state needed to achieve the desired outcome in 90 of the applicable cases reviewed6 whether state achieved one or more of the seven outcomes in given case was based on an onsite review of the case records combined with interviews of casespecific individuals eg the foster parents case worker andor child using standardized survey instrument reviewers then determined whether or not each specific outcome was achieved in the case by rating each of the applicable case review indicators see also table 3 in addition to achieving an outcome in 90 of the cases for state to be found in substantial conformity with two of the outcomes one associated with safety the other with permanency it also needed to meet each of the six national standards datahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs6 7 for information on the data measures to be used in the second round of the cfsr see child and family services review update vol 2 issue 5 june 2006 available online at httpwwwacfhhsgovprogramscbcwmonitoringcfsrjun06htmindicators the national standards used in the initial round of th cfsr were based on state administrative data regarding recurrence of maltreatment incidence of maltreatment while in foster care the rate of reentries to foster care the stability of foster care placements and th states achievement of adoptions and reunifications on timely basis for state to meet the required national standards an analysis of statewide administrative data for the 12 months generally that were part of the formal review period must indicate that the state matched or exceeded each of the established national st andards the national standard s and description

aggregate state performance on outcomes in the initial cfsr in general both the onsite case review and the analysis of statewide data showed that states performed best with regard to safety outcomes had greatest difficulty with most of the permanency outcomes and showed more mixed results in relation to the wellbeing outcomes case review only the case reviews indicate that as whole states performed most successfully in protectin g children from abuse and neglect outcome substantially achieved in 85 of cases nationally and in ensuring that children receive appropriate services to meet

outcome is not strictly comparable across all years of the initial cfsr because the case review performance indicators for this outcome were adjusted following the 2001 reviews conducted in 17 states both delaware and north da kota had their onsite review in fy2001protecting children from maltreatment although the states scored relatively well on both the case reviews nd national standards for this outcome when the two tests were combined just six states az ar dc pa sc were determined to have substantially achieved the goal of protecting children from abuse and neglect nationally there were close to 2350 pplicable cases rated on this safety outcome the share of cases in which indi vidual states achieved this outcome ranged from low of 62 ak to high of 100 ny the median state performance was 86 beyond the case reviews to determine conformity with this outcome statewide data were examined to measure 1 the incidence of children who were the found to be the victims of child abuse or

indicators related to the perm anency goal for children eg reunification adoption another planned permanent living arrangement would by definition be applicable to only subset of the cases being reviewed state performance on indivi dual case review indicators an additional view on the areas that showed the greatest strength or need for improvement can also be gained by studying whether each of the items or performance indicators associated with the case review process was rated as an overall strength or an area needing impr ovement for the state the strength or area needing improvement ratings for given state represent aggregate performance across all applicable cases for single one of these items performance indicators because these ratings are not casespecific findings they do not directly affect the determination of states c onformity or non conformity with particular outcome nonetheless these aggregate item ratings are discussed in the state final report and may be used to understand what contributed to states overall rating on an outcome and consequently what areas should be addressed in the state pip9 ranking state outcome performance by case review indicators produces pattern of strengths and weakness similar to what the casebycase analysis suggests as discussed earlier state was found to be in substantial conformity with two outcomes 1 families have enhanced capacity to provide for the needs of their children and 2 foster care children have permanent and stable living arrangements seven of the 10 separate case review indicators associated with achieving these two outcomes were rated as strength in 14 or fewer of the states at the same time state performance on two of the case review indicators associated with the outcome ensuring permanent and stable living arra ngements for foster care children far outstripped the number of strength ratings determined for any other performance indicators sixtynine percent of the states received strength rating for their efforts at keeping brothers and sisters together in foster care and 94 received strength rating for placing children clos to their birth parents or their own communities

on data provided in the cfsr final reports the description of each indicator is taken from the core question provided for given item as included in the stakeholder interview guide dated feb 2003 relevant stakeholders are asked to elaborate on each of the items generally however state performance on each of thesehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs17 items is rated as strength or area needing improvement based on the agency and workers performance in the individual cases reviewed the stakeholder interview guide as well as the instructions given regarding individual case reviews have been updated several times throughout the course of the initial review process however with the exception described in table note b the general thrust of each indicator has remained consistent b the focus of this indicator was significantly changed during the initial round of child and family services reviews for states reviewed during fy2001 n 17 this case review indicator addressed appropriate provision of independent living services the ratings given to those states for that indicator are not reflected in this table for reviews conducted in fy2002fy2004 n35 this case review indicator addressed appropriate reunification efforts the percentage of states receiving strength rating for this item is related to the 35 states for which appropriate reunification efforts were assessed out of those 35 states four were given strength rating for this indicator state system performan ce in the initial cfsr reviewers also rated state performance based on the states policy and practice with regard to seven federally required systems this part of the cfsr is intended to measure states capacity to achieve positive outcomes related to safety permanency and wellbeing for the children and families its serves ratings for this part of the review are largely based on in terviews with state and local stakeholders in the child welfare system overall states were more likely to be assessed as having the capacity to produce positive outcomes for children than they were to have been rated as achieving these outcomes at the same time because these systems are intended to work together poor rating on any one of the systems may affect states ability to achieve one or all of the outcomes assessed further state capacity was judged weakest with regard to case review system and service array and these systems are arguably keystones of successful child welfare program of the 52 states 49 were found to have child welfare agencies that were responsive to the community 45 were judged in substantial compliance with federal requirements for statewide info rmation system and 43 were found to have adequate recruitment rete ntion and licensing programs for foster and adoptive parents less substantial majority of states were f ound to have functioning quality assurance system in place 35 and to ad equately meet the federal staff training requirements 34 states had more difficulty meetin g the system requirements related to service array and case review less than half of states 23 were judged to have service array system in compliance with federal policy and just 13 states were found in compliance with the cas review system requirements compliance with the system requirements of federal child welfare policy was determined based on stakehol der interviews and the numbe r of strength or area needing improvement ratings given to each of the items associated with the implementation and proper f unctioning of system figure 2 shows composite national rating for each system with 100 representing strength rating for each of the items associated with an outcome for all states the figure illustrates again that service array and case review system were determined to be the most significant areas of weaknesses in state efforts to achieve positive outcomes for children the findings also suggests that performance in each of these areas may be more nearly equal than would appear simply by looking at the number of states in compliance with each systemhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs18 figure 2 state performance on syst ems by composite strength or area needing improvement rating source figure prepared by the congressional research service crs based on the strength or area needing improvement ratings given for each item associated with given system factor compliance with particular system is directly determined by the number of associated indicators that are given strength rating table 6 ranks each of the indicators associated with this complian ce determination from those least likely to receive strength rating to those most likely to receive this rating as might be expected it shows that items associated with the service array and case review system are more likely to be rated as areas needing improvement than are most of those items associated with agency respons iveness to the community and foster and adoptive parent recruitment retention and licensing however few items run counter to this trend for instance desp ite being an indicator related to the case review system the large majority of states 42 states 81 received strength rating for the case review item that sought to assess how good state was at conducting periodic review of the status of each child in foster care by contrast just 21 states 40 received strength rating for their fforts to ensure the diligent recruitment of potential foster and adoptive families that reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of children needing those homes although the vast majority of states were found in substantial conformity with the overall system related to licensing recruitment and retention of foster car and adoptive parents

the thrust of each core question ite mindicator has remained largely the same httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs21 10 because the case review indicators were adju sted after the first 17 states were reviewed in 2001 state performance on this outcome is not strictly comparable across all years of the initial round of the cfsr both north dakota and delaware the only states who achieved substantial conformity on this outcome for 90 or more of the cases reviewed were among those first 17 states the case review indica tors used for the first 17 states placed less explicit attention on the timeliness of achieving specific case goal did not include specific indicator with regard to timeliness of reunification did include an indicator exclusively about provision of independent living services to any foster care child age 16 or older for the reviews done in 20022004 35 states the timeliness along with appropriateness of childs permanency goal was explicitly reviewed an indicator concerning the timeliness of reunification wa s added and questions associated with the provision of independent living services were incorporated in the i ndicator concerning the appropriate use of another planned permanent living arrangementa closer look at the weaknesses identified by the cfsr the following discussion looks more clos ely at each of the indicators explicitly associated with the two outcomes for whic h state was found to be in substantial conformity it also examines indicators associated with systems that might be expected to affect state performance on those two outcomes many of those indicators are related to the case review and service array systems on which states were the least likely to have b een found in substantial conformity permanent and stable living arrangements nationally of the 1479 foster care cases reviewed permanent and stable living arrangements were determined to have been substantia lly achieved in 56 822 of the cases and only partially achieved in 37 548 of the cases reviewers rated 7 of the cases 109 as not having achieved or addressed this outcome at all in assessing how well state assists children in achieving permanent and stable living arrangements the cfsr looks at six perfo rmance indicators for each applicable case and also examines statewide data to judge its performance with regard to four national standards two stat substantially achieved the outcome of permanent and stable living arrangement in 90 or more of the cases and nd but state achieved compliance with all four of the national standards associated with this outcome10 the indicators associated with this outcome were number of reentries into foster car case review and national standard stability of placements case re view and national standard timeliness and appropriateness of permanency goals case review timeliness of reunification case review and national standard timeliness of adoption case review and national st andard and appropriate use of the permanency go another planned permanent living arrangement case review of these indicators states were most successful at limiting reentries to foster care half of the states 26 met the national standard meaning that statewide data showed that 86 or less of the children who were entering foster care in the yearhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs22 11 for reviews done in 20022004 states achieve ment of timely reunification or placement with permanent guardian or kin caregiver was also assessed just 11 4 out of 35 of the states reviewed during those years received strength rating for this item based on their case reviews under review had entered foster care previ ously within the past 12 months and close to half 24 received strength rating for this indicator based on the applicable case reviews based on the case reviews states were least successful in meeting the indicators regarding minimizin g the number of placements for children and developing appropriate permanency goals for foster care children on timely basis only five states received strength rating for either one of these indicators and just 14 states met the national standard of 867 or more of the children who were in care for 12 months or less experiencing two or fewer placements among the indicators related to specific permanency goals achieving timely adoption within 24 months of foster care try was the most difficult for states to achieve only six states achieved strength rating in this area based on the case reviews while 14 met the associated national standard with regard to reunification with parent or caretaker within 12 mont hs of entering foster care 19 met the associated national standard11 finally 16 states received strength rating for their use of the permanency goal another planned permanent living arrangement the case review system which is spelle d out in detail in section 475 of the social security act is key part of federal child welfare policy designed both to ensure the protection of children while in care and to enable them to achieve stable and permanent living arrangements states had the most difficulty achieving strength ratings for indicators associated with implementing parts of the case review system at the case level only six states received strength rating for development of written case plans which are intended to guide th work done with children and families and which federal law states must be created jointly with parents less than half of the states 22 received strength rating for complying with the termination of parental

certain systems in place that are intended to improve how the child welfare agency functions if these systems do increase the ability of state to achieve positive outcomes for state and assuming that the cfsr accurately measures how well state implements given system then states that achieved higher system compliance might be expected to have achieved the cfsr outcomes for greater share of the cases reviewed statistical analysis of the relationship between system compliance and achievement of the desired outcomes for ch ildren shows that states whose array of available services was determined in substantial compliance with federal policy had significantly higher percentage of cases in which familie s were found to have enhanced capacity to meet the needs of their children and in

hhs to specify in regulations how financial pena lties would be determined for states found to be out of conformity with federal child welfare policy and to make those penalties commensurate with the degree of nonconf ormity at the same time it required hhs to allow states found out of conformity w ith federal policy to develop and implement corrective action plan and to rescind an penalties if that plan was successfully implemented financial penalties for nonc onformity with federal ch ild welfare policy are to be withheld from specific pool of child welfare funds that as defined in the regulation includes all title ivb funds to the state funding for both child welfare services and promoting safe and stable families and 10 of the foster care administrative costs claimed by the state under title ive for the specified penalty period for the states initial review pe nalties may range from 1 of the specifiedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs28 penalty pool for failure to achieve specifi ed level of conformity with one of the outcomes or one of the systems studied up to 14 for failure to achieve specified level of conformity with each of the 14 outcomes or systems studied the regulations also specify that if state reaches the end of its required program improvement plan p ip and fails to have successfully completed the plan hhs must withhold funds from state based on the number of outcomes and systems that were found not in substantia l conformity during the cfsr and for which the state did not successfully complete the level of improvement outlined in its pip this withholding is to begin with the last specified completion date in the pip and continue until the state successfully achieve s the relevant pip goal or is found in substantial conformity by subsequent

continues for statebystate information on pip implementation and status see appendix did the initial cfsr accurately measure state performance state officials advocates and researchers have raised number of concerns about how substantial confor mity was measured in the in itial cfsr seve ral of the measurement concerns are related to the national standards and might call into question the accuracy of the overall assessmen t that state was found in substantial conformity with federal child welfare policy for instance some researchers and state officials argue that in certain cases what is actually measured does not accurately reflect what hhs intended to measure they further argue that accurate measures are necessary not only to ensure correct penalty assessment but as important to ensure that the required program improvement plans pips are properly focused other concerns raised about the cfsr raise questions about what is not measured and ensuring that account ability for outcomes is properly assigned national standards the national standards are an early effort to establish quantitative benchmark by which to judge state child welfare pe rformance state conformity with the national standards directly effects stat performance rating on just two of the seven outcomes none of the ven systems that are assesse d in the cfsr are directly affected by states rating on the national standards thus the ability to meet or not meet the national standards might be unde rstood as relatively small factor in achieving cfsr compliance at the sa time state can be found in complete substantial conformity with federal policy until it meet s each of the six national standards further if the national standa rds are not designed in way that truly measures state performance for given issu they might lead hhs to incorrectly require program improvement s or not require improveme nts of states who risk financial harm if they do not comply number of critiques of these

provided in th final regulations that it could add amend and suspend any such statewide da ta indicators s announced revised national standards for the s econd round of the cfsr and these seek to respond to at least some of the criticisms discussed here16 state variation in policy and caseload child welfare systems are administered differently by each state nd sometimes by each county within state and this can be problem if each state is judged by single federal standard for instance the federal government largely fers to the states with regard to definition of child abuse and neglect and state definitions of what constitutes child abuse and neglect thus how re ports of child abuse and neglect are classified varies significantly17 this is concern for some who argue that requiring all states to meet the same national standard for preventing recurrence of maltreatment in foster care might unduly punish states that have enacted broader defin itions of child maltreatment andor th at have welldeveloped system of reporting and investigation while allowing states with more narrow definitions or less efficient reporting and investigating systems to more easily achieve federal compliance during the course of the initial review and analysis hhs uncovered separate example of how varied state policy might affect states ability to meet the national standards established with regard to recurrence of maltreatment close to half of the states reviewed in fy2002fy2004 35 states indicated that child abuse and neglect allegations for families with open child welfare cases eg inhome cases are not reported as new allegations of abuse or neglect and therefore there is formal assessment of the validity of the allegation instead st ate policy or practice usually provides that the caseworker assigned to the family would informally assess the information and act to protect the children if necessary in short if child maltreatment is identified this information while it is likely acted on would not be reported to the states national child buse and neglect databa and thus would not be part of the statewide data used to determine whether or not state meets the standard on recurre nce of maltreatment18 the composition of states caseload may also vary for reasons that are not in control of the child welfare agency or again because of state policy decisions some researchers have called for riskadjusted standards although they acknowledge thathttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs30 19 mark courtney barbara needall and fred wulczyn unintended consequences of the

sample and the degree of succe ss achieved on certain outcomes20 for the most part this analysis found that states overa ll performance on the cfsr outcomes when compared to all other states was largely unaffected by the significant state variation in the case sample demographics including age raceethnicity primary reason for case opening and geographic location the single exception to this overall finding was in regard to the age of children in states case review sample and state performance on the safety outcome children are safely maintained in their own homes whenever appropriate and possible states with higher percentage of children in their case review sample th at were younger than age six at the time of their entry into foster care had lower percentage of cases rated as substantially achieving that outcome at the same time many more significant relationships were established when the lens of the analysis was shifted from comparison between states performance to the relationship between the particular characteristics of child in given case and the performance ratings for cases with children of similar or different characteristics for more information on these specific findings see appendix d accuracy of data closely related to the issue of state variation are certain concerns about data used to determine co mpliance with the national standards the most basic concerns the accuracy and compar ability of the data the majority of the data used to set the national standards as well as to assess state performance on those standards are collected via the adoption and foster care an alysis and reporting system afcars an analysis by the hhs office of the inspector general found that the federal guidance on reporting afcars data supports states beliefs that the lack of clear definitions leads to inconsis tent reporting states believed afcars data elements were not clearly and consisten tly defined and expr essed concerns about foster care placement

recommendations22 hhs has and continues to work on provi ding more guidance assessing what states are doing and improving state data collection systems the agency has also solicited comments on revisions to the afcars data collection system nonetheless the national standards used for the initial cfsr were derived from data collected via afcars in the early years of the systems operation in most states although the department worked closely with each state to ensure that the data used to measure the state against the standards were the best possible data available some find this troubling supporters of the polic to use statewide da ta measured against national standard however argue that da ta system is perfect that improved data collection is byproduct of using the data or in essence that you have to start somewhere sometime and that the cfsr assessed state performance in multiple ways using both qualitative and quantitative data so that state could be judged on all of the measures purely by quantitative data what is measured versus what is meant to be measured researchers have taken particular issue with three of the data indicators that are used in the national standards these indicators seek to ensure that states 1 are reuniting children with their families in timely manner or 2 are finding timely doptive placements for children who cannot be reun ited with their parents and 3 do not allow children to exit foster care to placements that are not permanent and simply result in the return of these children to foster care while researchers generally applaud the intent of these measures that is the effort to use quantitative data to determine how quickly and effectively states reestablish permanent home for children who come into care they argue that some of the measures used in the initial round of reviews might penalize state even if its performance was improving timely adoption and timely reunification the national standards for both of these measures look at only children who exit foster care in given year they determine of those who were reunite d with their parents what share were reunited within 12 months of entering care and of those who were adopted what share were adopted within 24 months of tering care some researchers have argued that the focus exclusively on children who exit foster care means that the overall likelihood of child being adopted or reunited is not being measured ie the measure does not look at all children who have been in care during the year but only those who exit that care further in the case of adoption they note that if state did the hard work of moving many of its long erstaying and likely more difficult to place children into adoptive homes even if it held steady or improved the rate at which newer entrants moved to dopti on it might perform badly on the official measure that is the longer staying children move d to adoption and who presumably werehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs32

courtney barbara needall and fred wulczyn uni ntended consequences of the push for accountability the case of national child welfare performance standards children and youth services review 26 december 2004 the pew commission on children in foster care recommended the use of longitudinal data to measure state child welfare performance and legislation in the 108th congress hr 1534 introduced by rep cardin would have required hhs to consider modifying afcars to allow collection of longitudinal data legacy of older agency practice would necessarily reduce the share of children adopted within two years23 rather than looking at children who exit foster care one alternative measure of time to reunification or adoption might fo llow the group of children or cohort in researcher lingo who entered foster care in given year to determine how many were adopted within two years or reunited within one year this kind of measure however would require the administrative data to follow single childs records across more than one fiscal year ie it requires longitudinal data and afcars is currently not set up to enable this kind of analysis24 another alternative might group certain measures together for instance with regard to timely adoption in addition to recording the share of children who exited foster care to adoption within 24 months of entering care the measur would also look at overall likelihood of adoptions eg total children served in given fiscal year divided by number of adoptions in that year foster care reentry rate criticism of the nationa l standard that looks at the foster care reentry rate focuses on the fact that changes in states caseload size in the given fiscal year affect state pe rformance in this area even though those caseload changes may be unrelated to how well state did at achieving permanency for children in the previous year this is because the current meas ure looks at all the children who enter foster care in the given year and asks what percentage of them are reentering care within 12 months of their prior entry to foster care this means that state that experiences decline in new entries to care may have fewer or at least greater number of children reentering th an in previous years but its performance might nonetheless be rated as worse than the previous year by contrast state with an increasing number of entries to foster care might increase the number of reentries but show decline in its performance one alternative measure might compare the number of children who reentered care in given year as share of the

measuring outcomes some critics of the cfsr also believe it does not go far enough in its effort to measure outcomes versus processes in particular they cite the measurement of child and family wellbeing outcomes as weak the pew commission on children in foster care recommended that congress require the national academy of sciences to study and make recommendati ons for appropriate measures and outcomes especially those related to child wellbeing and further that hhs convene an ongoing advisory pane l of experts to periodically review the measures to ensure that they remain timely and appropriate26 such panel would however have to reconcile its ultimate recommendations with the federal policies currently in law the criteria used to judge state performance is based on the federal statute including its interpretation in regulation current w includes relatively limited child welfare provisions specifically related to for instance health treatment or education services it requires that childs updated health and education record be accessible to foster parents while logical interpretation of these requirements might be that these records are supposed to be current and accessible so that children can receive the education services and health services needed this requires an interpretation and an easier case might be made for measuring states compliance based on process for example are the records uptodate and available as opposed to did the availability of the records lead to adequate health and education services for the child who is accountable this same concern might also be viewed as question of accountability child welfare sy stem must be able to count on other agencies and especially the courts if it is to successfully achieve positive outcomes for children is the states failure to achieve substantial conformity with the performance measure related to the system service array and the wellbeing outcome related to providing adequate mental health serv ices true problem of the child welfare agency not making the appropriate services available and accessible or is it simply lack of widely available child mental health services in the state if state is not in compliance with the statutes termination of parental rights tpr provisions is this because the courts in the state have tremendous backlog and cannot hear the cases on timely basis or is it because the child welfare agency is not making an effort to begin these proceedings in timely manner the next round of cfsrs the regulation provides that for states not found in substan tial conformity second full cfsr is to begin two years af ter the date hhs appr oves the states pip however hhs has since determined that state performance ma not be reasonably rereviewed until at

website at httpwwwacfhhsgovprogramscbcwrpresultsstatefindingsgenfindings04genfindin gs04pdf 30 the statistical analysis regarding age and performance ratings by cases was done with regard to cases reviewed in fy2002fy2004 only the total applicable cases reviewed with regard to the outcome of permanency and stability in the living situations in those years was 951 relationship between performance rating nd age was determined significant if the probability that the relationship occurred by chance was less than 1 appendix d analysis of case characteristics and ratings of outcome achievement as part of rating each case reviewers collected certain data about the characteristics of the child whose case wa s under review eg age raceethnicity these case specific data are not available in the final reports but have been studied by hhs via contract with james bell associates for statistically significant relationships between outcome s achieved and the characteristics of the case the full report discussing these findings is ava ilable on the childrens bureau web site29 synthesis of some of the ke findings is provided below age of child cases involving children under the age of 6 at the start of the cfsr review period were more likely to be rated as having substantia lly achieved permanency and stability in their living situations than cases involving children of all other ages age was independently established as significantly related to two of the performance indicators placement stability and establis hment of permanency goal used to determine whether permanency and stability have been achieved for child these analyses generally supported the anecdotal information that placement stability is harder to achieve for adolescents and that establishing appropriate permanency goals for children in timely manner is easier for younger children than for adolescents the percentage of cases receiving strength rating for placement stability decreased with increasing age until age of 16 for yout h age 1618 strength rating for placement stability was as likely as it was for children younger than 9 at the start of the cfsr review period the percentage of strength ratings related to establishment of the permanency goal was highest for children unde r the age of 6 at the start of the cfsr review period and lowest for children who were 1012 years of age at that time30 raceethnicity of child cases involving white non hispanic children were mo re likely to be rated as having substantially achieved permanency and stability in their living situations than were cases involving children who are alaska nativenative american asianpacific islander or black nonhispanic sepa rate analysis shows that cases involving children who are white nonhispanic were significantly more likely than cases involving children of any ot her raceethnicity to have been rated as substantiallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32968crs61 31 the statistical analysis regarding raceet hnicity and performance ratings by cases was done with regard to cases reviewed in fy 2001fy2004 for which raceethnicity data were identified the total applicable cases analyz ed with regard to the outcome children have permanency and stability in the living situa tions was 1415 the total applicable cases analyzed with regard to the wellbeing outcomes ranged from 2448 and 2326 relationship between performance rating and racee thnicity was determined significant if the probability that the relationship occurred by chance was less than 1 32 the statistical analysis regarding reason for case opening and performance ratings by cases was done with regard to cases review ed in fy2002fy2004 only the total applicable cases reviewed with regard to primary reason for case opening and the outcome children have permanency and stability in the living situations was 931 relationship between performance rating and reason for case opening was determined significant if the probability that the relationship occurred by chance was less than 1 33 the review years included in the statistical an alysis regarding ratings by largest or smaller population sites and performance ratings is not stated relationship between performance rating and site of review was determined sign ificant if the probability that the relationship occurred by chance was less than 1 achieving the wellbeing outcome children receive adequate services to meet their physical and mental health needs fina lly cases involving children who were white nonhispanic black nonhispanic or of two or more races were significantly more likely to have substantially achieved the wellbeing outcome families have enhanced capacity to meet childrens need than were cases involving children who are alaska nativeindian or asianpacific islander31 primary reason for case opening cases opened primarily for issues relate d to childs behavior eg childs substance abuse or juvenile delinquency were more likely to be rated as having substantially achieved permanency and stability than were cases opened for any other reason cases opened pr imarily for all other reasons g parents substance abuse abuse or neglect of the child mentalphysical health of family were more likely to be rated as not having substantially achieved permanency and stability in living situation than to have been rated as subs tantially achieving this outcome32 location of case review as noted earlier the onsite cfsr takes place at three locations in state including the most populous city or county other locations in each state varied from very rural to metropolitans uburban significant rela tionship between case ratings for most outcomes and review location l argest population compared to smaller population sites was found however for two of the wellbeing outcomes families have enhanced capacity to meet the needs of their children and children receive appropriate services for their physical and mental health needs cases reviewed in smaller population sites were significantly more likely to have been found to have achieved these outcomes33
