2008 for immediate release eric l nelson spokesperson for the holland campaign and american patriots for brian holland issued this statement earlier today on behalf of brian holland candidate for president of the united states this is statement that brian made personally and wanted released today nelson stated this is situation which we have urged him to address and despite his feelings that it should be ignored and treated for what it is he has finally agreed to speak on the subject these are brians words written by him from his heart and he has said that this will be the first and only time that this subject will be discussed inside the campaign or outside from the desk of brian n hollandmy friends supporters comrades and fellow fighters in the struggle i have been fighting this since we began this campaign but i have finally seen that i need to speak this will be the only time that i ever address this situation as i feel that it is negative and only hurts our movement as whole when i first joined the nsm some two years ago i expressed an interest in seeking political office as i have strong campaign background as well as professional background that i feel would make viable candidate some time later when i was told by commander schoep that another member was going to be running presidential campaign i endorsed it fully and did my duty to support the effort i saw the candidate not only as representative of the nsm but also the only representative of the white race willing to step up and take on the daunting task of national campaign it was my duty to support that effort as any good white man would do when the unfortunate situation occurred later that saw john taylor bowles and the nsm part company i was torn over the campaign situation despite the fact that he was longer affiliated with the nsm he was still the only pro white candidate making an effort i wanted in my heart to believe that any candidate was better than candidate and often times that is the case i contemplated endorsing taylor personally i considered working with him on the campaign for the purpose of advancing the movement as whole it was decision that weighed heavily on for quite some time i spoke with nick chappell who i considered friend in the struggle and i suppose i still do i dont harbor any ill will toward nick or taylor nick and i spoke probably 30 times via emails exchanged phone numbers etc nick in my estimation is capable young man and i believe that he has good future in the movement i certainly wish him well as i do taylor in all of his endeavors when the nsm held their annual nationals in washington dc i was still wrestling with the idea that the movement needed candidate candidate that would represent the movement as whole there has never been national candidate that outwardly supported our struggle and i have long believed that this was the one key ingredient missing in our fight i speak quite often with many many members of the nsm and of other organizations around the world as most of you know my position within the nsm keeps in constant contact with those in leadership positions many times i was asked why i did not run campaign of my own and represent the nsm nationally many times i smiled and declined saying that i wasnt the one sitting at the banquet that friday night at nsms national meeting i listened intently to the speakers one from the nsms leadership that spoke that night had bad thing to say about anyone that had parted ways with the organization names were mentioned phone numbers given out home addresses distributed the speakers spoke of unity progress and moving on despite having some rough times it was sitting there that night listening to people who spoke from the heart that i knew what my decision had to be the next day i informed commander schoep jeff if i may of my decision i will speak of him in this context as jeff because in this situation he is my friend first my leader second i told jeff that i was willing to take on the task of representing the nsm and the movement nationally despite the backbiting and rudimentary character attacks going on jeff did not orchestrate my candidacy to get even with taylor or to split the white vote jeff schoep was shocked when i told him that i would do it but because he knows whats in my heart he knew that i meant it you see let say this yes i am endorsed by the nsm and yes i am an nsm member however just as my friend jeff believes in his heart this candidacy this struggle this movement is not solely about the nsm it is about the future it is about survival it is about america i serve my heart i serve my cause and jeff knew when he accepted my offer that i would run this campaign in way that would benefit as many true believers as possible if anyone has read my email that was sent out to over 100 pro white organizations you know that i am offering my campaigns resources to all groups that believe as we believe the door is open you dont have to be an nsm member to support this effort you dont have to be the nsm to benefit from this this campaign is about what the movement can get out of it not what i can get or what my party can get the brian holland for president campaign is real presidential campaign registered with the federal elections commission and my name will appear on the ballot on november 4 in ten to fifteen states i am not write in candidate nor am i delusional enough to think that i can become president of the united states in 2008 granted it would prove entertaining but i just dont think its in the cards ive been accused of splitting the white vote by taylor and some other folks let address that briefly number one im going to be on actual ballots i will be the only pro white candidate to appear on said ballots so i am not splitting the vote on the contrary anyone who runs non ballotted campaign would be splitting the vote in that case thanks to my years as mainstream talk radio host an award winning journalist and professional campaign consultant i exercised my contacts and have actual state organizations in place at this time we are running this campaign just like any other viable candidate would be running now as i said i am not delusional nor am i certifiable i do not believe for an instant that i can win on november 4 why then am i running let answer that briefly as well i am running to deliver message that good hard working white citizens may not otherwise hear i am running to assist in the education of america to assist in the recruitment of fresh blood into the movement do i hope it benefits the nsm of course i do but on the other hand i hope it benefits us all i made the statement few days ago that i still consider taylor and nick to be brothers now thats probably contrary to what many of my colleagues would state however they are brothers to and they are doing what they think is right i encourage that if i had my way there would be 100 of us running national campaign that would be 100 people spreading the word providing education and working to unite movement that needs to be united very desperately i expect the attacks to continue i expect to be called an agent of evil tool of the establishment whatever else you call someone when you have nothing better to say however keep in mind the more i am attacked by my own people the more the enemy knows that they have nothing to worry about that is not the message that this campaign wants to project and i would think that its message that true real pro white representative would want to project i was told in an email shortly after my announcement that i would be treated like the enemy that didnt upset it saddened i have white enemies within the movement we may all be travelling on different paths but hopefully we all have the same destination i will not conduct negative attacks against my white brothers i whole heartedly refuse in closing i have used the word unity quite bit and it is theme of this campaign and i believe in my heart that this movement once force of tens of thousands of americans can once again be united to strong political force just as we filled madison square garden with twenty thousand members in the 1920s i believe with all of my being that we can attain that force again in saying this i will tell you now when my vice presidential running mate is announced it will be someone from outside of the nsm someone that will carry the banner of our struggle proudly and gallantly someone who is not part of the ego game i will chose wisely and i hope that together this campaign and all of white america can move on thank you and i look forward to your continued support prev by date re greetings from the nsm next by date re fw greetings previous by
