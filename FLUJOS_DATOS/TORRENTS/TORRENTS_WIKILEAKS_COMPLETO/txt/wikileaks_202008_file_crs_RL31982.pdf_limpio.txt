oversight summary since the current insurance regulatory framework was established by congress in the mccarranferguson act of 1945 vari ous proposals have been advanced to revise this system in the past few year s members of congre ss and various interest groups have put forward ideas including fullscale federal insurance regulator an optional federal charter and federally mandated but state controlled harmonization of state regulation proponent s of federal involvement ve argued that the current system puts insurers at significant disadvantage in competing with other financial institutions both nationally and internationally who have more streamlined regulatory systems opponents have argu ed that the federal option is unnecessary and would weaken consumer protecti on congressional committees have held numerous hearings examining the argument s and evidence put forth by the various sides in the debate insurance regulation began in the states in the early 19th century in the mid19th century the supreme court decided paul v virginia which foreclosed federal regulation of insurance state regulation of insurance grew in scope and scale during the next 80 years the court reversed itself in 1945 in southeastern underwriters v us establishing that congress did have authority to regulate insurance and insurers at the time many worried that southeastern underwriters vitiated state authority to tax and regulate insurers so congress acted the mccarranferguson act the act ceded to states the authority to regulate insurance and exempted insurers from most federal antitrust laws since 1945 several trends have emerged courts have circumscribed the antitrust exemption substantially congre ssional involvement in and oversight of insurance has increased and the nationa l association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted national role in establishing standa rds for states regulation of insurers financial solvency the naic s also become involved in establishing international standards for insurance regulation this report provides the historical b ackground for examining the arguments in this debate it shows that state regulation of insurance is largely historical artifact that congress has become increasingly involved in both regulating insurance and overseeing states regulation of insurance and that the national association of insurance commissioners has assumed na tional role it will be updated only following major legislative actionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31982contents v r v i w 1 b s i c s f i n s u r n c r g u l t i n

state in theory only the state that charters the insurer regulates its internal business practices this principle is generally observed in the breach however as the largest states such as new york and

insurance commissioners sets standards for both market practices and solvency though individual states may modi fy or ignore any naic standard1 why regulate insurers the purpose of insurance regulation stated classically is to protect consumers by monitoring the solvency of insurers and their business practices the idea was that consumers were not in an equal ba rgaining position with insurers so it was necessary for the government to regulate the terms of insurance contracts likewise it was necessary since the consumer was purchasing promise that the insurer would perform in the future for the government to regulate prices in order to prevent insurers from charging either too little which would endanger the insurers solvency and render the promise illusory or too much which would be unfair insurance has also been regulated for economic social and political purposes since the 1960s congress has stepped in wh markets have actually failed or when its constituencies have perceived that the market has failed2 in some cases congress has created new programs such as medicar or has revised in surance regulation to expand availability such as authorizing risk retention groups in other cases congress has created new standards for insurance such as those for medigap insurance state legislators have responde d to market failures or the perception of market failures by mandating certain benefits in health insurance policies or by creating special programs such as ca lifornias earthquake pool and floridas windstorm pool3 these decisions represent regulation to make insurance available and affordable to anyone who wants its be nefits federal and state efforts to make health insurance both available and affordable is the classic example insurance has also been regulated to protect the insurance franchise state insurance regulators have litigated for many years to maintain exclusive jurisdiction over federal banks insurance activities for example historically insurers wanted regulation to protect their franchise that is to exclude other entities from the risk financing market as alternative markets for financing risk have expanded however large insurers have found that current stat insurance regulation is not barrierto entry against their competitors not organized as insurers some are now suggesting that insurance should be regulated

regulators such as the financial stability forum4 have insisted on regulating international insurers for financial soundness and transparency other macroeconomic purposes would be to avoid regulatory arbitrage among financial sectors and to maximize efficiency of capital allocation much of the debate about whether char tering of insurance companies should continue as solely state function arises from the absence of consensus on the purposes of regulating insuran ce or types or insurance how does state regulation work the solvency of each insurer is regulated primarily but not exclusively by its domiciliary commissioner each state requires the insurer to prepare its quarterly and annual financial statements in very conservative format unique to insurance known as statutory accounting5 the naic as an organization sets the rules for statutory accounting and determines the content of the statements each insurer must file its statement with its domiciliary commissione r with the commissioner in each state in which it is licensed or does business nd with the naic corporate office though the formats are usually similar to the naics they are not identical particularly among the larger states each state may make its own assessment of the solvency of insurers in practice many states rely heavily on the naic corporate offices extensive financial database analysis in making that assessment each state regulates the terms of each insurance contract sold to consumers in that state every insurer as condition of retaining its license to operate in that state must obtain the insurance departments prior approval of insurance policies to be marketed there in many states propertycasualty companies selling personal lines coverage such as automobile and hom eowners insurance must obtain prior approval of the rates they plan to charge as well as of the terms of the policies they plan to market states regulation of comme rcial coverages is also extensive though not all require prior pproval of both rates and forms all states regulate advertising many require prior approval of advertising in an attempt to reduce the regulatory burden on individual states and on insure rs the naic has recently established an online system for electronic rate and form filing serff and an online coordinated rate and form review authority cafra6 observers disagree on whether these on line filing and approval systems are providing or can provide regulatory uniformity and efficiency7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31982crs4 7 continued procedures in bests review vol 102 apr 2002 p

the internal and external business practices of insurers domiciled in that state and many also regulate those licensed in their states as well often the naic has establis hed standards for those business practices most but not all states enact or promulgate those standards8 these standards are known as the naic model laws and regulations in the late 1980s and early 1990s states ability and commitment to regula insurers for solvency was in question subject to substantial criticism during the 103rd congress in response the naic began voluntary program to encourage states to dopt those standards states that adopted certain standards that the naic considered to be fundamental to solvency regulation were said to be naicaccredited currently all states but new york are naic accredited9

offering financial actuarial legal computer market conduc t and economic expertise to insurance regulators10 it began in 1871 and continued for nearly century as cooperative effort by the appointed or

outofstate insurers at much higher rate19 in years with few large fires fire insurers profited after large fires many local fire insurers became insolvent the fire insurers addressed the insolvencies what they perceived to be destructive competition by establishing cartels to keep rates high enough to provide adequate reserves to cover future fires state legislatures responded to the insolvencies by establishing administrative agencies to set reserve requirements and to collect information about company solvency 20 court says insurance is not interstate commerce insurers objected to the discriminatory taxes and to regulation and in 1866 they challenged in congress and in the courts the states authority to impose them they were unsuccessful in persuading congress to enact legislation21 and unsuccessful in test case charging that states were depriving them of equal protection under the law and imp eding interstate commerce in that test case the us supreme court disagreed with the insurers holding in paul v virginia22 in 1868 that corporation was not titled to the protections accorded citizen under the constitution and that an insurance contract was not an article of commerce within the meaning of its commerce clause therefore the court reasoned the commerce clause did not deprive states of the power to tax and regulate outofstate corporate insurers some analysts believe the court may have reached this conclusion to curtail the growing power of corporations generally and to avoid upsetting host of state regu latory and taxing laws which would have left the insurance companies free for the time being from all control23 the decision in paul v virginia meant not only that states could continue to subject insurers from other states to requirement s not imposed on local insurers but also that congress arguably had authority to regulate insurance policies paul v virginia was upheld in later

life insurers found serious abuses and in 1906 recommended sweeping new laws to govern their internal operations some states followed new yorks lead in enacting governance laws for insurers the 1906 san francisco earthqua ke bankrupted many fire insurers and new yorks merritt committee recommended collaborative rate setting for fire insurers to prevent future insolvencies most states followed new yorks example in encouraging collaborative rate setting boards or bureaus25 court reverses says insura nce is interstate commerce missouri did not follow new yorks lead in allowing collaborative rate setting instead in 1922 it attempted to curtail fire insurance rate increases but the fire insurers bribed the pendergast political machine to maintain them when the missouri attorney general di scovered that in 1939 he and the us attorney general obtained criminal indictment against the largest ratesetting bureau the south eastern underwriters associa tion for violations of fede ral antitrust laws the fire insurers challenged the charges on the ground that insurance was not commerce based on paul v virginia and that therefore the federa l court had jurisdiction over them divided supreme court disagreed with the insurers once more it found in us v southeastern underwriters association26 that the federal court did indeed have jurisdiction over them because insurance was clearly interstate commerce and congress had authority under the constituti on to regulate in terstate commerce congress had not acted to regulate insurance specifically said the court but it certainly had the power to include insure rs within the scope of the antitrust law which four of the seven justices voting determined congress had done27 the courts decision t hough it did not do so expressly effectively overruled paul v virginia because southeastern underwriters held that insurance was interstate commerce it caused consternation among insu rers regulators and state legislators the decision created uncertainty about whether and to what extent states could tax or regulate and about whether insurers could continue to use rating bureaus insurers regulators and the states asked

is not extensive it appears that cession of this authority to the stat was not controversial34 it limited the shortterm application of the federal antitrust laws to the business of insurance by granting an immediate moratorium on their enforcement35 the purpose was to allow states to decide during the period of the moratorium whether to allow insurers to set rates collectively36 the breadth of the threeyear moratorium was debated intensely on the house and senate floors37 in both bodies the majority agreed that the act would allow states for the period of the temporary moratorium to enact laws to regulate insurance that otherwise would not be llowed under federa l antitrust laws limited only by the acts prohibition on boycotts coercion and intimidation38 they felt this timelimite

to the business of insurance48 the model known as an act relating to unfair thods of competition and fair and deceptive practices in the business of insurance prohibited certain marketing and sales practices and gave the enacting states insurance co mmissioner broad powers to investigate insurers49 all states enacted the model though not as quickly as they had the rating laws naic intended to occupy the field of insurance regulation and thereby preempt federal law pursuant to the mcca rranferguson act that it had advocated50 the relevant section of the act however granted the reverse preemption only to the extent that the business of insurance was regulated by state law51 the scope of the reverse preemption depended therefor on several factors one was the definition of insurance was insurance any contract issu ed by an entity chartered as an insurer and who should decide th at state insurance regulators second was the breadth of the term the business of insurance did the business of insurance include any and all activities of insurers or only some subset of them the third factor was the meaning of the phrase to the extent could states gain preemption merely by enacting statute or did preemption pend on some level of enforcement of that statute these were questions for the courts courts narrow scope of mccarranferguson act in the years since the passage of th mccarranferguson act courts have substantially narrowed its scope the important cases have arisen when insurers or the naic have asserted that the act exem pts some activity or product from

take and whether or not they would result in effective uniformity of regulation were also voiced on march 31 2004 the subcommittee on ca pital markets held what was described as the committees 14th meeting of some kind on the question of insurance regulation in the past three years entitled working with state regulators to increase insurance choices for consumers this hearing focused on road mapfor insurance legislation developed by full committee chairman oxley and subcommittee chairman baker and publicly proposed by chairman oxley at the naic spring meeting on march 14 2004129 while not fully formed legislative proposal at the hearing the concept calls for allowing states to continue regulating insurance while enacting some federal requirements on what the state regulation should look like the model seems to be the narab provisi ons that were in glba but expanded to other areas such as commercial form preapproval company licensing market conduct examinations and general rate regulation both industry groups and representatives of the states expressed ge neral support for the concept although some noted that it falls short of the federal char ter that parts of the industry have sought letter from number of consumer groups presented at the hearing by robert hunter of the consumer federation of amer ica expressed concern that the road map would override what they see as critical c onsumer protections enacted by the stateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31982crs24 particularly regulation of insurance rates mr hunter indicated his support of greater uniformity but stressed that this uniformity should not come at the expense of such consumer protections the senate committee on commerce science and transportation signaled its interest in insurance issues w ith hearing on october 22 2003 entitled federal involvement in regulation of the insurance industry although the hearing was not specifically called to examine s 1373 disc ussion of the bill was prominent during the hearing senator hollings expressed the rationale behind the bill namely his conviction that state regulation of insure rs has failed to oversee the industry and protect consumers sufficiently and that it is time to federalize the system in order to do so reaction to this proposal was mixed with for example one of the two consumer advocates on the panel robert hunter of the consumer federation of america supporting federalization the ot her douglas heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights expressed his belief that if done properly state regulation is sufficient to protect cons umers as demonstrated in californias proposition 103 the witnesses from the in surance industry generally supported either federal charter that is optional not mandatory or continued state regulation of insurance the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs held the last hearing focusing on insurance regulatory issues in the 108th congress on september 22 2004 entitled examination and oversight of the condition and regulation of the insurance industry this hearing covered wide rang of issues relating to federal intervention in the insurance regulatory system particularly distinguishing this hearing compared to earlier ones was the discussion of the draft legislation that had been circulated in the house the month be fore some skepticis m was expressed over lack of enforcement provisions in the house draft and mr hunters testimony included another letter criticizing the draft for lack of consumer protection particularly the preemption of state rate

these contracts did not exist in 1933 and 1934 when the federal securities laws were enacted ibid at 6769 appendix how federal courts narrowed the mccarranferguson acts reverse preemption major historical cases congress passed the mccarranferguson ac t in 1945 as compromise after the walterhancock bill which would have imposed an absolute preemption of federal law failed in 1944130 not only did the compromise leave many unanswered questions but also as time passed and the industry changed new ones arose supreme court decisions on t hose questions have narrowed the scope of the mccarranferguson reverse preemption as this review of the historically important cases shows this analysis omits the long line of cases interpreting the preemption in the employees retirement income security act erisa of state insurance laws such as mandated benefits in those cases em ployers and insurers argued that erisa excluded completely any and all state insurance regulation of employee health plans notwithstanding the mccarran ferguson act the line ended in theory at least in the recent supreme court decision in kentucky association of health plans v miller 131 which separated the erisa anal ysis from reference to mccarran ferguson132 what is insurance sec v valic133 established that the defin ition of insurance under mccarran ferguson is federal question not state one in this case the securities and exchange commission wanted insurers issuing variable annuity contracts to register them as securities under th federal securities laws134 the insurers refused asserting both that the mccarranferguson act shielded them from federal regulation and that even if it did not they qualified for the insurance exemptions from the federal securities laws the court held that neith er state regulation of variable annuities nor their issuance by insurers qualified them as insurance this meant both that insurers and regulators could not prevent fede ral regulation using mccarranferguson nor avail themselves of the exclusion for i nsurance from the federal securities lawshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31982crs26 135 nationsbank of nc v vari able annuity life ins co 513 us

federal interest in protecting shareholders is in this situation perfectly compatible with the paramount st ate interest of protecting policyholders 140 ibid at 459 the mccarranferguson act was an attempt to turn back the clock to assure that the activities of in surance companies in dealing w ith their policyholders would remain subject to state regulation 141 ibid at 457 142 ibid at 461463 143 kimball and heaney supra note 19 at 104105nationsbank v valic135 established that for purpos of federal banking law selling fixed annuities is the business of banking and is not exclusive to insurers in this case the comptroller of the currency had by letter ruling determined that fixed annuities were not insurance but rather were financial investment instruments of the kind congressional authorization permits banks to broker136 an insurer issuing and selling nnuities challenged the comptrollers authority to allow banks to sell insurance the court agreed with the comp troller that the presence of mortality risk does not qualify an investment as insurance and that federal banking law does not plainly require automatic reference to state insurance law 137 this decision affirmed that the definition of insurance is federal question and that neither insurers nor state regulators can use mccarranfergusons reverse preemption to exclude federal regulation what is the bus iness of insurance national securities138 established that mccarran fergusons reverse preemption of federal law did not extend beyond regulation to protect policyholders139 it did not extend to all insurers ac tivities regulated by state insurance commissioners under state laws140 in this case the securities and exchange commission wanted to unwind merger between insurance comp anies that had been approved by the domestic insurance commissioner pursuant to st ate law as the sec thought that the insurers shareholders had not been give n correct or appropria information about the terms of the merger the insurers had objected to the secs assertion of jurisdiction arguing successfully in the wer courts that mc carranferguson barred it the supreme court disagreed with th lower courts and with the insurers holding that state statute aimed at protecting the intere sts of those who own stock in insurance companies did not come within the sweep of the mccarranferguson act since it is not state attempt to regulate the business of insurance 141 the court went on to say that the mcca rranferguson act furnishes reason for refusing the remedies the sec is seeking142 this meant the scope of the reverse preemption was much narrower than its supporters had hoped143httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31982crs27 144 group life health ins co v royal drug co 440 us 205 1979 145 ibid at 211 the exemption is

logical extension of the national securities decision and erroneously confined the royal drug indices to antitrust issues ibid at 512518royal drug144 established that insurers ex emption from antitr ust laws under mccarranferguson likewise did not extend to all their business activities145 i t extended instead only to those practices that spread or transfer policyholders risk are integral to the relationship between the insurer and the insured and are limited to entities within the insurance industry146 in this case pharmacies that had declined to contract with blue shield to limit dr ug costs for its policyholders brought an antitrust action against blue shield alleging an unlawful boycott after analyzing in detail mccarranferguson and its legislativ history the court concluded that the contracts between blue shield and the pharmacies could not be considered the business of insurance since they did not transfer risk but merely arranged for purchase of goods and services147 since they did not directly affect the contract between the insured and the insured148 and since congress had intended to exempt only collective ratemaking from the antitrust laws149 this meant that most insurers business practices other than collective ratemaking were subject to the federal antitrust laws us v fabe150 established that states laws for liquidating insurers do constitute the business of insurance and therefor preempt conflicting federal statute but only to the extent necessary to protect the insolvents policyholders151 in this case the united states had claims on the assets of an insolvent insurer which it asserted had priority under federal bankruptcy law over ll other claimants including policyholders the state insurance commissioner administering the insolvency objected asserting that the states prio rity scheme under which all government claims ranked last pr eempted the federal law152 the court analyzed section 2 of the mccarranferguson act and its legislative history closely it concluded that federal law must yield to the extent the state liquidation statute furthers the interests of policyholders153 the federal law need not yield said the court to the extent that the state liquida tion statute is designed to further interests of other creditors 154 this meant that mccarranferg uson could subordina the federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31982crs28 155

is act of congress shall be construed to invalidate impa ir or supercede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of in surance unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance the statutor exception to that exemption is section 3b codified at 15 usc 1013b nothing contained in this act shall render the said sherman act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott coerce or intimidation or act of continuedgovernment as creditor only with respect to policyholders but not with respect to general creditors155 must state regulation be effective to preempt federal law ftc v national casualty156 established that mcca rranfergusons reverse preemption did not depend on the quality of state regulation157 in this case the federal trade commission ordered two multistate insurers to stop using advertising that it found violated the federal trade commission act as false deceptive and misleading158 the court agreed that the mccarranferguson act withdrew from the ftc the authority to regulate the defendant insurers advertising practices in those states which are regulating t hose practices under their own laws159 the court expressly declined to examine whether the states laws had been effectively applied160 what is boycott coercion or intimidation st paul v barry161 established that federal antitrust laws may be applied to certain disputes between insurers and their policyholders162 in this case only four insurers offered medical malpractice insurance in state one of them st paul stopped selling it with terms most favor able to the insureds offering only coverage with less favorable terms the three other insurers in the market also refused to sell the more favorable coverage to any of st pauls policyholders those policyholders sued alleging that the in surers had engaged in an unlawful boycott the insurers asked for the case to be dismissed as barred by mccarranferguson the us supreme court held that the suit should not be dismissed since the insurers alleged concerted refusaltodeal came within the statutory exception in the mccarranferguson act163 it did not matter said the court that the floor debateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31982crs29 163 continued boycott coercion or intimidation the insure rs were arguing that the acts section 2b exemption trumped the section 3 b exception to the exemption 164 st paul v barry supra note 183 at 551552 note 24 see also ibid at 547 the debates make clear that the boycott excep tion was viewed by the acts proponents as an important safeguard against the danger that insurance companies might take advantage of purely permissive state regulation to establish monopolies and enter into restrictive agreements falling outside of the realm of statesupervised cooperative action 165 the case came before the supreme court on motion to dismiss so the courts decision meant that mccarranferguson provided shield against the mere allegation of boycott ibid at 533534 see also kimball v heaney supra note 19 at 157 166 hartford fire ins co v california 509 us 763 1993 167 ibid at 800811 168 ibid at 803 169 ibid at 805809 of course as far as the sherman act outside the exempted insurance field is concerned concerted agreements on contract terms are unlawful the mccarran ferguson act however makes that conspiracy lawful unless the refusal to deal is boycott ibid at 803 and 810811 170 courts have since held that defendant insu rers concertedly refusing to deal on terms satisfactory to plaintiffs have not engaged in illegal boycotts within the meaning of section 3b of mccarranferguson see slagle v itt hartford 102 f3d 494 11th cir 1996 n j auto ins plan v sciarra 103 fsupp 2d 388 dnj 1998during the acts passage expressed intent to proscribe concerted activity by insurers against other insurers or against agents the court reasoned that congress could not have meant to offer the shelter of the antitrust laws only to competitors and agents and not to consumers as well164 this case meant that mere regulation by the states could not shield insurers from all attempts to apply federal antitrust law165 hartford fire v california166 established that refusal to sell contracts with certain terms did not constitute boycott absent proof that the insurers also refused to deal on collateral or unrelated matters167 in this case nineteen states had sued us and foreign insurers alleging they had violated the antitrust laws by acting to force other insurers to sell only policies with terms similar to those in the defendants policies bare majority of the court defined boycott as collective use of unrelated commercial transactions as leverage to achieve the desired terms168 the majority distinguished between concerted refusals to deal on unrelated matters on the one hand and concerted refu sals to deal on particular transactions until the terms of those transactions are satisfactory on th other concerted refusal to deal on certain contract terms was not boycott within the meaning of mccarranferguson said the majority because the terms were central to the insurance contract169 this decision had the effect of narrowing th boycott exception to mccarranfergusons antitrust immunity170
