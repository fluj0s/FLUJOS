alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research d27515 bremerhaven germany abstract the results from 16 aogcm simulations are used to reduce internally generated noise and obtain an improved estimate of the underlying response of 20th century globalmean temperature response to volcanic forcing an upwellingdiffusion energy balance model ud ebm with the same forcing and the same climate sensitivity as the aogcm is then used to emulate the aogcm results the ud ebm and aogcm results are in excellent agreement justifying the use of the ud ebm to determine the volcanic response for different climate sensitivities the maximum cooling for any given eruption is shown to depend approximately on the climate sensitivity raised to power 037 after the maximum cooling for lowlatitude eruptions the temperature relaxes back towards the initial state with an efolding time of 2943 months for sensitivities of 14oc comparisons of observed and modeled coolings after the eruptions of agung chichon and pinatubo give implied climate sensitivities that are consistent with the ipcc range of 1545oc equilibrium warming for 2xco2 the cooling associated with pinatubo appears to require sensitivity above the ipcc lower bound of 15oc and none of the observed eruption responses rules out sensitivity above 45oc 1 introduction an important aspect of the validation of climate models is to compare their responses to estimates of past forcing with observed changes in climate such comparisons may use observed responses to individual forcing events such as volcanic eruptions or on longer time scales observed changes over the past 20100 years in response to full suite of natural and anthropogenic forcings for the latter type of analysis comparison methods based on regression techniques may yield probabilistic information about the climate sensitivity δt2x well recognized as primary source of uncertainty in climate simulations mitchell et 2001 allen et 2004 unfortunately because of the noise of internallygenerated variability in both model simulations and observations and because of substantial uncertainties in the past forcing history arising primarily from anthropogenic aerosol forcing uncertainties regressionbased estimates of see and the short time interval spanned by the event minimizes the effects of other forcings and their uncertainties are highly uncertain and such estimates do little to narrow the uncertainty bounds defined by other methods for example if the applied forcing underestimated the true magnitude of sulfate aerosolinduced cooling over the 20th century the implied value of δt2x would be too low spatial pattern information allows us to define joint probability density functions for aerosol forcing and climate sensitivity but until aerosol forcing uncertainties can be reduced independently these analyses still leave large uncertainties for δt2x an alternative that has been suggested is to use comparisons between the modeled and observed effects of volcanic eruptions for model validation and estimation of the climate sensitivity hansen et 1993 lindzen and giannitsis 1998 there are three difficulties with this approach well articulated by lindzen and giannitsis 1998 lg98 below first even for the eruption of mt pinatubo june 1991 where satellite data have allowed us to define the forcing with reasonable accuracy there are still differences between different estimates of the forcing see eg santer et 2001 uncertainties in the forcings for earlier eruptions are necessarily larger modelbased signals therefore have considerable intrinsic uncertainty second there is signaltonoise ratio problem since the relevant response is on monthly timescale and since the response to an individual eruption decays to negligible amount after only of order 5 years the noise of internallygenerated variability makes it difficult to define the response signal in the observations although some of these noise influences such as the effects of enso variability may be removed by empirical methods see eg wigley 2000 third short timescale events spanning 5 years or less are less sensitive to δt2x than longer time scale processes if the response is relatively insensitive to δt2x then it becomes much more difficult to back out information about δt2x from any modelobserved data comparison lg98 note that the longer time scale response to multiple consecutive eruptions is more strongly dependent on δt2x as pointed out and quantified earlier by wigley 1991 so this may provide an alternative way to obtain information on δt2x from the observational record unfortunately this approach is confounded by the effects of and uncertainties in other forcings both natural and anthropogenic lg98 attempted to estimate δt2x from the globalmean temperature response to volcanic forcings using threebox energybalance climate model with limiteddepth 400m diffusive ocean the authors show that this very simple model emulates the results of slightly more realistic upwelling diffusion energybalance model ud ebm hoffert et 1981 but the lg98 model still has admitted shortcomings in this paper we use more detailed ud ebm to investigate the effect of δt2x on the response to 20th century volcanic forcings in order to determine the credibility of the ud ebm in this context we compare its results to those obtained using fully coupled atmosphereocean general circulation model aogcm the climate sensitivity of the aogcm is fixed by the models physics and parameterizations the simpler model however has userspecified climate sensitivity thus provided the simpler model is able to match the results of the aogcm when its sensitivity is set equal to that of the aogcm the simpler model may be run for range of climate sensitivities to see how various characteristics of the response to volcanic forcing vary as the sensitivity is changed 2 analytical results some important insights into the influence that climate sensitivity has on the response to volcanic forcing can be gained by solving simple onebox climate model the simplest possible model for the effect of external forcing on globalmean temperature is represented by the equation c dδtdt δts qt where c is heat capacity term qt is the applied external forcing s replacing δt2x for simplicity is the climate sensitivity ie the equilibrium temperature change for unit radiative forcing and δtt is the change in globalmean temperature δtt must be function of c and s and we can show that the relative importance of these two terms depends on the characteristic time scale for qt to do this suppose that qt is sinusoidal qt sinωt the solution is then δtt ωτ21ωτ2 exptτ s1ωτ2asinωt ωt cosωt where τ is characteristic time scale for the system τ sc note that the sinecosine term can be written in the form sinωtφ showing that the asymptotic response follows the forcing with lag φ but the expanded form is more convenient here we now consider two endmember cases for highfrequency and lowfrequency forcing for the latter ω 1τ the asymptotic solution is simply the equilibrium response δtt s sinωt showing appreciable lag between forcing and response with the response being linearly dependent on the climate sensitivity and independent of the systems heat capacity for the highfrequency case ω 1τ the solution is δtt aωc sinωt π2 showing quarter cycle lag of response behind forcing with the response being independent of the climate sensitivity the critical question then is what is the appropriate time scale for volcanic forcing relative to the characteristic time scale τ for the climate system if representative values are used for c and s δt2x and realistic volcanic forcing time scale corresponding to ω 1 to 3 radians per year is assumed then we can show that the response to volcanic forcing should have relatively small but nonnegligible dependence on the climate sensitivity this is in accord with model simulation results obtained by wigley 1991 and by lg981 1 for more general analytical treatment in the frequency domain accounting for ocean mixing as an upwellingdiffusion process see wigley and raper 1991 the results are qualitatively the same as derived here 3 defining the volcanic response signal we begin by defining the response to 20th century volcanic forcing based on simulations with fully coupled aogcm the ncarusdoe parallel climate model pcm washington et 2000 we use results from simulations carried out by ammann et 2003 2004 which employ new forcing history developed by ammann in total there are 16 simulations that include volcanic forcing comprising fourmember ensembles for 4 experiments with volcanic forcing alone v volcanic plus solar forcing vs volcanic plus solar plus ozone forcing vso and combined volcanic solar ozone wellmixed greenhouse gases and direct sulfate aerosol forcing vsoga all in addition we have 4 short unforced controlrun experiments spanning the same interval an estimate of the volcanic response signal can be obtained simply by averaging the 4 members of the v ensemble this ensemble averaging reduces the noise about the volcanic response signal by factor of about two to be more specific for the control runs which like all of the simulations are driftcorrected see below the interannual standard deviation over 18901999 averaged over 4 ensemble members is 0171oc this provides an estimate of the aogcms internallygenerated variability that is superimposed on the volcanicallyinduced temperature signal in any single simulation averaging 4 simulations should reduce this noise to about 0086oc we can obtain an independent estimate of the background variability by using the magicc climate model see below to estimate the pure signal as shown in fig 2 subtracting this signal from each of the 4 aogcm volcanoonly v runs and then calculating the standard deviation of the residuals the mean of this standard deviation is 0173oc consistent with the raw controlrun variability and providing useful check on the accuracy of the magicc signal estimate after ensemble averaging over the 4 volcanoonly runs the residual variability about the estimated pure signal is reduced to 0090oc very close to the theoretical value of 01732 0086oc further reduction in the noise is possible by making use of the other runs that include volcanic forcing for these cases results for companion experiments to vs vso and all are available see wigley et 2004 and these may be subtracted from the withvolcanicforcing cases to give residual volcanoonly results eg vresid vs s where s is solar forcingalone ensemble etc the gain here is less than might naively be expected because by virtue of their construction method the residual volcanic cases have amplified noise which partly offsets the noise reduction that arises from the increase in sample size when all 16 volcano runs ie four from v and four each from vs v vso so and all soga are averaged the residual variability reduces to 0059oc the reduction in noise compared with what would be obtained from single aogcm realization is 65 potentially more important consideration in defining the volcanic signal is the problem of spatial drift in the aogcm which is considerable at the hemisphericmean scale warming of 0156occentury in the sh and cooling of 0167occentury in the nh these trends are common to all simulations see wigley et 2003 we consider only globalmean changes here however for which the pcms drift is small 0011occentury nevertheless drift effects are removed in all the data we consider the resulting time series consisting of the averaged volcanic signal plus reduced noise is compared with the results for single realization in fig 1 characteristic signature for the response to an individual eruption is clearly seen for santa maria agung chichon and pinatubo rapid cooling over the first 718 months followed by an approximately exponential relaxation back to the initial state the relaxation time will be discussed further below comparing the two panels of fig 1 shows how averaging over multiple realizations leads to much more welldefined volcanoresponse signature than can be seen in any individual volcano response experiment the individual response case corresponds to the real world where we also have only single realization so the top panel graphically illustrates the signaltonoise ratio problem alluded to earlier 4 validating the ud model we now compare the aogcm results with results obtained using simple upwellingdiffusion energy balance model ud ebm viz the magicc2 model used in various ipcc reports wigley and raper 1992 2001 raper et 1996 as part of the ipcc third assessment report tar magicc was calibrated by one of the present authors raper against different aogcms using the 1 compound co2 increase experiments coordinated under cmip covey et 2003 see raper et 2001 and the appendix in cubasch and meehl 2001 pcm was one of those models so we use the tar calibration results to define the model parameters in magicc the parameters are the climate sensitivity the landocean sensitivity ratio the oceanic mixedlayer depth the oceans effective vertical diffusivity the rate of change of upwelling rate as function of temperature and land ocean and interhemispheric heat exchange rates note that magicc separates the globe into land and ocean boxes in each hemisphere applying these long time scale calibration results to the much shorter time scales of volcanic eruption is quite severe test of the ud ebm there is still one unspecified parameter the primary forcing from the aogcm simulations is produced as optical depth od changes defined at some specified frequency while the ud ebm requires input as forcing at the top of the troposphere in w m2 the conversion factor between these two is uncertain work at the goddard institute for space studies illustrates this uncertainty in their early work lacis et 1992 the conversion for od at 055μm for small 2 model for the assessment of greenhousegas induced climate change forcings is 30 w m2 in hansen et 1997 it is 27 w m2 while in hansen et 2002 it is 21 w m2 results from pcm suggest value slightly less than the hansen et 2002 value we chose value of 20 w m2 as somewhat arbitrary estimate and it is these results that are shown here slightly better results might be obtained by tuning this value another difference between the aogcm and ud ebm experiments is in the nature of the input forcing in the aogcm the forcing is specified month by month as zonalmean loading patterns of stratospheric aerosol ammann et 2003 in the ud ebm it is only hemisphericmean forcings that are specified but the input is still on monthly time scale figure 2 compares the pcm results as shown in fig 1b with the magicc results the very close agreement justifies our use of magicc with different climate sensitivities to obtain reliable estimates of how the volcanic response varies with sensitivity with some confidence3 3 note that we have already used the magicc simulation in fig 2 as the true signal to determine the residual variability about the volcanic signal in the pcm results the similarity between this residual variability and controlrun variability provided another test of the magicc results 5 effect of different climate sensitivities figure 3 shows magicc results for climate sensitivities of 10oc 20oc and 40oc expressing the sensitivity here as the equilibrium warming for co2 doubling with the forcing for co2 doubling being 535 w m2 for maximum cooling these results show that for any given eruption the cooling depends approximately on the climate sensitivity raised to the power 037 in lg98 from results in their fig 4 the corresponding power is only 020 the time scale for relaxation back to the preeruption state is also dependent on the climate sensitivity with slower decay for larger sensitivity see below further difference from lg98 is that we find the time of peak cooling to be independent of the climate sensitivity lg98 find that this time lags behind the time of peak forcing by 4 to 16 months with greater lag for larger sensitivity in our simulations the lag varies with eruption as consequence of forcing differences between the hemispheres ranging from 1 month novarupta to 8 months agung behind peak forcing ie 3 to 13 months after the eruption for these particular volcanoes for any given eruption this lag is the same for all values of sensitivity we quantified the relaxation time scale by fitting exponential decay curves to the magicc results for the five largest eruptions santa maria novarupta agung chichon and pinatubo in all cases the decay is slower than exponential for the first 1216 months only few months for novarupta is well approximated by an exponential over the next 3050 months and then again slower than exponential the slow early response is result of the initially slow removal of aerosol from the stratosphere the later subexponential decay behavior produces long tail in the response although this is obscured in most cases by subsequent eruption it is impossible to identify this behavior in either the observations or the aogcm results because by the time the subexponential portion is reached the residual cooling is invariably much less than 01oc and consequently obscured by the noise of natural variability which has standard deviation of about 017oc for the same reason assuming purely exponential decay for all times provides an excellent approximation to the true decay curve the bestfit exponential decay times for sensitivities of 10oc 20oc and 40oc are santa maria 27 31 and 34 months novarupta 17 19 and 21 months agung 29 34 and 39 months chichon 31 37 and 43 months and pinatubo 31 37 and 42 months novarupta is anomalous here presumably because of the highlatitude northern hemisphere location of this volcano compared with the much lower latitudes for the other four volcanoes in magicc this geographical influence is captured by the hemispheric differential in the applied forcing and by the landocean and inter hemispheric separations in the model these results are entirely consistent with the decay times assumed by santer et 2001 they are much longer than the decay times for forcing approximately 12 months necessary consequence of the thermal inertia of the climate system the decay times dependence on sensitivity is given approximately by τ 30 δt2x023 using lg98 results their fig 4 the corresponding result is τ 57 δt2x041 lg98 therefore have much longer decay times than those implied by magicc particularly for higher sensitivities such long decay times would not be consistent with pcm given the magicc results for the dependence of maximum cooling on sensitivity it is possible by comparing these results with observations to estimate climate sensitivity values consistent with the observed global mean responses we do this here using modeled and observed maximum coolings for agung chichon and pinatubo the primary difficulty here as noted by lg98 and others eg bradley 1988 robock and mao 1995 is in estimating the observed maximum coolings since these are obscured by natural variability on the monthly to interannual time scale we use the estimates of wigley 2000 here which we reproduce to two decimals for the sake of precision not to be confused with accuracy agung 030 01oc chichon 024 015oc pinatubo 061 01oc where the refers to estimated 2sigma limits these are the most recent maximum cooling estimates for these three volcanoes that account for the effects of enso factor that can significantly obscure the volcanic response signal eg angell 1988 robock and mao 1995 wigley 2000 santer et 2001 the larger uncertainty for chichon arises from the difficulty in removing ensorelated warming in this case the implied sensitivities are agung 128283632oc chichon 030154773ocand pinatubo 179303521oc the central numbers here correspond to the bestestimate cooling values while the other numbers correspond to the 2sigma maximum cooling limits the uncertainties in estimating the observed maximum cooling and the relative insensitivity of volcanic responses to the value of the climate sensitivity combine to leave large uncertainties in the implied climate sensitivity values nevertheless the results are consistent with other empirical sensitivity estimates eg andronova and schlesinger 2001 forest et 2002 harvey and kaufmann 2002 aogcmbased estimates cubasch and meehl 2001 raper et 2001 and with the sensitivity range endorsed by ipcc we note that the cooling associated with pinatubo appears to require sensitivity above the ipcc lower bound of 15oc and that none of the observed eruption responses rules out sensitivity above 45oc it is not possible to use the long time scale behavior of eruptions times greater than few years after peak cooling to obtain additional insight into the value of the climate sensitivity for number of reasons first volcanic forcing is only one of many forcing agents that have acted over the 20th century and the effects of these other forcings and their uncertainties are greater than any residual longterm volcanic signal that may exist second the residual cooling in the long time scale tails that we obtain fig 3 is much less than illustrated in lg98 who have much greater decay times in all cases based on our results this residual cooling is sufficiently small that it must in general be lost within the noise of natural internallygenerated variability third the absolute separation between simulations with different climate sensitivities at least after the first few years decreases with time making the task of their separation from the noise and from each other more and more difficult as time progresses 6 conclusions we have defined the response to 20th century volcanic forcing based on simulations with the ncarusdoe parallel climate model pcm in total there are 16 simulations that include volcanic forcing these multiple realizations allow us to reduce the noise due to internallygenerated variability by 65 and produce much more welldefined volcanoresponse signature than can be seen in the observational temperature record we then compared the aogcm results with results obtained using simple upwellingdiffusion energy balance model model parameters for the ud ebm were chosen independently of the volcano simulations using the results from 1 compound co2 increase experiments the agreement between the aogcm and ud ebm volcanic forcing results was excellent see fig 2 justifying the use of the ud ebm to determine the volcanic response for different climate sensitivities the ud ebm results showed the maximum cooling for any given eruption to depend approximately on the climate sensitivity raised to the power 037 we also found the time scale for relaxation back to the pre eruption state to depend on the climate sensitivity slower decay for larger sensitivity and the time of peak cooling for any given eruption to be independent of the climate sensitivity we quantified the relaxation time scale by fitting exponential decay curves to the ud ebm results for the five largest eruptions santa maria novarupta agung chichon and pinatubo assuming purely exponential decay provides an excellent approximation to the true decay curve the bestfit exponential decay times for climate sensitivities of 10oc 20oc and 40oc are santa maria 27 31 and 34 months novarupta 17 19 and 21 months agung 29 34 and 39 months chichon 31 37 and 43 months and pinatubo 31 37 and 42 months novarupta is anomalous because of the high latitude northern hemisphere location of this volcano compared with the much lower latitudes for the other four volcanoes for these volcanoes the decay time is given approximately by τ 30 δt2x023 by comparing the ud ebm results with observations we estimated the climate sensitivity values consistent with the observations for agung chichon and pinatubo the implied sensitivities are agung 128283632oc chichon 030154773oc pinatubo 179303521oc the central numbers correspond to the bestestimate observed maximum cooling values while the other numbers correspond to the 2sigma maximum cooling limits these results are consistent with other empirical sensitivity estimates and with the sensitivity range endorsed by ipcc the observed cooling associated with pinatubo appears to require sensitivity above the ipcc lower bound of 15oc while none of the observed eruption responses rules out sensitivity above 45oc our conclusion here differs from that of lindzen and giannitsis 1998 these authors conclude that the observations favor low value for the climate sensitivity based on the long time scale response to eruptions the main reason for this difference is because the long time scale response that we obtain using physically more comprehensive and realistic models is substantially less than that obtained by lindzen and giannitsis and so is obscured by the noise of internallygenerated variability and by the effects of other uncertain forcing factors based on our results it is impossible
