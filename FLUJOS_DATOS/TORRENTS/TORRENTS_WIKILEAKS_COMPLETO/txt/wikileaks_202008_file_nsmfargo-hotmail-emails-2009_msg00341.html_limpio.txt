apr 24 2008 143 amsubject conversations on national socialismto commandernewsaxonorg commander greetings obviously i am not horst wessel but i assume and hope you know who horst was or actually what he was made to stand for i have been looking through the numerous web sites as well as watching hours of you tube in an effort to evaluate the current state of national socialism first let state i am national socialist i have been for quite some time however i have not been able to be so publicly i feel much like the werewolfs in germany after 1945 i am what you would call aryan actually of german decent with very much aryan family many children all blond and blue eyes we have our own secret family ceremonys i will be presenting my wife with the golden mothers cross with copy of hitlers mutter child 1910 this weekend she is very much national socialist and would be one publicly if not for i am not harmed at all by the present system in fact i have done very well and make very good living that allows my family to live well and my wife to stay home we want for nothing yet i am revolted at the decadence and the lack of pride and discipline in short i am one of those establishment types that the fuhrer sought out and needed to solidify and yes i am national socialist my cause of concern is on of viability i want national socialist party that is credible american national socialism is and must be fundamentally different than german national socialism for large number of reason culture being first and for most americans are not prone to uniforms and ultra nationalism as my german decedents were i submit to you that if the nasdap were still in power today 70 years after january 30 1933 they would be fundamentally different what we american national socialist need is vienna period im sure you know the significance of that term it is reflection we need to to take account as hitler did in lands berg just prior to 1933 goebbels made the following statements as guidelines 10 commandments for nationalsocialists your country is the mainspring of your life remember this always 1 germany is your fatherland love it above all and more in deeds than in words 2 germanys enemies are your enemies hate them with all your heart 3 every national comrade even the lowliest is part of germany love him as you love yourself 4 demand only duties for yourself then germany will also regain rights and privileges 5 be proud of germany you have right to take pride in fatherland for which millions gave their lives 6 he who abuses germany abuses you and your deceased repay him with your fists 7 repay like with like and then some if you are denied your just rights remember you can secure them again only through your own political movement 8 do not be hooligan antisemitebut beware of the berliner tageblatt 1 9 live your life in such way that one day you will not need to stand ashamed before new germany 10 have faith in the future only thus will you win it please look at the 3 i have underlined the nsdap in germany in the 1920s mandated that all party members review book they printed entitled discipline and order foundations of national socialist ethics please do not consider my comments as any form of mockery or attack quite the opposite as national socialist i want to see party day on the scale of nuremberg by the way have you watched the unedited videos of those party days of what they actually did other then the official speeches it gives you unique insight of how to build political party issues issues issues the current economic times mirror what was happening in germany ie the time is ripe for national socialism what we are lacking is focus mission discipline priority sacrifice evolution and timing i watched the washington march i have been watching for sometime there are groups of untapped potential that are ripe for recruitment but will require much different outreach do you recall how hitler finally got hindenburg to warm to him he held ceremony in potsdam and honored german traditionn essentially married the traditional german culture and traditions with national socialism we must do the same in different manner look at the mormons as an example of how to build organization in the face of public consternation the nsdap in germany built their organization much the same way in the end hitler came out of landberg having gone through another vienna period of reflection he had the courage of conviction to know that if party was to obtain power it would have to evolve and change so willing to do so he sacrificed roehm there are lots of people like lots of national socialists who want to come out of the wood work commander we need home there is lot of talent and resources national socialist talent and resources that is not being tapped i would like to engage in some discussion of issue development as fundamentalist national socialist perhaps i can help you from afar ich kampfe horst wessel be better friend newshound and
