httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21442 freedomcar and the hydrogen fuel initiative are two complementary governmentindustry research and development rd policy initiatives that promote the development of hydrogen fuel and fuel cell vehicles coordinated by the department of energy doe these initiatives aim to make massmarket fuel cell and hydrogen combustion vehicles available at an affordable cost within 10 to 15 years from the launch of the initiatives however questions have been raised about the design and goals of the initiatives this report discusses the organization funding and goals of the freedomcar and fuel partnerships and issues for congress introduction in his state of the union address on january 28 2003 president george w bush announced new 720 million research and development rd initiative to promote hydrogen as transportation fuel the hydrogen fuel initiative is intended to complement the freedomcar initiative1 which focuses on cooperative vehicle research between the federal government universities and private industry the freedomcar initiative replaced related clinton administration initiative the partnership for new generation of vehicles pngv announced in 19932 while both initiatives aimed to increase fuel efficiency of the automotive fleet freedomcar extended the time frame by another 10 to 15 years and focused research on hydrogen fuel 1 freedomcar cooperative automotive research was announced on january 8 2002 at the detroit auto show by energy secretary spencer abraham 2 for more detailed discussion of pngv see crs report rs20852 the partnership for new generation of vehicles status and issues by brent d yacobucci crs2 cell vehicles pngv focused mainly on dieselfueled hybrid vehicles3 through fy2003 the overall level of funding for pngv and freedomcarrelated research at the department of energy doe remained relatively constant with some of the funds for hybrid vehicles transferred to fuel cell research4 for fy2004 however overall funding for research within the office of energy efficiency and renewable energy into hydrogen fuel fuel cells and vehicle technologies increased by about 30 some of this increase was offset by funding reductions in other programs but the major portion of the increase was new funding for fy2005 through fy2008 funding for hydrogen and fuel cell rd steadily increased however for fy2009 the bush administration has requested 30 below the fy2008 appropriation for hydrogen fuel cell and vehicle technologies programs much of that decrease would be offset by an almost doubling of related basic science research overall the request is roughly 4 below fy2008 levels for all related research organization and funding most federal research on hydrogen fuel and fuel cell vehicles is overseen by two offices within the doe office of energy efficiency and renewable energy eere the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21442 office of freedomcar and vehicle technologies fcvt coordinates research on automotive fuel cells and other advanced vehicle technologies including electric propulsion systems vehicle systems materials technology and other areas the office of hydrogen fuel cells and infrastructure technologies hfcit coordinates research on fuel cell technologies for all applications not solely transportation5 as well as research on hydrogen fuel production delivery and storage systems as part of its fy2006 budget request for the hydrogen fuel initiative doe added ongoing research funded through three additional doe offices as well as small amount of research funding at the department of transportation the three doe offices are the office of fossil energy fe the office of nuclear energy ne and the office of science sc members of the partnerships include the federal government and the national laboratories as well as universities state governments vehicle manufacturers energy companies equipment manufacturers and industry groups 3 for more information on fuel

budget request february 2005 volume 3 p 61 crs4 the mission of the hydrogen fuel initiative is to research develop and validate fuel cells and hydrogen production delivery and storage technologies for transportation and stationary applications7 fuel cell rd areas include transportation systems stationary systems fuel processing fuel cell components and technology validation the focus of hydrogen fuel rd includes hydrogen production and delivery fuel storage hydrogen infrastructure safety codes and standards and training and education partnership goals the freedomcar and the hydrogen fuel initiatives have each set four goals for 2015 and share one additional goal between them the shared goal is to produce hydrogenfueled engine systems that achieve double to triple the efficiency of todays conventional engines at cost competitive with conventional engines freedomcars individual goals mainly focus on reducing system costs for various technologies the freedomcar goals are to develop electric drive systems with 15year life and significantly reduced httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21442 hardware costs advanced internal combustion engine systems with double to triple the efficiency of current systems at greater cost and higher emissions than conventional engine systems electrical energy storage with improved life and lower cost than current systems and materials and manufacturing technologies that achieve 50 weight reduction in vehicle structure while maintaining affordability and increasing the use of recyclablerecycled materials the four goals for the hydrogen fuel initiative focus on improvements in fuel cell technology and improvements in the storage and delivery of hydrogen fuel the initiatives goals are to develop hydrogen fuel cell power systems that are durable and deliver higher efficiency at lower cost than todays systems transportation fuel cell systems that deliver greater efficiency and lower cost and meet or exceed emissions standards hydrogen refueling systems that are highly efficient and deliver fuel at the market price of gasoline and onboard hydrogen storage systems with improved energy density and cost over existing systems 7 doe hydrogen fuel cells and infrastructure technologies program mission vision goals httpwwweereenergygovhydrogenandfuelcellsmissionhtml updated january 29 2003 crs5 debate over the initiatives the creation of freedomcar and the presidents hydrogen fuel initiatives have raised debate over several issues these issues include the proper role of the government in rd as well as the proper level of funding and concerns over energy efficiency and fuel consumption some environmental groups including the sierra club have criticized the initiatives they argue that while funding has increased for efficient technologies the initiatives do not require auto manufacturers to make fuel cell vehicles available to customers by any specific time8 also groups such as the natural resources defense council argued that the initiatives were put in place to forestall significant increases in national fuel economy standards9 however in 2007 congress enacted more stringent fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks as part of the energy independence and security act of 2007 pl 11014010 the administration argues that the higher rd funding will provide significant impetus for advancements in hydrogen and fuel cell technologies and that without those httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21442 advancements the technology would be unaffordable for consumers11 further some engineers argue that freedomcars efficiency and cost goals may be difficult to attain in the time frame of the program and that any sort of sales goal would be unrealistic12 moreover industry groups argue that an explicit sales goal could force manufacturers to abandon rd on other promising technologies like gasolineelectric hybrids even among supporters of the program there is criticism that freedomcar and the presidents hydrogen fuel initiative are underfunded and that additional government commitments to hydrogen and fuel cells must be made according to some proponents these commitments could take the form of increased rd funding expanded demonstration programs vehicle and fuel sales or production incentives and other incentives to make these vehicles attractive to customers13 finally some critics argue there are too many technical and economic hurdles to the development of affordable practical hydrogen and fuel cell technology especially for automobiles and that federal research should focus on more realistic goals 8 j l laws budget ii bush ups on hydrogenpowered vehicles greenwire january 29 2003 9 harry stoffer unmoved by hydrogen critics seek higher cafe automotive news january 21 2002

in addition to doe other government agencies are also involved in fuel cell vehicle rd although this funding is considerably lower for example the national automotive center nac part of the armys tankautomotive research development and engineering center tardec coordinates fuel cell vehicle research between the department of defense dod and private contractors and partners with doe the department of transportation dot the environmental protection agency epa academia and industry current legislation the appropriations processes over the next few years will directly affect the future of freedomcar and the presidents hydrogen fuel initiative between fy2004 and fy2008 the administrations stated goal was funding increase for both initiatives of 720 million above fy2003 levels for fy2004 through fy2008 in total congress appropriated an additional 450 million in total between fy2004 and fy2008 for httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21442 hydrogen fuel cell and advanced vehicle programs congress appropriated an additional 145 million for other programs mainly basic sciences for total increase of roughly 600 million over that fiveyear period in addition to appropriations legislation hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles are addressed by other recent legislation on august 8 2005 president bush signed the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 among other provisions pl 10958 authorizes appropriations for hydrogen and fuel cell research at higher levels than requested by the president 33 billion over five years in addition to rd funding the bill provides tax incentives for the purchase of new fuel cell vehicles issues for congressional consideration freedomcar and the presidents hydrogen fuel initiative raise several key issues for congressional consideration some of these issues are given rising federal deficits and the potential for increased defense costs can the federal government afford the recent increase for hydrogen and fuel cell rd should the federal government be picking hydrogen and fuel cell vehicle technologies over other technologies such as hybrid vehicles and lean burn engines would the designation of target deadline for commercialization of fuel cell vehicles help focus the program and make better use of funding resources alternately would such deadline force manufacturers to abandon other promising technologies or create an unfair burden on the industry should the government focus on longterm research or should it focus on technologies closer to commercialization or both is the widespread use of hydrogen and fuel cells technically and economically feasible or is the government taking too large risk on unproven technology
