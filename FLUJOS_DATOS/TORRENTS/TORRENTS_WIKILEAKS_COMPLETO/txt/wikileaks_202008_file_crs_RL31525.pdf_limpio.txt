medicare woul d then cover 95 of all additional drug expenses as long as the beneficiary paid minimum of 2 for each generic drug and preferred multiplesource drug and 5 copayment for all other drugs thus for most beneficiaries medicare w ould not contribute directly to the cost of drugs when annual drug ex penses fall in certain ra nge although medicare would contribute directly toward be neficiary drug expenses at levels below and above this range this aspect of the coverage is of ten referred to as the doughnut hole under medicare part d standard coverage the doughnut hole is between

under the medicare prescription drug benefit introduction on december 8 2003 the medicare pres cription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 was signed in to law hr 1 pl 108173 the law adds part d to medicare which establishe s new voluntary prescription drug benefit that begins in 2006 this report anal yzes how the costsharing and premium provisions under part d would affect th amount that bene ficiary would pay annually for prescription drugs1 in addition this report gives examples of how annual costsharing would differ for benefi ciaries with various levels of total prescription drug spending in 2006 under the plans standard benefit costsharing and insurance insurance acts to reduce uncertainty and individuals exposure to high costs due to catastrophic events such as severe illness in general individuals pay premium and in exchange insurers pay for thei r covered benefits premiums are paid regardless of whether covered expenses are actually incurred in addition to premiums enrollees may also face costsharing which is the portion of total expenses that enrollees mu st pay for covered be nefits costsharing in health plan generally includes some combination of deductibles coinsurance copayments and limits on individuals out ofpocket expenses because these concepts are necessary to evaluate and compare the prescription drug coverage in the proposals they are described in box 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31525crs2 2 beneficiaries will be able to purchase either standard coverage or alternative coverage with actuarially equivalent benefits plans w ith different but actuarially equivalent benefits might have other costsharing requirement s with slightly different deductibles and coinsurance rates 3 all of the nominal dollar amounts related to the benefit will be increased by the nnual percentage increase in average per capita medicare drug expenditures in subsequent yearsbox 1 terms used to describe costsharing deductible the amount an enrollee in an insurance plan must pay outofpocket before the insurer begins paying for covered services generally the enrollee must meet this amount each year plans with deductible are said to provide firstdollar coverage coinsurance rate the percentage of covered costs paid by the enrollee the terms of coverage can specify various coinsurance rates for different aspects of coverage for instance before and after threshold of expenses copayment fixed dollar amount that the enrollee must pay for each covered benefit for instance filled prescription copayment differs from coinsurance in that the copayment amount does not vary with the cost of the service however copayments may differ based on the type of drug for example one copayment amount for brandname drugs another for generic drugs coverage limit the total amount of incurred expenses at which the insurer federal government health care plan etc reduces its contributions to the enrollees expenses for example once an enrollees drug costs exceed th coverage limit the enrollee must pay for most or all the additional drug expenses catastrophic coverage to protect beneficiaries from exposure to extraordinarily large expenses insurers may offer catastrophic coverage wherein the insurer for instance medicare or private health plan typically pays all or almost all additional expenses once an enrollee meets the annual outofpocket protection threshold or catastrophic threshold excluding premiums costsharing arrangements pl 108173 establishes medicare pa rt d which includes voluntary standard prescription drug benefit in medicare that would take effect in 20062 variations in the beneficiar costsharing requirements of the plan will affect the level of potential outo fpocket costs to indi vidual beneficiaries since participation is voluntary expected outofpocket expenses are likely to be critical factor when beneficiaries consider whether to enroll under part d beneficiary with the st andard coverage w ould pay 25 of drug costs after meeting the 250 ductible in 20063 after 2250 in total drug spending the coverage limit the enrollee would pay for all prescription drug spending until reaching the 3600 outofpoc ket protection threshold this amount is often referred to as the true outofpocket threshold because according to the language in the conference agreement costsharing paid on behalf of the enrollee by group health insurance or other thirdpart arrangement does not count toward the 3600 this threshold is reached when to tal spending on prescription drugs exceedshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31525crs3 4 multiplesource drug is covered outpatie nt prescription drug for which there are 2 or more drug products rated as therapeutically and pharmaceutically equivalent by the food and drug administration 5 although the cbo estimate of the aver age monthly premium is 35 in 2006 many medicare beneficiaries will face different m onthly premium amounts for several reasons 1 the drug premiums will be adjusted for ge ographic variation in the price of drugs 2 beneficiaries premiums will be adjusted up or down to reflect the difference between the approved bid of their prescr iption drug plan of choice nd the national average bid amount adjusted for geographic variation and 3 late enrollment penalty will increase the monthly premiums for beneficiaries

to the cost of drugs and the beneficiaries outofpocket expenditures accumulate toward the catastrophic threshold while there may be gap in medicare payments there continues to be coverage and beneficiaries continue to have access to negotiated discounted pricescoverage purchased from medicare prescription drug or medicare advantage plan do not count the doughnut hole under part d medicare does not contribut toward the cost of drugs when an some individuals annual drug expenses fall in certain range that is when expenses are above the coverage limit but below the total amount necessary to reach the outofpocket threshold this aspect of the coverage has been referred to as the doughnut hole6 under part d beneficiaries receiving th standard benefit must pay the full cost of drugs once they reach the coverage limit of 2250 and until their true outof pocket payments reach the catastrophi c cap of 3600 because of the 250 deductible and the 25 coinsurance up to the initial coverage limit beneficiaries with the standard benefit will have spent 750 outofpocket excluding the premium when total of 2250 in drug cost s has been spent assuming none of the costsharing is paid for by group health insurance or other thirdparty arrangement they will have to spend an additional 2850 to reach the catastrophic threshold of 3600 since there is medicare contributi on over this range the beneficiary will bear the full cost of drugs from the coverage limit of 2250 until accumulated drug expenses reach 5100 as shown in figure 1 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31525 crs5 0102030405060708090100

examples examples follow of how much hypotheti cal enrollee with given level of drug costs would pay under the sta ndard coverage in medicare part d in 2006 for given level of prescription drug expenses beneficiarys outofpocket payments will vary depending on the plans deductible coinsurance coverage limit and outofpocket threshold the cost to the government of providing coverage will also vary depending on these plan characteristics as well as the premium charged to enrollees more specifically if plan is designed to increase the beneficiarys share of the cost the governments share of the cost will decrease each of the following examples assumes that none of the costsharing is paid by group health insurance or other third party arrangement the calculations do not consider reductions in ex penditures due to negotiated discounts the effects of formularies and pharmacy be nefit managers pbms or the consequences of incentives to use generic medications example 1 enrollee has zero annual drug costs medicare part d standard coverage 2006 premium 420 total payments 420 in example 1 the enrollee does not have any drug expenditures and therefore would pay only the premiums example 2 enrollees annual drug costs equal 50 medicare part d standard coverage 2006 deductible 50 premium 420total payments 470 in the second example the enrollees annual drug expenditu res equal 50 the 50 in drug costs falls below the plans deductible consequently the enrollee pays the entire 50 plus the premiums example 3 enrollees annual drug costs equal 750 medicare part d standard coverage

payments would occur only for the first 2250 of expenses thus the 3000 in expenses generated by the enrollee would exceed the initial coverage limit by 750 the enrollee would pay these excess expenses outofpocket in total the enrollee would pay the premiums as well as the following costsharing 1 the 250 deductible 2 25 of 2000 where 2000 equals the differe nce between the deductible and the

structure of the benefit and costsharing in part d st andard coverage produces many changes in coinsurance rates and outofpocket costs as total annual drug spending increases as can be seen in the kinks and corners in the figures breakeven the breakeven point is the point where the amount that an individual pays for plans costsharing and premiums is equal to what would have been paid in drug costs in the absence of any drug coverage the line in the figure 2 and figure 3 labeled drug coverage repres ents the amount that an individualhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31525crs15 would pay if he or she did not have any insurance coverage for prescription drugs the breakeven point is where this line is crossed by the line representing outof pocket spending under part d st andard coverage in the figures the line segment to the right of the drug coverage line repr esent levels of drug spending where the enrollee pays less in outofpocket expenses and pr emiums than if they had drug coverage the line segment to the left of this line represent levels of drug spending where the enrollee pays more in outofpocket expenses nd premiums than if he or she had drug coverage based on the premium and costsharing outlined in part d standard coverage the breakeven point is at 810 in total annual drug spending while the breakeven point is one factor in beneficiarys decision whether to participate in this insurance plan other factors such as attitudes toward risk and uncertainty are also important many beneficiaries will be making their decision about whether to purchase the insurance ba sed on their expected annual prescription drug costs and their attitudes towards risk all other things being equal the higher the breakeven point the less likely beneficiaries will be to join
