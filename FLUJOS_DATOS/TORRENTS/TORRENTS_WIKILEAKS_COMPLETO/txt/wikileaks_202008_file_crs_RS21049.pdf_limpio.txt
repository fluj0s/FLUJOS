history of supporting revolutionary moveme nts and governments in latin america and africa but in 1992 then cuban leader fidel castro said that his countrys support for insurgents abroad was thing of the past most analysts accept that cubas policy generally did change largel because the breakup of the soviet union resulted in the loss of billions in subsidies the state departments terrorism report maintains that cuba has remained opposed to us counterterrorism policy and activ ely and publicly condemned many associated us policies and actions it also noted that cuba maintains close relationships with other state sponsors of terrorism such as iran and syria nd has provided safe haven for members of several ftos the farc n and basque eta from spain colombia has publicly

those who support keeping cuba on th list point to the governments history of supporting terrorist acts and armed insurgencies in latin america and africa they point to the governments continue d hosting of members of foreig n terrorist organizations and us fugitives from justice critics of retaining cuba on the terrorism list maintain that it is holdover of the cold war they argu that domestic political considerations keephttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21049crs5 cuba on the terrorism list and maintain that cubas presence on the list diverts us attention from struggles against serious rrorist threats for background see crs report rl32251 cuba and the state sponsors of terrorism list us policy as in other parts of the world the united states has assisted latin american and caribbean nations over the years in their st ruggle against terrorist or insurgent groups indigenous to the region for example in the 1980s the united states supported the government of salvador with significant economic and military assistance in its struggle against leftist guerrilla insurgen cy in recent years the united states has employed various policy tools to combat rrorism in the latin america and caribbean region including sanctions antiterrorism assistance and training law enforcement cooperation and multilate ral cooperation through the oas moreover given the nexus between terrorism and drug trafficking one can argue that assistance aimed at combating drug trafficking organizations in the region has also been means of combating terrorism by cutting off source of revenue for terrorist organizations the same argument can be made regarding efforts to combat money laundering in the region although terrorism was not the main focus of us policy toward the region in recent years attention increased in the aftermath of the 911 terrorist attacks on new york and washington antiterrorism assistance has in creased along with b ilateral and regional cooperation against terrorism congress approved the bush administrations request in 2002 to expand the scope of us assistance to colombia beyond c ounternarcotics focus to also include counterterrorism assistance to the

focused on the potential transit of terrorists through mexico to the united states the united states has imposed sanctions on three groups in colo mbia eln farc and auc and one group in peru sl designated by the department of state as ftos official designation of such groups as ftos triggers number of sancti ons including visa restrictions and the blocking of any funds of these groups in us financial institutions the designation also has the effect of increasing public awareness about these terrorist organizations and the concerns that the united states has about th em as noted above the united states has included cuba on its list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1982 pursuant to section 6j of the eaa and both cuba and venezuel are currently on the annual section 40a aeca list of
