resources for additional staff in turkey to deal with the backlog and it is dealing with the staff performance issues also at present there are vacancies in the protection u nit in general the growth of the backlog is attributed to an increase in the number of asylum s eekers in 2006 oios appreciates that the lack of resources has an impact on the time taken t process cases oios will keep the recommendation open pending confirmation that posit ive action has been taken to reduce the timeline for processing asylum seeker cases 17 fo van was not able to provide oios with its work p lans these should be used as management tool to monitor project implementation they are especially important considering 4 that rsd functions will be mainly centralized in th office of the representation and work plans should now reflect other activities such as b order monitoring and cooperation with the national counterparts recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in turkey should ensure

taken and will close the recommendation on receipt of copy of fo vans workplans 19 oios review of the support protocol between the ge ndarmerie general command of the turkish republic and unhcr on improving accommo dation conditions for migrants entering legally and illegally from eastern border of turkey showed that the document was not sufficiently detailed it did not clearly expla in the actual needs of the concerned population and the ways to assist refugees and asylum seekers as result there was only one transfer of funds from the three planned in 2006 financial reports on the use of funds were received because of the low implementation rate fo van was not properly consulted during the drafting of the protocol recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in turkey within the frame work of the protocol with the gendarmerie should formulate clea r and realistic objectives accompanied by measurable outputs and in dicators in the future field office van should be properly consult ed during the drafting of cooperation documents rec04 20 the representation accepted the recommendation oios is pleased to note that action will be taken and will monitor the implementation f the recommendation which has target date for implementation of 30 april 2007 21 project financial and performance monitoring needed improvement in 2005 and 2006 the programme and administrative unit

followedup to ensure they are implemented rec05 22 the representation accepted the recommendation and agreed to implement financial monitoring visits on regular basis it further st ated that implementing partners were requested 5 to submit an spmr on monthly basis together with all supporting documentation which were subsequently verified oios is pleased to note that action will be taken while the representation may reverify the partners supportin g documents on monthly basis it is oios opinion that this is not an efficient use of unhcr resources periodic visits to the partners premises may be more beneficial in the long term p articularly if further activities are delegated to partners oios will keep the recommendation open pending copies of the planned schedule to review partners activities together with some s amples of the verification reports drafted subsequent to the review b payment of cash grants 23 the representation provides monthly financial assis tance to refugees by way of cash grants totalling us 09 million in 2005 oios was of the opinion that such an activity could be delegated to an implementing partner the representation explained that it is difficult t find reliable implementing partners in turkey since the turkish government does not provide active support to the idea of developing network of non governmental organizations in the country it was stressed that unhcr turkey is in an exceptio nal situation and has been working without ngo implementing partners for more than 30 years while oios appreciates that traditionally unhcr has not worked with many partne rs and that there are possible difficulties of finding suitable partners given the political si tuation oios is of the opinion that the representations efforts in the area of working mor with implementing partners could be further increased once this is established the re presentation could strengthen its project monitoring to ensure the risks of delegating such r esponsibilities are mitigated 24 the payment of cash grants is directly implemented by the representation and beneficiaries are paid via the garanti bank oios review of the systems and procedures in place to manage this activity as well as discussio n on the possible risks associated with the process assessed them as satisfactory 25 the representation transfers money to branches of t he garanti bank in satellite cities along with payment lists beneficiaries sign the pa yment list on receipt and the document is resubmitted to unhcr for reconciliation however u nhcr ankara is experiencing serious difficulties in getting the lists back from the ban k with the details of the unpaid amounts these difficulties in reconciliation increase the risk of incorrect payments the representation has to perform extensive followup work with the branch of fices of the bank up to 25 per cent of the staff time of g5 is spent solving these issues this problem had already been raised by the previous audit but the progress achieved was minim agreement has been signed between the representation and the bank recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in turkey should as res ult of difficulties encountered in obtaining details of paid amounts to refugees take appropriate action to ensure sign ificant improvement in services are received from the garan bank an agreement between the representation and the ban k should be signed rec06 26 the representation accepted the recommendation act ion has already been taken and discussions with the bank officials were held in fe bruary 2007 however despite several written and verbal warnings due to the frequent changes of staff in the bank branches delays in 6 obtaining payment lists still continue the represe ntative will be

has been reached with the bank c medical assistance 27 in the area of medical assistance to the beneficiar ies us 04 million in 2005 and us 03 million in 2006 the respective guidelines were not clear and were only issued in the form of note for the file in oios view they sho uld have been issued under the signature of one of the senior staff of the representation 28 oios noted that guidelines were not followed partic ularly in decisions relating to the percentage of reimbursement of difficult hospital c ases which varied between 25 to 50 per cent similarly decisions about onetime financial assistance cases were made without reference to them oios also found that reimburseme nts of medical costs were continued beyond the 1 august 2006 deadline when according t the new policy adopted by the representation all asylum seekers and refugees sho uld first approach the turkish social solidarity foundation it was decided that only in cases of refusal in writing would the representation review the case despite the fact th at the government has to gradually take over these expenses unhcr should adopt clearer approa ch during the transition period recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in turkey should ensure th at the criteria for medical assistance are consistently applied wit hout exceptions by the field offices and that the criteria are suffici ently clear so that staff need not make their own interpretation of the estab lished procedures rec07 29 the representation accepted the recommendation and stated that it was working on clear criteria for medical assistance and would shortly s end the instructions to all staff in the field offices however it is important to keep some flex ibility and keep room for some humanitarian exceptions to be made by field staff in coordinatio n with the senior management oios is pleased to note that action will be taken and will keep the recommendation open pending copy of the instructions sent to staff 30 in oios view the basis for the monthly lumpsum pay ment of us 6000 paid under the contract for the cankaya clinic in ankara was not c lear also prior to awarding the contract it was not submitted to and approved by the local comm ittee on contracts lcc even though the annual amount exceeded us 70000 oios was of the opinion that the representative and not the head of programme and administrative unit s hould have signed the contract the representation accepted oios recommendation an lc c has already been constituted the contract for the clinic in ankara was renewed and t he representative signed it oios takes note of the positive action taken to implement the recom mendation c supply management 31 there was limited procurement nonetheless the proc edures and internal controls in place should be strengthened oios suggested that p urchasing plans be prepared and 7 consideration be given to procuring items such as s tationery under frame agreement rather than on casebycase basis 32 only one meeting of the lcc was held in 2006 to rev iew the purchase of three air conditioners valued at about us 20002200 this is well below the threshold for the submission to an lcc for approval in oios opinion it is not cost effective to convene an lcc for such low value cases oios also noted that the lcc had not been officially established and members of lamb facto performed the functions of the lcc members the full set of supporting documents for the 2005 l cc meeting for the purchase of computers costing us 23000 could not be provided the lcc lso did not review the ankara cankaya clinic

provided staff members wit h documents stating their annual income and individual tax statements were issued to unhcr staff from their respective tax offices 41 following the adoption of new turkish fiscal legisl ation in 2003 the procedure for the payment of income tax changed the resident coor dinator had reached an agreement with the turkish tax authorities on tax exemption for na tional staff but for some reason it was implemented starting in 2005 oios did not manage t obtain clear understanding of why the implementation date was 2005 and was not backdated to 2003 the date the legislation was enacted oios was also informed that unhcr staff mbers had been specifically asked not to request the turkish tax authorities to reimburse the tax payments retroactively for 2003 and 2004 according

larg office and there was recent investment of 10 us 24000 for installing cabling and security sy stem however the review of the documents and discussion with the responsible officials indic ated that at least one third of these onetime expenses for computer equipment cameras etc cou ld be recovered by transferring the equipment if smaller and cheaper building were to be found an analysis should be done on whether it is cost effective to continue covering t he expenses of premises this size the reduction of the running costs by 50 per cent would result in savings amounting to us 70000 over twoyear period recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in turkey should review th need for such large office in silopi as well as prepare costbenefit analysis of the use of the office reduction of running costs by about 50 per cent could result in savings of up to us 70000 over twoyear period rec 12 48 the representation accepted the recommendation the head of fo van and the
