industry division oil industry profit review 2007 summary increases in the price of crude oil that began in 2004 pushed the spot price of west texas intermediate wti key oil in determining market prices to nearly 100 per barrel in the third quarter of 2007 tight market conditions persisted through the remainder of 2007 with demand growth in china india and other parts of the developing world continuing uncertain supply related to political unrest in nigeria venezuela iraq and other places continued to threaten the market and contribute to psychology that pushed up prices the decline of the value of the us dollar on world currency markets as well as the investment strategies of financial firms on the oil futures markets has also been identified by some as factors in the high price of oil the profits of the five major integrated oil companies remained high in 2007 as they generally accounted for approximately 75 of both revenues and net incomes for this group of firms oil production led the way as the most profitable segment of the market even though oil and gas production growth was not strong the refining segment of the market performed relatively poorly independent oil and natural gas producers are small relative to the integrated oil companies and their financial performance was weaker with more than half of the firms reporting declines in net income independent refiners and marketers also experienced difficult year that was reflected in profits in 2007 the combination of high crude oil prices that raised their costs and the inability to quickly pass cost increases on to consumers lowered refining margins resulting in generally declining profits the potential volatility of the world oil and financial markets coupled with the weakness of the us and other economies makes any profit forecast for 2008 highly speculative while continued high oil prices are likely the price of oil reached 110 per barrel in the first quarter of 2008 the ability of the industry to pass those prices on to consumers of gasoline and other products during 2008 is uncertain due to possibly weakening demand contents introduction 1 integrated oil company profits 2

industry profit review 2007 introduction the average spot market price for west texas intermediate wti reference grade of us crude oil was up 95 in 2007 compared to 2006 while the new york mercantile exchange nymex futures price for wti approached 100 per barrel pb in december 2007 refinery capacity utilization rates approached 90 or more for much of the year while oil supply disruptions from nigeria venezuela and the persian gulf remained both threat and sometime reality as the strength of product demand began to weaken in the latter stages of the year responding to high petroleum product prices as well as possible slow down of economic growth refinery margins began to narrow suggesting that the companies were less able to pass through the increased cost of crude oil to consumers however even in the face of uncertainty and weakening markets the oil industry enjoyed record revenues and profits in 2007 in 2007 the oil industry recorded revenues of approximately 19 trillion of which 78 was accounted for by the five major integrated oil companies profits for the industry totaled over 155 billion 75 of which were earned by the five major oil companies with the largest exxonmobil earning over 25 of the total profit1 although the financial results for the industry were at record levels the performance of different sectors of the industry varied as did the performance of individual companies within those sectors leaving some firms as relative underperformers compared to the industry leaders this report analyzes the industrys profit performance in 20072 while recent profit levels in the oil industry are of interest to policy makers investors and analysts among others the financial results of 2007 should be put in longer term perspective to understand the performance of the industry for example as recently as 2002 the financial picture in the oil industry was far different with declining earnings in key sectors such as refining the oil industry historically has been cyclic with periods of high earnings often followed by sharp declines driven by movements in the world price of crude oil for this reason projections of future industry performance based on current performance are unlikely to be reliable 1 the oil industry is composed of thousands of firms involved in all aspects of the exploration development transportation refining and marketing of oil based products in this report the oil industry refers to the firms listed in tables 1 through 6 2 this report explicitly analyzes the key firms in the production refining and marketing components of the industry crs2 integrated oil company profits integrated oil companies operate in both the upstream exploration and production and the downstream refining and marketing

values reflect changes from 2006 revenue growth among the integrated oil companies in 2007 was driven by increases in the price of crude oil especially in the last two quarters of the year even though five of the nine companies experienced decline in oil production and one of the nine experienced decline in natural gas production as shown in table 2 their revenues increased on average by 71 in 2007

presented in table 1 in report that appears periodically most recently after the oil companies announced their third quarter earnings in 2007 the american petroleum institute api compared the returns earned in the oil industry to other american industries3 the api comparisons are based on returns on revenue they found that the oil and natural gas industries earned 76 percent on revenues compared to 58 percent for all us manufacturing industries although this result implies 31 percent margin over the returns earned by all us manufacturing industries it is less than the 92 percent earned by all us manufacturing industries excluding the automobile and auto parts industries that had negative 26 percent return for the third quarter of 2007 calculating return on revenues dilutes the effect of growing total profits of the oil industry due to higher prices and growing revenues another standard percentage measure of profitability return on equity is presented in table 1 this measure indicates the success of the companies and industry in earning profit by utilizing the invested capital of the owners ie the shareholders of the company this measure is widely used by investors and financial analysts in evaluating the performance of firms seeking access to capital markets by this measure the integrated oil companies returned 227 in 2007 over twice the return on revenue the industry leader 3 american petroleum institute putting earnings into perspective 2008 p2 crs4 exxonmobil earned 334 these rates of return are likely to assure these firms and the industrys position as desirable

2 and table 3 separate the upstream and downstream performance of the integrated oil companies in 2007 table 1 and table 2 show that upstream net income growth led overall corporate net income growth for most of the companies and they earned almost 80 of their total net income from upstream activities oil and gas production declined for each product almost 3 in oil and less than one half of one percent in natural gas four of the five largest oil producers had declining output in natural gas only bp and shell experienced declining output in 2007 table 3 presents financial results for the downstream activities of the integrated oil companies for 2007 net incomes declined by more than twice as much as product sales suggesting that profit margins per barrel of crude oil refined had declined in the fourth quarter of 2007 only exxonmobil and conocophillips were able to produce positive net income growth with all the other firms showing negative net income growth or in the case of bp financial losses from downstream activities crude oil prices increased rapidly during the second half of 2007 and reached over 110 per barrel in march 2008 during this period gasoline price increases were thought by many to have lagged behind crude oil price increases potential weakening of the demand for gasoline in the united states was thought to be responsible for the lag with perception of weakening demand passing through crs5 cost increases to consumers was not thought to be economically feasible the result was decline in refining margins independent oil and gas producers table 4 presents data for 2007 for the independent oil and gas producers although they are large companies with revenues of more than 10 billion in 2007 for the industry leaders their total revenues are only about 5 of the integrated oil companies their net incomes however were approximately 15 of the net incomes of the integrated companies although all of the companies in this category experienced increases in revenue six out of ten experienced negative net income growth all of the companies except andarko and newfield experienced increases in production of oil and natural gas or both with prices for both oil and natural gas rising late in 2007 these companies seemingly should have performed better with respect to net income growth possible explanation for the declining net income experienced by some companies might be the large outlays the companies made investing in unconventional oil asset exploration and development many of these companies are involved in shale oil

largest refiner in the united states with total capacity of over 22 million barrels per day approximately 13 of the total us capacity independent refiners experienced the same pressure on refining margins as the integrated oil companies the difference was that these companies produce crude oil and therefore were not positioned to take advantage of the increases in the price of crude oil during

business operations valero the sectors leading firm earned 53 of the revenue but fully 97 of the earned net income not only was the cost of crude oil rising for the independent refiners but relatively weaker demand conditions made it harder for the firms to quickly pass cost increases on to consumers valero was able to remain profitable because it was able to purchase and utilize lower cost heavy

barrel in the first quarter of 2008 should the price of crude oil remain at or above 100 per barrel for large portions of the year the profits of oil producing firms should be high however the economic conditions will likely be difficult for firms that refine crude oil but do not have their own supplies it is likely that greater effort will be made by refiners to adapt technologies that allow them to use heavy sour oil stocks these lower quality crude oils are more readily available than high quality oils and sell at price discount relative to the reference oils west texas intermediate for example another key factor in the industrys profitability is whether demand for petroleum products continues to grow in the united states and the rest of the world us gasoline demand is arguably beginning to weaken as result of high prices4 some projections see 4 per gallon gasoline in the second and third quarters of 2008 while prices at that level might allow refiners to recover the cost of crude oil they might also reduce demand putting downward pressure on price demand for petroleum products outside the united states remains strong and will likely remain strong as consumers in developing nations use their higher incomes to fuel additional consumption worldwide economic slowdown is the most likely factor that would lead to slower demand growth 4 see lundberg letter volume xxxv number 5 march 14 2008 for varying interpretations as to whether us gasoline demand has actually begun declining crs8 conclusion the oil industry in general continued to generate high profits as it has since 2004 however it might be that the first sign of problems in at least part of the industry have arisen weakening demand for petroleum products specifically the us demand for gasoline has put pressure on the downstream side of the industry while demand growth political uncertainty the weak us dollar tight spare capacity and other factors make it likely that the price of crude oil will remain high in 2008 the weakening us economy coupled with the demand reducing effects of higher prices may make it more difficult to raise petroleum product prices new capacity investments in refineries one possible source of gasoline price relief for consumers are likely to be slowed by the poor profit performance of the refining sector if new capacity does not come on line the need for imported gasoline will remain key factor in avoiding shortages in the us market for other versions of this document see httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34437
