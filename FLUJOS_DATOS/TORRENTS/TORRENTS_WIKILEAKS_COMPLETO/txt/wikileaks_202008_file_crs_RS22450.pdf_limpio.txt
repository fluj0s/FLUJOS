public matters and deals with individuals only by classes the provisions of private law pply to one or several specified persons corporations or institutions1 private legislation is premised on the idea that general law cannot cover all situa tions equitably and some times congress must approve legislation to address unique problems that public law either created or overlooked private legislation has its foundation in the ri ght to petition the government for redress of grievances2 guaranteed to all citizens by the first amendment to the us constitution while once much more common in modern practice private laws are rare and designed to grant relief in those few situations where other legal or administrative remedies are available to petitioner between 1986 and 2007 99th109th

below demonstrates from 1986 to 2007 the subject matter of private laws enacted fell into five broad categories the largest subject category immigration is composed primarily of measures that conf er lawful permanent re sident lpr status on petitioner by waiving general law provision which prevents the granting or maintenance of such status3 the second category include s broad variety of claims against the government the remaining privat laws during the period studied are divided among three smaller categories the conveyan ce of public lands civil service issues and vessel documentation

enacted between 1986 and 2007 56 34 originated in the senate and 111 66 originated in the house of representatives source legislation information system lis of the us congress party sponsorship it is generally accepted that congress acts on significantly more measures sponsored by majority part members than by minority party members for example over the past nine congresse s between 71 and 88 of the measures passing the house under the suspension of the rules procedure were authored by majority party members4 an examination of the 167 priv ate laws enacted since the 99th congress however reveals more balanced breakdown by part affiliation over the 20year period 73 private laws were sponsored by republican members of congress and 94 by democratic members as table 1 shows both parties sponsored s ubstantial percenta ges of private bills that became law this is true not only during periods of split party control of congress but also during times when one party held the majority in

vol 1 washington cq press 2002 pp vixxxvthe data suggest that party membership is not the exclusive factor in determining whether private measure is successful or not table 1 tends to show higher proportions of measures both for democratic in comparison with republican majorities and for democratic in comparison with republican minorities this effect however may arise simply because during the period studied bot h the democratic ma jorities and minorities that occurred tended to be larger th an the corresponding republican ones geographic sponsorship the geographic distribution of the sponsorship of private laws from the 99th to the 109th congress reveals not surprisingly that members from the most populous states collectively aut hored the most private laws the nations four most populous states californi texas new york and florida5 were also the top four states in which members sponsored private laws during this period members from alaska and wyoming the 47th and 50st ranked states in population each sponsored four private laws however more than members from significantly larger states such as ohio illinois and new jersey these data suggest that the state or region of sponsor is not major factor in whether private measure is enacted cosponsors under house rule xiii private b ills may not be cosponsored6 notwithstanding this prohibition one house measure that subsequently became law in the period examined did have cosponsors7 the senate places limits on the cosponsorship of private measures of the 167 private laws examine d 14 senate bills had cosponsors companion bills just 23 of the 167 bills that became private laws enacted between 1986 and 2007 had companion measures introduced in the other chamber during the congress they were enacted this ong with the cosponsorship statistics noted above suggests that in contrast with public policy measures private bills sponsors view it as less necessary to build formal coalitions in advance in support of passage of private measure perhaps because the measure will be judged on the merit of the case and the relatively narrow precedents for the consideration of such requests for relief committee referral historically most private legislation introduced in congress was either considered by various claims committees established in each chamber8 or by committees

claims bills to the committees on the judiciary since 1947 only small fraction of private meas ures dealing with matters such as public lands vessel documentati on military awards veterans bene fits and tax and tariffs have been referred to committees other than the committees on the judiciary as figure 2 demonstrates while other committees have been referred small percentage of private measures subsequen tly enacted the house and senate judiciary committees have processed the largest percentage of private laws over the past 20 years five bills were referred to more than one senate committee and were c ounted multiple times in the corresponding table for purposes of clarity the table identifies the relevant house and senate committees by their current name and jurisdiction even if some might have had different name or jurisdiction at various points over the period studied method of consideration house the house has special procedures fo r considering private measures through call of its private calendar11 of the 167 private laws enacted between the 99th and 109th congress 150 were considered under these pro cedures eleven bills were considered by unanimous consent five were considered under the suspension of the rules procedure and one passed under the call of the consent calendar which has since been abolished senate unlike the house the senate does not have special procedures for the consideration of private measures they are dealt with in the same way as public bills all 167 private measures acted between the 99th and 109th congress were considered in the senate by unanimous consent bills passed over in the house in the house on the special days set aside for the call of the private calendar bills are acted upon in the order listed on the calenda r bill may be by unanimous consent passed over without prejudice however mean ing that it does not lose its place on the calendar even though it is not being acted upon12 of the private laws examined seven were passed over at least once before finally gaining house passage one private claims bill hr 1598 from the 99th congress was passed over w ithout prejudice 16 times before being approved by the house13httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22450crs6 14 see s 2042 108th congress 15 see hr 2731 and hr 2732 105th congressamendments to private bills as with public legislation committees of jurisdiction exercise judgment not only over whether private bill merits consideration by their chamber but also over the content of the bill simply put committees dont always accept the remedy suggested by the author of an introduced private measur as such private bills are sometimes amended either in committee or on the floor house of the 167 private laws enacted between 1986 and 2007 11 were reported from house committee with an amendment in the nature of substitute 25 were reported from committee with perfecting amendments and 12 were amended on the house floor senate of the 167 private laws enacted between 1986 and 2007 9 were reported from senate committee with an amendment in the nature of substitute 2 were reported from senate committee with perfecting amendments and 14 private bills were amended on the senate floor resolving differences only 13 of the private laws enacted between 1986 and 2007 were amended by the second chamber thus requiring the two cham bers resolve differences of this 13 none were resolved by conference committee in every instance an exchange of amendments between the house and senate was used to come into agreement time to enactment like public bills private bill must be enacted within the congress in which it was introduced and if not adopted by adjournment it dies and must be reintroduced in the next congress this often happens in private bill cases where the time for congress to deal with particular case may be longer than single congress between 1986 and 2007 the average time from the first introducti on of private legislation in congress requesting relief to resolution of the case by enactment of private law was two years nine months period roughly equa l to one and half congresses during the same period the longest case took over 8934 days over 24 years from the first introduction of private bill to enactment of private law resolving the claim14 the shortest time from first introduction of private bill to enactment of law resolving the case was 29 days15
