communities including providing funds to local economies affected by the economic downturn in the coal industry at less than the same of level of assistance received in 2006 and it directed eda to

been for the management of various information and telecommunications policies both domestically and internationally currently large part of this program 7 million is for the management of the federal

deficit reduction act that law and the creation of the new ntia program called for the creation of digital transition and safety public fund which would offset receipts from the auction of licenses to use electromagnetic spectrum recovered from discontinued analog signals the bush administration set those reimbursable funds at 45 million in fy2007 these receipts would fund the following programmatic functions at ntia digitalanalog converter box program to assist consumers in meeting the 2009 deadline for receiving television broadcasts in digital format public safety interoperable

national technical information service16 in accordance with the national technical information act pl 100519 as amended in 1992 by the american technology preeminence act pl 102245 the presidents budget submission did not request any funding for the national technical information service ntis for fy2007 similarly the house of representatives did not appropriate any funding for ntis when it passed hr 5672 on june 29 2006 likewise the senate committee on appropriations did not appropriate any funding for ntis when it passed hr 5672 on july 13 2006 the continuing resolution used to fund the remaining portion of fy2007 pl 1105 also did not include any funding for ntis instead funding for ntis will continue to be drawn from ntis revolving fund established by the commerce justice state appropriations act for fy1993 pl 102395 in part due to ntiss efforts to develop new products and limit spending ntis achieved positive net income of 192 million for fy2006 this compares with positive net income of 508000 for fy2004 10000 for fy2003 1346 million for fy2002 and 2290 million for fy2001 the ntis is part of the technology administration at the department of commerce the ntis was established within the department of commerce in 1970 although its origins can be traced back to world war ii with the creation of the publications board in 1945 the publications board collected classified scientific and technical information related to the war effort to be considered for release to the general public these functions were formalized in 1950 with the establishment of the clearinghouse for federal scientific and technical information within the bureau of standards which were later transferred to the newly created ntis in 1970 according to its website httpwwwntisgov

support the nations economic growth and job creation by providing access to information that stimulates innovation and discovery the ntis claims to hold approximately 3 million government information products with 600000 of these documents available through its online searchable database in addition ntis offers variety of fee based services to federal agencies these services include but are not limited to distribution of information products support services web development multimedia production and custom research services the advent and rapid growth of electronic and multimedia publishing both challenges and affirms the role of ntis on the one hand the growth of the internet and electronic documents contributed in part to decline in ntis sales as more documents become available online at charge from other sources in addition the emergence of range of new information brokers raises the question of whether or not the services ntis provides are redundant andor directly compete with those provided by private sector companies on the other hand the dynamic nature of online content means that websites and their content can move location or disappear without notice moreover even in the case of websites that are well established and relatively consistent in maintaining content there is guarantee that online materials will be archived or remain available indefinitely in contrast part of ntiss responsibilities include maintaining permanent repository of information bureau of the census17 for discretionary domestic spending by the bureau of the census in fy2007 the administration requested budget authority totaling 8782 million 1841 million for salaries and expenses and 6941 million for periodic programs including the decennial census the total request was 66 million greater than the fy2006 enacted amount of 8122 million and exceeded by 763 million the fy2006 level of 8019 million after rescissions much of the increase was due to preparations for the 2010 census the bureaus highestpriority program which will involve mailout mailback shortform questionnaire to be answered by all us households the bureau plans to replace the census long form with the american community survey acs which provides yearly tabulations of data from monthly household samples for the whole 2010 census program the fy2007 request of 5116 million was intended to go toward planning testing and developing the reengineered census improved mapping and maintaining the full nationwide acs implementation level to help fund the 2010 census the bureau proposed eliminating the vehicle inventory and use survey from the economic census also the bureau proposed phasing out and replacing the survey of income and program participation sipp in the salaries and expenses account as explained below 17 this section was written by jennifer d williams government and finance division crs30 for the past two decades the sipp has been the leading source of data on the economic wellbeing of americans its longitudinal household design provides many advantages however it also makes data processing and analysis difficult leading to long delays before the data can be analyzed and understood while the american community survey and growing body of administrative records now provide important sources of information they cannot by themselves meet all the information needs of policy makers the fy2007 request includes 92 million to design new data collection system on income and wealth dynamics to meet the policy and operational needs of the country which will replace the sipp18 of the 92 million the bureau was to use 56 million to design the new data collection system and the remaining 36 million to facilitate the collection of another wave ie ninth wave of 2004 sipp panel data during fy2007 thus providing full 2006 calendar year of sipp data the ninth wave however would have depended on the bureaus success in getting partner agencies such as the us department of health and human services and the us social security administration that rely on sipp data to also make combined investments of roughly another 64 million allowing for ninth wave investment of 10 million19 the house appropriations committee recommended that the sipp survey receive 10 million more than the requested amount in discretionary funds to continue sipp data collection while new survey is designed and that an additional 10 million from mandatory funds be available to disseminate data collected from the sipp in support of measuring the impact of welfare provisions20 during

space and aeronautics activities the agency is managed from headquarters in washington dc it has nine major field centers around the country plus the jet propulsion laboratory which is operated under contract by the california institute of technology dr michael griffin became nasa administrator in april 2005 nasa requested 16792 billion for fy2007 1 increase over its fy2006 appropriation of 16631 billion if 385 million in supplemental funding for hurricane katrina response and recovery was excluded from the fy2006 figure the requested increase for fy2007 was 3 for fy2007 the house provided 16709 billion in hr 5672 the senate appropriations committee recommended 16757 billion plus an additional 1040 billion in emergency funding the final continuing resolution pl 1105 provided 16247 billion plus an unspecified amount for statutory increases in civil servant pay sec 111 in september 2006 nasa announced change in how it accounts for overhead expenses the new system is known as full cost simplification the change increases the stated cost of some programs and decreases the stated cost of others 31 this section was prepared by daniel morgan analyst in science and technology policy resources science and industry division crs42 without affecting actual program content the increases and decreases exactly balance so that nasas total budget was unchanged for any particular program however amounts expressed in the new accounting system were not directly comparable with amounts expressed in the previous system in particular amounts in the final fy2007 appropriation may not be

of pl 1105 for statutory increases in civil servant pay budget priorities throughout nasa are being driven by the vision for space exploration announced by president bush in january 2004 and endorsed by congress in the nasa authorization act of 2005 pl 109155 the vision includes returning the space shuttle to flight status then retiring it by 2010 completing the space station but discontinuing its use by the united states by 2017 returning humans to the moon by 2020 and then sending humans to mars and worlds beyond the president did not propose significantly increased funding for nasa to accomplish the vision instead most of the funding was to come from redirecting funds from other nasa activities dr griffin has described this approach as go as you can afford to pay the funding requirements of the vision thus constrain other nasa priorities in the science aeronautics and exploration sae account funding for constellation systems the program responsible for developing vehicles to return humans to the moon would have increased from 17 billion in fy2006 to 31 billion in the fy2007 request the house provided 150 million less than the crs43 request for exploration systems which consists of constellation systems and two smaller programs the senate committee also recommended less than the request for exploration systems the final appropriation for exploration systems was 578 million less than the request but the act was silent on how reductions should be allocated among constellation systems and the other programs meanwhile also in sae reduced growth in science funding would have added up to proposed reduction of 31 billion through fy2010 relative to projections in the previous years request most of that reduction would have been to offset higher than expected costs for returning the space shuttle to flight status following the february 2003 columbia accident the request for science included full funding for hubble space telescope servicing mission but funding for several robotic missions to mars were cancelled or deferred funding was requested for the sofia airborne infrared telescope or the europa mission to one of jupiters moons the request for research and analysis which provides grant funding to individual researchers was down 15 from fy2006 in most programs the house provided 75 million more than the request for science including 50 million for research and analysis the senate committee recommended increases totaling 315 million for two science programs and directed nasa to proceed with sofia from within available funds the final appropriation however was 5251 billion less than the request by 79 million the request for aeronautics research in sae was about the same as was projected the previous year but its content had changed significantly the largest program vehicle systems has been renamed fundamental aeronautics and now focuses on core competencies in subsonic supersonic and hypersonic flight regimes including work on rotorcraft in the fy2006 budget cycle proposals to eliminate several of these areas met with strong congressional opposition an amendment to the senate fy2007 budget resolution samdt 3033 to sconres 83 increased the recommended funding for nasa aeronautics by 179 million the house provided 100 million more than the request for aeronautics research the senate appropriations committee recommended 35 million more than the request the final appropriation provided 890 million for aeronautics more than the request by 166 million in the exploration capabilities account nasas current human space flight programs the space shuttle and the international space station iss are also being significantly affected by the vision the presidents speech directed that the space shuttle be retired in 2010 after iss construction is completed the crew exploration vehicle cev being developed by the constellation systems program whose primary purpose is to take astronauts to the moon would also be able to visit the iss however because it is planned for later than 2014 there is likely to be multi year gap when the united states will be unable to launch its own astronauts into space as for the iss the presidents speech directed nasa to restructure the broadbased research program it had planned to conduct aboard iss to support only research needed to accomplish the vision congress responded in the nasa authorization act of 2005 by directing that at least 15 of iss research funding be used for research not related to the vision it is unclear what will happen to the iss after its use by nasa is completed in 2017 the house provided the requested amount for the space shuttle but less than the request for the iss and other crs44 exploration capabilities activities the senate committee recommended the requested amount for exploration capabilities the final appropriation for exploration capabilities was 6140 billion less than the request by 94 million mikulski amendment in the full senate appropriations committee markup created two new appropriations accounts for nasa 1 billion for space shuttle return to flight expenses and 40 million for additional hurricane katrina recovery expenses both were designated as emergency funding neither was included in the request the house bill or the final appropriation for more on nasas fy2007 budget request see crs report rs22381 national

included in the fy2006 conference report directing the nsf to pursue alternative sources of funding for the icebreaking fleet beyond 2006 one proposed option is for the nsf to enter into memorandum of understanding with the coast guard for reimbursement for the maintenance and operation of us polar research activities several studies are being conducted to review the longterm icebreaking needs in support of research in the antarctic 35 the fy2006 request included support for the rare symmetry violating processes continued crs47 that for project to receive support it must have the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding andor infrastructure technology nsf states that the projects receiving support in the fy2007 appropriation meet that qualification six ongoing projects and two new starts are funded in fy2007 projects receiving support are the atacama large millimeter array construction 643 million earthscope 274 million icecube neutrino observatory 287 million

dynamics and mathematical sciences additional priority areas include those of strengthening core disciplinary research continuing as lead federal agency in networking and information technology rd and sustaining organizational excellence in nsf management practices the nsf maintains that researchers need not only access to cuttingedge tools to pursue the increasing complexity of research but funding to develop and design the tools critical to 21st century research and education proposed investment of 5968 million in cyberinfrastructure will allow for funding of modeling simulation visualization and data storage and other communications breakthroughs nsf anticipates that this level of funding will make cyberinfrastructure more powerful stable and accessible to researchers and educators through widely shared research facilities increasing grant size and duration has been longterm priority for nsf the funding rate for research grant applications has declined from approximately 30 in the late 1990s to an estimated 23 in fy2006 the fy2007 appropriation for the education and human resources directorate ehr was 7967 million the same level as fy2006 disaggregated data on funding of specific programs and activities in the ehr as result of the cr are not yet available the ehr portfolio is focused on among other things increasing the technological literacy of all citizens preparing the next generation of science engineering and mathematics professionals and closing the achievement gap in all scientific fields support is provided at the various educational levels precollege undergraduate and graduate priorities at the precollege level include research and evaluation on education in science and engineering informal science education and new program discovery research k12 discovery research will combine the strengths of three existing programs and encourage innovative thinking in k12 science technology engineering and mathematics education at the undergraduate level approximately 72 of the funding was in support of new awards and activities priorities at the undergraduate level include the robert noyce scholarship program course curriculum and laboratory improvement 35 continued rsvp language was included in the fy2006 appropriations stating that conferees were concerned with the unacceptable increases in the project cost and suggested that the rsvp proposal be altered or descoped if the necessary changes can be made then the restructured rsvp could be considered for inclusion for project support within the rra crs48 science technology

congress about the management and oversight of major projects selected for construction and the need for prioritization of potential projects funded in the mrefc account the nsf was directed to improve its oversight of large projects by developing an implementation plan that included comprehensive guidelines and project oversight review one continuing question focused on the selection process for including major projects in the upcoming budget cycle in february 2004 the national academies released the congressionally mandated study of the process for prioritization and oversight of projects in the mrefc account the report recommended more open process for project selection broadened crs49 participation from various disciplines and welldefined criteria for the selection process in september 2005 the nsb released its management report on the new guidelines for the development review and approval of major projects setting priorities for large research facility projects supported by the national science foundation36 the report describes facilities under construction and those being considered for future funding because of the changing nature of science and technology nsf deems it essential that it have the flexibility to reconsider facilities at the various stages in their development also the nsf states that it must be able to respond effectively to possible changes in interagency participation international and cooperative agreements or cofunding for major research facilities the nsf encourages project planning from disciplines and fields in which scientists and engineers have not traditionally partnered or collaborated the report notes that although some concepts may evolve into mrefc candidates others may prove infeasible for major project support the nsf has stated that the facility plan will be updated as needed in september 2006 the nsf released the report investing in americas future strategic plan fy2006201137 nsf states that the report addresses the accelerating pace of scientific discoveries that are occurring in more competitive international environment the strategic plan lists several investment priorities that are targeted for increased emphasis of funding over the next five years the investments include furthering us economic competitiveness promoting transformational multidisciplinary research improving k12 teaching and learning in science and mathematics developing comprehensive integrated cyberinfrastructure and strengthening the nations collaborative advantage through unique networks and innovative
