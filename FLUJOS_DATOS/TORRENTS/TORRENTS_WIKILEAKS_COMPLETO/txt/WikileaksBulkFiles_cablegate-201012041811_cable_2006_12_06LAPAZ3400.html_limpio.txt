evo morales election in december 2005 was political earthquake in bolivia sweeping aside political expectations that have defined bolivian politics for generations and at the same time breaking open fissures and offering up new possibilities while president morales popularity has risen and fallen since his election his popularity has surged since the hydrocarbons nationalization and his successful use of political hardball tactics to overcome an oppositionimposed blockade of the senate for now the traditional opposition appears to be crumbling under the gobs pressure while it is too early to discern the final shifts of bolivias political tectonic plates this cable is an effort to explore the new political geography of current and potentially future leaders of the country end summary indigenous regional leaders 2 c rene joaquino cabrera mason by trade potosi mayor rene joaquino cabrera is an emerging politician known for competent management reported honesty and efforts to govern transparently despite low public profile joaquino has been involved in politics since 1993 and has twice been elected mayor of potosi his political group the social alliance of the people has earned reputation of acting independently and moderately to build consensus within bolivias constituent assembly ca however joaquino does not have the name recognition or funding necessary for national campaign given the number of potential candidates for the next presidential race there may not be enough political space for joaquino to make convincing bid for national office despite these challenges to joaquinos emergence nationally his indigenous background and personal biography as former child laborer in the countrys mines could galvanize popular support 3 c oscar gerardo montes member of the movement of the revolutionary left mir party tarija mayor oscar montes is an intelligent strategist who understands the realities that the political opposition faces in bolivias current political climate with wealth of political experience that includes positions within national and local government montes has regional name recognition within tarija and enjoys good reputation understanding the political chasm that separates the countrys eastern and western regions montes has expressed interest in creating politically viable alternative to the mas that includes an alliance among bolivias southernmost departments chuquisaca potosi ouro and tarija he is politically aligned with joaquino see above poloffs believe national ticket featuring joaquino as the presidential candidate and montes as the candidate for vicepresident could empower bolivias southern departments and garner wide national support 4 c pedro ticana former minister of indigenous affairs under the mesa and rodriguez governments pedro ticana is unaffiliated with particular political party and is an effective political operator with diverse political background former adviser to movement towards socialism mas ticana is now closely aligned with potosi mayor joaquino and eastern bolivia helping joaquino organize new political party ticana could help establish political block comprising the countrys southern and eastern departments ticanas political experience with three paz 00003400 002 of 005 different governments demonstrates his ability to work beyond party lines to establish effective political connections and build consensus as quechua ticana has the ability to take advantage of the political prominence indigenous groups now enjoy political analysts however note ticana prefers to remain behind the scenes rather than seek national leadership position at november 2006 indigenous roundtable with ambassadors goldberg and shapiro ticana presented himself as moderate political thinker who seeks to establish political environment that values inclusion and dialogue 5 c mario cossio cejas touting wide range of experience in academia and politics tarija prefect mario cossios potential as rising opposition leader is aided by his hydrocarbonsrich prefecture given tarijas hydrocarbons revenues cossio is wellequipped to advance the agenda of the media luna pando beni tarija and santa cruz departments especially on regional autonomy member of camino cambio civic political group cossio enjoys broad public support and is viewed positively by the bolivian national media his ability to rise as national opposition leader may also be aided by his discreet role in the highly publicized divide between the media luna and the gob which could help cossio attract more wideranging political support physically mestizo cossio can tap into the support president morales now enjoys by bolivians who identify with him and his background 6 c ruben costas the public face of the media luna and member of autonomia bolivia ruben costas position as prefect of the economic powerhouse santa cruz department gives him natural edge in establishing himself as regional opposition leader costas willingness to work with the united states would make him solid democratic partner his politically savvy use of the media to advance the interests of the media luna have helped establish costas as one of the primary political opposition leaders his public confrontations with the morales administration the latest bringing public retraction by morales of his accusations that costas was involved in plot against him have helped costas score public victories against the gob given his close relationship with other prefects in eastern bolivia and his leadership on regional autonomy costas is wellknown and respected in the east however his close association with eastern bolivia may limit him to regional leadership position as the altiplano has historically opposed candidates hailing from the east especially the santa cruz department the dinosaurs 7 c jose luis paredes munoz member of podemos who values us assistance in bolivia paz prefect jose luis paredes stands out as potential national opposition leader in an october 11 meeting with ecopol paredes privately expressed his interest in obtaining us support to run for the presidency poloff explained that we do not intervene in bolivias internal affairs as the former mayor of alto paredes has strong base of support in the altiplano despite the efforts of several mascontrolled social sector groups to drive him from office with history of demonstrating an ability to govern paredes has responded well to the enormous pressure he is under from his constituency and from the central government with an eye towards his political future paredes is attempting to shore up support through public relations campaign highlighting his accomplishments as prefect however paredes remains very vulnerable to allegations of corruption in regard to charges filed against him on october 16 for actions allegedly committed while he was mayor of alto paz 00003400 003 of 005 8 c manfred reyes villa former presidential candidate cochabamba prefect and agrupacion unidad cochabamba auc leader manfred reyes villa has wealth of political experience and broad name recognition although whispers of corruption haunt him known for delivering on his promises reyes is popular among his constituents which is particularly challenging given his position in an otherwise masdominated prefecture despite his political experience reyes political potential may have peaked during his 2002 presidential campaign when he garnered approximately 22 percent of the national vote lacking politically relevant party reyes ties to bolivias old guard politicians will likely keep him from regaining national position although reyes may be unable to assume national role he will likely remain an important player regionally 9 c samuel doria medina wealthy prominent businessman and national political figure since his third place finish in bolivias december 2005 national elections samuel doria medina is the head of the national unity party and delegate in the ca an entrepreneur and former minister under expresident jaime paz zamora medinas financial resources and position within the ca enable him to coordinate national opposition movement known for having political ambitions medina may try to thrust himself into the next presidential race without regard for his realistic chances of winning it medinas chances to run for the presidency however have been reportedly neutralized by his willingness to broker deals with the mas in the ca and threats by the gob to nationalize his businesses while the impact of these reports are unknown medina would still have to find support outside his party and overcome the leftist indigenous trend in bolivian politics if he were to attempt presidential campaign in the meantime medina will likely continue to play key role building consensus in the ca irrelevant 10 c jorge tuto quiroga ramirez the recognized leader of podemos jorge tuto quiroga is considered the glue that binds his party in the ca and in bolivias congress unfortunately he seems tonedeaf to bolivias radically changed political environment and has been unable to strike chord with the population as the leader of the largest opposition group in the ca and former president quiroga remains bolivias primary opposition leader like ortiz quirogas leadership of podemos may undermine his ability to win national office beginning latenovember 2006 quiroga has started to take more public stance on divisive issues between his party and the gob to build pressure and support for twothirds vote in the ca while effective as party leader most political analysts concede quiroga would not fare well in future presidential race in recent meeting with the ambassador quiroga appeared less interested in bolivian politics than discussing foreign policy that of bolivia as well as the us 11 c oscar ortiz an influential and wellknown opposition senator from santa cruz oscar ortiz has made name for himself by using his political position to publicly criticize the gob member of podemos with background in business ortiz understands the intricacies of economics and can use his experience to communicate policies that would resonate with bolivian electorate that is increasingly focused on employment like costas his ties to eastern bolivia and his probusiness outlook may diminish his ability to rise through the political ranks particularly in light of gob rhetoric against free market economics ortizs affiliation with the podemos party may also prevent his paz 00003400 004 of 005 emergence as an opposition leader that can gain broad political appeal left fielders 12 snf santos ramirez the president of bolivias senate movement towards socialism mas senator santos ramirez is considered the political confidant of president morales lawyer by education and teacher by training ramirez has an extensive history in politics as member of congress before being elected to the senate in 2006 born in the potosi department ramirez is wellknown in potosi and serves as the head of the mas party there with political career closely aligned to president morales legislative agenda ramirez political future is considered heavily dependent on the political successes of the gob rumored to be major player in the mas political playbook ramirez is in position to assume leadership position in the event president morales stumbles reftel ramirez role in railroading controversial legislative measures supported by president morales confirms the opinions of many political analysts who consider him radical emboldened by the newfound wave of popularity president morales is enjoying ramirez may shed his politically adept style for more radical approach with his strong alliances with the gob ramirez may ride out the wave of president morales strong popularity before revealing his personal aspirations to emerge on bolivias national stage sensitive reporting indicates that ramirez may be very vulnerable on corruption and human smuggling charges 13 c fernando huanacuni relative unknown in bolivias political sphere professor lawyer and aymara writer fernando huanacuni has raised the eyebrows of political analysts convinced president morales successor will hail from the countrys indigenous community relatively young in political terms at thirtynine years old huanacuni may present fresh perspective that would be welcomed by growing population of young bolivians frustrated with government they view as unresponsive resident of alto and born in the paz department huanacunis ability to galvanize support for national run would directly challenge president morales base of support despite his lack of name recognition huanacunis television show on social pressures is helping him gain wider recognition if he uses it as method to raise his political profile similar to the assessments made for other indigenous politicians huanacunis indigenous background could help him galvanize greater support 14 c juan granado known as the the gardener for his passionate support for environmentallyfriendly public works paz mayor juan granado is popular among his constituency for his efforts to reform paz and fight corruption he stands as likely candidate to emerge nationally from the mas rankandfile if the opportunity presented itself former member of the mir and the movimiento bolivia libre mbl granado is the founder and current leader of the movimiento miedo msm political party he started when he ran for mayor that is now allied with the mas in addition to the publicity granado enjoys from his position his skillful use of radio and television for constituent outreach help him raise his profile among the electorate while highlighting his accomplishments in office despite his alliances with mas however granado political viability remains murky at best considered member of the middle class granado would likely have to counter negative perceptions of the middle class among the indigenous community and traditionally marginalized groups to court their vote former minister in the gonzalo sanchez lozada administration granado would be an easy target for paz 00003400 005 of 005 this past association and this would present high hurdle for granado to clear in national run for office comment 12 c the december 2005 and july 2006 national elections exposed what turned out to be hollow center of leadership in bolivias political traditional political classes it was in this vacuum that evo morales took the presidency bolivias traditional leaders are still reacting to the earthquake his victory represented the roughandtumble politics favored by morales have further exposed the many weaknesses of the traditional opposition most recently the emergence of divisive issues within the ca has spurred some political leaders to action and offered tentative clues to possible alternative opposition leadership while resurgence of the old opposition is possible it is unlikely that bolivias future leader will be one of the political dinosaurs and irrelevant leaders of the past bolivia remains an overwhelmingly poor country given the leftward shift of rhetoric among many voters postmorales environment would likely offer serious electoral advantages to leader emerging from evos indigenous supporters if morales were to exit unexpectedly an indigenous or strong regional leader would be the most likely candidate to fill his position this year president morales has had lucky run with high hydrocarbons and other commodity revenues leaving him abundant room to maneuver that situation will change dramatically however when his economic luck runs out end comment goldberg select from cable where id 90016 order by date asc
