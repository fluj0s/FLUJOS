from keith briffa kbriffaueaacuk to cbaisandakotacomnet subject re help with an idea date wed aug 9 150558 2006 dear chris just wondering what became of my forwarded request from you to tony have not received any feedback and still anxious to follow this up cheers keith at 1553 17102003 you wrote keith i am inclined to forward your note to tony caprio any objections he has the best temperature sensitive foxtail pine material i am aware of i have some sense that there is change in regional climate patterns prior to 1000ad in the western us not sure what or why matt salzer and malcolm hughes are working on 3k yr material from temperature sensitive upper treeline sites in the west john king knows great deal about the sierra collections and data marybeth keifer and andrea loydfaste collected the sierra foxtail you referred to chris b hi lisa and chris and ed the first point of this message is to ask for access to the raw data for the boreal and camp hill foxtail pine chronologies lisa that i believe you andor your students produced and similar data that you may have chris for the area inland of the santa barbara basin california i am also trying to stimulate your interest and hopefully start joint collaboration lisa chris and ed please allow to explain i was reading some papers on the putative link between north atlantic temperatures oxygen isotope record from greenland and climate bioturbation index in the santa barbara basin on the 1000year time scale papers by boyle and leuschner et in the pages qsr volume published in 2000 it got to thinking whether robust regional temperature chronology for north west scandinavia might show any associations with any climate factors as represented in either high or low elevation treering chronologies in western california at higher temporal resolution perhaps decades to century and hence whether there is any evidence for thermohaline link or other more direct dynamic atmospheric connection operating on various time scales of course there are problems with what specific climate response one would investigate in terms of season and variable however as first look i compared our tornetrask temperature reconstruction jja in northern sweden with very few series i had for the west us among which were the chronologies mentioned above from ad 800 that jan esper and ed produced for their science paper using data supplied by lisa i believe now i dont actually like the general way they applied the rcs using very large scale standardisation curve based on disparate data from very wide expanse of sites across the northern hemisphere but as ed might say it seems to work however the association between the tornetrask series and the curves for boreal upper wright have stimulated to try to look deeper and solicit your interest and help in my opinion for the 600year period between ad 1100 and 1700 the similarity in the 5 circa 120year cycles that make up these series certainly warrant serious further study the similarity is not apparent before this but the two california series themselves show little agreement in the earlier 300 years of data that i have seen implying that the common signal at the regional level may not be well represented in either anyway this could be standardisation issue though by producing more robust mean series and especially by extending the series back before the post christian era we could significantly extend the power of the comparison i would like to establish well replicated series using morelocal rcs curves based applied to more and longer data for both the tornetrask and possibly northern finnish region and the combined set from upper wright and boreal and any other nearby foxtail data from the region of the 118 degrees west 36 degrees north we have earlier than circa ad 800 data for tornetrask and finland showing good inter region coherence if we can establish stronger evidence of north atlanticeastern pacific link at different time scales perhaps we can look at other high resolution records to establish the nature of the likely forcing and the possible climate dynamic mechanisms what do you think can i play with your data to this end whatever you think i would appreciate it if you would treat this as confidential and any thoughts on the idea or pointers to relevant data sets are still welcome all the very best keith professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 1httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa christopher baisan sr research specialist laboratory of treering research university of arizona tucson 85721 email cbaisanltrrarizonaedu tel 5206217681 fax 5206218229 professor keith briffa climatic research unit university of east anglia norwich nr4 7tj uk phone 441603593909 fax 441603507784 2httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa references 1 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa 2 httpwwwcruueaacukcrupeoplebriffa
