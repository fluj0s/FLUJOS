united states summary southeast asia has been considered by some to be region of relatively low priority in us foreign and security policy the war against terror has changed that and brought renewed us ttention to southeast asia especially to countries afflicted by islamic radicalism to some this renewed focus driven by the war against terror has come at the expense of attention to other ke regional issues such as chinas rapidly expanding engagement with the region some fear that rising chinese influence in southeast asia has come at the expense of us ties with the region while others view beijings increasin g regional influence as largely natural consequence of chin as economic dynamism chinas developing relations hip with southeast asia is undergoing significant shift this will likely have implications for united states interests in the region while the united states has been focused on iraq and afghanistan china has been evolving its external engagement with its neighbors particularly in southeast asia in the 1990s china was perceived as threat to its southeast asian neighbors in part due to its conflicting territorial claims over the sout h china sea and past support of communist insurgency this perception began to change in the wake of the asian financial crisis of 199798 when china resi sted pressure to devalue its currency while the currencies of its neighbors were in free fall today chinas charm offensive has downplayed territorial disput while focusing on trade relations with southeast asia which are viewed by some as the catalyst for expanding political and security linkages in november 2004 china and the association of southeast asian nations asean includes brunei burma cambodia indonesia laos malaysia philippines singapore thailand and vietnam agreed to gradually remove tariffs and create the worlds largest free trade area by 2010 china is also beginning to develop bilateral and multilateral security relationships with southeast asian

great if it is poorly managed but that the benefits in term s of economic prospe rity and world peace will be great if it is handled well1 moving from the global to the regional level of analysis others have observed the following with regard to southeast asia chinas ultimate strategic purpose remains subject of debate and speculation among interested observers southeast asia however is the sole region adjacent to china in which chinese influence can most easily expand benign interpretation would see china as simply cultivating the sort of stable peaceful and prosperous regional environment that china requires for its own successful modernization more skeptical view sees china playing longterm game designed to curtail american influence and weave closeknit economic and security community with china at the center2 chinas economic growth is dramatically changing its economic and political relations with the world including southeast asia an area where the united states has strong economic political and strategic interests this report will discuss issues related to chinas rapidly expa nding ties with southeast asia few major international relationships have changed as much or as quickly in recent years as has the relationship between china and the association of southeast asian nations asean3 many observers see that relationship as having been

united states washingt on november 7 2003 9 james brooke japan to list china as major threat the new york times september 16 2004 orientation of southeast asia is part of what some see as larger shift in the international balance of power which puts the rise of asia in general and china in particular on scale equivalent to th rise of western europe in the 17th century or the rise of the united states at the beginning of the 20th century5 some view the united states as unprepared to deal with this restructuring of the global balance of power others have observed in the south east asian context that there has not been time when the us has been so distracted and china so focused6 t h i s distraction is largely due to the us focus on the war in iraq such fundamental change has the potential to affect american interests many analysts expect that chinas history and culture will play key role in shaping chinas external relations in this view china is engaged in drive to regain its rightful place this drive has two ke components the first is the drive for unity which involves the control of taiwa n tibet and xinjiang which are outside the scope of this report the second drive is to restore china s traditional influence among its neighbors china appears to view southeast asia as potentially the most fruitful and receptive region for the projection of chinese influence7 this drive could potentially but not necessarily bring american and chinese interests into competition andor conflict in southeast asia chinas relations with southeast asia have been described by some analysts as either part of traditional confucian tribute system or more recently as part of more western concept of sphere of influence8 the united states has both sought to engage china and viewed china as strategic competitor the george w bush administration moderated its initial view which emphasized china as strategic competitor this shift has been explained by the need for chinas cooperation in the wa r against terror and on other issues while the war against terror has changed the dynamics of the relationship it has not changed the underlying factors that led many in the united states to view china as strategic competitor also while the ited states has adopted more cooperative policy towards china in recent years japan the principal us ally in asia appears to be increasingly wary of chinas power with some in japan viewing it as potential military threat9httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32688crs3 10 yong deng and thomas moore china vi ews globalization toward new

statement of angel rabasa policy analyst with rand corporation before the committee on international relations house of representatives southeast asia after 911 regional trends and us interests december 12 2001 chinas embrace of marketled econo mic development may mitigate against past assertive postures in the region and lead to more multilateral nd cooperative approaches chinas increasingly active diplomacy towards southeast asia can be viewed as benign outgrowth of its effo rts to achieve economic development for the betterment of its people or as part of an assertive foreign policy chinas embrace of multilateral initiatives such as the 2003 treaty of amity and cooperation with asean the east asia summit and efforts to forge chinaasean free trade area which was advanced in november 2004 are variously viewed as evidence of nonthreatening tradefocused china or as part of an evolving grand strategy that will rely on formal and informal mechanisms strengthened multilateral institutions and strong economic ties resp ectively of interdependence as facto strategy for restraining the united states10 for further information see crs report rl33242 east asia summit issues for congress by bruce vaughn chinas rise also creates concern about how beijing will use its growing economic and military power militarily china is the dominant regional power in asia and one of the worlds emerging gr eat powers some analysts view the emergence of new great power onto the world stage as causing likely disruption to the existing balance of power which could lead to conflict others see the potential to manage such shift in the balance of power in peaceful manner how china engages southeast asia may tell us much about the nature of chinas rise in the view of one analyst with regard to asia china seeks to promote an image of being able to handle its greater economic and strategic clout responsibly china wants to play constructive role in regional economic and political affairs perhaps with view to building stable foundati on for greater influence in the future11 for others there is concern that as chinas power grows so too will china s ambition and assertiveness12 there are some recent signs that china may seek to expand its economic and political influence in southeast asia into the security realm as well while chinese efforts to expand its economic and political influence are regarded as benign by many views of ch inas overall posture in the region may change if it seeks to develop new militarytomilitary relations with southeast asian states some analysts feel that such an expansion of influence would likely raise broader concerns in defense policy circles and could be viewed as challenge to americas posture in the region

asia chinas historical involvement in southeast asia as well as cultural affinity for china in many southeast asian states will likely influence how china is viewed by regional states20 historically china has exerted much influence in southeast asia this can be seen in chinas past cultu ral influence in and past dominance of vietnam as well as today through its increasing presence in burma while chinese influence has extended through its contigu ous borders with continental southeast asia there was brief period from 1405 to 1433 when china sent vast fleets under the command of zheng he

and 40 million ethnic chinese reside in southeast asia23 the degree to which ethnic chinese have been integrated into southeast asian societies has varied greatly across the region with chinese being relatively better integrated in nonmuslim states than muslim majority states while ethnic chinese have been subject to past abuses and di scrimination the trend line for earlier waves of chinese immigration has been towards greater levels of integration into their respective new homelands most of the chinese of southeast asia come from guangdong and fujian province the ove r two million

overall strategic posture while some analysts take zero sum approach to rising chinese power and american power in th region others point to the emphasis in china on the policy of peaceful rise or peaceful developmentand take more benign view of chinas objectives both globally and within regional context in southeast asia chinas peaceful rise potentially represents significant departure from earlier policy which sought to erode americas power in the region29 evidence of chinese unease with americas presence in asia c ontinues to some chinese commentators americas expanded internati onal posture since the sept ember 11 terror attacks has led to an american encirclement of china30 others take view that chinas foreign policy towards southeast asia is derivative of its traditional imperial tribute system31 since the mid 1990s china has been activel seeking to develop its relationship with southeast asia through more coopera tive approaches this is particularly evident in the period from the financial crisis of 199798 to the present the following regional objectives for southeast asia are seen to stem from chinas larger strategic agenda maintain stable political and

territorial disputes chinas offer of aid to thailand in the wake of the asian financial crisis of 1997 and chinas decision not to devalu its currency during the financial crisis were key events that began to more positively affect regional perceptions of china chinas actions indicate to some that it is interested in more than just expanded economic and trade ties with the region china has been working to establish security policy conference within the framework of the asean regional forum arf such conference would establish new security forum where china could be key player further such

imports on customs value basis which is the purchase price of the imported good while china and most other countries use the cost insurance and freight cif basis which is includes the purchase price of the import plus the costs of bringing the good into the country such as freight costs and insurance in addition china transships significant amount of its exports through hong kong large share of which china reco rds as exports to hong kong while the country of final destination records them as imports from china not hong kong therefore there are likely to be major di screpancies between the

office the pros and cons of pursuing freetrade agreements july 31 2003 46 see crs report rl33242 east asia summit eas issues for congress by bruce vaughnpossible implications for the united states of an acfta the implications of closer economic ties between china and asean on us firms and investors that have business interests in the asean countries are difficult to determine on the one hand some u s businesses may bene fit if reductions in trade barriers boost economic growth due to efficiency gains in china and the asean countries which in turn could boost their demand for foreign imports including those from the united states an acfta could boost overall economic efficiency in both china and asean re ducing their production costs and lowering prices of various goods ex ported by these countries to the united states43 i n addition an acfta would benefit us fi rms over the long run if the reduction in trade barriers agreed to by the two sides were later extended to all members of the world trade organization wto as part of multilateral trade agreement on the other hand an acfta could hur t us firms in number of ways bilateral and regional ftas are discriminatory by nature since they extend preferential benefits only to the parties of the agreement thus for example many us exports of goods and services to asean could face higher tariff and nontariff trade barriers than those faced by similar products and services exported by china to asean thus giving chinese firms competitive advantage over us firms this could lead to trade diversion where us firms even if more efficient than chinese firms lose some level of trade and investment opport unities in the asean countries or lose out to asean firms in china this is because the lower trade barrier eg tariff faced by chinese company in an asean country may offset its less competitive position visavis us company which faces higher trade barrier in addition trade liberalization produces bot h winners and losers and there is the possibility that closer economic integr ation between china and asean could produce economic welfare losses in some c ountries both within and outside the acfta thus diminishing their growth44 finally such regional ftas could produce large trading blocs that seek to promote further internal economic integration rather than seek multila teral agreements within the wto45 for example japan and south korea are also attempting to form trade agreements with asean in addition in december 2005 asean members china japan south korea india australia and new zealand held an east asian summit to discuss among other things closer economic integration46httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32688crs17 47 aseanchina expert gr oup on economic cooperation forging closer aseanchina economic relations in the 21st

malaysia and si ngapore increased but those to the philippines thailand and vietnam decreased 50 china would also see decline in its exports to japan 5115 million and the rest of the world 15571 million 51 while us exports to china and asean as whole declined us exports to japan and the rest of the world increased by total 2234 billion and exports from japan and the rest of the world to the united states increased by total of 8757 million 52 for example under this model us exports would decline by 280 billion this implies that if the acfta were open to all countries real world gdp would increase and possibly those of the united states japan and others as wella 2001 study performed by asean on the effects of an acfta47 estimated that it would raise chinas real gdp by 027 or 22 billion the analysis examining the impact on asean include d 6 of 10 asean nations indonesia malaysia the philippines si ngapore thailand and viet nam together combined real gdp of these six count ries was projected to rise by about 09 or 54 billion all of the countries would experience an in crease in real gdp the study further predicted us gdp would decline by 004 or 26 billion and total world gdp would fall by 00248 combined exports of these asean countri to china were predicted to rise by 130 billion with an acfta while thos to the united states were estimated to fall by 7991 million chinese exports to these asean countri were projected to rise by 106 billion while us exports to this group would drop by an estimated 21 million49 in addition us exports to china were projected to fall by 5010 million while chinese exports to the united states would fall by 8133 million50 exports by the six asean countries to each other were expected to decline by 31 billion overall according to the asean study the agreement would boost the six asean countries total exports to the world by 56 billion or 15 higher chinas overall exports would rise by 68 b illion overall total us exports would decline by 2797 million51 total world exports were projected to increase by 105 billion thus based on this model the ac fta boosts world exports but at the same time appears to cause some level of trade diversion away from more efficient producers outside acfta while the economies of china and asean would be better off several ec onomies outside the agreement woul d be worse off such as the united states and japan see table 9 52 the economic model used in this analysis has number of limitations for example it does not included all asean c ountries in addition the model is based on the world economy in 1995 and estimates th changes that would occur if asean and china removed all tariffs however the economies of asean and china are much different than they were 10 years ago in

prevent its potential encirclement by the united states burma has the potential to give china greater access to the indian ocean and from there to the oil rich middle east this is particularly valuable to china as it seeks to raise levels of development in its western interior which has experienced much lower rates of development than chinas eastern coastal areas china has helped burma build road linking yunnan province with port on the irrawaddy river73 the isolation of the military regime in burma due to its record on human rights has had the unintended consequence of encouraging ties with china which could give china key strategic access as well as economic access to the indian ocean which could have an impact on the geopolitical balance with india74 us policy towards burma is largely driven by human rights concerns while chinas foreign policy towards burma appears to be driven by geostrategic and geo economic considerations human rights concerns have led to legislation

their core interests110 australia there are signs that one of americas closest allies australia is re calibrating its external posture in way that places increased emphasis on asia and in particular china111 this it appears is being driven by the growing geoeconomic importance of china to australia as well as domestic australian public opinion that is perceived to have gr own less comfortable with the australian liberal governments extremely close identification with president bushs foreign policy including iraq112 it should be noted that australia s growing relationship with china is based on trade while its relationship with the united states is based on shared values the anzus alliance and largely common world view australias exports to china rose from 12 billion in 1990 to 59 billion in 2003 while its imports over the same period rose from 15 billion to 103 billion113 as result it appears to be the aim of australian foreign policy to avoid situation where the united states and china are in conflict because australia wishes to pursue enhanced economic ties with china while preserving its close strategic alliance relationship with the united states events that point to this potential shift include australias desire for free trade agreement with china the 2004 statement by foreign minister downer on taiwan the 2003 visit of premier president hu ji ntao to australia and desire by the australian opposition labor party to not be perceived as an unthinking and uncritical subordinate of the united states by regiona l countries while this recalibration does seek to establish degree of independen ce it starts from baseline of almost major foreign policy differences between the government of john howard and the administration of george bush which is built on strong personal relationship between the two leaders and national elites the decision to give chinese president hu jintao platform in parliament the day after president bush addressed the aust ralian

tandem with other key extraregional relationships such as w ith the united states japan india and australia while it is not evident exactly how the new security architecture will evolve what is of concern to some analys ts is that the current direction has the potential to move towards the creation of new asian centric architecture which reduces the central role that the united states has played and may have china at its center while it has been pointed out that such grouping may not pose any more of threat to the united states regional interests than the european union does in europe such grouping could challeng american interests if ignored or mishandled140 implications for am erican interests how one perceives the implications of the rise of china in southeast asia depends to great extent on whether the ri of china is viewed in zero sum or expanding sum terms relative to american interests zero sum perspective holds the potential to create strategic rivalry as any gain for china in either economic diplomatic or strategic terms would be viewed as diminishing americas regional posture such perspective could lead to policies by the united states that china would view as seeking to contain its rise which could lead to more assertive chinese policies an expanding sum approach holds the prospect of constructively engaging china in way that would have it act w ithout military force not only in the region but beyond such perspective could focus on those areas where us and chinese interests converge such as fighting or ganized crime drug smuggling counter terrorism stabilizing indonesia maintainin g regional stability and promoting energy security141 while china has pursued more cooperative policy in southeast asia there exists the possibility that it could revert to more aggressive posture such policy shift could be triggered by the issue of taiwan in such an event chinas enhanced presence in southeast asia could challenge american interests in the

shared strategic interest with the united states as both states will place increased importan ce on maintaining the sea lanes through which the oil will flow chinas increasing dependence on middle east based energy resources is demonstrated by the recent signing of memorandum of understanding between china and iran for the purchase by china of 10 million tons of liquified natural gas each year over the next 25 years142 conversely the rapid rise in oil consumption by asia which is projected to grow by 80 from 2001 to 2025 could lead to increasing competition for the resource143 energy is key resource for economic growth which has been key source of legitimacy for the chinese government some analysts have taken the view that regional states view the united states as being largely focused elsewhere in the world particularly iraq and afghanistan and that to the extent to which the united states is engaged in southeast asia it is engaged primarily through the prism of its war against terror and to lesser extent with human rights chinas recent foreign policy toward the region has stressed trade and not human rights this policy stance is relatively well received in many southeast asian capitals that said some southeast asian states are thought to quietly welcome the balancing effect of the united states strategic presence in the region144 some have viewed the emerging correlate s of power of asia as resting on three key interactive forces all of which are evident in the southeast asian context these are the ability of the united states to remain committed to the region and play leading role in creating new security architecture the rise of china and deteriorating arc of instability in asia145 from this perspective the ability of the united states to remain committed to th region beyond narrow focus on the war against terror is an important factor which will likely influence how regional states react to the rise of china if regional states perceive the united states as unwilling or unable to play an active role across the economic diplomatic and security spectrum in southeast asia they may be increasingly drawn to china as chinas influence grows southeast asian states ma seek to balance that influence in new ways particularly if they perceive the united states as reluctant to be comprehensively engaged in the region if american priorities such as the war against terror place limits on the attractiven ess of renewed ties southeast asian states may look to india australia japa n or to new asean ba sed initiatives which could be led by

regional states would add depth to americas regional presence and could positively shape regional states perceptions of the united states strategic posture some analysts are of the opinion that the united states could actively work to channel chinas emergence as great power along the path of the peaceful rise in their view the united states could reassure china that it will not oppose chinas efforts to attain higher leve ls of development to better the lives of its people while the united states could reserve the right to promote its economic and othe r interests in the region some regional states displeasure over united states policies associated with the war on terror create perceived distance in southeast asian states relations with the united states which it is thought creat space for enhanced relations between southeast asia and china the region appears to some to be increasingly uneasy with perceived american unilateralism while at the same time increasingly at ease with chinas concurrent shift to more multilateral approaches to security expanded use of multilateral and soft power approaches by the united states by enhancing dialogue with regional states across range of issues could according to some create greater levels of cooperation amongst regional states and the united states renewed emphasis on apec and ameri can involvement in mekong subregion development are also viewed as two possible ave nues for expanded mu ltilateral c ooperation streamlining the visa application process for southeast asian students and expanding scholarship opportunities to cultivate southeas t asias next generation of leaders are other opinions under consideration other analysts feel that greater flexibility to induce or persuade the regime in burma to promote human rights and political freedom could be used as way of engaging burma with asean states to provide burma with an alternative to an increasing reliance on china as one analyst has put it if the current relationship between the united states and china devel ops into more overt competition the realpolitik of great power rivalry could oblige it the united states to change its policy towards burma and seek more neutral if not closer relationship147 others are of the opinion that the united states can expand existing military exercises with regional allies such as exercises tandem thrust
