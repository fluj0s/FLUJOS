107th congress is whether or not congress will approve authority for the president to ne gotiate trade agreements and submit the agreements for implementation under exped ited legislative procedures the house approved its version of fasttracktra promotion authority tpa bill hr 3005 on december 6 2001 the senate approved its version on may 23 2002 as title xxi of an omnibus trade bill hr 3009 along with tpa hr 3009 contains reauthorizations of trade adjustment assistance taa the andean trade preference act atpa and the generalized system of preferences gsp differences between the bills must now b resolved by conference committee hr 3005 house and title xxi of h r 3009 senate are similar in their basic structure and in most provisions the latter bill however gives more attention to small businesses trade remedy laws and trade disputes the senate bill also contains the highly controversial crai gdayton amendment regarding provisions of trade agreements that would amend us trade remedy laws the two bills have many similarities to prior fasttrack law but they depart by giving more importance to labor the environment and other nontrad itional priorities as pa rt of us trade policy also for the first time they would establish congressional oversight group to monitor trade negotiations more closely than before both bills include more detailed require ments on labor than under prior law they are similar to each other with the exception of required labor ri ghts report and whether to attach trade adjustment bill to tpa legislation both versions bills give greater attention to environmental matters than previously one shared negotiating objective is to ensure that parties do not fail to effectively enforce environmental laws and to make such traderelated failures subject to dispute settlement the bills also seek language in trade agreements to discourage parties from weakening environmental laws to encourage trade with regard to agriculture both versions state that the principal negotiating objective is to obtain competitive fairer and more open market opportunities for us agricultural exports in addition to consultation requi rements for import sensitive products both bills establish add itional requirements fo r consultation with the agriculture committees current proposals would permit either house to limit the deadline for trade agreements eligible for expedited implementation by adopting an extension disapproval resolution also if required consultations do not occur or if an agreement fails to promote required objec tives congress could withdraw expedited implementation through pro cedural disapproval resolutions these and other restrictions might also be enforced thr ough other procedures available under general rules

3005 and title xxi of hr 3009 one of the major trade issues in the 107th congress is whether congress will approve legislation that sets conditions under which the president can negotiate certain trade agreements and submit the agreements for approval and implementation under expedited legislative pr ocedures under this aut hority formerly called fast track authority and now often called t rade promotion authority or tpa congress agrees to consider legislation to implement certain trade agreements under procedure with mandatory deadlines amendment and limited debate while the president is required to notify and cons ult with congress at various stages of negotiation the president was granted fasttrack authority almost continuously from 1974 to 1994 in 1994 the authority lapsed and has not been renewed under the current absence of fasttrack authority if the administration concludes trade agreement that requires congressional action implementing legislation will be considered under normal legislative procedures this report analyzes and compares the ve rsions of tpa legislation passed by the house and the senate house ways and means committee chairman thomas introduced hr 3005 on october 3 2001 wh ich the house passed on december 6 2001 by vote of 215214 along party lines as the bipartisan trade promotion authority act of 2001 on december 18 2001 the senate finance

two bills with the omnibus trade and competitiveness act of 1988 1988 trade ac t pl 100418 under which fasttrack procedures were last approved the report begins with an overview of the us trade policy agenda and what role tpa plays in trade policy it then summarizes the major provisions of hr 3005 nd of title xxi of senatepasse d hr 3009 and di scusses the labor including some discussion on trade adju stment assistance environmental and agriculture provisions in particular it includes review of consultation and notification provisions and c oncludes with discussion of expedited procedures and controls that the two bills propose on their use an appendix presents information on expedited procedures for implementing bills for trade agreements fasttracktpa procedures and on other procedures included in the bill the us trade negotiating agenda and trade promotion authority congressional consideration of trade promotion authority tpa legislation and the ensuing debate over us trade nego tiating objectives are occurring during period of growing global ec onomic uncertainty and of changing international trading system that shape very active us trade negotiating agenda as has been the case with previous fastt rack trade authority legisl ation the cong ressional debate not only involves whether to grant the pres ident the authority but also what us trade negotiating objectives should be members of the 107th congress are deeply divided over us trade policy objectives such as to what degree if any should non trade issues for example labor and environment be included in trade agreements world economic slowdown and changes in the international trade system many of the worlds major economies ve been experiencing slow economic growth or recessions after decade of robust growth and low unemployment rates the us economy shifted downward with increasing unemployment over the near term the european economies have endured slow economic growth while japan continues to suffer its worst economic slowdown of the postworld war ii period furthermore the economic problems of the industrialized countri have spilled over to developing countries that rely on them as export markets the bush administration and other suppor ters of tpa have argued that the united states must take the lead in trade negotiations to spur economic growth and that tpa is necessary before trade partners will negotiate with the united states seriously this argument is also present in the committee reporting language accompanying hr 3005 and title xxi of hr 3009 as passed by the senatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs3 2 zoellick robert b falling behind on free trade the new york times april 14 2002the international trading system is undergoing change by moving beyond multilateral negotiations among developed nations for example an increasing number of developing countries are active pa rticipants in the international trading system one hundred of the 142 members of the world trade organization wto are developing countries 30 of them are classified as least developed countries these countries have become more asser tive in pressing their agendas which frequently differ from those of the united states and other veloped countries furthermore chinas recent entry into the wto gives more weight to the developing country agenda the former co mmunist countries of central and eastern europe and of the former soviet union are also integrating themselves into the international trading system in addition the proliferation of bilateral and regional trade agreements is changing the international trading system according to the wto about 100 bilateral and regional agreements have been established since 1995 the international trade structure is also changing in that growing number of activities are considered to be trade or traderelated such activities include intellectual property rights protection fore ign investment servi ces and government regulations these changes in the international trading system will require new trade agreements to be negotiated and the bush administration has argued that it needs tpa now so that the united states can ensure that the changing international trade system reflects us interests2 us trade negotiating agenda and tpa legislation the economic slowdown in the united states and other countries and the changes in the international trading syst em are shaping the us trade negotiating agenda that agenda is reflected in th pending tpa legislation and can be divided into three overall goals to create favorable conditions for us exporters by eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers to protect domestic industries fro m the adverse effects of unfair foreign trade practices and to pr ovide temporary relief to domestic industries adjusting to rapid increas in fairlytraded imports and to ensure that international trade rules that are used to meet the first two goals apply to all relevant economic activities these three goals have guided us ne gotiators in previous trade negotiations and will likely do so in upcoming negotiations the goals are reflected in the negotiating objectives set out in the vers ion of hr 3005 passed by the house and title xxi of hr 3009 as passed by the senate the negotiating objectives are discussed further in other sections of this reporthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs4 us trade negotiators are pursuing the agenda in multilateral negotiations in the wto and in negotiations to establish regional and bilateral trade areas these negotiations cut across geographical areas and economic activities any agreements reached from these negotiations will proba bly require congressi onal approval before implementation tpa would provide that implementing legislation be considered without amendment thereby in creasing prospects for passage on november 14 2001 in doha qatar trade ministers from 142 wto member countries agreed to launch wide ranging multilateral ne gotiations the new negotiations will cover broad range of issues such as agricultural trade liberalization trade in servi ces industrial tariffs trade related intell ectual property rights and rules on antidumping and c ountervailing duty investigations the negotiations are tentatively sche duled to be completed by 2005 in the meantime the united states has been negotiating bilateral and regional free trade agreements and will likely begin negotiations on even more agreements at the end of 2000 the united states launched negotiations with singapore november 2000 and chile december 2000 to establish bilateral free trade areas such arrangements would lead at minimum to the elimination of tariffs in bilateral merchandise trade the reducti on or removal of other barri ers in trade in goods and services and concessions on treatment of foreign inves tments while negotiators have confronted stumbling blocks in both sets of negotiations the agreements are expected to be reached in mid to late 2002 similarly the united states and 33 other countries of the western hemisphere agr eed in december 1994 to begin negotiations to establish free trade area of the am ericas ftaa by 2005 in addition the bush administration has expressed the goal of exploring the possibility of establishing free trade agreement with th countries of centra l america and ustr zoellick has indicated the administration w ill consider forming free trade area with south africa australia new zealand egyp t and other countries have also either expressed strong interest in forming free trade areas with the united states or have been suggested as potential ftas partners committee reporting language for hr 3005 and for title xxi of hr 3009 explicitly state that the author ity will be applicable to all trade agreements that are reached before june 1 2005 or before june 1 2007 if the authority is extended and that meet the other conditi ons for such authority in addition unlike the 1988 fast track authority distinction is made between multilateral agreements on the one hand and regional and bilateral agreements on the ot her hand in terms of the applicability of the tpa furthermore both bills recognize that negotiations are already underway with chile singapore and the ftaa partnercountries and waives certain notification requirements in anticipation of such agreements being concluded shortly httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs5 prepared by lenore sek specialist in inte rnational trade and finance foreign affairs defense and trade division 3 for detailed

the senate title xxi of hr 3009 by lenore sek and william h coopersummary of major provisions the tpa provisions approved by the h ouse and by the senate like those of many fasttracktrade promotion authority bills can be considered in five parts first they outline trade negotiating objectives second they set conditions under which the bills provisions would apply to trade agreements and implementing legislation third they set out notification and c onsultation requirements for the executive branch fourth they specify actions re lated to implementati on such as documents the president must submit fifth they might include other related provisions3 trade negotiating objectives although the executive branch conducts the actual negotiations congress acting under the section on trade negotiatin g objectives communicates to negotiators the goals that it expects trade agreemen t to achieve similar to the 1988 trade act hr 3005 and senatepassed hr 3009 outline these negotiating objectives as overall negotiating objectives and principal negotiating objectives but unlike the 1988 trade act the two bills add thir d category called promotion of certain priorities overall negotiating objectives are usually broad objectives or goals the trade act of 1988 had three overall objectives that are included in hr 3005 and senatepassed hr 3009 mark et access elimination of tr ade barriers and stronger international trading disciplines the two bills add four more overall objectives economic growth mutually supportive trade and environmental po licies respect for worker rights and provisions to discourag weakening environmental or labor laws to encourage trade senatepassed hr 3009 has one more ove rall objective that is not in the house version fair and qual treatment for small businesses the enlargement of the section on overall objectives from prior law indicates broadening of the purpose of trade nego tiations beyond market opening to include other policies such as labor righ ts and environm ental protection principal negotiating objectives usually are more defined goals or issues hr 3005 has 13 principal objectives trade ba rriers and distortions to trade trade in services foreign investment intellectual property rights ipr transparency anti corruption improvement of the wto and multilateral trade agreements regulatory practices electronic commerce reciprocal trade in agriculture labor and the environment dispute settlement and enforcement and wto extended negotiations the senate bill includes these 13 objectives with identical language for most but some differences for five trade barriers nd distortions to trade foreign investment intellectual property rights agriculture and dispute settlement the senate bill alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs6 4 us senate bipartisan trade promoti on authority act of 2002 report to accompany hr 3005 srept 107139 feb 28 2002 p 36adds four additional princi pal objectives for total of 17 adherence to civil political and human rights revision of wto rules on border taxes equivalent opportunities in textile and pparel trade and regulati on of products resulting from the worst forms of child labor the principal objectives of hr 3005 and senatepassed hr 3009 show some similarities to the principal obj ectives of the 1988 trade act for example they all share some objectives that are often part of trade negotiations such as trade barriers services agriculture and intellectual property rights however the current bills show some dissimilarities to the 1988 trade act for example both of the current bills but not the 1988 trade act incl ude principal objectives on anticorruption regulatory practices and electronic comme rce the 1988 trade act but not the current legislation include d principal objectives on veloping countries current account surpluses and access to high technol ogy on the controversial issues of labor and the environment the 1988 trade act had principal objective on worker rights and the current bills have principal objective on labor and the environment but these objectives and related language in other principal objectives are substantially different the differences are discussed further in later sections of this report hr 3005 and senatepassed hr 3009 also include third section under negotiating objectives promo tion of certain priorities that was not in the 1988 trade act this section directs the president to take actions to promote certain priorities beginning in the 1990s many fa sttrack bills added third section under negotiating objectives in an attempt to address the role of labor and the environment in trade negotiations in some cases this third section was to separate labor and the environment from overall and principal objec tives in other cases it was to give detailed direction to the executive branch on domestic action to take related to the negotiations the senate finance committee in reporting bill that included these same provisions on promotion of certain priorities explains while these priorities are not formally described as negotiating objectives their importance as statements of the trade policy of the united states is equal to the importance of the general and specific objectives set forth in subsections on overall and principal objectives4 both the house and the senate bill lis t 12 actions under this third section of negotiating objectives promotion of certain priorities most of these actions nine out of 12 involve labor and the environment these are discussed in more detail later the other actions involve preser ving the ability of the united states to rigorously enforce its trade laws report on the effectiveness of trade remedy and consultation with other countries on how cu rrency movements affect trade the two bills have almost identical language except the senate bill expands on review of trade agreements and employment both bills have different provisions on report on other countries labor conditions and the senate bill require s the president to address distortions that lead to unfair foreign trade actionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs7 trade agreements authority after specifying negotiating objectives hr 3005 and senate passed hr 3009 set out conditions under which the bills provi sions would apply to trade agreements those conditions are almost identical in both bills with one major exception and they are similar to past law in many respect s one condition is that trade agreement tariff or nontariff must be entered into by given deadline june 1 2005 in both the house and senate bills with possible twoyear extension if specified conditions are met in the case of certain tariff agreements the congress would delegate to the president the authority to enter into those agreements and implement the tariff changes by proclamation implementing legisla tion would be necessary in the case of all other trade agreem ents hr 3005 and senatepassed hr 3009 would allow the president to enter into those agreements and submit them for approval and implement ation under expedited procedur mandatory deadlines limited debate amendment as long as specified conditions are met for expedited procedures called trade promotion procedures in the bills to apply the agreement would have to make progre ss in meeting the overall and principal objectives this is the same as the 1988 tr ade act and the president would have to satisfy the consultation requi rements trade promotion procedures would apply to an implementing bill with 1 provisions approving trade agreement and any statement of administrative action and 2 provisions necessary or appropriate to implement trade agreement if changes in law are required to implement the agreement the 1988 trade act did not have comparable provisions on implementing bills that qualify for expedited procedures the president could negotiate trade agreement without meeting the above requirements but in that case implementing legislation woul d be considered under the normal legislative process the senate bill adds controversial provision that is in neither the house bill nor the 1988 trade act this provision is commonly called the daytoncraig amendment the amendment states that trade authorities procedures would not apply to any provision in an implementing bill that modifies or amends any us law that provides remedies from unfair foreign tr ade practices eg us antidumping countervailing duty and safegu ard laws such provisi on would be stricken from the implementing bill if 1 any senator makes point of order against the provision and 2 the point of order is sustained by the presiding officer the point of order may be waived or appealed before or after action the presiding officer respectively with the support of ma jority of senators consultations and assessment hr 3005 and senatepasse d hr 3009 set out requirements for the president to notify and consult with congress at various stages of negotiation the two versions are similar in many respects alt hough the senate bill adds to the provisions on importsensitive agricultu ral products includes cons ultation requirements for negotiations related to fish or shellfish trade and requires additional reports when changes to us trade

graneymajor controversies the housesenate conference debate over tpa labor provisions will likely center on minor differences in language relating to labor rights report and major differences arising from the fact that the nate bill includes among other provisions amendments to the trade adjustment assistance programtaa labor rights report on the first issue the labor rights report the senate bill would require much more indepth report than the house the house bill requires that the president submit to congress report showing for any new trade agreement the extent to which countries currently

report on the country with which the president is negotiating see actual language for these requirements at the bottom of figure 1 currently the state departme nt annually publishes one to several

covering shifts in production would ma ke up about onefifth of the increase8 the second controversial element of s 1209 was the inclusion of premium assistance for health care coverage for t aa recipients the proposed subsidy would have paid 70 of health insurance premiums for eligible workers and temporary medicaid insurance for certain uninsured individuals adjusting downward from cbos earlier estimates for high er coverage this could result in an estimated budget outlay in 2003 of 244 million the admin istrations proposal would not have included health insurance benefits9 the

provisions and ove rall give substantially greater consideration to environmental matters than did previous fasttrack trade agreement authority under the 1988 trade act in that act environmental concerns were addressed only in negotiating objectives regarding trade in services and foreign direct investment these pr ovisions directed us negotiators in pursuing stated goals to take into account legitimate united states domestic objectives including but not limited to the protection of legitimate health or safety essential security environmental consumer or employment opportunity interests and the law and regulations related thereto 1988 trade act 1101b9 11 19 usc 2901b9 11 agreements entered into under this au thority were the north american free trade agreement nafta and the urugua round agreements which included the establishment of the world trade organizati on wto despite the lack of explicit environmental directives in the 1988 tr ade act environmental concerns were addressed in varying degrees in th nafta the nafta environmental side agreement and certain uruguay round ag reements and ministerial decisions environmental objectives hr 3005 and senatep assed hr 3009 include two identical overall negotiating objectives on environment the first objective is to ensure that trade and environmental polic ies are mutually supportive and to seek to protect and preserve the environment and enhance the international means of doinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs15 so while optimizing the use of the world s resources the second objective is to seek provisions in trade agr eements under which parties strive to ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections fforded in domestic environmental laws as an encouragement for trade hr 3005 sections 2a5 and 7 and hr 3009 2102a5 and 7 this second objective paralle ls language contained in the usjordan free trade agreement fta and the nafta chapter 11 investment both agreements assert that it is inappropriate to encourage trade by relaxing domestic environmental laws and generally state that party s hould not waive or otherwise derogate from such measures to attract investment nafta article 1114 further provides that party may request c onsultations if it considers th at another party has done so environmental groups have argued for tpa language that seeks to prevent countries from weakening environmental sta ndards to promote trade advantage and the language in both bills appears to respond to that issue environmental interests have further called for making such action subject to dispute settlement procedures those opposing this proposal by environmen talists have expre ssed concern that in doing so legitimate changes in domestic environmental measures could be subject to challenge by us trading partners neither bill includes such an objective the house and senate bills also contain several identical principal negotiating objectives on environment section 2b11 nd section 2102b11 perhaps most significantly each bill provides that it is principal negotiating objective to ensure that party to trade agreement with the united states does not fail to effectively enforce its environmental laws through sustained or recurring course of action or inaction in manner affecting trade be tween the united states and that party further objective is to recognize that parties retain the right to exercise discretion with respect to prosecutorial regulatory and compliance matters these objectives mirror provisions contained in the usjordan free trade agreement fta and the nafta environmental side ag reement this objective goes further than the usjordan fta to clarify the rights of government to establish its own levels of environmen tal protection by adding reta liation may be authorized based on the exercise of these rights or the right to establish domestic labor standards and levels of envir onmental protection other principal negotiating objectives on environment contained in both bills include strengthening trading partners capacity to protect the environment through the promotion of sustainable development reducing or eliminating government practices or policies that unduly threaten sustainable development seeking market access for us environmental technologies goods and services and ensuring that environmental health or safety policies or practices of the pa rties do not arbitrarily discriminate against us exports or serve as disguised barriers to trade other environmentrelevant objectives the bills set forth other objectives that have implications for envi ronmental laws and re lated disputes under trade agreements these include the objectives on dispute settlement foreign investment transparency and regulatory practiceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs16 14 for further discussion see crs trad electronic briefing book hot topic nafta chapter 11 investorstate dispute settlement and crs report rs20904 international investor protection indirect expropria tion claims unde r nafta chapter 11 dispute settlement and enforcement the effectiveness of trade agreement obligations is related to the strength of an agreements dispute settlement process environmental interests argue that environmental obligations should be included within trade agreements and that disputes involving th obligations should be treated the same as commercial disputes including using the same remedies business interests and others favor flexibility in addressing various kinds of disputes provisions in both bills parallel the u sjordan fta and go beyond nafta by calling for the inclusion of an obligation to enforce domestic environmental laws within the texts of trade agreements th dispute settlement objectives of hr 3005 and hr 3009 set forth at section 2b 12 and section 2102b 13 respectively call for seeking provisions that treat all principal negotiating objectives equally with respect to the ability to resort to dispute settlement and to have available equivalent dispute settlement procedures and remedies thus the bills envision that environmental obligations in trade ag reement would be subject to dispute settlement under the agreement further negotiating objective for dispute settlement shared by the house and senate bills is to seek provisions to im pose penalty upon party to dispute that encourages compliance with the agreement and is appropriate to the parties nature subject matter and scope of the violation and has the aim of not adversely affecting parties or interests not party to the dispute while maintaining the effectiveness of the enforcement mechanism both bills thus seek to make all disputes equally subject to dispute settlement but would provide flexibility in procedures and remedies foreign investment investment provisions have become an environmental issue because of the types of claims that have been brought under nafta investment provisions allowing foreign i nvestors to arbitrate disputes with nafta parties in some cases fore ign investors have sought compensation for the negative impacts of government environmental regulations claiming that the government action is form of indirect expropriati on or is tantamount to expropriation nafta provides that compensation must be equal to the fair market value of the expropriated investment these nafta provi sions and related cl aims have prompted concerns by some that this language ma dampen the enforcement of environmental regulations in signatory countries and that foreign investors ma have greater rights under the nafta with respect to expropr iations by federal state or local government in the united states than domestic investors have under the fifth amendment takings clause14 the house and senate bills each appear to attempt to addr ess this concern to some degree although the bills provisions differ in several regards the principal negotiating objectives for investment in each bill sections 2b3 and 2102b3 seek to reduce barriers to traderelated foreign investment and to secure for investors important rights comparable to those that would be available under united states legal principles and practice both bills call for achieving these objectives by seeking the establishment of standa rds for expropriation and compensation forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs17 expropriation consistent with united states legal principles and practice the senate bill further calls for seeking to establish standards for fair and equitable treatment consistent with united states legal principles and practice including the principle of due process the senate b ill as amended by samdt 3405 further calls for ensuring that foreign investors in the united states are not accorded greater rights than united states inve stors in the united states the house and senate bills also call for negotiators to seek to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes betw een an investor and government through various means including mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims the senate bill further calls for mechanisms to deter the filing of frivolous claims procedures to enhance opportunities for public input into the formulation of government positions and the establishment of an appellate body to review decisions in investorto government disputes and thus provide coherence to the interpretations of investment provisions in trade agreements in contrast the house bill calls for negotiators to provide in trade agreements an appellate or similar review mechanism to correct manifestly erroneous legal interpretations both bills similarly call for negotiators to ensure the fullest measure of transparency in investment disputes by ensuring that requests for dispute settlement are promptly made public ensuring that proceedings submissions findings and decisions are made public and establishing mechanism for accepting amicus curiae submissions from businesses unions and nongovernmental organizations environmental groups favor adding language in tpa investment objectives that directs negotiators to seek provisions in trade agreements that provide explicit protection for environmental measures that may affect foreign investors other stakeholders want to ensure checks are maintained against the potential for disguised or unfair barriers to foreign investment neither bill calls for negotiators to seek explicit exceptions for environmental measur in the investmentrelated provisions of trade agreements transparency various interests including the administration environmental groups and others have put priority on increasing transparency ie openness in trade matters and increasing public access to the dispute resolution process environmental and business inte rests agree that greater openness would allow increased awareness of the possible impacts of trade decisions relevant to their concerns the house and senate bills contain identical provisions to significantly increase public participation in trade matters compared to current practice hr 3005 section 2b5 and hr 3009 secti on 2102b5 provide that principal negotiating objective is to obtain wider app lication of the principle of transparency through increased and more timely public access to information on trade issues and activities of international trade institutions increased openness at the wto and other trade fora including with regard to dispute settlement and investment and increased and more timely public acce ss to all notifications and supporting documentation submitted by wto parties each bill

negotiating positionsidentical principal negotiating objective on re gulatory practices addressing the use of government practices to provide competitive advantage for domestic producers service providers or investors the goal of this provision is to lessen the use of regulations for the purpose of reducing ma rket access for us goods services or investments this objective calls for us negotiators to achieve increased transparency and opportunity for the par ticipation of affect ed parties in the development of regulations this obj ective would seemingly benefit both us business and environmental interests additionally the negotiating objective is to require that proposed regula tions be based on sound science costbenefit analyses risk assessment or other objective evidence this language has drawn criticism from environmental groups that have called for language that would protect the ability of federal state and local governme nts to take precautionary measures against risks in cases where scientific or other knowledge may be suggestive but incomplete proponents argue that without such discip lines regulations can too easily be used to create barriers to trade promotion of certain priorities in addition to negotiating objectives the house and senate bills require the presiden t to promote certain priorities in order to address and maintain us competitiveness in the global economy the senate finance committee report accompanying hr 3005 srept 107139 explains that the priorities are not negotia ting objectives themselves but that they should inform trade negotiations or be pursued parallel to trade negotiations15 among these priorities the bills contain several identical environmental and environmentrelevant provi sions specifically under each bill

expand agricultural trade however the house committee chairman and the ranking democrat ultimately pledge d their support for tpa after receiving assurances that the administration w ould agree to the

cotton wool and chocolate and consult with congress on how domestic producers would be affected by tariff cuts among other requirements the baucusgrassley bill which includes fish and shellfish in the requirement for special consultation contains somewhat different language but with the same intent requirements for consultation with agriculture committees in addition to consultation requirements for importsensitive agricultural products both b ills establish additional requirements for consultation with house and senate agriculture committees before in itiating or continuing negotiation the

finance division 18 pl 93618 88 stat 1978 as amende d 19 usc 2191 the appendix provides specifics 14 the presidents failure or refusal to notify or consult with congress with respect to tariff and nontari ff agreement would result in the denial of the trade authorities fasttrack procedures for the consideration of bill implementing that agreement if both houses separately ag ree under specific expedited procedure within 60 days of each other to pro cedural disapproval resolution denying such procedures to the implementing bill in question due to failure to consult section 5b1a 2105b1a 15 such disapproval resolu tion however is not in order in the event that the presidents failure to give the 90days notice prior to initiating negotiations and to consult in connection with th negotiations of any of the four specified agreements which are likely to be negotiated in the foreseeable future if the negotiations were already in progress at the time of enactment of the act the president however must notify the congress of such negotiations and consult on them with the entities listed in section 4a 2104a see 3 above as soon as feasible section 6 2106 expedited procedures and procedural controls on their use although current legislation to extend tr ade authorities procedures is said to provide trade agreements authority it does not itself grant the president any new authority with or without specific stat utory authority the president can negotiate trade agreements and their implementati on would normally requi re new legislation instead as the official title of hr 3005 an act to extend trade authorities procedures indicates the legislation only extends trade authorities procedures that is it extends to specified class of trade agreements the eligibility for an implementing bill to be c onsidered under certain expe dited procedures these expedited procedures originally estab lished by section 151 of the trade act of 197418 are also called fast track procedures their intent is to ensure that each house of congress will 1 consider and vote on the implementing bill and 2 entertain amendments to the bill the availability of this expedited treatment encourages trade negotiations by assuring the president and other participants that congress will vote on any agreement they reach in the form they ne gotiated it for just this reason however these procedures significantly constrain the discretion congre ss normally exercises over its legislative agenda current proposal s compensate for these constraints by 1 restricting the class of trad agreements eligible for ex pedited consideration and 2 providing procedural means for each house to ensure that these restrictions will not be breached through these procedural enforcement mechanisms congress retains substantial control over whether trade agreements may be considered under expeditedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs27 19 19 usc 2192 the appendi x provides specifics procedures each mechanism is derived from similar ones that appeared in earlier statutes making trade authorities procedur available and proposals for doing so earlier sections of this report have already identified the various restrictions that current proposals would place on trade ag reements eligible for expedited implementation they are pr incipally of four kinds the agreement must be reached within specified time period specified notifications to and consultations with congress must occur during its negotiation it must promote specified objectives and the implementing bill must contain only specified kinds of provisions and specified forms of supporting information must be supplied to enforce the first three kinds of restriction current legislation adapts several specific procedural mechanis ms provided for in earlier st atutes and proposals the senatepassed bill also intr oduces some requirements of the fourth kind that would be enforced through procedural mechanis ms also all four could be enforced through various applications of the ge neral constitutional power of each house of congress to determine its own rules except as noted in the following di scussion the procedural mechanisms provided for in hr 3005 as passed by th house and title xxi of hr 3009 as passed by the senate are substantially similar like most statutes establishing expedited procedures both versions of the current legislation declare the procedural enforcement mechanisms they share to be enacted as an exercise of the constitutional rulemaking power of each house the sena bill does not extend this declaration to the new procedural mechanisms it introduces enforcing time restrictions both the housepassed and senatepassed bills make the expedited procedures of section 151 available for bills to impleme nt trade agreements entered into before june 1 2005 this sunset provision is one way in which congress limits the extent of the constraint that the trade aut horities procedures pl ace on its legislative discretion the bills would also allow the president to extend the availability of the expedited procedures to agreements ente red into until june 1 2007 by so requesting unless either house before june 30 2005 disapproves the request by adopting an extension disapproval resolution re ferred to below as an edr an edr is to be considered under separate set of expedited procedures intended to guarantee consideration and pr ohibit amendment which is contained in section 152 of the trade act of 197419 in the house the resolution would be referred to the committees on ways and means and rules and could be considered on the floor only if reported the provisions for the senate do not specify referral but permit floor consideration only if the committee on finance reports thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs28 20 the provision in this form allows for the possibility that the committee on finance could report the edr as an original measure resolution20 these requirements effectively afford the revenue committees control over this means of regulating the availab ility of the trade authorities procedures enforcing notifications and consultations the current proposals establish similar remedy if congress finds that the notifications and consultati ons required for any covere d trade negotiation have not occurred the bills make the expedited pr ocedures of section 152 applicable to procedural disapproval resolution here called pdr stating that the president has failed or refused to notify or consult as required with respect to specified trade negotiations if both houses adopt pdrs with respect to the same negotiation within 60 days of one another the trade agreement becomes ineligible for expedited consideration accordingly while an ex tension request may be disapproved through action by only one chamber withdrawal from an implementing bill of eligibility for expedited consideration requires action by both both the housepassed and senatepassed bills specify that any member of the respective house may introduce pdr in th at house hr 3005 provides that the pdr be referred in the house to the committees on ways and means and on rules and may be considered on the floor only if reported by those committees as passed by the senate hr 3009 adds corresponding requirements in the senate for referral to and reporting by the committee on finance as with the edr these arrangements vest in the revenue committees effective control over this means to limit the availability of the trade authorities procedures as currently proposed this mechanism is stronger and more flexible than in either previous law or earlier versions fi rst the current legislation contains new language providing explicitly that failure to consult includes failure to develop guidelines for consultations with the congressional oversight group described in earlier sections or to meet with the group on request second under the 1988 trade act adoption by both houses of pdrs terminated the trade promotion authority altogeth er the current proposal permits the mechanism to be used against an individua l trade agreement or any specified set of otherwise eligible trade agreements it also introduces the new restriction that each house may consider only one pdr with respect to any given trade agreement under the expedited procedure during single congress third under both the 1988 trade act and the housereported version of hr 3005 pdr could be introduced in the house only by the chairman or ranking minority member of the committee on ways and means or on rules and in the senate the pdr had to be originated by the committee on finance the house passed and senatepa ssed bills eliminate this restri ction which increases the ability of individual members to influence the ava ilability of the trade authorities procedure the retention of the reporting requirement nevertheless preserves committee control over this decisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs29 hr 3009 as passed by the senate also excludes agreements negotiated under the auspices of the world trade organization wto from expedited consideration unless the secretary of commerce submits report to congress on plans for correcting dispute resolutions by the wt that have added to obligations or diminished rights of the united states this requirement however is not specifically associated with any procedural enforcement mechanism enforcing pursuit of objectives as reported in the house hr 3005 tablished specific procedural means for congress to enforce the requirements it places on the objectives covered trade agreements must serve this limitation ma intained the situation that existed under the 1988 trade act and other earlier statut for example one of the revenue committees might become c onvinced through the required consultations that given negotiation was not fostering the statutor negotiating objectives under the house reported version of hr 3005 the committee could not use pdr to withdraw eligibility for expedited consideration for this reason as long as the consultations were in fact taking place both the housepassed and senatepassed bills however include new provision under which failure or refusal to notify or c onsult also includes failure of the pertinent trade agreement to make progress in achieving the purposes policies priorities and objectives the bill would establish this language extends the applicability of the pdr mechanism enabling congress to withdraw eligibility for expedited consideration from bill to implement trade agreement that congress believes does not promote th established objectives enforcing restrictions on contents earlier statutes providing trade prom otion authority contained specific procedural mechanisms to enforce requirements they established for the contents of implementing bills and suppor ting information required to be submitted to congress if such requirements could be enforced pr ocedurally at all it would most likely be through points of order for example if an implementing bill included provisions of kinds the statute did not authorize it might be possible for member in either house to raise point of order on the floor that the measure was for this reason ineligible for expedited cons ideration if the chair sust ained the point of order it would in effect vitiate the opportunity for that implementing bill to receive expedited consideration most content and information requireme nts of the current proposals authority retain this approach for example the senatepassed ve rsion of hr 3009 introduces new requirement that the partment of commer ce report to congress by the end of 2002 on steps taken to correct decisions of wto dispute ttlement organs that increase obligations or diminish rights of the united states unless this information requirement is met bills to implement trade agreements reached under the wto may not receive expedited consid eration the bill does not provide any specific mechanism for enforcin g this restriction presum ably however if the report were not to be made and an attempt were made in either house to consider anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs30 21 during consideration of the renewal of trade promotion authority in the 105th congress however s 253 incorporated proposed mech anism to help ensure that if one house amended an implementing bill the two chambers would have an opportunity to adopt single versionimplementing bill point of order might be raised against doing so under the trade authorities procedures the senate bill however also adds some new content and information requirements for which it provides specific procedural enforcement mechanisms these requirements relate to proposals affecting existing us trade remedy laws first if trade agreement requires changes in existing trade remedy laws the chair and ranking minority member of each re venue committee must report to congress on whether those changes would be consiste nt with applicable trade negotiating objectives second under the socalled crai gdayton amendment an implementing bill that contains provisions changing existing trade remedy laws is declared ineligible for consideration under the trade authorities procedures in the senate the senate legislation explicitly provides that point of order may be raised against such provisions if sustained the provisions will be stricken from the bill which would then presumably become eligible for ex pedited consideration alternatively majority of the full senate may vote to waive the point of order or reverse the ruling of the chair on appeal this mechanism affords the senate an opportunity to decide case by case whether to extend expedited consideration to an implementing bill containing provisions of this kind on the other hand it makes provision for the potential consequences of striking out portions of the bill even if the senate then passed the bill in the altered form under the expedite d procedures it could not be enacted until both houses accepted the same version th senate proposal affords mechanism to expedite the reaching of agreement through conference committee or by exchanging amendments between the houses indeed effectual mechanism for compelling the two houses to agree can readily be conceived existing statute providing for an expedited procedure afford s any model for ensuring that measure can be cleared for presidential action under such conditions21 nonstatutory enforcement the ability of congress to enforce restrictions on the eligibility of trade agreements for expedited implementation is not limited to the procedural enforcement mechanisms for which current legislation explicitly provides each house would presumably also be able to enforce all four kinds of restriction discussed above by direct us of its constitutional power to determine its own rules and their application as noted above in many instances each house could presumably enforce statutory provisions th at operate as procedural rules through rulings on points of order each house also always retains the ability permanently to alter or supersede statutory procedure by adopting resolution for the purpose just as it may do for its own standing rules li ke most statutes establishing expedited procedures existing trade law and the cu rrent proposals explicitly reserve to eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs31 house this use of the constitutional rulemaki ng power in relation to some of the procedural mechanis ms described above in the house however if an implementing bill did not meet statutory requirements it would be more likely for the committee on ways and means to ask the committee on rules to report special rule proposing that the measure be considered other than under the statutory expedited procedures this special rule could make amendments in order or even provide that some alternative measure be considered instead of the implementing bill even when measure does meet the criteria of eligibility for ex pedited consideration in f act the house has sometimes considered it under the terms of special ru instead the sena normally alters its established procedures for considering measure only by entering into unanimous consent agreement yet it also retains th ability to reject the motion to proceed to consider an implementing bill that the statute authorizes and then instead take up the measure or an alternative under its general procedures in this context extension and proce dural disapproval resolutions appear as having function parallel to though in sense opposite from special rules in the house like special rules the two kinds of disapproval resolu tion have the function of regulating procedure whereas special rules establish the procedures under which specified measure shall be considered disapproval resolutions determine that certain procedures shall not be used to consider specified measures in this light for example the statutory prohibition on amending an implementing bill appears not as conclusive limitation on the authority of congress but rather as parallel to the closed rule that the committee on ways and means customarily requests for consideration of revenue measureshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs32 prepared by richard s beth specialist in the legislative process government and finance divisionappendix expedited procedures in current law section 151 implementing bills section 151 of the trade act of 1974 blishes expedited procedures for bills to implement trade agreements the following paragraphs list provisions of this section that would apply to the new class of implementing bills that hr 3005 would establish the implementing bill is to be introduced in each house jointly by the two floor leaders or their designees on the first day each house meets after the president submits his draft bill the bill is to be referred to the co mmittees of jurisdiction the principal committees involved will normally be the house committee on ways and means and the senate committee on finance in each chamber if committees of referral do not report by the end of 45 days of session they are automatically discharged if the implementing bill contains revenue provisions however the senate must for constitutional reasons pass the house bill in this case the senate committee is to report the house bill received after house passage if necessary the 45day deadline is extended so that the senate committee s 15 days to report after it receives the house bill once the committees have reported or been discharged motion to proceed to consider the bill is privileged and nondeba table in each house so that special rule in the house or othe r special leadership action is necessary to call it up the motion to consider may not be amended nd the vote on it may not be reconsidered the time for floor consideration is limited to 20 hours equally divided and controlled between the two party floor leaders in the senate between supporters and opponents in the house nondebatabl motion to reduce this time further is made in order each house is to complete floor action within 15 days of session after committees report or are discharged separate mechanism to enforce this deadline is established in the house motion to recommit the b ill is in order also appeals and motions to postpone consideration or turn to other business are nondebatable in the senate debate on an ppeal or debatable moti on is limited to one hour in both chambers amendment may be offered to the implementing bill either in committee or on the floor this prohibition may not be suspended by motion or unanimous consent because the bills must be introduced in identical form and cannot be amended the versions passed by both chambers will presumably be identical after one house passes an implementing bill the final vote in the other house is to occur on the billhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31376crs33 already received from the house th at acted first since both bills will be identical action to resolve housesenate differences can become necessary and this action will clear the measure to be presented to the president if the president were to veto the bill any attempt to override the veto would take place under the general rules of each hous section 151 establishes special procedures for this purpose section 152 extension nd procedural disapproval resolutions section 152 of the trade act of 1974 tablishes expedited procedures for certain congressional actions to make certain implementing bills ineligible for expedited consideration under section 151 as explained in the body of the report hr 3005 makes these extension disapproval resolutions and pro cedural disapproval resolutions eligible for expedited consideration only if they are reported from the committees of referral the respective re venue committees and in the house the committee on rules the following paragr aphs list provisions of section 152 that would apply to these resolutions under the terms of hr 3005 once the resolution is reported motion to proceed to consider it is privileged and not debatable in both houses amendments to or motions to reconsider the vote on the motion are not in order debate on the resolution is limited to 20 hours equally divided in the house between supporters and opponents in the nate between the two floor leaders in both houses amendments to or moti ons to recommit the resolution are not in order in the house motions to rec onsider the vote on the resolution also are not in order in the house appeals and motions to postpone consideration of the resolution or to proceed to consider other business ar not debatable in the senate debate on an appeal or debatable motion is limited to one hour nondebatable motion is in order to limit this debate time further provisions are made for the resolu tion of any differences between the houses because both extension and proce dural disapproval resolutions are simple resolutions of each house separately
