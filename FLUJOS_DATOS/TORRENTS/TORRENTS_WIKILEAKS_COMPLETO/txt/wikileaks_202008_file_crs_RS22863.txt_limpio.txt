national security implications of foreign investment transaction the act may well draw congress into greater dialogue and possibly greater conflict with the administration over efforts to define the limits of the broad rubric of national economic security this report will be updated as warranted by events foreign direct investment in the united states the united states is the largest foreign direct investor in the world and also the largest recipient of foreign direct investment by yearend 2006 foreign direct investment in the united states had reached 18 trillion and us direct investment abroad had reached 24 trillion this dual role means that globalization or the spread of economic activity by firms across national borders has become prominent feature of the us economy and that through direct investment the us economy has become highly enmeshed with the broader global economy crs2 the globalization of the economy also means that the united states has important economic political and social interests at stake in the development of international policies regarding direct investment with some exceptions for national security1 the united states has established domestic policies that treat foreign investors less favorably than us firms in addition the united states has led efforts over the past 50 years to negotiate internationally for reduced restrictions on foreign direct investment for greater controls over incentives offered to foreign investors and for equal treatment under law of foreign and domestic investors in light of the terrorist attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 however some members are questioning this opendoor policy and are arguing for greater consideration of the longterm impact of foreign direct investment on the structure and the industrial capacity of the economy and on the ability of the economy to meet the needs of us defense and security interests committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius arguably the most important and most controversial activities related to foreign direct investment are the reviews and investigation of foreign investments in the united states by the committee on foreign investment in the united states cfius2 the httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22863 committee is an interagency organization that serves the president in overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in the economy originally established by an executive order of president ford in 1975 the committee has operated until recently in relative obscurity3 cfius has the primary continuing responsibility within the executive branch for monitoring the impact of foreign investment in the united states both direct and portfolio and for coordinating the implementation of united states policy on such investment4 following its creation by executive order the committee met infrequently and played lowprofile role in monitoring foreign investment in the economy until 1988 when congress approved the exonflorio provision5 the exonflorio provision grants the president broad discretionary authority to take what action he considers to be appropriate to suspend or prohibit proposed or pending foreign acquisitions mergers or takeovers which threaten to impair the national security in this act national security was not defined but was meant to be interpreted broadly nevertheless regulations developed by the treasury department to implement the law direct the members of cfius to focus their reviews of foreign investments exclusively on those transactions that involve products or key technologies essential to the us defense industrial base and not to consider economic concerns more broadly cfius also indicated that in order to assure an unimpeded inflow of foreign investment 1 crs report rl33103 foreign investment in the united states major federal statutory restrictions by michael v seitzinger 2 for additional information see crs report rl33388 the committee

additional information see crs report rl33312 the exonflorio national security test for foreign investment by james k jackson crs3 it would implement the statute only insofar as necessary to protect the national security and in manner fully consistent with the international obligations of the united states6 when congress adopted the exonflorio provision many members were concerned that the united states could not prevent foreign takeovers of us firms unless the president declared national emergency or regulators invoked federal antitrust environmental or securities laws through the exonflorio provision congress attempted to strengthen the presidents hand in conducting foreign investment policy while limiting its own role as means of emphasizing that as much as possible the commercial nature of investment transactions should be free from political considerations congress also attempted to balance public concerns about the economic impact of certain types of foreign investment with the nations longstanding international commitment to maintaining an open and receptive environment for foreign investment while cfiuss activities often seem to be quite opaque the committee is not free to establish an independent approach to reviewing foreign investment transactions but operates under the authority of the president and reflects his attitudes and policies as result any discretion cfius uses to review and to investigate foreign investment cases httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22863 reflects policy guidance from the president foreign investors are also constrained by legislation that bars foreign direct investment in such industries as maritime aircraft banking resources and power7 generally these sectors were closed to foreign investors prior to passage of the exonflorio provision in order to prevent public services and public interest activities from falling under foreign control primarily for national defense purposes the exonflorio process is comprised of three different steps for reviewing proposed or pending foreign mergers acquisitions or takeovers of persons engaged in interstate commerce in the united states to determine if the transaction threatens to impair the national security cfius has 30 days to conduct review 45 days to conduct an investigation and then the president has 15 days to make his determination the president is the only officer with the authority to suspend or prohibit mergers acquisitions and takeovers neither congress nor the administration have attempted to define the term national security as it appears in the exonflorio statute treasury department officials have indicated however that during review or investigation each member of cfius is expected to apply that definition of national security that is consistent with the representative agencys specific legislative mandate8 for instance over time and through series of executive orders the department of defense has developed the national industrial security program nisp through which it has adopted various provisions under the term foreign ownership control or influence foci these provisions attempt to prevent foreign firms from gaining unauthorized access to critical technology 6 ibid 7 crs report rl33103 foreign investment in the united states major federal restrictions by michael v seitzinger 8 senate armed services committee

through an export control license this type of review is run independently of and parallel to cfius review in 2007 congress changed the way foreign direct investments are reviewed through pl 11049 the foreign investment and national security act of 20079 through pl 11049 congress strengthened its role in two fundamental ways first congress enhanced its oversight capabilities by requiring greater reporting to congress by cfius on the committees actions either during or after it completes reviews and investigations and by increasing reporting requirements on cfius second congress fundamentally altered the meaning of national security in the exonflorio provision by including critical infrastructure and homeland security as areas of concern comparable to national security the law also requires the director of national intelligence to conduct reviews of any investment that poses threat to the national security the law provides for additional factors the president and cfius are required to use in assessing foreign investments including the implications for the nations critical infrastructure in another change pl 11049 requires cfius to investigate all foreign investment httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22863 transactions in which the foreign entity is owned or controlled by foreign government regardless of the nature of the business some foreign investors may well regard this approach as change in policy by the united states toward foreign investment prior to this change foreign investment transactions were reviewed in way that presumed that the transactions contributed positively to the economy consequently the burden of proof was on the members of cfius to prove during review that particular transaction threatened to impair national security pl 11049 however shifted the burden onto firms that are owned or controlled by foreign government to prove that they are not threat to national security in any given year the number of investment transactions in which the foreign investor is associated with foreign government likely is small compared with the total number of foreign investment transactions the number of such transactions however is growing as some foreign governments experience surge in their foreign exchange reserves and they establish sovereign wealth funds and invest their reserve funds abroad in an array of activities including in us businesses homeland security arguably the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 and dissatisfaction among some members over perceived lack of responsiveness by the administration reshaped congressional attitudes toward the exonflorio provision this changed perception became apparent in 2006 as result of the public disclosure that dubai ports world10 was 9 pl 11049 originated in the first session of the 110th congress as s 1610 the foreign investment and national security act of 2007 introduced by senator dodd on june 13 2007 on june 29 2007 the senate adopted s 1610 in lieu of competing house version hr 556 by unanimous consent on july 11 2007 the house accepted the senates version of hr 556 by vote of 37045 and sent the measure to the president who signed it on july 26 2007 on january 23 2008 president bush issued executive order 13456 implementing the law 10 dubai ports world was created in november 2005 by integrating dubai ports authority and dubai ports international it is one of the largest commercial port operators in the world with continued crs5 attempting to purchase the britishowned po ports11 with operations in various us ports after the september 11 terrorist attacks congress passed and president bush signed the usa patriot act of 2001 uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism12 in this act congress provided for special support for critical infrastructure which it defined as systems and assets whether physical or virtual so vital to the united states that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have debilitating impact on security national economic security national public health or safety or any combination of those matters13 this broad definition is enhanced to some degree by other provisions of the act which specifically identify sectors of the economy that congress considered as elements in the critical infrastructure of the nation these sectors include telecommunications energy financial services water transportation sectors14 and the cyber and physical infrastructure services critical to maintaining the national defense continuity of government economic prosperity and quality of life in the united states15 the following year congress transferred the responsibility for identifying critical httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22863 infrastructure to the department of homeland security dhs through the homeland security act of 200216 in addition the homeland security act added key resources to the list of critical infrastructure cikr and defined those resources as publicly or privately controlled resources essential to the minimal operations of the economy and government17 through series of directives the department of homeland security has identified 17 sectors18 of the economy as falling within the definition of critical infrastructurekey resources and assigned primary responsibility for those sectors to various federal departments and agencies which are designated as sectorspecific 10 continued operations in the middle east india europe asia latin america the carribean and north

dhs memo designating critical manufacturing as the 18th sector on the cikr list conclusions the broad sweep of industrial sectors in the economy that fall within the terms critical infrastructure homeland security and key resources reflects fundamental change in the way some in congress view national economic security from this viewpoint economic activities are separately identifiable component of national security and therefore should be protected from foreign investment that transfers control to foreigners or shifts technological leadership abroad this viewpoint however has not been shared by some policymakers within the administration who argue that including critical infrastructure and homeland security in pl 11049 did not alter the overriding focus of the exonflorio provision on investments that directly affect us national defense security as result congress and the administration have sparred at times over transactions that cfius has approved over the objections of various members of congress this clash of views essentially revolves around three longstanding issues httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22863 what constitutes foreign control of us firm b how should national security be defined and c which types of economic activities should be targeted for cfius review some members also perceive greater risks to the economy arising from foreign investments by firms that are owned or controlled by foreign governments as result of the terrorist attacks the dubai ports world case in particular demonstrated that there was difference between the postseptember 11 2001 expectations held by many in congress about the role of foreign investment in the economy and of economic infrastructure issues as component of national security for some members of congress cfius seemed to be out of touch with the postseptember 11 2001 view of national security because it remained founded in the late 1980s orientation of the exon florio provision which views national security primarily in terms of national defense and downplays or even excludes broader notion of economic national security these and other concerns about foreign investment underscore the significant differences that remain between congress and the administration over the operations of cfius and over the economic and security objectives the committee should be pursuing the proposed acquisition of po by dubai ports world sparked broader set of concerns and wideranging discussion between congress and the administration over working set of parameters that establishes functional definition of the national economic security implications of foreign direct investment in part this issue reflects differing assessments of the economic impact of foreign investment on the us economy and differing political and philosophical convictions among members and between the congress and the administration 19 sectorspecific agencies include the departments of agriculture defense energy health and human services homeland security interior treasury and the environmental protection agency
