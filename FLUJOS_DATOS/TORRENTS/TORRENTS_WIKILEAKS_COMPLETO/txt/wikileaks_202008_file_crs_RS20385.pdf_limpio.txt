are receiving more attention in recent years there have been several local and federal initiatives to help low income fathers become more employable and financially and emotionally accountable with respect to their children2 the final reports on the parents fair share pfs demonstration which was designed by the manpower demonstration research corporation and conducted by public and private organizations concluded that with respect to the entire sample of persons participating in the pfs demonstration program the program did not significantly increase employment or earnings during the 2 years after they entered the program however the program did increase earnings among men who were characterized as less employable ie those without high school diploma and with little recent work experience3 in addition another of the final reports found that although pfs did not affect the frequency of fathers visits with their children it did increase their involvement in parenting4 proponents of the pfs approach assert that observers should expect that an endeavor this difficult will have its problems and will not be able to help all noncustodial parents most observers agree that providing grants to wide spectrum of public and private entities will result in an array of specific strategies for successful fatherhood programs5httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20385crs3 6 us congress
