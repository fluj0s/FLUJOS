observed in concurrence with midfrequency sonar operation additional controversy has focused on the development of lowfrequency active lfa sonar environmental interests are concerned with lfa sonar because lowfrequency sound travels farther than midfrequency sound and is closer in frequency to those known to be used by baleen whaleshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33133 order code rl33133 active

research specialist knowledge services grouphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33133active military sonar and marine mammals events and references summary the deployment of active sonar by th us navy and its potential impacts on marine mammals has been an ongoing issue of intense debate regulatory legislative and judicial activity and internationa l concern some peacetime use of military sonar has been regulated under the ma rine mammal protection act mmpa and other statutes due to concerns that active military sonars are operated at frequencies used by some cetaceans ie whales porpoises and dolphins and their high intensity sound pulses may travel long distan ces in the ocean there is also concern that sonar transmissions of sufficiently high intensity might physically damage the hearing in cetaceans or cause them to modify their behavior in ways that are detrimental although midfre quency sonar has been implicated in several beaked whale strandings there is scientific uncerta inty surrounding the totality of the effects active sonar transmissions ma have on mari ne mammals this report summarizes legal and political events related to active sonar and marine mammals since 1994 prior to the late 1990s concerns focused primarily on the use of underwater sound as research tool while strandings and mortality of marine mammals primarily beaked whales have been observed in concurrence with midfrequency sonar operation additiona l controversy has focused on the development of lowfrequency active lfa sonar environmental interests are concerned with lfa sonar because low frequency sound travels farther than mid frequency sound and is closer in frequency to those known to be used by baleen whales additional questions involve how to balance obligations of the military to comply with mmpa provisions as well as provisions of the national environmental policy act and the endangered species act with national security concerns in 2003 congress passed pl 108136 wherei n 319 amended the mmpa to authorize exemptions from restrictions on harassing and otherwise taking marine mammals for national defense generally speaking concern about the nvironmental effects of ocean noise is now principally focused on three activities military sonar exercises oil and gas exploration and commercial shipping th is report summarizes some of the more significant recent events

1371 refers to this action as moratorium some consider this action ban or prohibition because it was and is permanent 2 16 usc 136213 3 16 usc 136218 4 active sonar involves the transmission of va rious sounds pulses t onal signals or bands of acoustic energy and the interpretation of received echoes as way of sensing the environment passive sonar involves listening without transmitting these sounds non military active sonars such as the integrated marine mammal monitoring protection system imaps active tracking system and highfrequency bathymetric mapping sonars are not the primary focus of this report 5 frequency is expressed as the number of cycles or completed alternations per unit time of sound wave most often measured in hertz hz 6 baleen whale sounds are usually below fre quencies of 500 hz and predominantly below 100 hz exceptionally some clicks can reach 3000 hz toothed cetaceans such as sperm whales beaked whales dolphins and porpoises are characterized by their higher frequency sounds from 400 hz to as high as 8000 hz 7 the us navy committed to developing lowfrequency active sonar system in the late 1980sactive military sonar and marine mammals events and references introduction the marine mammal protection ac t of 1972 mmpa 16 usc 1361 et seq established moratorium1 on the taking of marine mammals in us waters and by us nationals on the high seas under the mmpa take means to harass hunt capture or kill or attempt to harass hunt capture or kill2 in addition harassment encompasses both behavioral disruption and physical injury short of death3 however the mmpa does allow us citizen s to apply for and obtain authorization for taking small numbers of mammals incidental to certain activities eg offshore oil and gas exploration and velopment if that taking would have more than negligible effect on any marine mammal species or stock and mitigation and monitoring requirements nd other conditions are met some peacetime use of military sonar s been regulated under the mmpa and other statutes due to concerns that active military sonars4 operate at frequencies5 used by some cetaceans6 and may travel long distances in the ocean current sonars in widespread use are primarily midfrequenc sonars midfrequency active sonar operates between 2 and 20 kilo hertz khz with most current systems using 35 khz and 710 khz lowfrequency sonar is being developed to detect quieter submarines at greater distances7 lowfrequency active l fa sonar operates below 2 khz with most operation between 600 and 1500 hz except the us navyshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33133crs2 8 sound intensity is measured in decibels decibel db is unit used to express the intensity of sound wave equal to 20 times the common logarithm of the ratio of the pressure produced by the sound wave to refere nce pressure typically 1 micropascal at 1 meter in water 20 micropascals at 1 meter in air thus direct numerical comparisons of noise intensity from sources in air and sour ces underwater cannot be made without taking into account the differences in reference pressure for example sound intensity of 235 db underwater is equivalent to 209 db in air
