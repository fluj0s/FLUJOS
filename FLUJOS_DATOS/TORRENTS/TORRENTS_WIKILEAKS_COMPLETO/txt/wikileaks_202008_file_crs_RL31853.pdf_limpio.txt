illness is serious public hea lth problem the centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimate th at each year in the united states 76 million people get sick 325000 are hospita lized and 5000 die from foodrelated illnesses there are many who maintain that these timates understate the problem because many people do not seek medical help for foodborne illness and so those episodes of illness are not included in offici counts most consumers look to the government to regulate and protect the food supply and industry is interested in producing foods that are safe at reasona ble price consequently congress has an interest in oversight and legislation in this area several federal agencies along with c ooperating agencies in the states are responsible for assuring the safety wholes omeness and proper beling of all foods the responsibilities under the current fede ral system are divided among two departments and one independent agency the us department of agriculture usda regulates meat poultry and certa in egg products while the food and drug administration fda in th department of health and human services dhhs sets and enforces standards for safety of all other domestic nd imported foods the fda is also responsible for ensuring that all animal drugs and f eeds are safe labeled properly and produce human health haza rd when used in foodproducing animals the cdc also part of dhhs tracks foodbor ne illness outbreaks the environmental protection agency epa sets legal limits tolerances on the amounts of pesticide residues allowed in or on food production of food is often multistage process i nvolving many different vendors and producers cong ress maintains close oversig ht over federal food safety activities which consist of inspecting testing research and monitoring the food supply in response to limited federal f unding fda and usda adopted an approach to food safety known as the hazard anal ysis and critical control point haccp system it requires food companies to id entify where hazards could enter food during its preparation for market nd to take steps to lower the risk of contamination fears of terrorist attacks spawned legisla tion that has been assisting the federal government in protecting th food supply th public health security and bioterrorism preparedne ss and response act of 2002 pl 107188 requires fda to register food

experts agree that the us food supply is among the safest in the world every year foodborne pathogens in the food supply make many people ill which causes some consumers to lose confidence in its sa fety concerns have been raised about whether the federal regulatory system as currently structured adequately deals with problems in the food supply us consumers worry that current safety efforts may not be enough to provide the vel of safety in the food supply that they demand the nations food safety sy stem consists of activ ities carried out by many different federal state and local government agencies together they inspect test research and monitor the food supply th type and amount of oversight depend on the food product for the most part th agencies monitor whether the food industry are adhering to their legal res ponsibility of ensuring the production of safe food this report provides an ove rview of federal food safe ty activities and issues of concern to congress the major areas of concern include illnesses caused by foodborne pathogens the cost of these illn esses and the vulne rability of the food supply to terrorist acts it also describe s activities of federal agencies

over food security issues enforcement powers such as recalls proposals to reorganize the food safety regulatory structure questions about regulating bioengineered food the growing problem of antibiotic resistan ce and the safety of fresh produce problems in the food supply the us diet is composed of food pr oduced all over the united states and the world for example many us consumers have become more weight conscious and are eating more lettuce as lower cal oriealternative food lettuce consumed domestically may be grown domestically or imported once lettuce is harvested it usually goes to packing house where it is washed mu ltiple times and packaged increasingly lettuce products are produced that contain precut or mixed greens then the product is transported throug hout the country to food distribution warehouses or facilities at each stage in its journey ownership of the lettuce may change and it may be handled by different people or machinery contamination or adulteration

information about product handling processing and shipping may be limited andor incomplete public health problems the centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimate that foodbor ne diseases cause appr oximately 76 million illnesses 325000 hospitalizations and 5000 deaths each year in the united states1 these estimates are based on data from variety of sources including surveillance systems death certificates and academic studies often victims of food poisoning do not report their illness to doctor or they take food poisoning for some other illness such as influenza cdcs current estima tes are higher than prior estimates due in part to better surveillance data rather than changes in disease prevalence even so the most recent cdc preliminary surveilla nce data for 2004 indicate substantial declines in the incidence of infections caused by campylobacter cryptosporidium parvum escherichia coli o157 listeria salmonella and yersinia enterocolitica when compared with 19961998 data2 while bacterialbase d food illness shows decline bacteria can mutate for example one strain of escherichia coli coli common bacteria found in intestines of all birds nd mammals has mutated into deadly form known as coli o157h7 it has been found in hamburger and also in unpasteurized apple juice alfalfa sprouts and packaged lettuce common but unusually virulent type of salmonella called phage type 4 has been found in chickens and dairy cows both pathogens have contributed to number of foodborne illness outbreaks3 in addition to bacteria foodborne di seases and illnesses can be caused by viruses parasites and fung i directly or by toxins produced by the pathogens chemical or drug residues found in food can also have health effects most cases of foodborne illnesses are cla ssified as acute these are usually selflimiting and of short dur ation although they can range from mild to severe gastrointestinal problems and vomiting are common acute symptoms of many foodborne illnesses deaths from acute f oodborne illnesses are ra re however fda estimates that 2 to 3 of all acute cases develop secondary long term illnesses called chronic sequellae chronic sequellae of

blood cell destru ction kidney failure and ne urological complications such as seizures and strokes5 several factors contribute to public hea lth officials increasing concern about the risk of getting ill from food 1 some sensitive popula tion groups such as the elderly the very young pregnant women and people with hivaids and cancer are particularly vulnerable to diseases cause d by foodborne pathogens 2 as people eat out more frequently and re tail establishments proce ss foods onsite there is increased opportunity for contaminated f ood to cause illness 3 more cases of illness from pathogenic organisms on fresh fruits and vegetables have been reported and consumers are eating more produce for its nutritional benefits and 4 the highly mechanized efficient production and longdis tance distribution practices of the food industry make it possible for contamin ated product to be quickly distributed nationally or even internationally and give more opportunity for time and temperature abuse which can promote the growth of harmful organisms costs of illness foodborne illness imposes costs on the us economy according to the us department of agriculture usda foodborne illness costs are borne by the food industry households whose members become ill employers and the public and private health sectors usda estimates costs associated with medical expenses and losse s in productivity from five major types of foodborne illnesses at 69 billion annually in august 2000 dollars6 these costs include medical costs productivity losses from misse d work and an estimate of the value of premature deaths but exclude travel costs in obtaining medical care and time lost from work in caring for sick children this methodology produces estimates that vary based on the expected age distribution of those who become ill for example the annual cost of foodbor ne illnesses caused by salmonella decreases from 37 billion to 24 billion when adjusted for age of death because over twothirds of the deaths from salmonellosis occur in people over 65 adjusting foodborne illness costs by age of death raises cost estimates for coli o157h7 because most deaths occur in children under five that timate is 6591 million estimates of coli andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31853crs4 7 economics of foodborne disease featur available at httpwwwersusdagov briefingfoodbornedis easefeatureshtmrelated pathogens costs are 3297 million fo r combined total of 9888 million for all ecoli related illnesses nd deaths in 20007 aftermath of the terrorist attacks the fall 2001 terrorist and anthrax attacks have forced congress federal f ood safety policymaker s and food industry officials to consider the nations read iness to protect against and respond to intentional acts of food adu lteration or the targeting of food production there is widespread concern that naturally occurring pathogens such as coli o157h7 salmonella listeria and botulinum toxin could be us ed as bioterrorist weapons and could be spread through the multilink food distribution chain in addition there are chemicals dioxin and heavy metals lead or mercury that could be introduced intentionally along the stages of the food ch ain such an attack would be particularly lethal to children the elderl and the immunecompromised one likely goal of terrorist action woul d be to cripple some part of the farm to table continuum any link in the f ood production chain is potentially susceptible to an attack such an attack could cause an erosion of public confidence in the food supply and economic ruin for certain food producers experts recognize weaknesses in the ability of most nations to prevent and contain biological attack on their food supply limited inspection capabilities lack of rapid diagnostic tools inadequate c oordination among inspection agencies and little biosafety training of the industry workforce are among the cited weaknesses even tracing contaminated food back to its point of origin is problematic most nations have responded by ins tituting variety of policies th at help to prevent or if necessary respond to an attack u s activities are discussed below statutory authority the federal government atte mpts to ensure that the food supply is safe from the farm or port to the consumers table th rough statutory mandate s and sciencebased regulatory policies federal laws mandate how each federal agency approaches its role in food safety and these laws dictate very diffe rent approaches fda the federal food drug and cosm etic act ffdca which prohibits the entry into interstate commerce of adulterated or misbranded foods is implemented by fda section 402 of th ffdca defines food as adulterated if it contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to health fda has interpreted this authority broadly to in clude food that is defective contaminated unsafe etc under this authority the agency has established guidance and regulatory requirements for manufacturers to assure that food is safe and not adulterated to enforce the requirements fda monitors food manufacturers through periodic inspections to judge whether they are producing foods appropriately for fy2004 fda plans to use approximately 476 fulltime equivale nt fte positions in the inspection of domestic food manufactur ers this translates into about

reaching consumers fda has direct authority sec tion 409 of the ffdca to approve of food and color additives the law defines food additive to be any substance added directly or indirectly to food incl uding any substance used in producing manufacturing packing processing preparing treating packaging transporting or holding food and including any source of radiation intended for any such use10 an industry or sponsor with proposed food dditive must file petition for premarket approval with fda that incl udes test data showing that the food additive meets the ffdca standard of safe safe means that there is reasonable certainty that harm would result from the substance under its intended conditions of use usda meat and poultry inspection require ments contrast sharply with fdas mandate the federal meat inspection ac t of 1906 as amended by the wholesome meat act of 1967 requires that usda tinuously inspect all cattle sheep swine goats and horses brought into any plant to be slaughtered it also requires that federal inspector be present for at least part of every shift while firm is processing meat products for human consumption c ongress instituted requi rements for poultry in the 1957 poultry products inspection act amended by the 1968 wholesome poultry products act under the meat and poultry acts 7680 food safety and inspection service fsis inspectors ar responsible for inspecting meat poultry and processed egg products for safety wholesomeness and proper labeling at 6200 plants and import facilities such standards are similar to fdas mandate from the ffdca that calls for prohibition of dulterated and misbra nded food usda also has established mandatory program called hazard anal ysis and critical control point haccp for meat and poultry plants see below epa under the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra the environmental protection agency epa regulates the sale and use of pesticide products under the authority of the safetyonly clause

found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal or if it is found after tests which are appropriate for the evalua tion of the safety of food additives to induce cancer in man or animal it means that substance that induces cancer should be added to the food supply and implies that substance that might cause cancer should even be in the food supply whatever its source delaney clause so that ll food both raw and processed has tolerances set under standard that requires all resi dues to be safe and ensures that there is reasonable certainty of harm from the pesticide residues11 agency framework for food safety the statutory structure governing food sa fety yields regulatory system that makes jurisdiction over food dependent on the type of food the way the food is processed or the type of dulterant to be found in pa rticular food critics charge that overlapping jurisdictions and duplicati on of effort waste taxpayers money and result in fragmented system that prevents an effective focus of resources on areas where the risks of adulteration and contamination are greatest federal officials argue that by working cooperatively and through formal understandings among the agencies federal agencies now for th most part avoid duplicating efforts federal agencies responsibilities the diversity of federal agencies and departments with re sponsibilities for food safety can be confusing specifically within usda the food safety and inspection service fsis regulates meat poultry and processed egg products additional agencies in usda the coope rative state research education and extension service csrees the agricultural research rvice ars and the economic research service ers support intramural or extr amural research on food safety and the economics of foodborne illness other usda agencies the f ood and nutrition service fns and the agricultural marketin g service ams ensure the safety of foods distributed through school nutrition programs the fda

of commercial fisheries productshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31853crs7 12 the most important and controversial step in haccp is the choice of the critical control points or ccps ccps are points where control must be exercised because loss of control of ccp is likely to result in contamination of food an example of ccp would be heattreatment step cooking where spec ific combination of time and temperature is maintained to eliminate all pathogens u nder haccp food companies are responsible for identifying and setting the limits of this critic step and putting in place control measures that are activated when the limits are breachedin essence the different agencies food safety re sponsibilities encompass four basic functions that when combined have created system that tries to assure the safety of the food supply 1 providing gu idance to industry about what is expected and developing policies and regulations 2 enforcing compliance by inspections and programs 3 giving premark et approval to additives that will be added to food and listed in the labeling and 4 tracking nd responding to foodbor ne illnesses in the united states and overseas each federal entity may take different approach when implementing these functions establishing guidance and regulatory requirements federal agencies develop regulations to minimiz food hazards and guide the production of safe food these regulations collec tively called good manufacturing practices gmps are proposed after c onsultations with the industry experts the public and other interested parties and go through rigorous notice and comment periods as required by law both fda and usda publis h the gmp regulatory requirements in the federal register they then enforce these standards through inspections and verification of documents gmps for f ood production represent generally recognized practices for food processing and handlin g to avoid contamination with poisonous or deleterious substances filth or potentially harmful microorganisms gmps also address layout and maintenance of facilities pers onnel qualifications the cleaning of equipment and utensils and the processe s and controls required to assure basic sanitation and cleanliness the major par ties responsible for complying with the gmps the manufacturers producers and dist ributors of food must ensure that food when marketed in interstate commerce is not adulterated and does not contain unacceptable chemical residues in addition to publishing gmps fda and usda have adopted in the 1990s preventive approach to ensure safety of food called the hazard analysis and critical control point haccp approach or system it is uniform sciencebased approach to food safety an haccp prog ram typically applie s seven principles based on technical analysis of the food produc tion process that is carried out by the food plant itself the seven principles ar 1 analyze hazards 2 identify critical control points to control identified hazards12 3 establish the point at which preventive action must be taken 4 blish procedures to monitor the control points 5 establish corrective actions to be taken when monitoring shows that critical limit has not been met 6 establish procedures to verify that the system is working consistently and 7 establish effective record keeping to document the haccp system the key to haccp is th use of microbiological approach to pathogen and contaminati on control to prevent th contamination of food the haccp approach has been used by fda in its lowacid canned foods regulations for more than 30 years th haccp approach also gained industryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31853crs8 support when it calle d for giving more responsibility for assuring the safety of the food supply to the food industry once the system is in place fda and fsis review industry records of monitoring at the criti cal control points to assure compliance and evaluate the food products nd facilities in the mid to late 1990s both agencies mandated that certain food pr oducts including seafood fruit and vegetable juices and meat and poultry have plans in place for haccp approach the federal government role is di fferent under haccp from its enforcement role for gmps because gmps are very speci fic requirements that are published in the code of federal regulations and have statutory aut hority behind them haccp plans in contrast are developed by the industry and are tailored to the individual facility or manufacturing line when gmps are not followed official government inspectors have the authority to determine that food is adulterated and have the food seized under haccp the government role is to give guidance oversee safety programs monitor records of the critical control points kept by the company and determine whether the company has corrected any problems that are discovered some in industry argue that the haccp rules are cumbersome layered on top of existing regulations and are expensive to implement consumer groups argue that haccp plans need to be combined with gmp rules for haccp plans alone may not provide adequate regulatory ove rsight to assure food safety enforcing compliance with insp ections and lega l requirements fda has certain enforcement tools which it uses to assure that food is safe enforcement generally begins with insp ection fda officials and some state officials under contract with fda are authorized to ente r and inspect at reasonable times any factory warehouse establis hment in which foods are manufactured processed packed or held prior to intr oduction into interstate commerce or in vehicle transporting food inspections of the 57000 food establishments under fdas jurisdiction occur on average once ever five years if violations are found fda has had the authority since june 2002 to order the detention of food during an inspection the detention is possible only if an fda district di rector finds credible evidence showing the food presents threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals in addition fda can request that the justice department initiate an injunc tion seizure or prosecution however to bring the case to the justice department fda officials must have substantial evidence that the food is adulterated some critics of the current policy suggest that fda needs further enforcement powers such as mandatory recall authority to prevent contamination in the food supply fda uses number of other administr ative tools to enforce its safety requirements it sends warning letters and other regulatory correspondence if evidence has turned up from its inspections the agency also creates import alert lists which name importers w ho have previously tried to import contaminated food it requests voluntary recalls if food has been tested and determined not to meet the criteria under the law however it has power to mandate recalls nor can fda inspectors look at records kept by the plant to meet st ates recordkeeping requirements unless the facility permits it in contrast usda has more daytoday involvement with the foods for which it is responsible under the authority of the

people get sick as result of foodbor ne illnesses such estimates spurred the department of health nd human services dhhs to enhance its tracking systems of these illnesses in order to recognize outbreaks more quickly and begin steps to prevent their spread in 1996 the foodnet surveillance system began collecting information about laboratorydiagnosed cases of foodborne illnesses caused by nine pathogens the ma jor microbial pathogens found in the us food supply16 foodnet was created by cdc fda and usda because public health officials who rely on epidemiology to identify and track the source of outbreaks of foodborne illness did not have an accurate accounting of foodborne illnesses under this system doctors and laboratories report to local health departments when certain pathogenic organisms are found in samples from ill patients states then collect these data and send reports to cdc where fficials can then update the national surveillance database and track foodborne illnesses th most recent findings of the foodnet program preliminar data from 2004 suggest an encouraging track record in preventing foodborne illness compar ed to 1996 when tracking began with incidence of illness from some major pathogens having decreased while the incidence from others relatively minor pathogens remaining unchanged17 if an outbreak is identified by cdc s foodnets active surveillance system strains of foodborne pathogens can be an alyzed by cdcs pulsenet networked computer system linking public health labor atories in 50 states as well as seven fda laboratories and

producing and distributing safe food and that the us system is held up around the world as model for food safety regulation and labeling of genetically engineered foods questions have been raised in various congresses as to whether genetically modified or bioengineered foods are safe and whethe r they should be labeled bioengineered foods or genetically engineered foods ge foods refer to the use of recombinant dna and related techniques to alter the genetic makeup in plants or living organisms these techniques allow scientists to identify and isolate genes of interest from any organism and put them into other organisms scientis ts have developed several types of engineered crops that contain traits making them either herbicide tolerant ht or insect resistant because they contained the gene for the pesticide produced by bacillus thuringiensis bt natural pesticide us farmers have rapidly adopted varieties of these crops in 2004 85 of the total soybean acreage was planted with ht

sunflowers49 on january 18 2001 fda published proposed rule50 supported by the industry that would require that food company notify the agency 120 days prior to marketing bioengineered food and at that time supply the agency with safety test data the proposed rule also strongly ur ged companies to consult the agency prior to the mandated notification deadline in order to ensure agreement on the types of safety testing that would be needed after reviewing the submitted data fda would either issue letter to the company saying it has safety concerns or expressing why the product should not be marketed fda has not finalized this rule currently fda does not requi re labeling of ge foods in the same january 2001 federal register fda published draft guidance for industry on voluntary labeling of foods developed us ing bioengineering in this document fda reaffirmed that it believes as it did in its 1992 regu latory guidance that most genetically engineered foods are substan tially equivalent to their c onventional counterparts the agency decided it would not require speci labeling of all bioengineered foods because it believes that the use of bioengineering or its absence does not itself cause material difference in the food however the agency did suggest that because of the strongly divergent views on labeling manufacturers may consider providing more information on the label about bioengineer ed food the information given however must be truthful and not misleading to avoid false or misleading statements about the absence of bioengineered ingredients because there are established threshold levels of bioengineered cons tituents or ingredients in foods or to avoid implyinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31853crs24 51 see crs report rs20507 labeling of genetically

or genetic modification it so claims that if validated testing is available it can be used to verify whether the label is truthf ul or manufacturers could keep records to document the reasons why foods label is truthful51 supporters of labeling have used the starlink episode as being illustrative of the need for truthful labeling in 1998 epa approved genealtere d variety of yellow corn called starlink for use only as animal feed and set zerotolerance level for its use in human food the corn contains naturally occurring bacterium bacillus thuringiensis or bt bt does not break down easily in the human digestive system is heat resistant and could prove alle rgenic group supporting the labeling of ge foods detected starlink corn in taco she lls in septem ber 2000 the agencies took quick action and millions of pounds of corn suspected of contamination were destroyed illnesses nor allergic reactions from eating the food made with starlink corn were confirmed since then usda has strengthened fieldtesting requirements for permits on genetically engineered traits in plants that are not intended for food production such as pharmaceuticals and veterinary biologics the agency added new safeguards as condition for all permits allowing the conf ined release of such products into the environment52 these specific safeguards include confinement procedures performance standards and required monitoringauditing practices for ensuring that outcrossing or commingling with other seeds and commodities are prevented the new requirements are intended to prevent any pollen drift that could bring with it intermittent low levels of genetically engineeredgenes in food and feed crops under development until all appropriate safety standards are met these new requirements took on new urgency when one firm prodige ne failed to manage former test sites in iowa and nebraska corn containing an enzyme that was used to make pharmaceutical was mixed with soybeans and led to the destruction of 500000 bushels of soybeans thought to be conta minated with the plantbased pharmaceutical the company was fined 250000 and required to pay for the cost of destroying the soybeans the incident has caused the food industry to call for complete separation of plantbased pharmaceutical production from the food supply53 on july 28 2004 the national academies released another report concluding that federal agencies should continue to assess the safety of foods whether produced by genetic engineering or by other ge netic modification techniques such as conventional breeding for sirable traits on casebycase basis to determine whether unintended changes in their co mposition could adve rsely affect humanhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31853crs25 54 national academy of sciences

unique information on the composition of ge foods should be made public and more postmarket surveillance of these foods could create data base of hea lth effects on humans in november 2004 fda published draft guidance describing procedures that it recommends be used to assess the safety of new proteins in pl ant varieties intended for food the draft addresses the potential of new protein to cause an allergic reaction in susceptible people or be toxic to people or animals the agency is recommending that sponsors of new food pl ant varieties consult with fda prior to when the plant protein might be plante d and inadvertently enter the food supply55 under the proposal developers would provi fda with information about the food safety of the new protein at relatively early stage of development of the crop once developer decides to commercialize pa rticular crop the veloper would still be expected to participate in fdas volunt ary premarket consu ltation process the agency also stated that any potential risk from the lowlevel presence of gm material in the food supply would be limited to the po ssibility that it would contain or consist of new protein that might be an allergen or toxin critics of the draft complain that it is vague fails to specify when safety evaluations must be submitted what toxins and allergens should be evaluated and wh ether crops can be planted while fda assesses their safety56 supporters claim that ge foods have been carefully tested by industry and that in fact genetic engineering is more precise than traditional crossbreeding technique that often transfers unwanted ge nes to the food plant however critics question whether the agencies have scrutinized properly the longterm effects of these products on human and environmenta l health including any potential for an unlabeled allergen to become part of the product these critics want mandatory labeling and consultation with the agency prior to marketing antimicrobial resistance public health experts are concerned about the increasing numbers of people who do not respond to standard medical treatment because the microorganisms causing their illness are resistant to the antibiotics normally used to treat the illness or disease antimicrobial resistance in bacteria occurs when genetic changes of microorganism makes it resistant to antibiotics although antimicrobial agents are used to treat illnesses both in humans and animals these agents are also used in food animals for nontherapeutic purposes nontherapeutic use is when producer s of food animals put small amounts of antibiotics in animal feed so their chickens cattle and pigs grow faster use less feed and dont get sick as often nontherapeu tic uses are defined formally in proposed legislation as uses of the drug as feed or water additive for an animal in the absence of any clinical sign of disease in the animal for the purposes of growth

abdominal and skin infections that do not respond to older antibioticsfeed efficiency and sometimes disease pr evention nontherapeutic uses are being questioned because the drugs when used in food animals can also promote genetic changes that make microorganisms resistant to antibiotics used to treat human illnesses however for so large scale animal producers farm might not be commercially viable without the routine use of these drugs in feed some think the link between widespread use in animal feed and increased antimicrobial resistance in humans is not strong enough to warrant the added costs to food production others think use of antimicrobials should be severely constrained to limit antimicrobial resistance the fda states that due to the diffuse use of antimicrobials it is difficult to assess precisely whether the growing resistance in foodborne pathogens is attributable to the use of antimicrobial dr ugs in food producing an imals or some other use on october 23 2003 fda released new guidance document outlining an evidencebased approach to preventing antimicrobial resistance that may result from the use of antimicrobial drugs in animals the document guidance for industry gfi 152 evaluating the safety of antimicrobial new animal drugs with regard to their microbiological effects on bacter ia of human health concern is not regulation instead it explains science based process that drug sponsors may use when they seek approval of an antimicrobi for use in foodproducing animals the new guidance encourages drug sponsors to use risk assessment process to demonstrate that an antimicrobial drug us ed to treat foodproducing animals will not create risk of antimicrobial resistant bacteria likely to lead to human health problems fda states that this process can help prevent antimicrobial drugs with high risk of causing such problems fro m being improperly used in food producing animals and thereby potentially leading to antimicrobial resistance in humans according to july 21 2004 re port by the infectious disease society of america the number of drugresistant in fections including foodborne infections caused by salmonella continues to rise while the number of new antibiotics in the pipeline to combat the infections is declining drastically57 the report contains table showing that since 1998 only two novel antibiotics linezolid and daptomycin have been approved by fda and only five new antibiotics are in the drug pipeline out of more than 506 drugs in development58 it called upon congress to increase funding to several federal agencies to increase the number and size of research grants reduce the cost of clinical trials by providing tax incentives and establish liability protections to reduce companies ri sks in addition according to the report fda should develop wildcard patent exte nsion in which company that creates priority antibiotic could extend the marketing exclusivity period of another fdaapproved drug as

producers to defray the costs of reducing the use of the an tibiotic supporters claim that scientific experts have shown that the overuse of antibiotics in human medicine and livestock are the two chief contributors to the growth in antibiotic resistance in this country critics claim that other uses of antimicrobials are the major cause of resistance in humans on june 3 2005 environmental defe nse an environmental nonprofit organization formerly the environmental defense fund published report claiming that over 26 million pounds of antibiotics impor tant for treating human diseases are used in animal feed each year59 almost all 90 of the use occurs in 23 states this use contributes to an increase in antibiotic resistance in humans they claimed this use is also almost seven times th amount of antibiotics used in humans annually according to the gr oup the study suggests that people living in areas where antibiotics are heavily used in animal feed are at greater risk of developing
