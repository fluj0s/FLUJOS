congressional record members and staff sho uld see the following internet web site httpwwwclerkwebhousegov introduction transportation budgeting uses confusing lexicon for those unfamiliar with the process of budget authority and contract authority the latter form of budge t authority contract authority provides oblig ational authority for the funding of trust1 fund financed p rograms such as the federalaid highway program prior to tea21 changes in spending in the annual transportation budget compon ent had been achieved in the appropriations pro cess by combining changes in budgetcontract authority and placing limitations on obligations the principal function of the limitation n obligations is to control outlays in manner tha t corresponds to congressional budget agreements httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98208crs3 contract authority is tant amount to but does not actually involve entering into contract to pay for project at some future date under this arrangement specified in title 23 usc which tea21 amends authorized funds are automatically made available to the states at the beginning of each fiscal year and may be obligate d without appropriations legislation appropriations are required to make outlays t some future date to cover these obligations as will be discussed tea21 greatl limits the role of the appropriations process in core highway and transit program s because the act sets the limitation on obligations level for the period fy1999 through fy2003 highway and transit grant programs work on reimb ursable basis states pay for projects up front and federal payments are made to them only when work i s completed and vouchers are presented perhaps months or even years after the project has begun work in progress is represented in the trust fund as obligated funds and although they are considered used and remain as commitments aga inst the trust fund balances they are not subtracted from balances trust fund balances therefore appear high in part because funds sufficient to cover actual and expected futur commitments must remain available both the highway and transit accounts have substantial short and longter m commitments these inclu payments that will be made in the current fiscal year as projects are completed and to much greater extent outstanding obligations to be made at some unspecified future date additionally there are unobligated amounts that are still dedicated to highway and transit projects but have not been committed to specific projects two terms are associated with the distribu tion of contract authority funds to the states and to particular pro grams the first of these apportionments refers to funds distributed to the states for formula driven programs for example all nationa l highway system nhs funds are apportioned to the states allocated funds ar funds distributed on an administrative basis typica lly to programs under direct federal control for example federal lands highway program monies are allocated th allocation can be to another federal agency to state to an indian tribe or to some other governmental entity these terms do not refer to the federal budget process but often provide frame of reference for highway program recipients who ma assume albeit incorrectly that st ate apportionment is part of the federal budget per for fy1999 the dot request ed total funding of 43259 billion about 10 increase from the fy1998 enactment of level 42828 billion the department s fy1999 budget request was similar in many respects to the fy1998 appropriation the agencies targeted for

for further information see cr s report 9667 entitled the surface transportation board stb an overview and selected public policy issues by stephen j thompson key policy issues one of the maj or challenges facing appropriators continues to be the allocation of funds for the us department of transportation among numerous competin g national interests competition for these funds stems from various transportatio n interests and from the modal administrations themselves seeking portions of th transportation pie monies have been allocated for diverse array of purposes for example to pay for the expenses of the us coast guard to improve safety across the transportation system and to help finance various infrastructure needs in th dot and related agencies appropria tions act monies are also provided to support the national transportation safety board and the surface transportation boar d stb and several other transportationrelated agencies2 the perennial question of priorities surrounds the appropriations process througho ut its budget request the dot continues to emphasize several prioritie s including safety infrastructure innovative financing environmental enhancement technology and national security much of the appropriations process must take place within the newly enacte d framework f the transportation equity act for the 21st century tea21 signed into law on june 9 1998 pl 105178 hr 2400 the act which authorize s appropriations for key transportation programs through the fiscal year 2003 emphasizes certain programs and deemphasizes others the general sense f congress appears to be that although transportation trust funds are not sacrosanct proceeds from the gasoline tax must be targeted towards the maintenance of the vast us highway and transit network and not viewed as source of revenue for th general treasury although attempts to move highway and transit programs off budget were unsuccessful congress did insert language within tea21to protec t specific funding by creating fire walls around programs in addition to spendin g ceilings the fire walls effectively create floors the creation of these devices emerged as point of contention between authorizers and appropriators surface transportation infrastructure policy the administration requested total of approxima tely 300 billion for fy1999 this requested increase occurred in spite of the limitations placed on domesti c discretionary spending by the balanced budget act of 1997 since man discretionary budget allocations were reduced the increase in transportatio n infrastructure spending is regarded as strong policy statement on the part f congress and the clinton administration that infrastructure is policy priority in each of its budget submissions the clinton administration has sought t emphasize its commitment to improving the nations infrastructure increase dhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98208crs6 us dot budget in brief fy1999 p 83 us dot budget in brief fy1997 p 54infrastructure spending to enhance national productivity and competitiveness was policy feature of both of the presidents election campaigns the administration s fy1999 budget request is predicated on continuation of this policy at least in spirit the administration makes the case in its budget document that the fy199 9 budget request would compliment the spending increases that have occurred earlier in this decade the administration view is that transport ation infrastructure spending3 at the 300 billion level envisioned in its request would provide the highest level of infrastructure spending in dot history in addition the administration take s considerable credit for some improvements in transit capacity airport capacity and highway condition that have occurred in recent years finally the administratio n contends that it has accomplished all of these advances and provided for futur improvements in fiscally responsible manner in reality the administrations fy1999 request is very similar to the levels f funding provided in the fy1998 act this is very much the result of the balance d budget act of 1997 the administration request has now been so mewhat superceded by passage of tea21 by signing this legislation the administration has agreed to somewhat higher level of spending f or surface transportation in fy1998 then it had proposed earlier in the year in addition the administration has agreed to muc h higher levels of spending in the period fy1999fy2003 one of the principal provisions of tea21 is change in the budget treatment of the hig hway and transit programs this new legislation sets limitation n obligations for program spending in each of the next 6 fiscal years and does so b creating fire walls that prevent reductions in spending below agreed upon levels this action deprives the house and senate appropriations committees of thei r traditional authority to determine the absolute level of spending for these programs instead the committ ees now control spending of only small portion of the highway and transit programs over the last several years the administration has attempted to find more funding for infrastructure by changing the way infrastructure was financed to accomplis h this objective in fy1999 the dot proposed to continue supporting stat infrastructure banks sibs at the 150 million level and to finance ne w transportation infrastructure credit program at the 100 million level for fy1998 the sib program combines federalstateprivate funding t help finance variety of transportation improvements such as toll roads and intermodal terminals although the sib program had been adopted by 10 states with an additional 1 5 expressing interest the program was reduced to four states by language in tea21 examples of innovative financing include proposed new transportatio n infrastructure credit program intended to leverage federal dollars and encourag private sector investment in projects of national significance that may be too large to attract local capital the administration also is trying to improve the efficiency of4httpwikileaksorgwikicrs98208crs7 federal funds distribution in dollar terms however the administrations efforts to promote innovative financing represent small portion of the total dot budget technology the administration proposed to spend about 11 billion on transportatio n research development and technology activities during fy1999 this amoun t represents about 10 increase over the fy1998 level for those activities th support of research and technology activities is not goal in and of itself but i t underpins the ther functions of the department for example dot seeks to apply the results of its research and development activities to improve safety enhanc mobility further an intermodal tra nsportation system promote economic growth and trade and support national security the three largest components of the fy1999 research development and technology budget req uest are for fhwas program 582 million faas program 334 million and nhtsas program 53 million increased investment in research and dev elopment continues to be key theme of the clinton administration and this emphasis has been reflected in the department s budget during the last few years it remains difficult t decide on the amount of funds for the num erous rt activities at the department especially when these decisions are considered within the context of the other funding needs dot is involved in variety of technology programs including the partnership for new generation of vehicles the nati onal advanced driving simulator and the advanced technology transit bus one of the largest rt activities is th intelligent transportation systems its program the fy1999 request for thi s multifaceted activity that involves each of the surface transportation modes within the department is 250 million these funds would support comprehensive research and demonst ration program and deployment initiative that initiative is designed to stimulate investments in variety of its technologies such as traffic surveillance crash avoidance systems and safety monitoring for commercial motor vehicles the actual amount of fy1999 contract funds authorized for its is set in the tea21 law for fy1999 that act provides 95 million for research development operationa l tests and other activities considered to be p art of the core departmental its program tea21 also authorizes 105 million of contract funds for its integrated deployment projects the overall highway obligation limitation will reduce the amount of funds actually made available for those activities pl 105277 provides total f 200000000 to be available for implementation of the var ious its program specified in tea21 with an obligation limitation of 883 percent for fy 1999 that amount is effectively reduced to 1766 million the federal railroad administration requested that funding for the nex t generation of high speed rail program be reduced from about 20 million i n fy1998 to about 126 million in fy1999 the senate appropriations committee recommended 28494000 for this program for fy1999 the coast guar d requested 18 million for research development testing and evaluation funds were requeste d for technologies materials and human factors research to improve th coast guards mission performance and delivery of services to the publichttpwikileaksorgwikicrs98208crs8 safety safety continues to be claimed as the departments highest priority dots request for various transportation safety programs for fy1999 is 31 billion an 11 percent increase over the fy1998 level substantial increases are requested for the safety activities of several modal administrations including the federal aviatio n administr ation the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and the federal highway administratio n each year debate continues over the perennial question regarding funds for safety relative to other functions of the dot dot sought to promote public health and safety by working toward th eliminatio n of transportationrelated injuries deaths and property damage funding was requested to increase safety using variety of approaches including rulemaking compliance efforts public education and outreach and direct operations such s vessel traffic services in fy1999 some of the activities intended to achieve th departments safety goals include requesting additional personnel for the fra s office of safety promoting publicprivate p artnerships to demonstrate costeffective safety technologies such as intelligent vehicles and advancing research explorin g causes of and countermeasures for transportation incidents in all modes f transportation spending for nhtsas highway safety programs was intended to increase b 22 from 333 million in fy1998 to 406 million in f y1999 increased funding for grants and research to improve the protection of automobile occupants wa s requested 31 million was proposed for the p residents initiative to increase seat belt use and 102 million was proposed for safety systems research which support s improvements in vehicle structures and occupant protection the 1998 department of transportation appropriations act provided 186500000 for obligations fo r highway traffic safety grants and 146962000 for operations and research for total of 333462000 for nhtsas activities the conference bill ultimatel provided 1594 million for nhtsa operations and research and 3614 million total for all of nhtsas activities tea21 sets specify contract funding levels for th various traffic safety grants administered by nhtsa tea21 also sets n authorization level for nhtsa section 403 research program and for nhtsa s various motor vehiclerelated ac tivities which together form much of the operations and research account of nhtsa consequently tea21 will likely have substantial impact on setting the overall nhtsa budget and appropriation durin g fy1999 through fy2003 pl 105277 provides 159400000 for nhtsa s operations and research account and 2000000 for the n ational driver register and limits obligations for highway traffic safety grants to 200000000 other factors the debate on the fy1999 budget request has focused partly on th administrations funding priorities some members however chose to focus their interests on other priorities such as local needs for roads transit and airports the debate leading to passage of tea21 is indicative of these concerns passage of this legislation has created new issues for the appropriations process primary

appropriations act provides an obligation limitation of 255 billion fo r highway program activities this is an increase of over 40 billion over the fy1998 act and is consistent with the levels authorized by the transporta tion equity act for the 21 century tea21 an additional 12 billionst in exempt obligations is provided by the act 6 the fy1999 act provides for few modest changes in the highway program but generally follows the program guidance provided in tea21 one importan t provision in the act is clarification of tea21s distribution of high priority project funds the act gives the st ates considerable leeway in their treatment of these funds and allows the states to set overall priorities wit hout having to treat each high priority project as separate pot of money finally the act provides funding in th transportation section for the appalachian highway program the act also provides some highway funding in the emergency supplementa l portion of th omnibus act these provisions provide an additional 100 million for alabama and massachusetts that had been promised to these states during the tea21 conference further highway fu nding from this section is provided for west virginia and arkansas some of these funds are for the appalachian highway program the total level enacted for fy1999 is well above what had been proposed by the clinton administration 235 billi

core highway spending total funding for fhwa was set at 267 billion which is somewhat below the senate level much of this difference can be accounted for by the committees decision to zero out funding

recent administrations beginning with the reagan admi nistration have proposed reductions andor outright elimination of these programs transit tends to be supported on local basis with the majority of support coming from urban areas support for sometimes competing highwa programs is seen as having much broad er base especially because of the absence of transit systems in rural areas transit p
