studies are often used in making government policy decisions while the studies are often published traditional federal research funding policies have not required the data on which they are based to be made available publicly such policies generally require researchers to share data and physical samples with other scientists after publication of the research rider called the shelby amendment that was attached to the omnibus appropriations act for fy1999 pl 105277 mandated omb to amend circular a110 to require federal agencies to ensure that all data produced under federally funded award will be made available to the public through the procedures established under the freedom of information act foia the amendment authorize s user fees omb was required to make changes and release revised circular subsequently agencies that choose to do so will issue their own conforming rules omb published proposed revisions for comment in february and august the final revision was issued september 30 published in the federal register on october 8 1999 and took effect on november 8 1999 the amendment originated from disputes about access to research information used in federal regulation it is significant change from traditional practice since while permitted federal agencies typically do not require grantees to submit research data and pursuant to 1980 supreme court decision agencies did not have to give the public access under foia to research data they did not possess as part of agency records to balance the need for public access while protecting the research process ombs revision limits the kinds of data that will be made accessible it excludes personal and businessrelated confidential data and limits applicability to federally funded data produced under an award that has been published or cited by federal agency and used in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law opponents of the amendment say that foia is an inappropriate vehicle to allow wider public access since it will harm the traditional process of scientific research human subjects will believe that the federal government might obtain access to confidential information researchers will have to spend additional time and money putting data into form required by the government thereby interfering with ongoing research and private sector cooperation and funding for governmentuniversityindustry partnerships will be jeopardized proponents of the amendment say that accountability and transparency are paramount the public should have right to review scientific data underlying research funded by government taxpayers some believe that the omb revision narrows the scope of public access to research data contrary to congressional intent and might be challenged in court senator shelby said the final revision while still narrow in scope is good first step some say that the omb revision not the provision in the law directing omb to amend the circular will be the legal predicate if there is court challenge both congress and omb might seek continuing oversight legislation to withhold funding for implementation of the amendment was rejected hr 88 proposal to

governmental policy decisions while the studies are often published the data on which they are based have seldom been publicly available even for federally funded research especially if the study was performed by nonfederal grantee provision in pl 105277 changed that it directed omb to revise its circular a110 to make data from federally funded research governed by the circular available to the public through the freedom of information act foia 5 usc 552 see also crs rept 97911 popularly known as the shelby or shelbyaderholt amendment it is significant change from traditional practice it is controversial and has raised several issues that the 106th congress has been addressing through oversight and legislative proposals the fundamental issue is how to reconcile different public interests on the one hand the public interest requires that governmentfunded research is performed efficiently and effectively and that the rights of individuals involved in that research are protected on the other hand the public has an interest in examining the results of governmentfunded research and in verifying the soundness of the science underlying policy decisions those interests can conflict if for example public access makes the research more difficult or more expensive to perform supporters of the amendment say that the public has right to review all data produced from research supported by taxpayers especially those used in developing federal policies such as regulations most opponents say that using foia to provide access to federally funded research will harm the process of scientific research by imposing additional costs and other burdens on researchers and by making participation in research less attractive to potential subjects and collaborators concerned about confidentiality omb said its revisions to circular a110 attempt to balance those interests httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs2 2at httpwww2whitehousegovombcircularsindexhtml 3omb circular a1 revised subject bureau of the budgets system of circulars and bulletins to executive departments and establishments august 7 1952 this report provides an analysis of the issues raised by the changes to circular a110 mandated in pl 105277 the first section describes the basis for the relevant provision and how it and the proposed changes to circular a110 change access to federally funded research data this is followed by discussion of the issues raised by those changes and relevant activity in the 106th congress requirements of the shelby amendment omb circulars are applicable to the federal executive branch omb describes the intent and authority of omb circulars as instructions or information issued by omb to federal agencies these are expected to have continuing effect of two years or more2 furthermore omb requires all agencies to observe the provisions of relevant circulars3 before passage of the shelby amendment circular a110 did not define data but it permits the federal government to obtain reproduce publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award and authorizes others to receive reproduce publish or otherwise use such data for federal purposes section_36 intangible property also it does not define the word record but pursuant to section _53 retention and access requirements for records requires that records related to an award be kept for minimum of three years from the date of submitting the expenditure report or allows the government to request transfer of records to its custody if it determines that records have long term retention value the same section permits agencies unless required by statute to limit public access to recipient records if the awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure by foia if the records belonged to the federal awarding agency circular a110 applies only to federal grants to and agreements with institutions of higher education hospitals and other nonprofit organizations it does not apply to grants and agreements with state and local governments but federal agencies may apply it to grants awarded to commercial organizations foreign governments organizations under the jurisdiction of foreign governments and international organizations the shelby amendment mandated omb to modify circular a110 to require federal agencies to ensure that all data produced under an award will be made available to the public through the procedures established under the freedom of information act pursuant to the changes made to circular a110 if request is made under foia agencies will be required to obtain certain types of research data from grantees and provide the requester access to the data if foia exemptions do not apply and as permitted by foia the agencies may collect research data in anticipation of public requests for data foia and the circular also provide for cost reimbursement via fees charged to persons who request data under foia httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs3 4according to kathy casey office of senator shelby in 1997 similar effort was made on the house side in full committee while it did not succeed it was something that we were aware of and certainly supported in early 1998 the senator shelby joined by other members senators lott campbell and faircloth was interested in seeing some sort of effort by omb to review the current policies for making federally funded research subject to public disclosure and sought to include language in the treasury and general government appropriations bill origins of congressional action regarding public access to data aaasfederal focus briefing on data access february 16 1999 the language calling for omb action evolved during 1998 from the first proposal which called for study of the issue to the final language in pl 105277 which required specific changes in circular 110 specifically s 2312 the treasury and government appropriations act 1999 required that the director of omb submit report within 180 days of enactment to the senate committee on appropriations 1 evaluating the implementation of specific governmentwide procedures for making federal funded research results including all underlying data and supplementary materials available as appropriate to the public unless such research results are currently protected from disclosure under current law the accompanying senate report 105251 referred to language in omb circular a110 that gave agencies the right to obtain data produced under an award but concluded that these policies sic directives are not being implemented on systematic basis although the national aeronautics and space administration the public health service and the national science foundation currently implement data sharing policies in order to permit wider assessment of the validity of the research results and to facilitate broader public understanding other federal agencies do not given the prevalent use of government funded research data in developing regulations and federal policy it is important that such data be made available to other interested

but the laws supporters believe that better access is needed6 the amendments supporters say two issues were raised by the epa dispute one was the need for transparency that the public should have access to data that they paid for and that affects policy the second related to accountability that the public not only peer reviewers or scientists should have right to examine the data on which agency regulations are based since the data or interpretations of it might be incorrect and regulations can be very expensiv to implement and to comply with proponents have argued that data access is important to ensure that regulations are wellsupported scientifically and do not carry an undue burden7 those issues are not new8 but they had been relatively quiet since the us supreme court ruled in 1980 that grantees data were not agency records within the meaning of foia because the data had not been created or obtained by federal agency the case was forsham v harris9 the legal issue presented was whether records that were created and retained by nonagencies but which are in some way affiliated with an agency may be classified as agency records in forsham the court established the minimum requirements for determining agency record status in the context of records created by nonagencies in forsham private organization of physicians sought to obtain the data underlying the report of department of health education and welfare hew grantee funded to conduct study of diabetes treatment regimens the plaintiffs alleged that the data they sought were agency records because 1 they were records of the grantee which received its funds from federal agency and were subject to some supervision in the use of those funds 2 the federal agency had authority under its grant agreement to have obtained the data had it chosen to do so and 3 they formed the basis of the grantees reports which were relied upon by the agency the court found that congress had purposely excluded federal grantees from the foia and held that the private grantee was not an agency subject to the foia the court also concluded that the required data were not agencyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs5 10written data generated owned and possessed by privately controlled organization receiving federal study grants are not agency records within the meaning of the act when copies of those data have not been obtained by federal agency subject to the foia federal participation in the generation of the data by means of grant from the department of health education and welfare hew does not make the private organiza tion federal agency within the terms of the act nor does this federal funding in combination with federal right of access render the data agency records of hew which is federal agency under the terms of the act ibid at 171 11ibid at 186 12ibid at 180 13for instance an official of the us chamber of commerce testified in support of the shelby amendment and in opposition to hr 88 saying that the excessive cost of compliance with federal regulations cited as 737 billion annually coupled with the lack of public review of the data used by agencies in developing regulations justifies support for more access william l kovacs statement of the us chamber of comme rce before the house subcommittee on government management informatio n and technology house committee on government reform hearings on hr 88 regarding data available under the freedom of information act 15 july 1999 pp 23 another witness robert w hahn of the aei brookings joint center for regulatory studies testified at present analyses used in policy making are rarely checked carefully before big regulations are put in place he also said the peerreview processis frequently not adequate for major public policy decisions such as those involved in regulation he recommended allowing greater access to information that pertains to the formulation of such regulations testimony robert w hahn p 2 at hearing ibid at the same hearing michael gough of the cato institute claimed that study ultimately supporting regulation was published in refereed journal but that upon replication it yielded different nonsupporting results the importance of data access for science and governance at hearing ibidrecords within the meaning of foia because the data had not been created or obtained by federal agency10 and the foia applies to records which have in fact been obtained and not to records which merely could have been obtained11 the court suggested that the grantees data could become agency records if it could be shown that the agency directly controlled the grantees daytoday activities12 the legislative history of the amendment is sparse because hearings were held on it before passage the major indication of legislative intent other than the language in the provision itself and the report language is from senate floor statements made at the time the amendment was adopted however on july 15 1999 the subcommittee on government management information and technology of the house committee on government reform held hearing on hr 88 bill that would repeal the amendment that hearing provided additional background proponents of the amendment cited the costs of compliance with federal regulations coupled with the lack of public review of the data used by agencies in developing regulations they also cited concerns about the adequacy of peer and agency review mechanisms to validate scientific data for setting regulations13 opponents cited concerns about possible violation of the privacy of human

funded by federal grants have been required to provide the agency with grant completion report and copy of the publication that resulted from their research if there was one as is discussed in this section agencies have developed policies to encourage researchers to share their data with other researchers however agencies have not generally required researchers to provide the data used or collected to the federal agency that sponsored their research therefore while data may be available to other researchers they have not been available to the public those practices are based on principles and policies about governmental support of science many of the principles about federal support for science were discussed first in science the endless frontier by vannevar bush science adviser to presidents franklin roosevelt and harry truman considered to be the document that established the basis of policy for government support of and accountability for extramural especially academic research by grants15 after world war ii congress initiated large programs to fund scientific research because of its perceived immediate or future value to the nation postworld war ii enactments creating the national science foundation the national institutes of health and so forth led to the development of programs of governmental grants for research and for education and training of scientists in us colleges and universities scientists were largely given responsibility through the research funding agencies to select research grantees by means of peer and merit review

scientific research reflects principles that scientists consider important to the conduct of research those include scientific peer review of data and findings replication of research results use of publications to award credit for discovery and interpretation of data and protection of the process of scientific inquiry especially important to scientists is public discussion of preliminar findings

instruments set overall federal policy about ownership of data produced under grant awards in general researchers have acted as owners and agencies have permitted them to act as owners of data in that they retain them and control access to them over time federal agencies have developed their own separate policies that generally endorse sharing by the researchers of recorded information following publication of research results with access limited to other researchers and with adequate safeguards for protection of confidential information relating to human subjects or confidential commercial

some say that the courts have interpreted the exemptions narrowly promoting disclosure39 foia also permits agencies to charge requesters for the cost of complying although agencies do not retain the reimbursements which go to the treasury only direct costs can be reimbursed and they are limited at most to search duplication and review lower charges apply to certain classes of requesters such as educational institutions and the media before passage of the shelby amendment private performers of federally funded research were not required to provide federal agencies with raw data and related information in response to foia requests however if the funding agency obtained the data for federal purposes40 such as to investigate possible scientific misconduct the data became agency records

applicability of the provision from regulations to research that has been published and used in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law the second proposed revision defined the terms published and research data and sought comments on whether the revision should apply only to regulations with impacts of 100 million or more the final revision defined the term published as in the second proposed revision but defined research data slightly more restrictively replacing the term files with information to prevent the release of video or audio tapes of research subjects the implications of these differences in language are discussed below in the section on issues the shelby amendment provides specifically for cost reimburseme nt via reasonable user fee equaling the incremental cost of obtaining the data if the agency obtaining the data does so solely at the request of private party the omb language pertaining to this issue which did not change through the three versions of the revisions allows an agency to obtain reimbursement of the full incremental cost of obtainin g the research data including the costs incurred by the agency the recipient of the research funding and applicable subrecipients provided that the agency obtains the data solely in response to foia request the supplementary information attached to the second proposed revision said agencies would be allowed to retain that fee to reimburse themselves recipients and applicable subrecipients for the costs they incur omb also requested comments on estimates of such incremental costs and on the ways that grant recipients might charge such costs to their awards the supplemental information attached to the final revision explained procedure agencies could use to obtain reimbursements for grantees but contained the same costreimbursement provisions as in the first and second proposed revisions although the final revised circular became effective thirty days after publication in the

second proposed and final revisions of circular a110 for instance the supplementary information attached to the second proposed revision said in preparing the proposed revision omb has used its discretion to balance the need for public access to research data with protections of the research process specifically omb seeks to 1 further the interest of the public in obtaining the information

to the final revision omb also said that it does not construe the statute as requiring scientists to make research data publicly available while the research is still ongoing because that would force scientists to operate in fishbowl and to release information prematurely55 the desire for scientists to do research using the traditional scientific process also led omb to allow grantees to withhold

requestor that the disclosure of the data in question is in the public interest congress needs to do more investigation of this concern statement of alberts ibidissues the use of the freedom of

protections provided by foias exemptions and potential for abuse58 some suggest that requests should meet public interest test before data are released59 the issues raised by the amendment and the omb revisions to circular a110 can be divided into four categories whether the revision of circular a110 will make the desired information available to the public whether the procedures established will

this version is more restrictive than the proposed language of the first revision which would have limited release to federally funded research data relating to published research findings that were used in developing federal policy or rules but less restrictiv than the proposed language of the second revision which would have limited applicability to published research findings that were cited in or used by the government in developing regulation omb said that it based its first proposed revision on its interpretation of floor statements in support of the provision made by senators shelby trent lott and ben nighthors campbell60 however those senators cosigned letter of april 5 1999 to omb director lew criticizing the narrow approach of omb61 we believe that the clear intent of the statutory language the accompanying report language and floor debate was to make all federally funded research data subject to foia not just data which are used to support federal rule or policy additionally omb cited parts of comment letter to the second revision submitted by senators shelby lott campbell and gramm that the revision should not be limited to regulations but should apply generally to federal actions that can dramatically impact the public62 in respons to comments that application only to data directly related to regulations narrowed access contrary to congressional intent63 omb in the final revision to circular a110 broadened applicability to when federal agency publicly and officially cites the research findings in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law omb said that would include actions in the form of administrative orders but added we think that agencies rarely rely on federally funded research in the context of their administrative orders64 omb said it decided not to extend the scope of the revision to agency guidance documents and other issuances that do not have the force and effect of law because that would be difficult to implement it is possible that the omb final rule will be subject to court challenges since it limits public access to research data and is more restrictive than congress apparently intended in passing the law some say that is moot point since the omb circular not the provision in the law directing omb to amend it will be the legal predicate if there is court

omb director lew september 10 1999what data will be made available to the public the amendment said that foia would apply to all data produced under an award but did not define data the first and second proposed omb revisions were more restrictive than the language of the amendm ent see table 2 the first version used but did not define data the second and final revisions did so what is meant by data many in the scientific community expressed concern about how data should be interpreted it might include not only final data but also preliminary results as well as emails physical specimens notes of researchers and so forth as discussed above many federal agencies encourage or require researchers to share physical specimens as well as data with other researchers after the completion of research project federal agency definitions such as those used by the nsf nih and nasa define data as recorded information regardless of form or medium that can include computer software and copyrightable materials the definitions of data however do not include physical specimens66 in their april 5 1999 letter to omb director jacob lew senators shelby lott and campbell stated at minimum data should include all information necessary to replicate and verify the original results and assure that the results are consistent with the data collected and evaluated under the award this would include all tangible information or materials including but not limited to measurements surveys and experime ntal details and subsequent data treatments including statistical analyses obtained performed and compiled by researchers under an award and used as the basis for reasoning calculations or conclusions p 3 the second and the final revisions of circular a110 used the term research data defining it as stated in table 2 the definition focused on recorded factual material needed to validate research findings and specifically excluded several other kinds of information and materials including physical samples about which commenters on the february proposed revision had expressed concern however arguably the second version would have permitted access to film or video of interviews with subjects which are both recorded data and samples the final version seems to permit researchers to withhold access to such records the second proposed and the final revisions also excluded from the definition of research data materials similar to two foia exemptions despite the objections of many including sponsoring senators that exclusions at the outsetareinconsistent with the plain meaning of the law and that these kinds of data could be exempted by an agency via the foia exemption process67 omb retained them in the final revision see table 2 one exclusion related to

excluded information which may be copyrighted or patented which commenters thought was too broad the other exclusion is for information that would constitute clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy the second revision had excluded files rather than information but omb explained in the supplementary information attached to the final revision notice that many commenters said they feared that video or audio tapes of research subjects might not be considered to be in the form of file and could be subject to disclosure but that the word information covers such materials thus grantee would not be required to submit excluded records to the funding agency in addition the agency would presumably subject the records that were submitted to further screening under the exemptions omb also noted that the courts have allowed agencies to withhold an entire recordif necessary to ensure privacy eg in case where notwithstanding the redaction of names or other personal identifiers an individuals identity could still be inferred from other information68 to what activities does the provision apply the final omb revision limits public access to research data consisting of recorded factual materials necessary to validate research findings excluding preliminary analyses drafts of scientific papers plans for future research peer reviews and communications it also excludes physical objects such as laboratory samples trade secrets and information required to be held confidential until publishing or similar information protected under law and personnel and medical information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy furthermore the materials have to have been published in peerreviewed journal or cited by an agency in support of an action that has the force and effect of law see table 2 for complete definition examination of funding sources indicates that about 47 of federally funded extramural research is potentially covered by circular a110 see table 1 it consists of federally funded research to universities and colleges and nonprofit performers most of which is funded by grants however the data that would actually be made accessible to the public will likely come from small proportion of federally funded research activities much of the scientific activity that circular a110 covers is basic research69 it is arguably likely that under ombs final revision most basic research would not be accessible to the public under foia because of exemptions the way data is defined and the fact that most academic basic research is unlikely to produce results used in developing an agency action that has the force and effect of law however much basic research is aimed at developing scientific principles that can lay the groundwork for applied research that is targeted at specific policies actions or regulatory issues httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs22 70an executive agency shall use procurement contract as the legal instrument

httpombwatchorgnpadva110rev2html omb also said in the supplementary information attached to the second revision that it might narrow data access only to regulations that meet 100 million threshold level of impact and it sought public comments on this suggestion the supplementary material attached to the final revision said omb would not limit the applicability only to agency actions that have an impact over 100 million because it received comments of both strong support for and opposition to the 100 million threshold some believe that much research used in developing agency actions that have the force and effect of law will still not be accessible to the public that is because circular a110 does not cover contracts which agencies must use if procuring services70 such as data which an agency knew from the outset would be used in developing specific agency actions including regulations federal agencies would not be required under the amendment to obtain data from contracted research thus such data would not be available to the public under foia unless the contract required that the data be provided to the agency the circular also does not covers grants to state and local governments so data from such awards would not be available under the amendment in light of such considerations some observers have proposed that omb extend the revisions of circular a110 to both the federal acquisition regulations 48 cfr 1ff which cover contracts and circular a102 which covers grants and cooperative agreements with state and local governments71 what is meant by published the first omb revision limited applicability of the amendment to data relating to published research findings it did not define published which could be interpreted narrowly or broadly as commenters noted for example it could apply only to papers published in scientific journals or to discussions of preliminary findings at meetings data cited in papers sent out for peer review mails and so forth in

publically available under foia72 in response the second and final omb revisions defined published research findings as those appearing in peerreviewed scientific or technical journal or publicly and officially cited in support of an agency action that has the force of law or in the case of the second revision cited in regulation some critics have said that language would not resolve several problems for instance omb watch said the trigger should not be based solely on whether the agency simply cites the research in its support of the regulation rather the trigger should be based on whether data from the cited research was part of the underlying assumptions or assessments used in developing the regulation73 nih proposed narrowing access to significant scientific findings when regulatory agency cites research in the regulatory process that research may be critically or marginally applicable to that regulation brief review of regulations revealed that some cite hundreds of research studies all of which would be subject to foia under this amendment it would greatly reduce the burden of this legislation if access were afforded to data from only those studies that were critical in the formulation of the regulation74 another question still troubling to some despite the language of the final revision is what impacts public access will have on the ability of the researchers who develop data set to benefit appropriately from the effort they have invested researchers often publish more than one paper from set of data data cannot be copyrighted75 and scientists have traditionally been reluctant to make data public until they have had an opportunity to analyze them fully and publish the results once data become publicly available others might use them to publish analyses before the original researchers have the opportunity to do so76 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs24 77letter from senators richard shelby ben nighthorse campbell and trent lott to

separate from the office processing the request the agency is permitted an extension of up to ten working dayshow quickly should access to the data be provided senators shelby lott and campbell recommended to omb that the public should have access in sufficient time to review underlying data before rule or policy is issued omb should encourage agencies to 1 notify the public of which studies will be used as early as is feasible in the rulemaking or policy development process and 2 process all timely and relevant data requests before the public comment period on proposed rule or policy closes in additionclarification that risk assessments and other federal reports or surveys are covered independently under the proposed revision will also help by providing the public with chance to review the underlying data supporting these government findings before they are used in rulemaking process77 the first second and final versions of the revisions to the circular proposed reasonable time standard for the response to request for research data some say that those who use foia to obtain data to comment on proposed regulation may not obtain the data quickly enough to do so78 typical comment periods for regulations are 30 60 or 90 working days although longer periods may be provided for complex rules79 in most cases an agency would be required under foia to notify the requester within 30 working days six weeks whether it would comply with request80 if it grants the request it must comply promptly or it may be subject to legal action once the data are obtained requesters must examine and possibly reanalyze them to develop comments in defense of the reasonable time standard omb explained in the supplementary informa tion attached to the final revision since omb and the agencies do not yet have experience with implementing the public access process we believe the reasonable time standard which allows consideration of the circumstances of particular case is appropriate as omb andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs25 81omb final revision p 54929 82the circular requires retention of financial records supporting documents statistical records and all other records pertinent to an award for three years it also gives government representatives the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books documents papers or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards for as long as records are retained section __53 section __36c states that the government can obtain reproduce publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award unless the awarding agency waives that right and allows the government to authorize others to receive reproduce publish or otherwise use such data for federal purposes 83council on governmental relations cogr policy considerations access to and retention of research data 1996 the agencies gain experience with the public access process we may be able to develop further clarification on this point81 how long should the data be kept and who should keep them section_53 of circular a110 requires that papers or records pertinent to an award there is specific requirement about data but it is implied must be retained for three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report and that if the grantee holds it longer the federal government can still access it82 thus if the researcher kept records subject to the new circular for more than three years the funding agency would be able to seek that information to respond to foia request if eligible research were officially cited or used in support of an agency action that has the force and effect of law but more than three years after an award had ended the data might longer be available however in practice scientists would seem unlikely to so quickly discard data from such important research questions remain about who whether the university or the researcher should be the custodian of the data that is important because the researchers who collected the data may leave the institutions where the research was conducted according to the council on governmental relations cogr various custodial arrangements could be considered custody could theoretically be placed at central facility the department the laboratory or with the individual principal investigator at least one university harvard has made the originating laboratory the custodian of research data alternatively universities may wish to assign custody of data to faculty and researchers whether those individual reside at the home university or move to another institution if soarrangements should specify that the custodian is responsible for providing access to the data as well as for providing adequate data storage such custodial arrangements should recognize ownership right and require the custodian to keep the data in trust not moving or destroying it without appropriate advance notice and permission from the legal owner 83 how will public access to research data serve the public interest the debate before and after passage of the shelby amendment and the hearings held on hr 88 produced numerous reasons for widening public access to data from federally funded research one is the transparency argument that the public should have access to the data since it was funded with taxpayer dollars other reasons are morehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs26 84see for instance harris cooper and larry v hedges eds the handbook of research synthesis new york russell sage foundation 1994 573 ppdirectly related to accountability and the processes and politics of us policymaking that rely on scientific and technical information or judgments as more and more costly public policy decisions are based on scientific and technical information there will likely be more public scrutiny of the rationale for those decisions that is especially true in controversial issues where different scientists might interpret research data and their policy implications differently or when opposing interest groups might bring conflicting scientific data to bear on decisionmaking some contend that public understanding of science and public financial support for science might be enhanced with more access to research data others say that more access would ensure confidence in the legitimacy of governmental actions some say that peer review by other scientists may not be adequate to validate research especially when findings affect important public policy decisions that is crucial when research findings are based on metaanalysis or research synthesis when researcher develops new policyrelevant research finding based on synthesizing the findings of many different research studies relating to the same topic84 those research methods are increasingly used in policy analysis others question not only the techniques used in metaanalysis but also the validity of the original research and findings in addition some segments of the public are skeptical of the government s ability to correctly represent interpret or present all relevant scientific findings especially given recent disclosures about federal agency misrepresentation of medical experimentat ion such as the tuskegee experiments relating to treatment of syphilis and of radiation exposure levels around some nuclear research laboratories there is also skepticism about federal agency findings and policies relating to research or research evaluations of subsidy or intervention programs in such diverse areas as science education and genetic engineering of crop seeds and other farm products advocates of public access say that in cases like those they should be given access to research data to replicate the analyses to verify or refute the findings or to evaluate methods used in conducting the research and interpreting the data interested members of the public seek the same kinds of access as other researchers often have to data physical samples specimens and other records from federally funded research for most research however scientists find that independent evaluation of the raw data from study is not necessary to evaluate the validity of the research federal agencies and the scientific community use several methods during the research process with public involvement usually limited to later stages those evaluations usually do not involve examination by others of the raw data produced by the researchers before grant for scientific study is awarded the granting agency generally performs merit review of the proposed study including an evaluation of the proposed methods of research and analysis that review often involves evaluation of the proposal by independent scientists as study progresses scientists usually report on progress including preliminary findings to their colleagues those findings may become public at that time if reported at scientific conferences attended by members of the press researchers may adjust methodologies or perform additional research based on the feedback they receive from colleagues once study or ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs27 85cre enhancements to the scientific enterprise httpwwwthecrecomaccess comments124htmlparticular stage is completed researchers usually prepare the results for publication as part of that process drafts of articles reporting the findings are usually evaluated by other scientists who examine the methodology analysis and other elements once paper is published other segments of the scientific community and the public may respond to it and they might challenge the premises methodology analyses or conclusions such challenges might include other research aimed at testing the validity of the findings the potential for such testing is one of the fundamental checks on validity provided by the scientific method if independent researchers obtain the same results that greatly strengthens the conclusions if the results cannot be replicated then the original conclusions were probably not correct however replication can be difficult or even impossible for largescale studies or those using unique sets of information such as the harvard six cities study cited earlier also in some instances regulatory or other decisions might need to be made before confirming experiments could be performed it is for such cases that evaluation of the data by others can be especially important in judging the validity of the research public access to such data may lead to several alternative evaluations being produced by interested parties that should help validate conclusions and increase the likelihood that errors will be detected according to some it could lead to higher standard of reviewand the end result of this approach will be body of scientific work more rigorously tested and reliable85 however evaluation of data is itself an area of expertise requiring skill and training for example statistical analysis can be done in many ways and use of an inappropriate procedure can easily lead to spurious conclusions therefore public assessment of the original and alternative evaluations may be difficult will the procedures established adequately protect proprietary information and the privacy of human subjects some opponents of the amendment say that foia is an inappropriate vehicle because its exemptions would not provide adequate protections for research data that should not be made public as is specified in the final revision to omb circular 110 in responding to foia request researcher or research institution may withhold from an agency data that consists of trade secrets confidential information or information that is protected by law or personnel and medical information whose disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy those definitions are similar to foia exemptions 4 and 6 but these data will not be sent to the agency for consideration for redaction as will be discussed next despite those protections some researchers believe that human subjects data and proprietary data will not be adequately protected protection of proprietary information and trade secrets the final revision to the circular like the second proposed revision included language that excluded proprietary information and trade secrets from the research data that would have tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs28 86omb final revision p 54928 87see for example cre intellectual property protection httpwwwthecrecom accesscomments222html 88the house committee on

being considered see predisclosure notification procedures for confidential commercial information executive order 12600 3 cfr 2351988 the submitter then has an opportunity to convince the agency that the information qualifies for withholding submitter can also file suit to block disclosure under the foia such lawsuits are generally referred to as reverse foia lawsuits because the foia is being

information which may be copyrighted or patented omb explained in the supplementary information published with the revision that to avoid unintended consequences and to avoid having to sort out the complexities of copyright law and how it might apply in various areas of federally funded research the substitute language is intended to ensure that the public access process will not upset intellectual property rights that are elsewhere recognized and protected under the law86 in addition the exemptions and other precedents associated with foia would seem to prevent public access under the shelby amendment to trade secrets and confidential business information exemption 3 exempts from mandatory disclosure matters exempted from disclosure by other statutes exemption 4 specifically protects trade secrets and privileged or confidential business information commercially sensitive data in pending patents are also protected from disclosure by other statutes87 also the submitter of information may challenge its release through reverse foia lawsuit88 some have complained that opportunities to compromise commercially relevant information could arise in the context of joint universitygovernmentindustry partnerships even if the federal share of support is only 10 since public access will not depend on the level of funding or whether the award recipient is also using non federal funds89 there is also the view that some partnerships that include federally funded researchers make strict requirements on the researcher not to share datahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs29

cogrcase law regarding use of exemption 4 shows that two major tests are being used decisions regarding release of data are based on whether the provider is likely to experience competitive harm as result of the release if universities desire to shield scientific raw data protection may well hinge on the broad interpretation of competitive harm the second criterion traditionally used is the government impairment test release is usually granted when courts find danger that the government would be unable to obtain information in the future or that release would cause substantial competitive injury cogr legislation to amend omb circular a110 p 4 95ibid 96testimony before the subcommittee on government management information and technology house committee on government reform july 15 1999further without such agreements private researchers would not participate in these partnerships90 nas president alberts testified on this subject at hearings on july 15 1999 for example commercial interests that have strong competitive interest in particular areas of research will now be able to use foia requests to obtain universitybased research data for their own use and competitive advantage in an effort to dominate or control that area of research ultimately discouraging independent university research in these areas where universities have industry partners for jointly sponsored research projects commercial concerns can use foia requests to obtain research data from these projects to the detriment of the actual project sponsors who are their competitors91 he also said foreign governments would obtain data from federally funded basic research for use in their own rd92 there is also concern about timing under us law scientists have year from the date of publication to file patent application will allowing data to be publicly available through foia threaten scientists foreign patent rights93 according to the council on governmental relations cogr considerable case law has grown around use and challenges under foia and indicates that exemption 4 has been effective in protecting university data94 there are well understood exemptions that serve to protect data that are important to universities for scientific or commercial reasons according to cogr95 in fact according to testimony of james t oreilly visiting professor of law university of cincinnati college of law and author of federal information disclosure the protections afforded by the exemptions to foia and court and case law together with agency rules and policies have been viable in protecting privacy and commercial interests in addition he said there are about 100 special exempting statutes the conflicts over specific research interests in medical device testing data

projects who either contributed parts of the database to the project or participated in developing the database an opportunity to make recommendations to the federal agency regardin g which data should be withheld from disclosure pursuant to the foia exemptions97 protection of personal information about volunteer human subjects many scientific studies involve volunteer human subjects concerns about protecting the privacy of those subjects has increased in recent years in conjunction with the increasing capabilities of information technolog to integrate separate pieces of related information and the rapid pace of discoveries about human genetics98 many observers believe that current protections for personal medical and health information collected during medical treatment as well as during scientific research are inadequate generally and congress has considered legislation to address such concerns99 some analysts suggest that the potential for increased public access to health research data provided by the revision of circular a110 may increase those concerns the exclusion of certain personal information in the circulars definition of research data table 2 is intended to protect against unwarranted invasions of privacy foia exemption 6 provides additional protection as does the public health service act100 however foia permits but does not require agencies to withhold information covered by the exemptions and courts have ruled that public interest in disclosure may outweigh privacy interests see section on foia above therefore some fear that information that human research subject was told was confidential might become public in addition courts might reject the exclusions that omb wrote into the definition of research data and require researchers to submit all data to the agency which would then determine what personal information can be withheld some have expressed concern that the sorting and analytical capabilities of information technology might permit human subjects to be identified even if personal identifiers were removed according to nih director varmus httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs31 101statement of harold varmus md director nih before the subcommittee on government management information and technology committee on government reform 15 july 1999 p 4 102see footnote 13 above statement of william kovacs at hearings on hr 88 regarding data available under the freedom of information act 15 july 1999 pp 23foia would allow the government agency to remove obvious identifiers such as name social security number telephone number but in given data set it is quite feasible to identify subjects using other information if the requestor knew few items about an individuals history such as place of birth education occupation marital history or other general information an individual could be identified such identification would then open up the whole research record including personal medical information to the requestor101 related concern of researchers is that potential volunteer human subjects fearing that personal private information will not be protected will be reluctant to participate in research projects experience over time will indicate whether the exclusions embodied in the term research data will resolve concerns about privacy and proprietary information what will be the financial benefits and costs of implementation potential financial benefits associated with the shelby amendment could result from savings from actions not required three kinds of costs are potentially associated with implementation reimbursable costs nonreimbursable costs and costs associated with the litigation that could follow implementation each of them is discussed below potential benefits the potential financial benefits of the amendment would be reflected in any net savings to the public and the private sector that could occur if implementation pursuant to circular a110 prevented agency actions having the force and effect of law if the benefits of the actions were determined incorrectly or if the benefits did not justify the expense this might include the net savings accruing from postponing or not imposing regulations or other standard setting requirements these kinds of actions could result according to some observers in savings of billions of dollars annually102 it is also possible that wider public access to research data used in federal actions having the force and effect of law could facilitate public scrutiny and identification of errors which if corrected might lead to improved federal actions and regulations however it is difficult to speculate about range of cost savings in the absence of information about which actions might be subject to provisions of the law reimbursable costs foia allows the federal government to recover reasonable costs of fulfilling requests although reimbursements go to the treasury not to the agency that incurred the costs the shelby amendment and revision to circular a110 provided specifically for cost recovery in addition to the normal reimbursement fees imposed upon the requestor for foia request the february

omb memo to john callahan assistant secretary for management and budget from director nih august 1999 op citwhether fees collected would go to the us treasury as with reimbursements covered directly by foia the second and final revisions said that agencies may charge the requester reasonable fee equaling the full incremental cost of obtaining the research data this fee should reflect costs incurred by the agency the recipient and applicable subrecipients this fee is an addition to any fees the agency may assess under the foia 5 usc 552a45 the amendment itself is silent on whether the agency can retain the fee or whether it should go to the treasury however the supplementary information attached to the second revision and the final revision explained that agencies may seek reimbursement from data requesters to reimburse the recipient and the agency for the costs of providing the data103 several objections were raised to the reimbursement provisions omb watch said the proposed revision does not explain how reimbursement would occur if the agency fulfilling the foia request were not the grantmaking agency or how to deal with reimbursement for the costs of providing data after grant period was finished104 and all funds had been expended nonreimbursable costs even though researchers may be reimbursed for maintaining and preparing data to satisfy foia requests scientists have complained that foia access would substantially encumber researchers and universities with new responsibilities according to the president of the national academy of sciences federal research grantees are generally not wellequipped by inclination training or experience to deal with the legal and definitional subtleties of data and the bureaucratic responsibilities that go with being custodian s of agency records nor with the very substantial financial and administrative burdens of doing so105 in addition some say that researchers who are likely to receive request for information from an agency pursuant to foia would be forced to store and maintain their data in form that could be understood at the july 15 hearing on hr 88 nih director varmus also testified that costs of centralizing and maintaining data could be staggering in letter to omb commenting on the second proposed revision he said the costs associated with providing data under this amendment are likely to be substantially greater than costs incurred to fulfill current foia requests because of the expense of importing and exporting data sets especially if software were custom made for the research and the costs of training agency foia officials to assess materials for exemptions including training in the substantive area covered by the research data as well as epidemiology and biostatistics106 some say that the provision will result in expansion of the federal bureaucracy because agencies are likely to have to create new office to decide how to collect

agency some have commented that much administrative work and researcher time will be needed to prepare data and any accompanying explanations for disclosure the federation of behavioral psychological and cognitive sciences suggested that to alleviate the costs associated with this possibility federal agencies could notify investigators whose work has been officially and publicly cited that their data meet the threshold for being subject to foia request107 then the institution could recover costs for the period during which data could be subject to foia similar suggestion of notifying researchers who need to retain data was made by nas president alberts in his letter to omb on april 5 some observers have said that the expenses to universities are likely to exceed the 26 cap on administra tive costs as part of the indirect cost rate universities may charge as defined in omb circular a21 cost principles for educational institutions108 therefore universities would have to absorb the costs unless circular a21 were revised in its second revision omb stated that it would consider such revision and invited comments on costs supplementary information in the final revision said comments received on this issue focused on the need for separate agreement between the awarding agency and the recipient to ensure reimbursement for the full incremental cost of responding it explained process that agencies might use and said that omb would consider revising circular a21 if the process did not work costs of litigation another issue of concern focuses on the potentially large costs of litigation about implementation of the new rules as researchers the government the public and interest groups seek to clarify the meanings of ambiguous terms and to determine whether agencies and funding recipients are complying appropriately especially in those cases where requests are denied some complain that large amounts of money may be spent on lawsuits to deal with interpretations of specific cases how might the changes affect needed research it is possible that the changes will have little impact on research agencies may determine that only few actions having

phil gramm and lott said that although ombs exclusion of business and personal information from its definition of research data that is maintained in the final revision may seem an innocent restatement of the foia exemptions it creates troubling outcome by allowing researchers and agency officials broad discretion to interpret these new exceptions outside of foia and the case law that

government management information and technology july 15 1999 p 3 111ibidhighly subjective the results could be disastrous for the publics ability to access important information for instance the main reason provided by research institutions for not releasing the raw data supporting the particulate matter epidemiology studies is the need to protect the privacy of the research subjects despite the fact that personal identifiers could be redacted the omb proposed revision should rely on the foia exemptions and the case law which have evolved over time in applying these exemptions rather than allowing adhoc and inconsistent decisionmaking109 if there were only few public requests for such data neither researchers nor their institutions might experience any major changes resulting from the amendment however the amendment might stimulate more independent reanalysis of data or methods used to evaluate data from covered research it may also inspire more efforts by researchers to explain the bases of their findings to the public or it may generate more public scrutiny of the content and quality of scientific and technical data used in making federal policies but some observers worry that costs concerns about protection of personal and proprietary information and the potential for abuse could inhibit scientists from performing needed research as noted above concerns have been raised that subjecting research data to foia will make human subjects reluctant to participate in studies or if they do to provide sensitive medical and other information to the researchers and will make some scientists reluctant to engage in research likely to be subject to foia requests some researchers say that study participants might refuse to participate if they know that the federal government would see personal data about them there is also the view that despite privacy protections and the constraints on obtaining human subjects data that are in the final revision to circular a110 research would be compromised since researchers would be obligated to inform study participants that the information they provide might not remain confidential and could be sent to the government110 according to nih director varmus such intrusions could stop promising scientific research in its tracks and the mere threat of such intrusions could impede the nations efforts to recruit its most talented students into publiclysupported research for example imagine what would happen if hivinfected patients thought their condition might be revealed by someone using the new requirements to examine raw experimental data patients would not participate in clinical trials if they believed there was an opportunity for their infected status to be revealed progress toward treatment of the disease would be stymied 111httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30376crs35 112shelton hearing on hr 88 15 july 1999 113effort to block access to research findings under foia fails administration to release

june 16 1999some observers fear that the effort required to respond to foia requests and uncertainties about how the data would be used might inhibit the conduct of research likely to be subject to the provision some even fear harassment that groups opposed to particular types of research will impose excessive data reporting requirements on them if foia is extended to research data special interest groups could make data requests solely for the purpose of creating the costs and disruptions that are inherent in gathering extensive amounts of raw research data under foia the requestor would be the agency not the group leading the campaign the university would be obligated to undertake extensive work and involve the time of the targeted researchers which would be the intention of the action as well as utilize limited resources and staff time in fulfilling these mandated requests112 third area of concern is that the various costs associated with implementation could inhibit research time spent by researchers on complying with foia requests could not be spent on research and researchers might decide not to pursue particular line of research if they fear that it is likely to lead to burdensome foia requests or to involvement in litigatio n associated with such requests if research institutions find the financial burdens associated with compliance too great they might discourage scientists from pursuing research likely to generate foia requests also if agencies fear that compliance with foia requests will be too burdensome they might cite less research in developing regulations or support less research that would be likely to generate requests additional issues for congress attempts have been made in the 106th congress to modify or repeal the amendment in addition it is possible that congress and omb may exercise oversight of implementation of the law by the federal agencies these activities are discussed next representatives james t walsh and david
