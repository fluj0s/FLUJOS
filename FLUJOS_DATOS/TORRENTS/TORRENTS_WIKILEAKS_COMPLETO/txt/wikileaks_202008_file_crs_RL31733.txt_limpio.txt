congress updated may 27 2005 john f frittelli specialist in transportation resources science and industry division congressional research service the library of congress port and maritime security background and issues for congress summary the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 heightened awareness about the vulnerability to terrorist attack of all modes of transportation port security has emerged as significant part of the overall debate on us homeland security the overarching issues for congress are providing oversight on current port security programs and making or responding to proposals to improve port security the us maritime system consists of more than 300 sea and river ports with more than 3700 cargo and passenger terminals however large fraction of maritime cargo is concentrated at few major ports most ships calling at us ports are foreign owned with foreign crews container ships have been the focus of much of the attention on seaport security because they are seen as vulnerable to terrorist infiltration more than 9 million marine containers enter us ports each year while the bureau of customs and border protection cbp analyzes cargo and other information to target specific shipments for closer inspection it physically inspects only small fraction of the containers the coast guard and cbp are the federal agencies with the strongest presence in seaports in response to september 11 2001 the coast guard created the largest portsecurity operation since world war ii the coast guard has advanced its 24 hour notice of arrival noa for ships to 96hour noa the noa allows coast guard officials to select high risk ships for boarding upon their arrival at the entrance to harbor cbp has also advanced the timing of cargo information it receives from ocean carriers through the container security initiative csi program cbp inspectors prescreen usbound marine containers at foreign ports of loading the customs trade partnership against terrorism ctpat offers importers expedited processing of their cargo if they comply with cbp measures for securing their entire supply chain to raise port security standards congress passed the maritime transportation security act of 2002 pl 107295 in november 2002 the focus of debate in congress has been about whether current efforts to improve port security are adequate in addressing the threat while many agree that coast guard and cbp programs to address the threat are sound they contend that these programs represent only framework for building maritime security regime and that significant gaps in security still remain the gao has investigated how the csi and ctpat programs are being implemented and found several shortcomings that need correction the gao found that ctpat participants were benefitting from reduced scrutiny of their imported cargo after they had been certified into the program but before cbp had validated that the participants were indeed carrying out the promised security measures the gao also found that not all containers that cbp had targeted for inspection at the overseas loading port were being inspected by the host customs administration this report will

topic of port security which has emerged as significant part of the overall debate on us homeland security2 the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 heightened awareness about the vulnerability to terrorist attack of us ports and the ships in them the issue for congress is providing oversight on port security and proposals for improving it port security legislation can have significant implications for public safety the war on terrorism the us and global economy and federal state and local homeland security responsibilities and expenditures background concerns for port security government leaders and security experts are worried that the maritime transportation system could be used by terrorists to smuggle personnel weapons of mass destruction or other dangerous materials into the united states they are also concerned that ships in us ports particularly large commercial cargo ships or cruise ships could be attacked by terrorists experts are concerned that largescale terrorist attack at us port could not only cause local death and damage but also paralyze global maritime commerce the 911 commission reported that while commercial aviation remains possible target terrorists may turn their attention to other modes opportunities to do harm are as great or greater in maritime and surface transportation initiatives to secure shipping containers have just begun3 1

terrorist attacks upon the united states new york ww norton 2004 p 391 crs2 in response to concerns for port security on november 14 2002 congress passed s 1214 as amended the maritime transportation security act of 2002 mtsa and the president signed it into law as pl 107295 on november 25 2002 the coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2004 was signed into law as pl 108293 on august 9 2004 title viii of the act adds specificity to some of the provisions in mtsa on december 17 2004 the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 was signed into law this act implements the transportation securityrelated recommendations of the 911 commission with respect to maritime transportation there is continuing debate about whether current efforts to improve port security are adequate in addressing the threat while many agree that coast guard and cbp initiatives to address the threat are strengthening the security of the maritime transportation system they contend that these initiatives represent only framework for building maritime security regime and that significant gaps in security still remain features of the us maritime system us ports the us maritime system includes more than 300 sea and river ports with more than 3700 cargo and passenger terminals and more than 1000 harbor channels spread along thousands of miles of coastline4 transportation firms tend to concentrate traffic through major cargo hubs because of the high cost of their infrastructure5 the top 50 ports in the united states account for about 90 of all cargo tonnage and 25 us ports account for 98 of all container shipments6 energy products are concentrated at particular ports for instance almost onequarter of californias imported crude oil is offloaded in one geographically confined area7 commercial ships using us ports in 2003 approximately 6000 commercial ships made approximately 60000 us port calls8 most ships calling at us ports are foreign owned and foreign crewed less than 3 of us overseas trade is carried on usflag vessels9 4 for further information on the us maritime system see us dot maritime admin an assessment of the us marine

rose new york public affairs 2001 p186 8 us maritime administration vessel calls at us ports 2003 july 2004 9 the maritime component sea power august 2001 crs3 cargo containers container ships are growing segment of maritime commerce and the focus of much of the attention on seaport security container ships carry stacks of marine containers loaded with wide variety of goods large container ship can carry more than 3000 containers of which several hundred might be offloaded at given port marine container is similar to truck trailer without wheels standard sizes are 8 x 8 x 20 feet or 8 x 8 x 40 feet once offloaded from ships they are transferred to rail cars or tractortrailers or barges for inland transportation overtheroad weight regulations generally limit the cargo load of 40 foot container to approximately 45000 pounds the estimated world inventory of containers is about 12 million container ships tend to carry highervalue cargo than other types of cargo ships while they represent only 11 of annual tonnage they account for 66 of the total value of us maritime overseas trade containerized imports are dominated by consumer goods such as clothing shoes electronics and toys us automakers also import large quantities of parts in containers containerized exports are dominated by wastepaper forest products chemicals and agricultural products10 more than 9 million cargo containers enter us sea ports each year for comparison over 13 million trucks and rail cars cross the canadian and mexican borders cbp analyzes cargo manifest information for each container to decide which to target for closer inspection based on such factors as origin destination shipper and container contents only small portion have their contents physically inspected by cbp physical inspection could include scanning the entire container with sophisticated xray or gamma ray machine unloading the contents of container or both11 importance of the us maritime system economic importance ships are the primary mode of transportation for world trade ships carry approximately 80 of world trade by volume12 the united states is the worlds leading maritime trading nation accounting for nearly 20 measured in tons of the annual world oceanborne overseas trade ships carry more than 95 of the nations nonnorth american trade by weight and 75 by value trade now accounts for 25 of us gross domestic product gdp up from 11 in 1970 over the next two decades the total volume of domestic and international trade is expected to double 10 for list of the top importers and exporters of containerized marine cargo see inside the box journal of commerce aug 1218 2002 p 20a 11 for further information on cbps container inspection process see cbp fact sheet the 5 percent myth vs us customs and border protection reality october 7 2004 12 united nations conference on trade and development unctad review of maritime transport 2002 crs4 given the importance of maritime trade to the us and world economies disruptions to that trade can have immediate and significant economic impacts13 by one estimate the cost to the us economy of port closures on the west coast due to labor management dispute was approximately 1 billion per day for the first five days rising sharply thereafter14 the container shipping system is designed for speed and efficiency transportation services are critical component of the global lowinventory ie justintime distribution model that many manufacturers have adopted most industries in the united states use some imported components from overseas suppliers by bringing parts to plant just before they are needed for assembly manufacturers can save money on warehouse space and inventory carrying costs transport efficiencies permit warehouse requirements to be minimized lean inventories in turn have contributed to business productivity from 1980 to 2000 according to one study business logistics costs dropped from 161 of us gdp to 10115 given the dependence of the united states and the global economy on highly efficient maritime transportation system many experts acknowledge that slowing the flow of trade to inspect all inbound containers or at least statistically significant random selection would be economically intolerable16 supply chain analysts are concerned that increased securityrelated delay at seaports could threaten the efficiency gains achieved in inventory management over the past two decades by forcing companies to hold larger inventories enhanced security has benefits as well as costs many experts see economic benefits to tighter control over maritime commerce resources put towards seaport security can also reduce cargo theft narcotic and migrant smuggling trade law violations the accidental introduction of invasive species and the cost of cargo insurance improved planning for responding to terrorist attack at seaport could also improve responses to other emergencies such as natural disasters or transportation accidents new technologies intended to convert the sea container into smart box such as electronic seals sensors or tracking devices could also improve shipment integrity help carriers improve their equipment utilization and help cargo owners track their shipments in response to the terrorist threat the cbp has accelerated development of its new information management system the automated commercial environment ace this system will assist cbp in 13 for further information see oecd security in maritime transport risk factors and economic impact maritime transport committee july 2003 14 report of

importance in addition to its economic significance the marine transportation system is vital for national security the departments of defense and transportation have designated 17 us seaports as strategic because they are necessary for use by dod in the event of major military deployment thirteen of these ports are commercial seaports during desert storm 90 of all military equipment and supplies were shipped from us strategic ports the deployment required over 312 vessels from 18 commercial and military ports in the united states as the gao has reported if the strategic ports or the ships carrying military supplies were attacked not only could massive civilian casualties be sustained but dod could also lose precious cargo and time and be forced to rely heavily on its overburdened airlift capabilities18 port security threat scenarios security experts are concerned about variety of terrorist threat scenarios at us ports among other things they are concerned that terrorists could use commercial cargo containers to smuggle terrorists nuclear chemical or biological weapons components thereof or other dangerous materials into the united states seize control of large commercial cargo ship and use it as collision weapon for destroying bridge or refinery located on the waterfront sink large commercial cargo ship in major shipping channel thereby blocking all traffic to and from the port attack large ship carrying volatile fuel such as liquefied natural gas and detonate the fuel so as to cause massive inport explosion attack an oil tanker in port or at an offshore discharge facility19 so as to disrupt the world oil trade and cause largescale environmental damage 17 for further information on ace see httpwwwcbpgovxpcgovtoolboxabout modernization viewed 12403 18 gao combating terrorism actions needed to improve force protection for dod deployments through domestic seaports gao0315 oct 2002 19 in an offshore lightering zone very large crude carrier vlcc or supertanker transfers part of its cargo to smaller shuttle tanker that delivers the crude oil to the tank farm or refinery onshore there are also offshore oil ports where tanker discharges its cargo through submerged pipeline that carries the cargo along the seabed to the onshore terminal crs6 seize control of ferry which can carry hundreds of passengers or cruise ship which can carry more than 3000 passengers of whom about 90 are usually us citizens and threaten the deaths of the passengers if demand is not met attack us navy ships in an attempt to kill us military personnel damage or destroy valuable us military asset and in the case of nuclearpowered ships cause radiological release use land around port to stage attacks on bridges refineries located on the waterfront or other port facilities some of these scenarios or similar ones have already come to pass elsewhere for example in october 2002 the french oil tanker limberg appears to have been attacked by bombladen boat off the coast of yemen killing one crewman aboard the tanker damaging the ship and causing an oil spill20 in october 2001 italian authorities arrested on terrorism charges an egyptianborn canadian citizen found with hightech equipment including satellite phone and computer and other personal possessions in cargo container in an italian port21 in october 2000 the us navy destroyer cole was attacked by bombladen boat during refueling stop in the harbor of aden yemen killing 17 sailors injuring 39 others and causing damage to the ship that cost about 250 million to repair22 in 1985 terrorists seized the cruise ship achille lauro in the mediterranean and held its passengers hostage killing one of them much concern has focused on the threat that sea container could be used to smuggle nuclear weapon into the united states experts are concerned that if nuclear weapon in container aboard ship in port is detonated it could not only kill tens of thousands of people and cause massive destruction but could also paralyze the movement of cargo containers globally thereby shutting down world trade23 port and ship vulnerabilities to terrorist attack port facilities port areas and ships in ports have many vulnerabilities to potential terrorist attack port areas have very large landside perimeters to secure 20 ships as terrorist targets american shipper nov 2002 p59 21 his

strategic and international studies washington dc january 17 2002 httpwwwcbpgovxpcgovnewsroom commissionerspeeches_statementsarchivesjan172002xml crs7 giving terrorists many potential landside points of entry some ports are located immediately adjacent to builtup urban areas giving terrorists places to hide while approaching or escaping from port areas large numbers of trucks move in and out of ports making it possible for terrorists to use truck to bring themselves and their weapons into port many ports harbor fishing and recreational boats that terrorists could use to mask their approach to target ship ships commercial cargo ships at pier or at anchorage in harbor are stationary and those moving through port do so at slow speeds making them easy to intercept by fastmoving boat commercial cargo ships are generally unarmed and have very small crews making them vulnerable to seizure by small group of armed people as proven by modernday pirates in the 1990s the number of reported attacks on cargo ships by pirates tripled24 most pirate attacks occur while the ship is in port although most attacks occur in southeast asian waters on foreignflag freighters us shippers are likely to be among the owners of cargo onboard it can also be noted that some experts believe there is link between piracy and terrorism that the goal of some acts of piracy may be to raise money to finance terrorist operations the financial times has reported an incident where chemical tanker in the south pacific was boarded by pirates who practiced steering the vessel at varying speeds for several hours25 the lack of transparency in ship registration has been longstanding concern an organization for economic cooperation and development oecd study on the ownership and control of ships reports that not only does perfect transparency not exist but in fact anonymity seems to be the rule rather than the exception and not only is it permitted but in many cases positively encouraged this enables terrorists and would be terrorists to remain intimately involved in the operation of their vessels while maintaining totally hidden through the use of relatively simple mechanisms that are readily available and legally tolerated in almost all jurisdictions26 unscrupulous ship owners are known to mask their identity by reregistering their vessels under fictitious corporate names and renaming and repainting their ships shipowners can register their vessels in flag of convenience countries which may have lax regulations and require little information from the applicants according to press reports us intelligence officials believe they have identified 15 cargo ships that have links to qaeda27 24 us dot surface transportation security vulnerabilities and developing solutions nd

containerized shipments makes it more difficult to ensure the integrity of this type of cargo28 unlike other cargo ships whose loading process occurs at the port and whose cargo is often owned by single company container ships carry cargo from hundreds of companies and the containers are loaded away from the port at individual company warehouses typical single container shipment may involve multitude of parties and generate 30 to 40 documents single container could also carry cargo for several customers thus multiplying the number of parties and documents involved the parties involved in shipment usually include the exporter the importer freight forwarder customs broker customs inspector inland transportation providers which may include more than one trucker or railroad the port operators possibly feeder ship and the ocean carrier each transfer of the container from one party to the next is point of vulnerability in the supply chain the security of each transfer facility and the trustworthiness of each company is therefore critical in the overall security of the shipment it is also important to keep in mind that not all us bound containers arrive at us ports half of the containers discharged at the port of montreal for instance move by truck or rail for cities in the northeastern or mid western united states29 also many containers that enter us waters are bound for other nations maritime crimes security experts warn that terrorists attempting to use container to smuggle weapon of mass destruction or components thereof into the united states could purchase known exporter with long and trustworthy shipping record drug smugglers have been known to employ this strategy to disguise their contraband in otherwise legitimate cargo while both the coast guard and cbp are experienced in the marine environment with the war on drugs they recognize that terrorism is different kind of threat among other things drug smugglers are often interested in finding smuggling method that can be used over and over to make multiple shipments this permits the coast guard and cbp to look for certain patterns of operation among drug smugglers terrorists on the other hand are more likely to be interested in using particular method of attack only once to carry out particular terrorist operation this makes the tactic of looking for patterns of operation potentially much less useful another difference concerns the potential consequences of failure to detect and intercept given the tremendous amount of cargo arriving at seaports the mission of interdicting illegal drugs or weapon of mass destruction is often described as searching for the needle in the haystack in the case of the weapon of mass destruction however the potential consequence of not finding the socalled needle is much greater the incidence of other shippingrelated crimes also attests to the challenges faced in improving port security the national cargo security council estimates that 28 see arun chatterjee an overview of security issues involving marine containers and ports proceedings of the 2003 transportation research board annual meeting available on cdrom 29 hoge and rose ed how did this happen p 188 crs9 cargo theft domestically ranges between 10 billion and 15 billion annually30 the fbi believes much of this theft occurs in or near seaports31 identifying where cargo theft occurs in the transportation system may help identify where terrorist infiltration could occur government authorities at seaports port governance and financing in considering how to enhance seaport security it is important to know how they are governed and operated the governing structure of ports varies from place to place while the federal government has jurisdiction over interstate and foreign commerce and designated federal waterway channels state or local governments have ownership over ports there are ports which are part of state government and others which are part of city government the port authority of new york and new jersey and the delaware river port authority are examples of bistate or regional port agencies ports can be subsidiary of public agency but may be structured to act as private sector corporation most ports are landlord ports which means the port provides the basic services and infrastructure but the tenant such as terminal operator performs most of the activity operating ports both generate and carry out most of the activity at the port in addition to city law enforcement personnel some port authorities also have their own police forces depending on how they are structured ports finance infrastructure improvements through variety of means some may levy taxes if they are granted this authority ports may also pay for infrastructure with the general funds they receive from the governments they are part of from operating revenues general obligation bonds revenue bonds trust fund monies or loan guarantees most ports generally break even or are minimally profitable32 federal agencies involved in port security federal agencies involved in port security include the coast guard the bureau of customs and border protection cbp and the transportation security agency tsa all of which are housed in the department of homeland security dhs and the maritime administration marad the coast guard and cbp are the two federal agencies with the strongest presence at seaports coast guard the coast guard is the nations principal maritime law enforcement authority and the lead federal agency for the maritime component of homeland security including port

the federal agency with principal responsibility for inspecting cargoes including cargo containers that commercial ships bring into us ports and for the examination and inspection of ship crews and cruise ship passengers for ships arriving in us ports from any foreign port prior to the establishment of the cbp customs and immigration functions at us borders were conducted separately by the department of the treasurys us customs service and the department of justices immigration and naturalization service transportation security administration tsa is an agency created by the aviation and transportation security act of 2001 pl 10771 initially its focus was the security of air transportation but it is responsible for the security of all modes of transportation cargo and passenger

reports and national planning guide on port security mtsa requires marad to publish revised version of its national planning guide on port security port security initiatives by federal agencies coast guard in response to the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 the coast guard created the largest portsecurity operation since world war ii coast guard cutters and aircraft were diverted from more distant operating areas to patrol us ports and coastal waters the coast guard began to maintain security zones around waterside facilities navy ships and cruise and cargo ships entering or leaving port coast guard port security teams began to inspect certain highinterest vessels and coast guard sea marshals began escorting certain ships transiting the harbor to counter the terrorist threat the coast guard and cbp have sought to improve the quality and advance the timing of information submitted to them by shippers and carriers so that they can better evaluate the terrorist risk of ships cargo or crew 33 continued coast guard in areas where the coast guards capabilities are limited or lacking such as air defense or antisubmarine warfare for more on the navys role in homeland security see crs report rs21230 homeland security navy operations background and issues for congress by ronald orourke crs11 bound for the united states by increasing their knowledge of the various parties in the marine environment it is hoped that federal authorities will be better able to separate the bad from the good without impeding the flow of legitimate commerce in support of this goal the coast guard has instituted new reporting requirements for ships entering and leaving us harbors the former 24hour advance notice of arrival noa has been extended to 96hour noa the noa includes detailed information on the crew passengers cargo and the vessel itself the coast guard has also developed the concept of maritime domain awareness mda mda involves fusing intelligence information with information from public private commercial and international sources to provide more complete picture of potential maritime security threats the coast guard will use this picture to support riskmanagement approach to preventing or mitigating terrorist threats through the use of actionable knowledge34 in support of the mda effort the coast guard is expanding vessel tracking system the automatic identification system to monitor ship traffic in harbors and is underway on multibillion dollar effort the deepwater program to replace and modernize its aging vessels and aircraft35 on october 22 2003 the coast guard issued final rules implementing mtsa36 these regulations became effective on november 21 2003 bureau of customs and border protection among the programs cbp has initiated to counter the terrorist threat are the container security initiative csi and the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat csi is series of bilateral reciprocal agreements that among other things allow cbp personnel at selected foreign ports to prescreen usbound containers in order to give inspectors the data and time they need to prescreen containers cbp issued new rule requiring that information about an ocean shipment be transmitted to cbp 24 hours before the cargo is loaded at foreign port onto usbound vessel previously ocean carriers did not submit this information until the ship arrived at us port cbp is also requiring more comprehensive and specific cargo information so it can more efficiently evaluate individual container shipments for risks of terrorism more detailed descriptions are intended to help speed up nonintrusive inspections of high risk containers by reducing the number of containers inspectors need to unload for closer examination the rationale of csi is that nuclear weapon 34 for further information on the coast guard as it relates to homeland security see crs report rs21125 homeland security coast guard operations background and issues for

processing of cargo if they comply with cbp guidelines for securing their entire supply chain businesses that sign up for the program are required among other things to conduct comprehensive selfassessment of their supply chain and submit completed questionnaire to cbp that describes their current security practices if cbp certifies an applicant they may benefit from reduced number of cargo inspections thus reducing the risk of shipment delay transportation security administration the transportation security administration in conjunction with cbp is conducting the operation safe commerce osc pilot project39 the goal of osc is to verify the contents of containers at their point of loading ensure the physical integrity of containers in transit and track their movement through each mode of transport from origin to final destination container tracking is key area of debate on cargo security various smart container devices are being developed that would provide realtime location information and container tampering notification the challenge is developing device that can withstand the harsh ocean environment be relatively inexpensive and reliable enough not to trigger false alarms tsa is also fieldtesting transportation worker identification credential twic for workers in all modes of transportation that will be used to control access to secure areas of cargo and passenger facilities the agency has developed maritime selfassessment risk module to assist port terminal and vessel owners in developing their security plans as required by mtsa maritime administration marad along with the coast guard cbp and tsa is part of the container working group which has made classified recommendations on how best to ensure the security of marine container transportation marad has also developed curriculum for training maritime security personnel international institutions in june 2002 the group of eight nations identified the imo and the world customs organization wco as two institutions that should develop global initiatives to improve maritime security at its december 2002 conference the imo adopted new chapter to the safety of life at sea solas

facilitation of the international supply chain which they completed in june 2003 in may 2005 the wco issued its framework of standards to secure and facilitate global trade the framework sets out principles for advance electronic reporting of cargo and shipper data and requires importers to verify security measures taken by its suppliers recent law on port security the bill creating the new department of homeland security dhs was passed by the senate on november 19 2002 and by the house on november 22 2002 and signed into law as pl 107296 on november 25 2002 the dhs incorporates the coast guard the former customs service and tsa among others43 the maritime transportation security act of 2002 was passed by congress on november 14 2002 and signed into law as pl 107295 on november 25 2002 the act creates us maritime security system and requires federal agencies ports and vessel owners to take numerous steps to upgrade security the act requires the coast guard to develop national and regional area maritime transportation security plans it requires ports waterfront terminals and certain types of vessels to develop security and incident response plans with approval from the coast guard the act authorizes cbp to require that cargo manifest information for inbound or outbound shipments be provided to the agency electronically prior to the arrival or departure of the cargo this information may be shared with other appropriate federal agencies the legislation calls on the department of transportation to determine the level of funding needed for grant program that

into law on august 6 2002 section 343 provides authority to cbp to issue regulations requiring the electronic transmission of cargo information to cbp prior to the shipments exportation or importation into the united states the coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2004 was signed into law as pl 108293 on august 9 2004 title viii of the act contains number of provisions related to maritime security many of which add specificity to provisions in mtsa among other things the act requires the dhs to submit plan to congress implementing maritime intelligence system section 803 it requires the dhs to submit plan for maritime security grant program including recommendations on how funds should be allocated section 804 it requires the coast guard to report on the implementation and use of joint operational centers at certain us ports section 807 it requires the dot to investigate and examine sensors that are able to track marine containers throughout their supply chain and detect hazardous and radioactive materials within the containers section 808 it requires the dhs to report on the costs of vessel and container inspections and plan for implementing secure systems of transportation including the need for and feasibility to inspect and monitor intermodal shipping containers within the united states section 809 the week of december 6 2004 congress passed the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 pl 108458 the act imposes an urgency on dhss efforts in strengthening maritime security by imposing deadlines on the agency in planning and carrying out certain maritime security activities that were called for in mtsa this includes deadline of april 1 2005 for completion of national maritime security plan deadline of december 31 2004 for completion of facility and vessel vulnerability assessments and deadlines for deployment plan for twic status report on standards for seafarer identification and status report on establishing performance standards for container seals and locks the act also requires dhs to create terrorism watch list for passengers and crew aboard cruise ships issues for congress the challenge of port security raises several potential issues for congress some members of congress who have introduced their own versions of maritime security legislation are concerned that mtsa does not go far enough in its requirements in addition to considering further port security legislation congress is debating whether the federal government is providing enough funds to port authorities and border agencies for improving port security congress is also considering how to pay for port security addressing the threat major concern for congress is assessing whether the nation is addressing the threat to maritime security with enough urgency despite the progress that has been made in strengthening port security thus far many security officials still describe crs15 seaports as wide open and very vulnerable to terrorist attack44 seaports along with air cargo general aviation and mass transit were identified in recent gao report as the major vulnerabilities remaining in the nations transportation system45 the gao found that an effective port security environment may be many years away while many agree that csi ctpat osc and mda are sound strategies for addressing the threat they contend that these programs represent only framework for building maritime security regime and that significant gaps in security still remain in the words of one security expert46 right now none of these initiatives has changed the intermodal transportation environment sufficiently to fundamentally reduce the vulnerability of the cargo container as means of terrorism however all are important steppingoff points for building an effective risk management approach to container security foundation that simply did not exist prior to september 11 2001 in its oversight role congress is examining the effectiveness of these programs in addressing the terrorist threat whether they are proceeding at sufficient pace and whether enough resources are being provided to implement these and other security initiatives some observers and members of congress are concerned that initiatives to fill gaps in port security are not proceeding at sufficient pace tsas program to credential all transportation workers and its effort to develop smartbox to ensure the integrity of container shipments has also been criticized for moving forward too slowly some argue that the security funding provided to seaports especially when compared to the amount provided to airports is woefully inadequate others argue that current efforts to improve port security are proceeding at an unprecedented pace they note that the imo with leadership from the us coast guard agreed to new international port security measures within year they also note that the coast guard issued final rules implementing mtsa within year after becoming law during operation liberty shield march 17 2003 through april 16 2003 the coast guard and cbp demonstrated their ability to rapidly intensify port security operations by increasing ship and cargo inspections increasing air and surface patrols escorting more ships through harbors and other activities47 funding port security according to many the unresolved debate over how to pay for port security is stalling efforts to improve port security the debate is over whether port security should be paid for with federal revenues by state and local governments by the 44 safe harbors wall street journal april 21 2003 pb1 45 gao transportation security post september 11th initiatives and longterm challenges april 1 2003 gao03616t 46 stephen flynn on the record government executive magazine october 1 2003 47 for further information on operation liberty shield see crs report rs21475 operation liberty shield border transportation and domestic security crs16 maritime industry or by cost sharing arrangement among all of the above the coast guard roughly estimates the cost of implementing the new imo security code and the security provisions in mtsa to be approximately 15 billion for the first year and 73 billion over the succeeding decade48 congress has provided over 650 million through fy2005 in direct federal grants to ports to improve their physical and operational security this is in addition to the budgets of the coast guard bureau of customs and border protection tsa and other federal agencies involved in port security49 advocates for more spending argue that the federal funds provided to port authorities thus far are woefully inadequate particularly when compared to airports skeptics of additional spending argue that taxpayers should not provide funds to large and profitable corporations to secure infrastructure that is in their own financial interest to do so sources of funds dispute over how to finance security requirements arose during the conference committee on mtsa senator hollings proposed creating system of user fees on ship cargo as means of generating funds for port security upgrades required in the legislation other conferees opposed this proposal calling the user fees tax some policymakers contend that without providing funding source the act amounts to an unfunded mandate port authorities ocean carriers and shippers argue that port security is national concern and therefore the federal government should finance it through general revenues others argue that the maritime industry should finance port security through user fees because it is direct beneficiary of improved security as it reduces cargo theft and other economic damages50 proponents of user fees contend that user surcharges are an effective means of ensuring improved security because they would provide more secure and predictable source of funding than annual appropriations they propose that port security trust fund be created in manner that prevents the user fees from being spent on anything other than port security if such port security trust fund were created they argue port security would not have to compete with other funding priorities in the annual appropriations process some economists contend that user fee system is also more efficient than direct subsidies because the users of the service being provided in this case port security are likely to demand that policymakers spend the funds in the most productive manner allocating resources an issue of likely interest to congress is how to allocate resources appropriately to the various ports maximum security is prohibitively expensive therefore it is important to properly identify specific security areas that have the greatest vulnerability and apportion funds accordingly criteria could include ports relative economic importance and its proximity to an 48 see 68 federal register 60464 oct 22 2002 49 see crs report rl32863 homeland security department fy2006 appropriations 50 representative dana rohrabacher introduced an amendment to hr 2557 that would allow ports to impose percontainer fee to pay for port security unlike senator hollingss user fee proposal the fund would be administered locally by individual ports crs17 urban or sensitive area the 911 commission criticized the tsa for lacking strategic plan for systematically analyzing transportation assets risks costs and benefits in order to allocate limited resources in the most costeffective way51 the inspector general of the dhs was critical of port security grant award decisions made thus far and made recommendations for improving them52 resources for foreign ports in addition to funding security at us ports there is also the issue of finding resources for improving security at foreign ports especially in developing countries that may not be able to afford the technology to improve their ports security the imos recent adoption of new security measures includes statement inviting the secretary general of the imo to give early consideration to establishing maritime security trust fund for the purpose of providing financial support in developing countries for strengthening their maritime security infrastructure53 balancing security and commerce security experts argue that perfect maritime security can only be achieved by shutting down the transportation system as one observer stated harbor without ships is safe but that is not what harbors are built for54 the issue for congress is how to increase port security to desired levels while minimizing the economic impacts associated with impeding the maritime trade system when security experts speak of significant gaps still remaining in maritime security they are often referring to the credibility problems associated with the container loading and screening process overseas and the true identity of ships and their crew on the high seas point of origin cargo security major area of concern is ensuring the integrity of cargo as it begins its transit to the united states from its overseas origin point of origin security is necessary because inspecting cargo on the high seas is practically impossible and inspecting cargo upon its arrival at us port could be too late to prevent terrorist event ensuring that the container was not stuffed with illegitimate cargo at the overseas factory that the loaded container was not tampered with while trucked to the port of loading and ensuring that the cargo information reported to cbp is not fraudulent are all critical challenges in supply chain security congress is examining the effectiveness of ctpat csi and osc in ensuring the integrity of us bound cargo at its overseas point of origin issues include what type of procedures are necessary to verify the legitimacy of cargo loaded into container what type of smart box devices should be required to ensure the physical integrity of the container while route and what specific information should cargo manifests contain to enable cbp to target shipments for closer inspection 51 the 911 commission report final report of the national commission on terrorist attacks upon the

port shutdown for terrorist incidents could cost billions drill shows cq homeland security dec 5 2002 crs18 the gao investigated how the csi and ctpat programs were being implemented and found several shortcomings that need correction55 the gao found that ctpat participants were benefitting from reduced scrutiny of their imported cargo after they had been certified into the program but before cbp had validated that the participants were indeed carrying out the promised security measures the gao also found that not all containers that cbp had targeted for inspection at the overseas loading port were being inspected by the host customs administration the gao found other flaws in these two programs and cbp has taken corrective action to address some of these flaws56 vessels under foreign ownership and control there is single sovereign power that regulates international shipping mtsa requires the coast guard to report on foreignflag vessels calling at us ports specifically those vessels with murky ownership histories and to report on actions taken to improve the transparency of vessel registration procedures section 112 in december 2002 as mentioned above the imo adopted more stringent international standards for the security of vessels and ports congress is likely to examine the effectiveness of coast guard and international efforts at raising the security level of ship operators skeptics contend that the new imo regulations mostly offer the illusion of increased security they contend that flag of convenience countries lack the resolve to enforce these standards and that the compliance documentation is too easy to manipulate in order to appear as legitimate operators57 while the united states enforces its standards when the coast guard selects arriving ships for boarding their burden is greater if there is effective international shipping regime that prescreens substandard shipping international considerations in the wake of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 consensus emerged among experts involved in the issue that an effective solution for securing maritime trade requires creating an international maritime security regime this regime would rely not on single solution such as increasing the number of container inspections but rather on layered approach with multiple lines of defense from the beginning to the final destination of shipment the first security perimeter in this defense in depth strategy would be at the overseas point of origin58 security experts argue that an effective solution must start with preventing undesired items from entering the maritime transportation network because if some of these items particularly nuclear weapons or dirty bombs reach us seaport they could be detonated before inspectors could find them 55 gao homeland security key cargo security programs can be improved gao05 466t may 26 2005 56 see senate committee on homeland security and government affairs subcommittee on investigations hearing on

control foreign affairs novdec 2000 crs19 related issue is whether raising international port security standards should become part of international trade agreements thus far the united states strategy has been to raise standards by working within the maritime transportation industry such as through the imo however some assert that given the strong link between maritime security and international trade the united states could also pursue international port security standards as part of international trade agreements standard vs sitespecific measures an additional issue for congress is determining what elements of port security might be best addressed through acrosstheboard requirements that establish common standards and practices to be applied at all seaports versus those elements of port security that might be best addressed through tailored bottomup approach that employs measures that are designed to fit the specific circumstances and meet specific needs of each seaport some observers while acknowledging the need for sitespecific measures argue that certain amount of uniform measures are necessary to help ensure that seaport remains excessively vulnerable to terrorist attack other observers argue that while standardized measures make sense up to point the effort to implement such measures must not come at the expense of efforts to devise and implement site specific security measures that respond to the unique characteristics of each port compared to commercial airports seaports are generally more diverse in terms of their physical infrastructure and operations as result of this diversity in characteristics each ship and port facility presents different risks and vulnerabilities port authorities are also very concerned with finding the right balance between standard and port specific security regulations ports seek level of uniformity in security requirements because they are concerned that their customers will move their business to competing ports where their goods may be cleared more quickly at the same time ports do not want to be held to inflexible federal standards they are concerned that setting security benchmarks may waste time and resources if those benchmarks are not applicable at their port given their particular commodity mix or other unique circumstances security cards in addition to improving the security infrastructure of us ports there is also the issue of ensuring the trustworthiness of the people who work in them issuing credentials for port workers illustrates the challenge of implementing standard security measures one of the difficult questions is what should disqualify someone from holding job in port area mtsa section 70105 requires the secretary of homeland security to develop transportation security card for port workers that would be used to limit access to secure areas in port59 among the items that would disqualify port worker from obtaining card would be felony conviction within the last seven years that the secretary believes could cause the 59 for status report on progress towards development of this card see gao report gao 05106 port security better planning needed to develop and operate maritime worker identification card program december 2004 crs20 individual to be terrorism risk60 the usa patriot act pl 107273 passed in october 2001 requires background checks for truckers carrying hazardous materials the tsa is developing transportation worker identification credential twic program that will use biometric cards issued to all transportation workers to limit access to secure areas in the nationwide transportation network issuing transportation id cards is an example of an acrosstheboard requirement however the difficulty of implementing such measures at specific ports is illustrated below61 tampa offers good example some of the ports major employers consist of ship repair companies that hire hundreds of workers for shortterm projects as the need arises historically according to port authority officials these workers have included persons with criminal records however new state requirements for background checks as part of issuing credentials could deny such persons needed access to restricted areas of the port from security standpoint excluding such persons may be advisable but from an economic standpoint company may have difficulty filling jobs if it cannot include such persons in the labor pool roles and responsibilities major concern for us policymakers is assigning roles and responsibilities for maritime security among federal agencies among federal state and local agencies and between government agencies and private industry clear roles and responsibilities are needed to prevent overlap duplication of effort and conflicting regulations it is critical that the maritime trade community perceives that federal agencies are working in concert otherwise the dhss goal of close partnership with industry in fighting terrorism may be frustrated intelligence sharing the difficulty of detecting terrorist activity once it has entered the maritime system may point to the value of intelligence most acknowledge that there is just too much cargo coming from all corners of the globe to scrutinize each shipment thoroughly uncovering terrorist activity is likely to require actionable or precise intelligence identifying exactly which shipment to intercept the gao reports that in surface transportation timely information sharing has been hampered by the lack of standard protocols to exchange information among federal state and local government agencies and private entities62 one 60 preexisting regulations regarding the issuing of coast guard port security cards are contained at 33 cfr part 125 identification credentials for persons requiring access to waterfront facilities or vessels 61 gao port security nation faces formidable challenges in making new initiatives successful

security new structures have improved information sharing but security clearance processing requires further attention april 2005 gao 05394 crs21 barrier to more effective intelligence sharing with local port authorities may be that state and local government officials do not have the required security clearances private industrys role broad policy question for congress is how much of role the private sector should have in enhancing maritime security many observers believe that businesses will worry more about near term profits than the remote possibility that their property will be attacked63 at the same time most experts acknowledge that there are just too many cargo movements for the government to monitor on its own security experts believe that tightening control over maritime commerce requires that security be embedded into everyday business processes cbps ctpat program is intended to enlist the effort of the many companies involved in international container shipments in its oversight responsibilities congress may evaluate the effectiveness of this program particularly in ensuring the due diligence of maritime traders over the long term congress may consider how best to ensure sustained follow through on the part of ctpat participants trust but verify approach utilizing regular cbp security audits may be one strategy policymakers consider
