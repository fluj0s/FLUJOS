plans objective business plan specifies all actions necessary to comply with all or part of particular commission r ecommendation including timin g estimated cost military construction and envi ronmental remediati on among others the 2005 brac round was the fifth ce 1988 however because this round is occurring concurrently with dod tra nsformation efforts as well as the redeployment of forces from overseas installations it is the most complex of all rounds to execute secretary wynne vised the business plan approach as management tool serving two main functions to ensure that

imple mentation and to assist dod in allocating resources and prioritizing tasks to meet the statutory deadline3 business plan is not intended to pr ovide an all inclusive description of activity but only the level of detail needed by administrators to ensure coordination and to allocate brac funds effectively th plan describes necessary steps that must be taken to carry out the commissions recommendations and the estimated time frames and costs associated with those step s detailed planning is not included but can be found in associated documentation refe renced in the plans also some details concerning to the planning particularly with regard to personnel are deliberately excluded in order to avoid providing poten tially useful information to adversaries what information is incl uded in business plan secretary wynne issued his guidelines for business plan preparation in two memoranda the first da ted september 21 2005 provided basic outline of major headings and general guidance regarding the information to be included the second dated october 12 2005 described the necessary data in greater detail4 each plan should contain the relevant recommendation fro m the

affected by the plan along withassurances that those agencies have participated in the plans development and concur with its content why is it called business plan secretary wynne selected the term business plan based on the premise that the plans present the business case for the implementation of eachhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33766crs3 5 see department of defenses website at httpwwwdefenselinkmil releasesreleaseaspxreleaseid2949recommendation they outline financial estima tes of costs and savings as well as describe movement plan s throughout the brac imp lementation process furthermore use of the term business is consistent with terminology currently employed within dod soon after taking over as secretary of defense donald rumsfeld announced his intention to st eer the department towards more cost effective operations by adopting comme rcial business models june 18 2001 dod press release announced the crea tion of the senior executive co mmittee to function as business board of direct ors for the department and the business initiative council created to recommend good business practices and implement cost savings that could offset the f unding requirements fo r personnel programs infrastructure recapitalization equipmen t modernization nd transformation initiatives5 secretary wynne adopted the practi ces of private enterprise to create these business plans who developed the plans secretary wynne assigned each brac commission recommendation in whole or in part to military department or defense agency generally the entity that has the largest number of resources tied to th action is responsible for preparing and executing the corresponding business plan when more than one service or defens agency is involved in realignment dod gave consideration to the location r eceiving resources as result of the recommendation dod reasoned that the recei ving agency could best decide how to align additional personnel and facilities with their existing infrastructure as an example in commission recommendation 131 which calls for the colocation of military criminal investigative agencies w ith the counter intelligence field agency and the defense security service at the united states marine corps base quantico virginia responsibi lity for developing the business plan was assigned to the department of the navy who will have access to the plans because they were intended to be inte rnal resource allocation documents these business plans were not intended to circul ate outside dod nevertheless once the dod fy2008 budget proposal is submitted to congress much of the information contained in the plans if not the pl ans themselves will likely become publicly accessible this is because the plans will form the basis for dods allocation of brac funding and estimated budgets thus supporting data from the plans will likely be included in the military department and defense agency budget justification documents or jbooks jbooks are usually provided annua lly to congress to explain how the military departments and defense agencies plan to use requested funds httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33766crs4 6 brac commission report executive summary pg iii of the 190 closures and realignments recommended by the dod the commission approved 119 with changes and accepted 45 with amendments see crs report rs22291 military base closures highlights of the 2005 brac commission report and its additional proposed legislation by daniel h else and david lockwood 7 for an explanation of joint base see what is the current status of the plans p 6why are business plans require d for brac 2005 and not for previous brac rounds brac 2005 differed from previous brac rounds in number of ways unique to 2005 was the number and complexity of the recommendations in their final report the commission noted the 2005 brac recommendations exceeded the number considered by all prior brac co mmissions combined in addition to the unprecedented number many dod recomme ndations were extremely complex proposing intertwining movements betw een and among numerous installations6 the planning and execution of th 1991 1993 and 1995 brac rounds centered on the departments of the army navy and air force each of which crafted its own list of recommendations dod consolidate d coordinated and fo rwarded these lists to the president for approval the military departments were then responsible for implementing the approved recommendations within the six years required by law however the very high level of comp lexity of the 2005 pr ocess led dods senior leadership to institute centralized contro l of the planning and resource allocation process while at the same time preserving decentraliz ed implementation policy for the military departments and defense agencies furthermore dod believed the coordi nation required by business plans development process would provide an dded benefit coor dination was intended to produce an efficient plan but also to create conditions in which potentially problematic issues could be identified and resolved pr ior to implementation this was of particular importance where co mmission recommendations resulted in new methods of operation such as with joint basing7 what time period does th business plan cover business plans are intended to cover current planning through fy2011 when the law mandates implementation must be complete action affecting location after fy2011 such as its postclosure use by the local community is not covered in the plans will the business plans be updated dod will require updates to each of the bu siness plans biannually in the fall to examine the next years budget request and in the spring to assess current budget execution dod considers these

number of required business plans was 240 however the dod brac office determined that three of those were not necessary two of the three were for naval air station oceana virginia beach virginia and naval broadway complex san diego california those two installations met certain conditions set by the brac commission are therefore longer slated for closure the third plan longer required was for recommendation requiring the establishment of an oversight board for the naval post graduate school monterey california and the air force institute of technology wright patterson air force base ohio

recommended that the installations support functions be combined and operated by single service dod is currently developing joint base implementation guidance to provide the military departments and defense agencies direction regarding how the combined bases will be established and operated once this guidance is issued by the deputy secretary of defense the 12 plans will be completed and
