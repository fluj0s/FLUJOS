growing portions of the federal budget projections suggest if the rapid growth in health care costs is not curtailed governments at all levels will face an uncomfortable choice between significant cuts in other spending priorities or major tax increases this report examines the ec onomic justification for government intervention and involvement in health care markets many analysts claim marketoriented policies in certain instances could lower costs and enhance efficiency in health care this report discusses the invisible hand theorem which states that when certain assumptions hold market outcomes will be efficient these assumptions require that one has an informational advantage over another that spillover effects exist in consumption or production that one exerts market power and that scale economies exist in production many characteristics of health care markets fail to satisfy the assumptions of the invisible hand theorem moreover fundamental characteristics of health care such as informational asymmetries between patients and health care professionals and between payers and providers as well as ethical and distributional concerns complicate efforts to expand the use of market or marketlike incentives in health care rising health care costs in part reflect the cost of technological advances whose benefits exceed their costs and the aging of the us population the growing role of thirdparty reimbursement over the past half century weakened incentives to minimize costs and thus has also led to higher health care costs many analysts have called for initiatives which would improve the functioning of health care markets such as improving consumer information and allowing greater use of bargaining these initiatives may help reduce or slow the growth of health care costs but may also have unintended negative consequences greater use of marketlike incentives can improve the efficiency of the health care system but only if they take into account the special characteristics of health care httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33759g10g142g138g149g157g145g561g5g138g155g142g561g138g151g141g561g15g138g155g148g142g157g156g561 g561

policy makers and politicians argue that the us health care system would perform better if market or marketlike institutions played larger role this view is based on the belief held by economists that markets generally work most efficiently when left alone provided that certain conditions are met these conditions essentially state that consumption or production by one person does not affect others that one has privileged position in the market and that property rights are welldefined if those conditions are violated however markets may function inefficiently which is what economists call market failure government intervention may enhance economic efficiency although in other cases government action may exacerbate market failure the special characteristics of health care often lead to market failures the extent of government activity visavis the health system is seen by many economists and health care analysts as policy response to the inequalities and inefficiencies associated with such market failures health care professionals often view market orientation as threat to their traditions ethics and culture bottomline mentality they argue cannot deliver the same high quality of care as the socalled traditional approach based on professional ethics and responsibilities critics such as arnold relman editor emeritus of the new england journal of medicine denounce the medicalindustrial complex for its dedication to profitability rather than patient wellbeing 1 nevertheless health care institutions have always cared about their pecuniary interests as well as their patients as one historian noted in many respects hospitals have behaved as businesses but hospitals have simultaneously carried symbolic and social significance as embodiments of american hopes and ideals2 even if some view market forces and the use of the price system to allocate health care services as an intrusion consumers and providers of health care are strongly affected by economic incentives hospitals cut the average length of an inpatient stay sharply after medicare switched from costbased reimbursement to paying flat diagnosisrelated fee3 physicians increased the volume ie number of patient visits and intensity of patient care ie number or complexity of services provided in an average visit seen after reductions in medicare part b payments4 consumers use less health care when they must pay larger share of the cost these behavioral responses although predicted by economic theory do not necessarily enhance economic efficiency the challenge for those who wish to expand the use of market incentives in health care is to design policies that align material incentives facing consumers and providers of health care so that changes in behavior enhance economic efficiency both friends and foes of the expanding role of markets have sometimes relied on crude ideas about what markets can or cannot accomplish this report explains what wellgrounded economic theory has to say about the limits and capabilities of the market in the health care sector these 1 arnold s relman the new medicalindustrial complex new england journal of medicine vol 303 october 1980 pp 963970 2 rosemary

by mixture of public and private payers staffed by dozens of health professions working in clinics hospitals nursing homes private offices health maintenance organizations work sites and home settings among other venues this patchwork system provides patients with broad set of alternatives gives health professionals in general and physicians in particular substantial degree of autonomy and assigns separate if often overlapping responsibilities among various levels of government the complexity of the us health system which gives it considerable flexibility is also one of the principal causes of its inefficiencies dissatisfaction with the performance of the us health care system has spurred wider interest in using market or market like institutions to generate better results and lower costs

health indicators such as average longevity and infant mortality are among the bottom quarter of the 30 advanced industrial countries that comprise the organization for economic cooperation and

and by 2016 projections indicate that proportion will rise to one in five9 according to the latest oecd figures us health care spending in 2004 was about third higher than switzerland which had the second highest level of spending10 this spending is not due to differences in the proportion of population aged 65 or older nor to higher direct costs of malpractice claims11 while the united states spends more on health care than other countries fewer health care resources per capita are available compared with many other advanced nations the number of physicians per capita in the united states is about twothirds of the oecd average and the number of hospital beds per capita is lower than the oecd average so greater availability of medical inputs cannot explain the spending differ ence between the united states and other oecd countries greater intensity and complexity of medical care in the united states may account for some of the difference 1996 mckinsey research project found that health care providers in the united states were more efficient in the sense of producing more outputs for given amount on inputs than those in germany and to some extent than those in the united kingdom many analysts however emphasize other explanations for why medical care in the united states costs more than in other advanced countries prices of medical inputs and administrative costs are much higher in the united states than in other oecd countries 12 for example average remuneration for medical specialists in the united states as compared with per capita national income is higher than for any other oecd country while the number of specialists per capita in the united states is below the oecd average13 group of harvard medical school researchers estimated that administrative costs accounted for about quarter of health care expenditures in 1 999 administrative costs in canada and europe appear to be much lower although the extent of the difference is subject to

costs take up large and growing part of the economy and of public budgets medicare the largest health expenditure in the federal budget will cost in total 428 billion in fy2007 according to cbo baseline projections or 31 of gross domestic product gdp and the federal portion of medicaid is expected to cost 193 billion or 14 of gdp 16 medicare part costs per beneficiary grew on average 466 year between 1970 and 2005 and part b costs grew on average 876 year over the same period17 one congressional budget office cbo scenario anticipates that in 2050 medicare spending will take up 86 of gdp with medicaid taking up another 40 of gdp even aside from state contributions to medicaid18 medicaid is one of the largest and fastest growing components of state spending budgets in fy2004 medicaid accounted for 223 of total state spending which was slightly larger than the 214 spent on elementary and secondary education the size and rapid growth of medicaid spending led the national governors association and the national association of state budget officers to call the program the dominant force in state spending19 governments in general and the federal government in particular are deeply involved in health care markets public spending in 2007 is expected to account for 47 of national health expenditures up from 38 in 1970 federal spending alone was expected to reach 34 of national health expenditures in 2007 up from 24 in 1970 20 furthermore federal involvement in health care extends well beyond spending health care markets are extensively regulated and the federal tax code affects health care markets in important ways in particular the cost of the federal tax exemption for employerpaid health insurance premiums exceeds that of any federal health program other than medicare and medicaid this exemption will decrease federal revenues by an estimated 100 billion in fy200721 the pace of health care costs and the expanding public role in health care have stoked interest in using market incentives to slow or limit costs and to improve quality of outcomes the nature of health care however provides some inherent limits to the effectiveness of the market 15 for

hand theorem which states that market outcomes are efficient so long as certain conditions hold22 these conditions are externalities an externality or spillover effect exists when ones consumption or production affects the abil ity of another to consume or produce public goods defined as goods which more than single person can enjoy at the same time are special type of externality 23 symmetric information everyone knows the same things one has an informational advantage over others market power one acts as if he can influence prices through his actions voluntary trade property rights are welldefined and individuals can refuse trades that make them worse off24 the invisible hand theorem takes the distribution of buying power as given however to the extent society cares about fairness or the evenness of distribution it may wish to use taxes and transfers to alter the distribution of buying power if transfers and taxes could be made without economic distortions then society could move to another distribution of buying power and the economy would run at full efficiency 25 in practice however all taxes and transfers will cause some economic distortions thus society alters the distribution of buying power to more fair allocation but at some cost of economic efficiency

some form of coordination individuals will contribute inefficiently small amounts for the prevention of contagious diseases therefore an efficient government can improve public wellbeing by imposing taxes and spending an appropriate amount on prevention and public health information gained through medical research is an example of public good because the same information can benefit many people simultaneously individual donations however would yield an inefficiently low level of support for medical research charging those who benefit from better medical technology or procedures can provide partial solution but to the extent that some patients will be priced out of the market economic inefficiencies will persist what economists 22 among economists the invisible hand theorem is called the first welfare theorem see gerard debreu theory of value new haven yale 1959 pp 9496 for proof 23 more precisely good is considered pure public good if the cost of allowing one more person to enjoy its benefits is zero for example radio broadcast can be considered pure public good because the cost of adding one listener is zero 24 technical condition on consumer preferences nonsatiation that rules out bliss points is also required this discussion uses the assumption of symmetric information rather that the assumption that individuals possess perfect information used in standard proofs proof of the first we lfare theorem with symmetric information requires slightly stronger conditions on consumer tastes 25 this is the second welfare theorem

groups for example privately supported basic research is an example of privately funded public good many goods provided by governments are private goods not public goods extending the benefits of police fire and municipal trash collection to more people generally requires proportionate increase in resources so such services would not be considered public good by economists26 redistribution of resources to the poor according to some economists can also be considered public good27 in this view each member of society would benefit by the knowledge that all other members were kept from falling below some minimum standard of living however the warm glow that each member might feel from redistribution that ensured that minimum standard often falls short of an intensity sufficient to induce opening of ones own pocketbook compulsory taxation provides way to finance redistribution by sharing the cost among all taxpayers many people would derive some satisfaction from knowing th at health care system fulfilled the ethical norm that access to medical care was available regardless of ability to pay supporting such system as practical matter requires government intervention

information which occurs when some have informational advantages over others is the source of many of the key problems in health care when consumers know the quality and price of goods they can search to find higherquality and lowerpriced goods this puts pressure on firms to increase quality and reduce price when consumers cannot see prices or quality however markets work less well in general when one party knows more than another party market failure can occur economists distinguish among several different types of asymmetric information which are considered as follows 28

or activity to an agent who has special knowledge if the principal can directly assess outcomes and effort then problem exists however if the principal cannot observe how hard the agent works or if the principal is unable to tell the difference between incompetence and bad luck then market failure can result the interaction of patient and physician is an example of principal agent relationship the patient goes to physician because the physician has special knowledge the physician however faces different incentives that are not always aligned with the patients best interests for example the physician may be paid more by ordering test whose costs exceed its benefit or the physician may have patient make additional visits whose benefits fall short of their costs principalagent problems can be mitigated in several ways physicians reputation can provide one solution to the principalagent problem if good reputation brings benefits to physician and if patients occasionally get some

physicians will have an incentive to avoid actions which would damage their reputations however if patients rarely obtain information on whether physician acts in their best interest or if the penalty of losing good reputation is too small then the agents will have weak incentives to be faithful to their principal and the principal will use physicians less often centralized tracking of physicians is another possible solution centralized mechanisms such as licensure requirements exist to certify that physicians have received appropriate training the national practitioner data bank npdb contains information on malpractice claims and disciplinary actions against health care professionals governments hospitals health plans and related organizations can access specific records but individuals cannot some consumer groups have attempted to compile their own databases that would allow consumers to assess the quality of different physicians so far these databases are fragmentary and limited thirdparty monitoring can also give incentives for health care providers to maintain and improve quality accreditation or certification of health care providers gives consumers and payers seal of

selection occurs when some personal characteristics which affect health care costs are hidden from others pricing of individual insu rance contracts can only depend on characteristics that the insurer knows or can discover and which can be verified by third party such as court or an arbitrator if sicker and healthier persons are indistinguishable they will pay the same health insurance premiums while insurers may not know each individuals characteristics they will have information based on claims history and other data about the aggregate characteristics of various pools of persons seeking insurance furthermore insurers understand that carefully designed and marketed menu of insurance plans can induce individuals to separate themselves into different risk pools for instance lowpremium highdeductible plan is more likely to attract healthier individuals and highpremium lowdeductible plan is more likely to attract individuals with greater health care needs thus even if insurers cannot observe individual characteristics they can still achieve some separation of high and lowrisk enrollees insurance companies in competitive market face strong incentives to attract lowrisk customers and avoid highrisk customers which they can do through underwriting underwriting is the process of assessing levels of risk associated with different insurance contracts and setting terms conditions and prices for those contracts underwriting splinters the insured population into smaller and smaller risk groups and reduces risk sharing across broader population for auto and property insurance this is standard adverse selection is less of problem because insurers can predict risk using observable characteristics of drivers and their claims history pooling careful and careless drivers in effect compels careful drivers to subsidize careless drivers this pooling would be inefficient if such implicit subsid ies caused careless drivers to either drive more or drive less well or if resulting increases in premiums caused careful drivers to buy less insurance underwriting by auto insurance companie s raises strong fairness issues to the extent that the risk of having auto insurance claims is linked to personal choices including the choice of whether to drive or not

health insurance has always worked differently than other lines of insurance few would argue that anyone has right to be careless driver on the other hand differences in health costs are often presumed to stem from factors which are beyond the control of individuals29 the idea that access to health care should be equal has had enormous influence on health policy the need to use health care is typically viewed as result of bad luck or genetics rather than carelessness to the extent that individual demand for health care is unaffected by insurance status the costs of providing health care can be considered fixed sum in this case the practice of medical underwriting which consists of offering better prices and conditions to the healthy rearranges the cost burden of health care but does not affect overall costs that is while an individual insurer earns higher profits by attracting healthier risk pool via medical underwriting total costs are not reduced because underwriting consumes real resources administrative costs in system with medical underwriting will be higher than when all risks are in one pool legal or administrative measures can require insurers to charge the same premiums to individuals with differing characteristics which in the co ntext of health insurance is called community rating in competitive market community rating may be unsustainable if sicker and healthier persons face the same premiums sicker persons face stronger incentives to enroll in insurance plans and to choose more generous health plans health plans that attract higher proportion of sicker enrollees will have higher average costs if health insurers are unwilling to sustain losses higher average costs lead to higher premiums which gives healthier individuals incentive to purchase less insurance relative to situation in which adverse selection were absent mixed insurance pool may be stable however if the proportion of sicker people in pool is small enough and if economies of scale make larger plans more efficient if healthier persons remain in the same plans as sicker people then in effect they subsidize sicker persons if the proportion of sicker persons is sufficiently large however private insurance providers can earn profit by introducing plans that attract preponderance of healthier people 30 as healthier people leave the mixed insurance pools average costs for remaining enrollees increase leaving more people unable to afford health insurance this dynamic is often termed death spiral the ability to organize large pools of diverse individuals is central advantage of employerbased health insurance which has dominated the us health care system for the past half century31 blue crossblue shield organizations once adhered to the community rating principle that spread risks across large heterogenous pools community rating was vulnerable to forprofit insurers pricing strategies that offered lower rates for firms with healthier employees which cut blue crosss market share twelve states still require insurers to use community rating for certain markets 32 some see the shift of market share from blue cross plans that used community rating 29 for example few employers offer plans which charge nonsmokers lower premiums than smokers suggesting strong reluctance to use experience rating within groups even when cost differences are strongly

groups as an example of death spiral33 other researchers however contend the introduction of community rating need not result in death spiral34 furthermore the financial problems of some blue cross organizations may have had more to do with administrative problems than with adverse selection35 the tax exemption for employerprovided health care was major factor in the expansion of employeebased health insurance while linking health insurance with employment has advantages of low administrative costs and broad pooling of risks the tax exemption gives the largest subsidies to those with the most generous health plans and for employees with choice of plans encourages the choice of more generous plans tying health insurance to employment which the tax exemption encourages can discourage employees from switching jobs problem know as job lock the presidents advisory panel on tax reform recommended capping this tax exemption 36 organizing governmentsponsored risk pools is another way to ensure that the risks of incurring major health care costs are spread across large population in singlepayer systems such as canadas all eligible persons are in the same pool putting all canadians in single pool and the ban on private health insurance prevents any splintering of the health insurance market that could trigger death spiral and ensures that the health care costs of the sickest patients are borne by the whole population more limited approach is to set up risk pools which allow those with serious medical problems to obtain health insurance37 as of 2005 33 us states had set up risk pools that offer insurance to individuals denied insurance due to an existing medical condition despite subsidies from state and federal funds riskpool premiums are much more expensive than premiums paid by healthy individuals who have employerprovided insurance38 in 2004 state subsidies totaled more than 05 billion and premiums typically cost 125 to 150 of comparable individual market premiums the number of enrollees in risk pools about 180000 in 2004 comprises only small fraction of the pool of uninsured39 adjusting payments to plans and providers based on characteristics of enrollees at least in theory can provide incentives for private insurers to treat pool of patients more efficiently rather than to focus on attracting healthier pool of patients if insurers were paid less for covering healthy 33 paul starr the social transformation of american medicine new york basic 1983 pp 327331 34 thomas c buchmueller and john dinardo did community rating induce an adverse

weaker incentive to attract the healthy and avoid the sick for instance medicare advantage sets rates for its hmo capitation program based on enrollee characteristics so far however medicare advantage ma uses crude rules of thumb to set reimbursement adjustments which do not appear to have changed incentives facing insurers in significant ways medicare administrators are currently exploring more sophisticated ways of reimbursing ma providers designing reimbursement schemes to change insurers incentives is difficult for two reasons first health expenditures are highly skewed among the population 5 of patients account for over 50 of health care costs40 thus to alter insurers behavior substantial pricing adjustments would be needed second insurers are likely to have better information about health characteristics of enrollees and potential enrollees as well as more sophisticated methods of analyzing those characteristics to the extent that payment adjustments misprice risk private insurers can profit by medical underwriting providing people with the opportunity to extend or renew their health insurance coverage can provide some protection against the effects of splintering risk pools if insurance plans are subject to frequent renewal decisions that may depend on past claims history then insurance becomes less of shield against financial calamity and more of an installment plan congress and several states have enacted reforms intended to preserve enrollees ability to renew coverage the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 cobra pl 99272 contains provisions which allow retirees former employees and dependents to pay more than 102 of the full normal premium to continue coverage terminated employees may generally obtain cobra coverage for 18 months in some ci rcumstances beneficiaries can obtain cobra benefits for longer periods because employers typically contribute portion of the cost of premiums obtaining insurance under cobra almost always costs former employees much more than what current employees pay for health insu rance cobra policies however cost less than individual health insurance plans with the pos sible

experience rating of small group health insurance and 21 states limit experience rating for nongroup health insurance some states also require insurers to issue policies and many more have extended cobra and hipaa provisions regarding continuation of health insurance coverage45 despite various federal and state measures intended to limit experience rating and expand health insurance coverage many people especially those with preexisting conditions have trouble finding affordable health insurance 46 the health insurance trade association reported in 2002 that 71 of applicants were offered standard premiums and 12 were rejected47 g15g152g155g138g149g561g10g138g163g138g155g141g561 moral hazard occurs when persons actions are unobservable so that changes in behavior cannot be observed48 in particular moral hazard refers to changes in behavior that affect the risks being insured for example after person obtains health insurance she may take less care to remain healthy or may visit her physician more often than necessary moral hazard in health insurance may be limited by noninsurable costs for instance going to the physician takes time having procedures performed is painful and neglecting ones health can cause problems which medical care cannot easily cure copayments and deductibles are standard methods to limit moral hazard according to economic theory insurance policies that divide risksharing between an insurer and the insured in an efficient way require individuals to pay for relative ly small regularly occurring expenses such as eyeglasses and routine dental care and require insurers to pay major part of large unexpected expenses the value of insurance is higher for rare or unusual expenses which would cause serious financial disruption for household small and routine costs present lesser financial risks to policyholders so the benefit of insuring such expenses is minor thus economic theory suggests that if consumers are informed and rational then insurance with doughnut provisions which cover small and highcost claims but which fail to cover claims over some intermediate range is an inefficient means of sharing risks 49 the medicare part d drug coverage is one example of health insurance with doughnut provision on the other hand the medicare catastrophic coverage act of 1988 pl 100360 which introduced changes in the medicare system arguably more in line with standard economic theory was subsequently repealed in 1990 after vigorous protests by some medicare beneficiaries 50 45 merlis op cit pp 1516 46 merlis op cit pp 1012 47 thomas musco and

and deductibles receive more health care the rand health insurance expe riment which randomly assigned families to insurance plans found that free care encouraged health care use families that paid nothing for their health care were about 10 more likely to use medical care and incurred about 25 more medical expenses than families with 25 copay plans families with 50 and 95 copay plans were less likely to use medical care and incurred fewer medical expenses51 health status for those receiving free care was little different than health status for those in copay plans with two exceptions first lowincome people with poor vision and free care had slightly improved vision compared with others second lowincome populations with free care had fewer problems with high blood pressure within that highrisk group better control of high blood pressure appeared to lessen mortality risks52 another study using data from the medical outcomes study found that older patients with chronic conditions who had zero or low copayments consumed more medical care than those with high copays53 requiring families to pay portion of their health care costs according to the usual theory of supply and demand reduces demand for lowbenefit care to the extent that costs of some types of care exceed their benefits excluding such items is more efficient way to design insurance plans demand for health care items whose benefits greatly exceed their costs should be affected to lesser degree if patient behavior conformed to standard economic assumptions there is mixed evidence however that higher copayments have different effects on lowbenefit and high benefit care the rand health insurance expe riment and the medical outcomes study found that higher patient copays and deductibles reduced use of lowbenefit items but also reduced consumption of some highbenefit items as well that suggests demand for health care responds to monetary incentives but that patients often have difficulty in distinguishing highbenefit and lowbenefit care or that some portion of the patient pool responds to monetary incentives and another portion does not in some instances changes in what patients pay can induce reductions in lowbenefit care without significantly affecting highbenefit care for instance 1996 study found that requiring kaiserpermanente hmo enrollees to pay 25 to 35 for emergency room visits reduced overall emergency room visits by 15 while the reduction in emergency room visits for conditions classed as always an emergency was small and statistically insignificant 54 the extraordinary cost of major medical intervention presents difficult dilemma to those who design costsharing provisions in health insurance plans while few patients incur huge charges that small percentage of cases accounts for large proportion of total health care costs on one hand health insurance plan has limited value if it does not prevent health emergency from becoming financial calamity forcing families to pay even fraction of the costs of an expensive medical episode could strain the finances of most families even to the point of bankruptcy 55 on the other hand if insurance pays all or nearly all of the charges associated with major health episode then patients their families and their physicians have little incentive to 51 w g manning et health insurance and the demand

study found correlation between spending on care for terminal patients and regional mortality rates suggesting that either higher spending yields little or benefit in mortality or that data aggregated by region are too crude to identify effects57 many plans have outofpocket limits that commit the insurer to pay all charges above certain level which provides families with substantial protection against financial calamity at the cost of eliminating monetary incentives to avoid items or procedures with only low or speculative benefits in some cases administrative and financial incentives may induce terminal patients to be treated in highcost settings even when patients have expressed desire to be treated in lowcost hospice or home setting 58 imposing tighter controls on access to medical care by imposing gatekeeper requirements is another way to limit moral hazard most managed care plans require primary care physician or insurance plan representative to approve hospital visits procedures and specialist visits managed care plans substantially increased their share of the health insurance market in the late 1980s and early 1990s development driven in part by the belief that managed health care and health maintenance plans could control costs some research suggested that cost growth moderated in markets where managed care plans had larger market shares 59 other evidence suggests that managed care plans do not deliver lower costs60 in the late 1990s consumer dissatisfaction slowed or even reversed the expansion of managed care although hmo and managed care plans avoided losing market share by loosening controls on access to care and by expanding into the medicare population 61

standard feature of benefit packages for nearly all businesses with more than 200 employees and for firms that tend to employ highwage employees64 highwage employees are more likely to fall within higher marginal tax brackets and therefore gain more from the tax exemption of employerprovided health insurance than lowwage employees for instance highwage employee whose income puts her in the 35 marginal tax bracket saves 35 in taxes for every dollar shifted from posttax compensation to health insurance paid in pretax dollars lowwage employee who pays federal income tax gains federal income tax advantage from shifting compensation to health benefits 65 without some curtailment of the employerprovided health insurance tax exemption medium and large businesses and firms that tend to hire highwage individuals will continue to offer health benefits smaller businesses and firms that employ large numbers of lowwage workers who gain less from tax exemptions face stronger temptation to drop or curtail health insurance benefits as health premiums rise the percentage of small businesses that offer health benefits dropped from 69 in 2000 to 60 in 200566 lowwage workers may be more willing to take the risk of going without health insurance in exchange for higher takehome pay although lowwage individuals are more likely to have poor health status for example in 2005 fewer than half of walmart employees were in its health insurance plan while some worked too few hours or had not worked long enough to be eligible many others passed up coverage because of the high cost of benefits relative to their earnings67 an internal 2005 walmart memorandum stated that significant proportion of workers 27 obtained coverage for their children through public insurance programs such as medicaid and state childrens health insurance program schip and that an additional 19 had children who were uninsured 68 walmart employees and their children were less likely to have employerprovided insurance and more likely to be covered by public insurance than the national average for all workers but were more likely to have employerprovided insurance and less likely to be covered by public insurance than the average retail worker in april 2006 in the face of pressure from unions and several state legislatures walmart announced changes in its benefits package intended to increase the

to offer lowincome individuals and their families stable and predictable financial protection against medical costs in addition the interaction of public and private insurance programs can distort incentives for low wage individuals and the firms that employ them although enrollments in medicaid and schip increased in the 1990s in recent years some states have tightened eligibility standards while other states have expanded coverage70 many lowincome families lose their eligibility for medicaid when their incomes rise above statespecific earnings thresholds which imposes high implicit marginal tax rate on earnings of those families serving as deterrent to work71 some firms that tend to hire lowwage workers have trouble offering insurance plans as attractive to lowincome families as public insurance programs supported by tax dollars firms that offer lowwage workers health benefits find that through the tax system they pay health insurance costs of their competitors employees as well as their own in addition waiting periods for benefits and other eligibility hurdles impose barriers to insurance benefits and health care access for lowwage workers who change jobs more frequently and are more subject to economic and social disruptions than workers with greater financial resources

health economists and practicing physicians according to one survey believe that the primary reason for the increase in the health sectors share of gdp over the past 30 years is technological change in medicine72 in other sectors of the economy most notably those involving computers and information technology technological advances brought better and cheaper products asking why technology causes higher costs in health care but lower costs elsewhere is natural part of the answer lies in how incentives facing developers of new medical technologies interact with the structure of health care finance the direction and pace of advances in medical technology depend on incentives facing engineers and researchers which are affected by how health care is financed inventors and developers if motivated by profits must consider who will pay for new technologies and innovative products the dominant role of insurers and governments in health care finance implies that converting breakthroughs in medical technology into financial success generally depends on private and public insurers decisions about what their plans cover defining coverage limits of health insurance presents special

time has an important effect on incentives facing those working to develop new drugs devices and procedures because health insurance makes patients and physicians less sensitive to price developers have stronger incentives to invent new treatments or technologies which do something new or better rather than invent cheaper ways of doing existing things innovation in computer hardware technology is mainly focused on making cheaper computers that run faster if firms and individuals had computer insurance computers might perform more esoteric tasks but at much higher price one proposed strategy is to design health insurance plans that will pay an amount equivalent to the cost of an existing technology if patient wanted newer and better technology then the patient would have to pay out of her pocket if the new technologys benefits warranted its higher costs then presumably the patient would be willing to pay the extra amount for example an insurer could set reimbursement for pharmaceuticals aimed at specific condition equal to the cost of an existing drug of known efficacy if drug company developed more effective drug for that condition that was more expensive then the patient would pay the difference if the gain in efficacy was large compared to the increase in price the consumer would presumably be more willing to choose that drug this reimbursement policy would provide developers of new medical technologies with powerful incentive to make newer products better and cheaper while fixing reimbursement levels for new pharmaceuticals at the level of existing approved drugs would give drug developers strong incentives to consider the costs and prices during the rd process it could also create pricing anomal ies in the short run for instance study based on data from the clinical antipsychotic trials in intervention effectiveness ca tie found significant differences in qualityoflife measures for secondgeneration drugs and firstgeneration drug perphenazine even though newer drugs cost 300 to 600 more per month 74 thus for some patients switching to an older antipsychotic could yield large cost savings however different patients with the same condition often respond differently to the same drug and patients with schizophrenia often must try several different drugs to find one that is clinically effective and does not create serious side effects some patients will do better with secondgeneration drug while other patients with the same condition will do better with firstgeneration drug if reimbursement levels of secondgeneration drugs were set at the level of firstgeneration drugs either some patients would pay substantially more or someone would pay more on their behalf for their treatment using secondgeneration drug or they would have to use first generation drug which for them works less well g15g138g155g148g142g157g561g18g152g160g142g155g561 health care providers often have substantial market power shopping around for

such as better working conditions and higher pay similarly patient benefits from the bargaining power of his employer with his insurer as well as from the insurers bargaining power with health care providers 75 likewise retiree can benefit from the governments bargaining power lower prices for health care in other oecd countries are to large extent due to the willingness of governments to use their bargaining power with providers76 if consumers have wide choice of organizations or firms that can negotiate on their behalf then competition will ensure that consumers will reap most of the benefits if consumers cannot easily choose or switch among such organizations however then the middlemen will capture larger portion of those bargaining benefits for themselves moreover while the bargaining power of employers insurers and governments benefits consumers as compared to situation in which consumers face providers directly bargaining interactions among employers insurers and

separate questions of efficiency from questions of redistribution if market failure occurs market outcomes are inefficient in the sense that other outcomes exist that would make some people better off without making anyone else worse off even if markets are efficient society may decide to redistribute resources despite efficiency losses designing policy according to mainstream view of public economics is matter of achieving given set of distributional goals with minimal loss of efficiency 78 the concept of social insurance which is embedded in the design of social security and much of federal health policy provides way to redefine the distinction between efficiency and redistribution for instance social security benefits resemble annuities offered by private insurers retiree who purchases an annuity pays for the right to receive regular payments until death annuities therefore insure retirees against the risk of having their assets run out before they die and allow retirees to reallocate income to match over time financial resources to needs an actuarially fair annuity ie one whose expected benefits match its cost for each category of risk cannot be properly said to redistribute income even though annuity holders who live longer receive more benefits than those who do not 75 henry j aaron funny thing happened on the way to managed competition journal of health

progressive benefit schedule so that retirees who had low wages receive more relative to the payroll taxes they paid than what retirees who had high wages receive th us the progressive structure of social security benefits tends to transfer income from richer to poorer retirees in way that private insurer would not while this could be viewed as pure redistribution the progressive structure of social security benefits can be seen as implicitly providing insurance against the risk of having low earnings to the extent that this socially provided insurance reduces the riskiness of individuals incomes over their lives economic efficiency is enhanced 79 broader interpretation of the social insurance concept would be that redistributional programs aimed at the poor act as an insurance program that all members of society join before birth some part of regular taxes constitutes the premium for this social insurance and individuals collect benefits if they suffer bad luck of some sort that makes them poor social insurance provides protection against some consequences of becoming poor at the cost of higher taxes for others the introduction of medicare and medicaid in 1965 reflected both social insurance and more purely distributional concerns medicare which reduced the share of the elderly living in poverty added medical benefits to the social security program by including nearly all of the working population in medicare its original proponents sought to distinguish it from more redistributive welfare programs and emphasize its social insurance aspects in contrast while medicaid also provides substantial social insurance benefits its design continues to reflect its origin as redistributive program medicaid stemmed from various poorrelief programs aimed at low income groups and those impoverished by poor health which were extended and consolidated in multibilliondollar federalstate program 80

intensify pressures on public budgets81 if health care costs continue to grow at past rates cutbacks in other types of consumption will be inevitable even if health care costs moderate substantial portion of the gains from economic growth will be directed towards the health care system rising costs have stemmed in part from the introduction of medical advances which have increased longevity and reduced morbidity 82 the increasing proportion of the elderly populati on is another cause of rising medical costs finally thirdparty reimbursement by shielding consumers from health care costs makes

consumers make better decisions however transparent pricing is likely to be effective only when combined with other measures often price information is of little value without accompanying information on quality 89 in addition consumers will be sensitive to prices only if they share nontrivial portion of their health care costs however the bulk of medical costs stem from small proportion of highcost episodes often occurring in the last few days of life90 insured patients in those episodes are well above outofpocket limits above which the insurance plan pays until some very high limit of coverage is reached for this reason insurance plansnot consumerswill be in the best position to put pressure on providers to lower prices and improve quality for the most expensive types of health care that is better price information for consumers can spur competition among providers of eyeglasses teeth cleaning and routine checkups but better price information is unlikely to sharpen

extensive databases which contain information reflecting the quality of health care these data aside from some limited exceptions are unavailable to consumers medicare pays an average of more than 400 million per year to run 53 quality improvement organizations qios which work with hospitals physicians nursing homes and other providers to improve quality of care research by academics and the institute of medicine has cast doubt on the efficacy of qios 92 other research however suggests that interventions by qios are associated with quality improvements93 hospital professional organizations in 2002 created the hospital quality alliance which provides comparative data for each hospital 20 indicators measuring the proportion of patients who receive specific treatments recognized to constitute best practice in the areas of heart attacks heart failure pneumonia and prevention of surgical infections are reported94 for example one item reports what percentage of heart attack victims received aspirin upon arrival at the hospital critics say this type of reporting focuses on what hospital did rather than what happened to patients they note that if food critics operated according to similar principles perhaps their reviews would report which restaurants remembered to include important ingredients of meals or how sophisticated the restaurant stoves were while failing to report how meals tasted traditional approaches to quality monitoring in health care focused on zeroone indicators that provide information on gradations of ability or competence physicians were licensed and hospitals were accredited and those who were not could not legally engage in medical care providers were certified for medicare reimbursement such measures however only served to set lower bounds the board certification of physicians is partial exception which provides consumers an opportunity to select physicians who have passed more rigorous set of standards 92 claire snyder and gerard anderson do quality improv ement organizations improve the quality of hospital care for medicare beneficiaries journal of the american medical association vol 293 23 june 15 2005 pp 2900 2907

it is difficult therefore to infer whether qios were good at helping providers improve quality of care or whether qios we re good at selecting providers with higher potential for quality improvement

health care quality95 of course outcome data must include risk adjustments so that statistics reflect the fact that healthier patients will on average have better outcomes for example the united network for organ sharing established by congress in 1984 collects data on all transplant operations in the united states riskadjusted outcome data for each transplant center are available at httpwwwunosorg public availability of riskadjusted outcome data puts pressure on surgeons and transplant centers to improve performance new york state has published riskadjusted average mortality rates for cardiac surgery since 1991 after starting this program the mortality rate among cardiac patients treated in topperforming hospitals or by topperforming surgeons was about half the mortality rate for patients treated by hospital or surgeon rated in the bottom 25 of the rankings 96 2003 study however contended that publication of performance data gave providers incentives to avoid difficult cases leading to worse health outcomes for sicker patients and higher resource usage97 in the absence of effective qualitycontrol programs malpractice and the tort system act as rough substitute for quality control98 expanding consumer access to useful medical outcome data would take pressure off the tort system for instance once new york state started publishing cardiac outcome data surgeons with high reported riskadjusted average mortality rates were more likely to retire or stop performing operations giving patients information that allows them to avoid surgeons with high mortality rates is preferable to having their estates sue g15g138g148g142g561g7g161g157g155g138g156g561g5g152g156g157g561g7g161g157g155g138g561 one strategy for slowing the growth of health care is to make patients pay more when they choose health care which is more expensive to provide for example many employers tie their contribution to an employees health insurance plan to the cost of the cheapest plan employees then face choice of paying for the incremental cost of more generous insurance plan out of their own pocket or spending that money on other things however some employees can pay for more generous insurance out of pretax income via premium conversion plans so that the tax exemption for employerprovided health care still tilts those employees towards buying more health insurance 99 limiting the income tax exemption for employerprovided health care at some fixed level would help ensure that those who benefit from more generous health plans pay for their added cost themselves100 to the extent that consumers make rational decisions between health and non health expenditures the tax exemption creates an economic distortion that lowers allocational 95 for more

generous health plans more sensitive to the cost of health insurance which would put downward pressure on health care costs as noted above the presidents advisory panel on tax reform called for capping this exemption for those reasons the weisbrod proposal described above which would tie reimbursement for new drugs to the level of an existing drug of recognized efficacy is another application of the make extras cost extra principle 101 providing drug developers with strong incentive to find new drugs that would be cheaper but just as effective as currently available drugs could help constrain the growth of health care costs in effect some insurers have partially implemented this approach in their efforts to promote use of generic drugs by waiving copays or deductibles that would apply for nongeneric drugs102 patients who want more expensive drugs rather than cheaper generics must pay some portion of the difference themselves the same pay more for extras approach appears in various forms in several health care reform proposals for example this idea is central to th rationale for the favorable tax treatment of high deductible insurance plans linked to health savings accounts hsas which have been an important part of the presidents health reform agenda those who choose these plans pay for routine expenses from hsas or beyond some point out of pocket but retain insurance protection against the financial risks connected to health care

information technology it could improve quality and increase efficiency of medical care the veterans health administration vha which treats about 5 million patients per ye ar began an organizational transformation in 1995 that featured centralized health information system this system not only simplified record keeping giving physicians instant access to records on all previous visits made by patient but also provided researchers and managers access to treatment and outcome data that provided hard evidence on clinical effectiveness 103 the vha is now considered leader in the application of it to health care administration104 several studies have concluded that quality of care in the vha exceeds that in comparable private health care providers105 centralized clinical it systems can also allow payers to link physician reimbursement with measures of quality of care the british national health service nhs initiated payfor performance contracts with family practitioners in 2004 which

diseases106 in the first year of this program almost 97 of uk physicians met quality targets while analysis of these initial data cannot determine whether initial clinical quality targets were set too low or whether clinical quality improved the information collected on quality indicators provides the nhs with powerful tool to monitor the quality of patient care and to push for further improvements the federal government has taken preliminary steps in the same direction the federal government has funded demonstration projects that make extra payments to physicians and hospitals that report certain quality indicators107 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 pl 108173 cuts payments by 04 to hospitals which do not report on 10 quality indicators for acute myocardial infarction congestive heart failure and pneumonia the deficit reduction act of 2005 pl 109171 increased that penalty to 2 of payments and authorized the department of health and human

selected by the centers for medicare and medicaid services phys ician v oluntary reporting program at present this program collects data on 16 quality measures in future years the secretary of health

leading many to ask why broader application of market principles to the health care system could not reduce costs and improve performance as many have noted health care is not standard commodity unless institutions and reforms are designed to reflect the unique characteristics of the health care market failures will continue to be the norm certainly past experience indicates that patients insurers and providers all react to financial incentives unfortunately designing incentives th at align behavior of consumers and health care payers and providers is difficult because of the nature of medical care broadening financial protection against unexpected health care costs enhancing access to routine and preventative care constraining costs and setting up economic incentives that induce efficient behavior among individuals and firms are all worthwhile goals designing policies with reasonable expectation of reaching each of those goals is difficult information asymmetries between patients and physicians as well as between providers and payers stem from the unavoidable need for highly specialized roles the specialized expertise of medical personnel gives patients access to sophisticated therapeutic measures many of which could hardly have been imagined generation ago this specialization of expertise also necessitates an informational asymmetry that requires patients to depend on their physicians to guide them through the system thus the principalagent relationship lies at the heart of the 106 t doran c fullwood h gravelle et payforperformance programs in family

while payers only see paper claims physicians possess an important informational advantage over thirdparty payers expanded use of performance measurements and information technology has the potential to reduce these problems the health insurance systems ability to spread risks across broad pool of beneficiaries will continue to face challenges as insurers seek to avoid losses through medical underwriting and related practices extending coverage to individuals in poor health from the point of view of an insurer is more akin to providing subsidy than insuring risk insuring such individuals may require either subsidies or pricing schemes that induce private insurers to compete on grounds of efficiency of service rather than ability to avoid those with greater needs for health care alternatively health insurance for those in poorer health could be guaranteed by policies that would create larger and broader pools such as the canadian singlepayer system another alternative is the united kingdoms twotier system in which all residents are enrolled in the national health service but those who wish access to more convenient services may buy supplemental policies such as provided by the british united provident association bupa this system gives all uk residents access to reasonable standard of care although this may involve some level of inconvenience and waiting in some cases and restricted access to some care regarded by health planning authorities as of low benefit those wishing to bypass such inconveniences can pay for access to more extensive and comfortable care some state governments have introduced other reform strategies after july 2007 massachusetts will require all residents to obtain health insurance this approach parallels the typical automobile insurance system which requires citizens to have insurance but allows them to choose among many approved and regulated insurance providers lowincome individuals will be eligible for subsidized access to insurance on sliding scale 108 governor schwarzenegger has proposed health insurance reform plan that also includes requirement that all individuals obtain health insurance109 even if the design of health care policy requires balancing of goals that present conflicting requirements policy innovations can deliver better results policies that harness market incentives and recognize the nature of health care can enhance efficiency and improve performance because asymmetric information is cause of market failure policies that provide better information to patients and payers may improve performance because market power often serves as cause of market failure policies that either reduce or counterbalance market power can help improve performance policies that either fail to reflect the nature of the health care or that fail to address causes of market failure are unlikely to lead to lasting improvements 108 henry j kaiser foundation massachusetts health care reform plan fact
