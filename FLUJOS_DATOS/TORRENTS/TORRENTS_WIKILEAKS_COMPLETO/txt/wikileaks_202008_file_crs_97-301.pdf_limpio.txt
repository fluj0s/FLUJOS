vote to create an expedited procedure to repeal or correct laws rules and regulations that are as then rules chairman gerald solomon stated obsolete ludicrous duplicative burdensome or costly1 the resolution amended the house rulebook by repealing the consent calendar and replacing it with new corrections calendar background the consent calendar originated in 1909 as way to expedite floor action on noncontroversial measures legislation on that calendar in order on the first and third mondays of the month typically passed quickly without amendment by unanimous consent however the consent calendar fell into disuse as the house increasingly employed other procedures unanimous consen t or suspension of the rules to process noncontroversial or rela tively noncontroversial gislation measures were called up on consent days during the 102nd and 103rd congresses the idea for the corrections calendar wa s highlighted early in 1995 by speaker newt gingrich crediting the concept to michigan governor john engler the speaker stated that he wanted to establish corrections day procedure for repealing the dumbest things the federal government is currently doing and just abolish them2 in subsequent weeks the speaker raised the co rrections day idea in different forums and provided some additional tails as to how the concept might be implementedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97301crs2 3 the speakers press room speaker ging rich announces correcti ons day steering group march 23 1995on march 23 1995 the speaker announced th formation of corrections day steering group chaired by representa tive barbara vucanovich rnev with representatives bill zeliff rnh and david mcintosh ri nd serving as cochairs for years the speaker said businesses of all sizes have voiced concerns and objections to the high cost and abundance of regulati ons they are subjected to which makes little sense but are required by law3 the basic mission of the corrections day steering group was to assess how the speakers plan mig ht be implemented so that wasteful and unnecessary regulations or laws could be considered for termination by the house in an expedited manner subsequently public hearings were held on the correcti ons day concept on may 2 1995 appropriate subco mmittees of the committees on government reform and rules held joint hearing with speaker gingrich as the leadoff witness the speaker stressed the importance of returning to common sense in crafting regulations and noted that corrections day would allow citizens to have an effective way to address legal but stupidly legal rules and regu lations and that the procedur would enhance congressional oversight of federal agencies other witnesses provided examples of what in their judgment constituted especially onerous and arbitrary laws nd regulations identified pro cedural options including corrections day calendar for implementing the corrections concept and highlighted the value of having rapid response and bipar tisan procedure for c onsidering what seemed to be plainly ridiculous and wasteful laws and regulations concern was also expressed at the hearing that any corrections day procedure not be employed by special interests that may want to repeal rules they say are mistakes or silly when in fact the regulations serve beneficial public purpose some witnesses also stressed the complexity of issues treated by regulations and emphasized th need for committee review of any proposed corrections bill still others highlighted the need to allow for minority party participation in the process some witnesses also wondered why existing procedures such as suspension of the rules could not be employed for corrections legislation consideration by the house rules committee on june 6 1995 representa tive vucanovich introduced hres 161 wh ich pr oposed to abolish the consent calendar and establish in its place corrections calendar the product of her task forces work the reso lution laid out procedural blueprint for implementing the speakers goal of having corrections day in addition the corrections day steering group suggested during its deliberations that an advisory panel of republicans and democrats be established to assist the speaker in formulating criteria as to what constituted corrections bill and in establishing guidelines for screening and scheduling such measures on june 13 1995 the rules committee received testimony on the proposal to establish corrections calendar from members and other witnesses three days later the committee favorably reported privileged resolution hres 168 to abolish thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97301crs3 4 congressional record november 28 1995 p h13675 5

did not include definition of st atutory or regulatory measures that might be candidates for considerati on on corrections day info rmally the corrections day advisory group developed criteria for making their recommendations to the speaker as one member of the advisory group said the guidelines we developed for the corrections day advisory committee say that corrections bill should address laws and regulations that are ambiguous arbitr ary or ludicrous the bill should be noncontroversial and have br oad bipartisan support4 the first corrections bill to be signed into law by the president was the ed ible oil regulatory re form act pl 10455 when the house adopted its rules on the opening day january 7 1997 of the 105th congress three changes were made in the co rrections
