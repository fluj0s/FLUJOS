announced by presid ent bush in january 2004 the vision calls for nasa to return humans to th moon by 2020 and someday send them to mars president bush did not propose adding significant funding to nasas fiveyear budget plan to implement the vi sion instead the agency must redirect funds from its other activities nasas resour ces are being strained by that decision increased funding requirements

cannot afford all the programs on its plate and priorities must be set he also is changing the emphasis on some of the visionrelated activities for example he is accelerating development of crew exploration vehicle cev to reduce an expected multiyear gap between when the space shuttle is to be terminated 2010 nd the availability of the cev during that gap the united states would be dependent

appropriations act adjusted for the rescission nasa also received 126 million in fy2005 supplemental for damages from the 2004 florida hurricanes giving it total of 16196 billion for fy2005 the fy2006 request was 16 increas above that total by comparison last years fy2005s budget submission pr ojected that the agen cy would receive 47 increase for fy2006 nasa submitted fy2006 budget amendment on july 15 2005 total funding requested did not chan ge only how it is allocated within the agency in the final version of the fy2006 sc ience state justice commerce appropriations act wh ich includes nasa congress approved 164568 million for nasa 500000 above the request th appropriation is subject to 028 acrosstheboard rescission the bill hr 2862 was signed into law on november 22 2005 pl 109108 the fy2006 departme nt of defense dod appropriations act pl 109148 included 350 million add ition for nasa for recovery from the 2005 hurricanes and 1 acrosstheboard rescission for most federal agencies including nasa the fy2006 funding figu res in this report do not reflect the acrosstheboard rescissions or the dditional 350 million congress also passed 2005 nasa authorization act pl 109155 it includes many policy provisions but does not authorize funds for fy2006 only for fy20072008 nasa substantially changed its budget structure in the fy2006 budget request as it has done repeatedly over th past several years the agency also shifted to full cost accounting in fy2004 these change s make comparisons across fiscal years at the program level virtually impossibl comparing the fy2005 appropriation and the fy2006 request alone is difficult in its fy2006 re quest nasa provided estimated fy2005 funding figures taken fro m its initial operating plan december 23 2004 using the same structure as the fy2006 budget to enable comparisons between those years however nasa s fy2005 spending plans have changedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs2 1 nasas operating plans are discussed below under overview of nasas fy2006 budget request 2 the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca chartered in 1915 served as the nucleus for nasa the day that nasa began operations five naca research facilities were transferred to nasa and all continue to operate today ames research center dryden flight research center glenn resear ch center formerly lewis research center langley research center and wallops flight facility two army organizations also were transferred to nasa within year of the ag encys creation the development operations division of the army ballistic missile agency the von braun team which developed the jupiter c launch vehicle that pl aced the first us satellite into orbit on january 31 1958 prior to nasas creation now called marshall space flight center and continuedsignificantly since then as explained in periodic updates to the operating plan1 the fy2005 operating plan updates are presented in the budget structure nasa used for fy2005 not fy2006 with crosswalk between the old and new structures thus those numbers cannot be incorporated into th tables in this report major changes are discussed in the text however the most prominent issues in the fy 2006 budget debate were carryovers from fy2005 whether to approve president bu shs vision for space exploration to return astronauts to the moon by 2020 and th go on to mars and worlds beyond returning the space shuttle to flight stat us following the february 2003 space shuttle columbia tragedy the future of us use of the international space station and whether to use the shuttle to service the hubble space telescope another major issue was the future of nasas aeronautics research programs which are slated for significant reductions several other crs reports are availa ble on

for inflation in the early 1960s as the nation strived to put an american on the moon by 1969 nasa s budget increased rapidly peaking at 525 billion current dollars in fy1965 then as other nati onal priorities gained precedence nasas budget declined sharply to about 3 billion current dollars by fy1974 subsequently it increased steadily for almost two decades the oneyear spike in 1987 was to build replacement space shuttle orbiter but declined in the mid1990s as effort s to restrain federal funding took hold it rose gradually in current dollars thereafter president bu shs vision for space exploration called for nasas budget to increase by about 5 in fy2005fy2007 that occurred for fy2005 but the fy2006 budget request is less than what had been projected last year see below source

historically nasa was part of the appropriations bill covering the department of housing and urban devel opment hud department of veterans affairs va and independent agencies including the national scien ce foundation and the environmental protection agency th house and sena appropriations subcommittees with oversight over th at bill were dubbed the vahudia subcommittees in the 109th congress the house decided to reorganize its appropriations committee reducing the number of subcommittees from 13 to 10 the vahudia subcommittee was one of t hose abolished nasa now is part of the newly established science state justice commerce ssjc subcommittee press accounts trace the origin of the reorganization to dissatisfaction by representative tom delay then house majo rity leader with deep cuts for nasa recommended by the vahudia subcommitt ee in the fy2005 deliberations and desire to eliminate the funding co mpetition between nasa and other popular programs such as housing and veterans medical care5 representative delay is strong supporter of nasa see crs report rl32676 the national aeronautics and space administrations fy2005 budget request description analysis

retained total of 12 subcommittees down from 13 nasa was moved into the newly established commerce justice and science cjs subcommittee the senate cjs subcommittees jurisdiction is different from its house counterpart in that the house subcommittee includes the state department nasas senate authorizing committee the senate commerce science and transportation committee also reorganized its subcommittee structure previously nasa was part of the science technolog and space subcommittee in this case the committee added several ne w subcommittees and technol ogy issues were moved to

the 16070 billion adjusted for the rescission appropriated in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act pl 108447 nas also received 126 million in fy2005 supplemental pl 108324 for hurricane re lief associated with the 2004 hurricanes giving it total of 16196 billion for fy2005 the fy2006 request was 16 increase above that total the previous year in the fy2005 request nasa was projected to

difficult footnotes to table 2 explain the changes from fy2005 nasa submitted fy2006 budget amendment on july 15 2005 available at httpwwwwhitehousegovombbudg etamendmentsa mendment_7_15_05pdf it reflects in part the shifting of two programs into the exploration systems mission directorate esmd iss crewcargo rvices 168 million from the international space station theme in the space operations mission directorate and the lunar robotic exploration prog ram 135 million from the so lar system exploration theme in the science mission directorate these changes are consistent with the statement in nasas may 10 2005 operating pl an update that these moves had been made for fy2005 thus the fy2006 funding request for the esmd increased by 303 million in the budget amendment th budget amendment made number of other changes which are discussed else where in this repor t as appropriate some of the fields in table 2 are necessarily blank because of how the various congressional committees acted on the bills increases and decreases for specific programs were noted in the text of the house and senate committee reports accompanying the appropriations bill hr 2862 but overall funding levels were

2005 is not available there the fy2005 totals for the sae and exploration capabilities accounts are different from those in the table included in nasas fy2006 budget justification documents because omb shows the shift of exploration systems from one account to the other the nasa table uses the fy2006 budget structure without showing trace between last years budget presentation and this years since the omb data show that trace they are used in this report the final version of the bill does not authorize funds for fy2006 only for fy2007fy2008 for the 2004 florida hurricanes fy2006 final appropriation does not reflect the 028 acrosstheboard rescission in the ssjc bill the 10 acrosstheboard rescission in pl 109148 or the add ition of 350 million for recovery from th 2005 hurricanes in pl 109148 congress gave nasa significant latit ude in how it could spend its fy2005 funding the conference report referred to it as unrestrained transfer authority between nasas two major budget accounts6 nasa was directed to notify congress of how it planned to spend the m oney and did so through the traditional process of submitting periodic operating plans an initial operating plan was sent to congress on december 23 20047 and it was used to show fy2005 funding figures for various activities in the nasas fy2006 budget submission several updates were subsequently submitted the most comprehe nsive of which were the may 10 and september 30 2005 versions8 despite the fact that nasa received pproximately the same amount that it requested in fy2005 the ag ency was under si gnificant funding constraints in fy2005 as noted 126 million of the total was supplemental to help nasa recover from the hurricanes that damaged nasa facilities at kennedy space center fl in 2004 the nasa fy2005 budget was subject to an acrosstheboard rescission reducing the appropriated vel from 16200 billion to 16070 billion more than 1 billion in other funding was used for activities that were not

his statement covered both th fy2006 request and the may 10 update to the fy2005 operating plan he emphasize d that nasa does not have sufficient money to fund all the prog rams it has on its plate fo

bills see belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs12 nasas fy2006 budget justification documents contained significantly less detail than in previous years the committees directed nasa to provide more

2005 nasa authoriza tion act pl 109 155 th final version authorized funding for fy20072008 not fy2006 its funding provisions are summarized in table 11 but are not otherwise discussed in this report however its policy provisions are discussed herein as ppropriate prior to this laws enactment the most recent nas authorization act covered fy20002002 pl 106391 house hr 3070 hr 3070 as passed by the

discussed below these figures changed significantly in the housepassed version of the bill during committee markup an amendment in the nature of substitute was adopted that reflected compromise between hr 3070 as approved by the space and aeronautics s ubcommittee on june 29 and hr 3250 gordon democratic substitute that was introduced after subcommittee markup most democratic members of the subcommittee abstained from voting on hr 3070 during subcommittee markup because they said they had insufficient time to review it the amended version of hr 3070 that cl eared the full committee is quite different from the earlier version of hr 3070 and from hr 3250httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs16 the amended bill adopts the budget structure proposed in hr 3250 which is different from the one used in nasa s fy2006 budget request instead of three accounts science aeronautics and expl oration explorati on capabilities and inspector general the bill creates four accounts science aeronautics and education exploration systems space oper ations and inspector general thus funding for exploration would be in its own account instead of with science aeronautics and education according to comments at the markup the intent is to create budgetary firewalls that would require closer congressional scrutiny if funding is shifted from one set of ac tivities eg scien ce aeronautics and education into another eg exploration the goal is to maintain balance among nasas activities the recommended budget structure is shown in table 3 the committee shifted some programs from one account to another as explained in the report hrept 109173 the new science aeronautics and education account would include all th programs in the current science aeronautics and education lines proposed in the request except that the robotic lunar exploration program would be transferred from science to exploration systems the exploration systems account would include all programs currently in the exploration systems line in the fy2006 request as well as the robotic lunar exploration program and two activities transferred from the space operations account sp ace and flight support and iss crewcargo services the new space operations account would include only the space shuttle and the international space station minus the iss crewcargo services activity hr 3070 as reported further specifi ed that for fy2006 of the amount in the science aeronautics and educa tion account 962 million was for aeronautics 150 million was for hubble servicing mission see below and 24 million was for

spent the bill contains number of policy provisions and requires nasa to submit certain reports these are discussed in subsequent sections of this report floor action managers amendment was adopted during floor consideration of the bill in terms of funding changes from the committeereported version the managers amendment specifies how much is allocated to science programs within the science aeronautics and exploration account for fy2006 and fy2007 53412 million and 59603 million respectively the fy2006 amount is the same as the amount reque sted in the amended july fy2006 budget request

amendment and are discussed below among them are modifying the language concerning retirement of the space shu ttle expanding on the requirement for developing national aeronautics policy and requiring the administrator to develop human capital strategy for the nasa workforce conference the bill was reported from conference hrept 109354 on december 16 2005 it passed the house on december 17 and the senate on december 22 it was signed into law on december 30 2005 as noted earlier it authorizes funding for fy2007 17932 b illion and fy2008 18686 billion not for fy2006 so its funding provisions are not further discussed in this report policy provisions are discussed elsewh ere in this repor t as appropriate it should be noted however that the act contains variation of the house passed requirement that nasa restructur its budget in the future so that explorationrelated activities are separated from science aeronautics and education instead of creating separa third account for exploration however the final version moves exploration sy stems into the same account as the international space station the space s huttle and space flight support thus nasa will continue to have two major accounts not three one will be labeled science aeronautics and education nd the other exploration systems and space operations the act limits to 10 the amount of funding each year that can reprogrammed from exploration systems into space operations or from space operations into exploration systems major nasa issues should nasa be single mission agency implementing the vision for sp ace exploration on january 14 2004 president bush ma major space policy address in which he directed nasa to focus its activities on returning astronauts to the moon by 2020 and someday sending them to mars and worlds beyond officially this policy is called the vision for space expl oration vse or simply the vision but is often informally referred to as the moonmars program the presidents vision for space exploration under the vision as delineated by the president nasa woul d terminate the shuttle program in 2010 when construction of the international space station iss is expected to be completed instead of operating the shu ttle until 2015 or beyond as planned prior to the columbia tragedy the scientific research program aboard the iss would be restructured to support only research asso ciated with achieving the vision instead of the broadlybased progra m that was planned nasa w ould end its use of iss by fy2017 instead of using it for at least 10 years after assembly is completed as previously planned president bush dir ected nasa to build crew exploration vehicle cev with demonstration flight by 2008 and an operational capability to low earth orbit later than 2014 its primary purpose is transporting astronauts to and from the moon nasa also would bu ild robotic probes as trailblazers forhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs19 the astronauts and launch ot her robotic missions to explore the solar system and the universe including new space telescopes the president invited other countries to join in the initiative the president did not propose adding significant sums to nasas budget to pay for the vision instead most of the funding was to be redirected from nasas other activities the white house nnounced that 126 billion would be made available for the vision from fy2005 2009 but only 1 billion of that was new money the remaining 116 billion w ould come from other nasa activities taking most of the requisite funds fro m other nasa programs instead of adding new money for the agency could mitigate concerns that the vision might increase the deficit or detract from ot her national prioritie s but it raised issues about the impact on those other nasa programs nd whether the level of funding is adequate to achieve the goals nasa released sand chart of projected nasa budgets through 2020 see figure 4 the sand chart shows nasa budget increasing approximately 5 each year for fy20052007 less than 1 in fy2008 and 2009 and remaining roughly level with inflation approxima tely 2 beyond fy2009 the total amount of funding for the vision represented in the chart appears to be 150170 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988 crs20 figure 4 nasas sand chart of pr ojected budget authority january 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs21 9 the transcript of the press conference is available at httpwwwnasagovpdf 133896main_133896main_esas_ro llout_presspdfnasa officials said the intent of the chart was to demonstrate there was balloon in funding past fy2009 the end of the time period covered by the outyear projections accompanying the fy2005 budget request however it fueled concerns that inter alia certain programs woul d pay the price for funding the vision in addition to showing termination of the sp ace shuttle and international space station programs it included category labeled aeronautics and other science activities for which funding would remain essentially level without adjustments for inflation throughout the 17 year time period that sparked concern that nasa was becoming single mission agency devoted to vision while sacrificing its other responsibilities the fy2005 and fy2006 nas budget requests and their outyear projections further increased worry that aeronautics and certain science disciplines would suffer in order for nasa to be able to afford the vision particularly when the presidents fy2006 request for nasa was only half of what had been projected the fy2005 budget and the original fy2006 budget request were prepared under the leadership of thennasa administr ator sean okeefe he left nasa in february 2005 and was succeeded by dr michael griffin in april 2005 dr griffins approach to implementing the vision is different from mr okeefes dr griffin submitted changes to the fy2005 budget in the operating plan updates discussed earlier and to the fy2006 budget request in july 2005 budget amendment for completeness both the original fy2006 request developed by mr okeefe and the amended request submitted by dr griffin are discussed below under dr griffins leadership sand ch art equivalent to the one produced in february 2004 showing how funding will be allocated across the agency through 2020 has not been made public how much will it cost the 2004 sand chart is budget projection not cost estimate the white house and nasa have not released cost estimate for accomplishing the vision in its entirety such as for sending people to mars the only specific milestone for which cost estimate has been released is for returning humans to the moon in late february 2004 nasa estimated that landing crew on the moon in 2020 would cost 64 billion in fy2003 dollars 24 billion fy20042020 to build and operate the crew expl oration vehicle and 40 billion fy20112020 to build the lunar lander portion of that vehicle new launch vehicle and operations the estimate did not include the cost of robotic missions in september 2005 dr griffin announced the results of the exploration systems architecture study the implementation plan for the vision during september 19 press conference he stated that it would cost 104 billion to return humans to the moon by 20189 nasa briefing charts in october 2005 however clarified that the 104 billion does not include the costs of cev missions to the international space station durin g the 20122016 time period those costs add another 20 billion according to nasa for total estimate of 124 billion for the first human return to the moon both figures 104 billion and 124

nasa update on nasa tv september 8 2005 httpwwwnasagovpdf 127082main_090805_mg_updatepdfadjusted for expected infl ation in calendar year 2005 dollars the estimates are 83 billion and 99 billion respectively according to nasa dr griffin stated at the press conference that when adjusted for inflation the cost of the new program is 55 the cost of apollo that estimate also did not include the cost of cev missions to the space station one question is whether nasas annua l budget is sufficient to support implementation of that pla n as noted nasas request for fy2006 is less than what the white house projected last year so the vision did not survive even its first year of priority setting within th total national budget some critics assert that the vision is more about ending nasa programs than setting the nation on bold path towards the future veteran space comment ator john pike who operates the globalsecurityorg website called the visi on roadmap for the quiet and orderly phaseout of manned space flight10 workforce impacts another aspect of the vi sion is its effect on nasas workforce nasas fy2006 budget jus tification which in cludes projections through 2010 assumes that the agency will cut about 2500 civil service jobs by the end of fy2006 the agency is offering buy outs and other incentives to encourage staff in certain disciplines to leave but to date these efforts have not achieved their targets nasa officials explain that everyone who currently is employed by nasa is funded through the end of fy2006 as discussed below see what is the future of the aeronautics program many of the personnel cuts are expected in the aeronautics field where significant funding cutbacks are being proposed because aeronautics is not considered to be visionrelated activity four of nasas field centers fo cus primarily on aeronautics research langley glenn ames and dryd and are expected to bear the brunt of the personnel cuts dr griffin has been visiting each nasa center reassuring workers that the centers themselves will not be closed but cautioning that workforce changes are inevitable as nasa shifts its focus during september 8 2005 talk to nasa employees dr griffin noted that i cant kid folks we are going to do everything we can to assign real and meaningful work as part of the exploration effort into centers where that work is needed to begun sic but we are not going to get all the way there there w ill be folks who are simply longer needed at nasa11 he stressed that nasa headqua rters staff requirements would be scrutinized along with those at the centers the fy2006 appropriations act that in cludes nasa pl 109108 restricts nasas use of buyouts and reductions in force rifs prior to nasa providing certain reports to congress th

they called on the house and senate authorizing committees to provide guidance and authorization for the effort nas as fy2005 operating plans show how nasa plans to spend the fy2005 funds the initia l operating plan submitted to congress in december 20 04 was significantly modified in the may 10 and september 30 revisions reflecting the different approach being taken by dr griffin discussed elsewhere in this report original fy2006 budget request under mr okeefes tenure the original nasa fy2006 budget request was developed under thennasa administrator sean okeefe mr okeef approach to implementing the vision centered on development of the new crew exploration vehicle cev with competition between two contractors from 2006 to 2008 at which time final design and single contractor would be selected an operational vehicle with earthorbital capability would be available by 2014 small amount of funding was included to begin planning for launch vehicle for the cev but decision was made on what launch vehicle would be used mr okeefe would not commit to using the cev to service the international space station seek ing to keep the program focused on lunar transportation funding for project prom etheus to develop advanced space nuclear power and propulsion systems strong intere st of mr okeefe and for the first of series of robotic lunar probes to s upport the vision to be launched in 2008 as directed by the president were relativel well supported in concert with the idea that most of the funding for the vision would come from other nasa activities the original fy2006 request included steep cuts in aeronautics see below 1 billion reduction in funding for space and earth sciences over the fy20062010 time period and sharply declining budget for the space shuttle program in the fy20082010 time frame as noted above the budget request also assumed that nasa would reduce its civil service workforce by about 2500 jobs by the end of fy2006 within nasas total budget request what constitutes funding for the vision is open to interpretation the entire fy2006 nasa budget is labeled exploration vision but fy2006 nasa budg et chart reproduced as table 4 divides the

via factivaamended fy2006 budget request u nder dr griffins tenure dr griffin emphasizes that he believes nasa s hould continue to have diverse set of missions and f unding for the vision should not come from nasas science or aeronautics programs at his april 2005 c onfirmation hearing he testified that nasa pursued broad range of activities during the apollo program in the 1960s and early 1970s and sees reason the agen cy cannot do so while implementing the vision14 appendix b provides summary comparison of nasas human space flight robotic space flight and aeronautics activities by decade he concluded that the total amount of nasa funding is not the problem pointing out that nasa received approximately the same amount of money in its first 16 years as it has in the past 16 years adjusted for inflation instead he said it is matter of setting priorities dr griffins chie f priorities are returning the shuttle to flight and making each flight as safe as possible comple ting construction of the space station by 2010 terminating the shuttle in 2010 and acceler ating the development of the cev to minimize the gap between when the shuttle ends and the cev is available at november 3 2005 house science co mmittee hearing dr griffin clarified that by science programs he means the space science and earth science programs in the science mission directorate he does not include biological and physical sciences research which is currently part of the exploration systems mission directorate as discussed elsewhere in this report he is cutting funds for that research some of which wa s to be conducted aboard th international space station in order to pay for accelerating the availability of the cev it is important to note that he did not promise that he would not take funds from scie nce or aeronautics to pay for other agency priorities the nas budget is under tight constraints because of increased costs for returning the space s huttle to flight status cost overruns in various programs including space science programs the need to pay for congressionally directed items and the need to pay for hurricane cleanup the following is list of the major changes dr griffin is pursuing compared with mr okeefes plan constellation systems this program comprises the crew exploration vehicle cev and crew launch vehicle clv for it it is the major focus of the exploration systems mission director ate esmd dr griffin has stated repeatedly that he wants to close the gap between when the space shuttle will be terminated 2010 and when the cev become s available his current goal is 2012 he also has added servicing the international space station to the cevs requirements instead of looking for ne w concepts for the cev which might be expensive and take time to develop dr griffin emphasizes that it should be simple and straightforward and therefore not require significant development time he has decided that instead of funding two contractors with competing designs through 2008 as originally planned the ag ency will choose single contractor in 2006 dr griffin estimates that downselecting to one c ontractor that early could save 1 billion in the near term however additional funds are needed both for the cev and the clv in the september 2005 implementation plan dr griffinhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs28 announced that the clv would be shuttled erived vehicle another shuttlederived launch vehicle will be developed later for taking heavy cargo into space funding for that vehicle is not included in the fy 2006 budget request shuttlederived launch vehicles are discussed below in keeping with the philosophy that fundi ng for the vision in this case funding for esmd should not be taken from science or aeronautics dr griffin has focused on reducing funds for other esmd activitie s in order to pay for accelerating the cev the fy2006 budget amendment shifts 292 million in fy 2006 from other biological and physical research other md research and technology programs and project prometheus see below into the cevclv the september 30 2005 operating plan update identifies an dditional 493 million in fy2006 funds to be shifted into cevclv from research and t echnology programs within esmd taken together that would increase planned funding for cevclv in fy2006 by 785 million from 112 billion in the original fy2006 request to 19 billion some question whether that much can actually be spent in fy2006 especially considering that nasa does not plan to awar d cev contract until spring 2006 project prometheus this program to develop new space nuclear power and propulsion systems was initiated by nas prior to the vision speech nasa initially requested 320 million for fy2006 but the july 15 budget amendment reduced that request by 140 million with that amount instead shifted into the cevclv effort the goals of project prom etheus also are changing during mr okeefes tenure its goal was developing nuclear electric propulsion nep and advanced radioisotope thermoelectric ge nerators rtgs robotic probe the jupiter icy moons orbiter jimo which was being designed to study three of jupiters moons was to be the first missi on to use these new systems rtgs have been used by nasa since the 1960s to supply power for spacecraft systems and experiments on probes that travel so far from the sun that solar energybased systems are impractical rtgs also can be used for spacecraft that land on surfaces where they will experience night for long periods nasa has not used nuclear propulsion either nep or di fferent type nuclear therma l propulsion ntp in the past although nasa worked on developing ntp in the 1960s and early 1970s initially dr griffin changed the focus of project prometheus to nuclear surface power systems for use on the lunar surface eg and ntp with development of nep third on the priority list jimo was indefinitely deferred in nasas september 30 2005 operating plan update however fu rther cuts to prometheus were announced and jimo was canceled nasa sh ifted prometheus and its remaining 270 million in fy2005 funds from esmd back to the science mission directorate smd from whence it had come management of the program remains with esmd however the operating plan noted that the program was being restructured again because nuclear surface power is not n earterm requirement and the resulting 76 million in savings would be applied to the cevclv program congress cut 200 million from prometheus in the fy2006 appropriations bill that includes nasa pl 109108 how nasa will adjust its plans in light of the congressional action presumably will become clear once the agency submits its initial operating plan for fy2006httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs29 15 the centrifuge and the cam were being

vision speech and president bushs directive that research on the iss be restricted only to that which supports the vision nasa began developing revised re search plan including identification of what must be done on the iss versus us ing groundbased facilitie s dr griffins announcement that he would tap these resear ch funds to help pay for accelerating the cev further affected the plan that wa s followed by nasa decision not to launch large centrifuge and its centrifuge accommodation module15 intended to be the major facility for conducting f undamental biological res earch on the international space station iss the space studies bo ard of the national research council sharply criticized nasas revised iss research plan16 in addition an editorial in the november 25 2005 issue of science publication of the american association for the advancement of science lamented the cutbacks in iss research and cautioned that nasa was cutting the very research needed to ensure the health and safety of astronauts who would some day journey to mars nasas fy2005 operating plan updates do not have budget line item called human systems rt because that line ite m first appears in the fy2006 request in fy2005 these activities were still part of obpr the fy2005 operating plan updates show that activitie s funded under obpr in fy2005 were cut by 106 million leaving 925 million for fy2006 the original request for human systems rt was 807 milli on the july 15 budget amendment shifted 30 million of that into the cevclv effort the september 30 2005 operating plan stated that 34 contracts and activities previously planned for fy2006 under human systems rt would be discontinued resulting in ne t savings after terminati on costs and buyouts of 243 million it further stated that 80 tasks and activities under expl oration systems rt are being discontinued for net saving s in fy2006 of 174 million together these 417 million in cuts to research and technol ogy would be shifted to the cevclv effort added to the 76 million that woul d be cut from project prometheus the total addition to the fy2006 cevclv effort would be 493 million as noted above congress cut 25 million from human systems rt and 25 million from exploration systems rt in the fy2006 appropriations b ill that includes nasa pl 109108 how nasa will adjust its pl ans in light of the congressional action presumably

missions to the moon in support of the vision the lros purpose is to support the vision by providing deta iled maps of the lunar surface and because the former office of space science was experienced in developing such probes it was given management res ponsibility for lro originally conferees on the fy2005 appropriations bill directed that because it was being funded by the office of space science at least 25 of its experiment s should focus on science objectives rather than those associated with the vision in the may 10 operating plan update dr griffin moved the program into esmd pr esumably to make its purpose and focus clearer the fy2005 funding level will not change from the 53 million in the december operating plan congress cu t funding for the lro from 70 million to 10

challeng program as in the senate version of th bill and 200 million from prom etheus congress added 5 million for heavy lift launch vehile what is the space shuttles future the congressional committees that oversee nasa are closely following the agencys efforts to return the space shuttle to flight status following the february 1 2003 columbia tragedy although nasa launched the first of two return to flight missions sts114 discovery on july 26 2005 the agency re grounded the shuttle fleet the next day afte r discovering that largerthanexpected pieces of foam detached from the extern tank during launch similar to what led to the loss of columbia the columbia tragedy sts114 and the return to flight effort are disc ussed in crs report rs21408 nasas space shuttle program the columbia tragedy the discovery mission and the future of the shuttle by marcia s smith nasa is trying to determine why large pieces of foam detach from the external tank and how to mitigate the problem the date for the next shuttle launch is uncertain at the same time there is considerable debate about the shu ttles future in light of president bushs directive that the shuttle in its current form be terminated in 2010 some want the shuttle terminated as soon as possible either because they consider it unsafe or because they want to use the money now devoted to the shuttle program for other aspects of the vision instead others want to keep the shuttle until the cev is operational so that the united states is not dependent on russia for human access to space another option is to define precisely how many more shuttle missions are needed and operate the system until they are completed whenever that occurs fourth alternative articulated by dr griffin after the sts114 mission is to launch each shuttle mission only when nas determines it is ready to fly instead of trying to meet predetermined schedule taking this onelaunchatatimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs31 approach nasa would see how many unches could be co mpleted before 2010 and continue construction of the iss after that if po ssible using other launch vehicles terminating the shuttle in 2010 nasas current target is to launch 18 shuttle missions in support of the iss prog ram plus one possible additional mission to service the hubble space telescope by the end of 2010 nasa will not make final decision about the hubble servicin g mission until after the shuttle completes the second return to flight mission most of the remaining segments of the iss awaiting launch were designed to be launched only on the shuttle the shuttle also is used to take crews back and forth c onstruction of iss has been suspended since the columbia accident nasa and its iss partners have been keeping twoman crews aboard iss using russian spacecraft in the interim before the sts114 launch nasa was ssessing how many shuttle flights would be needed to complete the iss in early 2005 the timate was 28 but dr griffin considered only 18 of those to be needed for iss assembly the other 10 comprise five for logistics taking food wate r equipment etc to the iss and five for utilization conducting research he proposed shifting the logistics flights to other launch vehicles that perhaps could be provided by comme rcial launch service providers and to delay nasa s utilization of the iss as noted above the current plan is for 18 issrelated shuttle missions nasas fy2006 request included budget pr ojections that showed the shuttle budget decreasing significantly beginning in fy2008 see table 5 many were skeptical that nasa could succeed in reducing shuttle budgets while maintaining whatever flight rate is needed the board that investigated the columbia tragedy cited budget constraints as factor table 5 space

nasas december 23 2004 initial operating plan see the fy2005 budget subsection below for additional changes since then during testimony before the hous science committee on november 3 2005 dr griffin acknowledged that the shuttle program will need 35 billion more in fy2008fy2010 than shown in the above projection he is hoping to keep the figure to minimum through synergies he expects to achieve by melding the current shuttle program with the effort to develop shuttlederived launch vehicles see below another factor cited by the columbia investigation board was schedule pressure resulting from the iss assembly schedule at the time thennasa administrator sean okeefe had set completing particular phase of iss constr uction called ushttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs32 17 these two launch vehicles were developed under the department of defenses evolved expendable launch vehicle program and thus are sometimes referred to as the eelvscore complete by february 2004 as prio rity today some worry that setting firm date of 2010 for completing all shu ttle launches is crea ting an environment similar to that prior to columbia the senate version of the nasa author ization bill s 1281 as reported from the senate commerce committee directed nasa not to retire the shuttle until replacement humanrated spacecraft has been demonstrated that provision was modified in the managers amendment adopted by the senate during floor consideration on september 28 2005 as passe d by the senate the bill stated that it is us policy to possess the capability for assured human access to space and directed the nasa administrator to act to ensure that capability and to make several related reports to congress in future years the house version hr 3070 as introduced and approved at the subcommittee level directed that the shuttle not be launched after december 31 2010 however the democratic alte rnative hr 3250 contained language similar to that in the senate bill as reported from committee the compromise version of hr 3070 as re ported from the house science committee hrept 109173 and passed by the house was silent on this issue the final version of the law pl 109155 states th at it is us policy to have human access to space on continuous basis and direct s nasa to submit seve ral related reports to congress shuttlederived launch vehicles president bushs directive that the shuttle be terminated in 2010 refers to the shu ttle in its current form vehicle that takes both crews and cargo into space the concept of developing shuttle derived launch vehicle sdlv or sdv has been discussed for many years the need for launch vehicle for the new cev and heavy lift launch vehicle to support other aspects of the vision r eenergized debate about the sdlv dr griffin is strong advocate of such vehicle and on september 19 2005 announced that he had chosen that appro ach for implementing the vision according to that plan two sdlvs will be developed one for crew the crew launch vehicle and one for cargo the h eavylift launch vehicle the crew launch vehicle clv or gle stick would use one solid rocket booster the shuttle uses two one on each si of the orbiter augmented by new upper stage with the cev on top the heavy lift version would modify the external tank the large cylindrical tank that carries fuel for the orbiters main engines add srbs with cargocarrying spacecraft on top it would be designed to lift approximately 125 tons of cargo to low earth orb it leo several times more than what could be launched with existin g versions of the other two major us launch vehicles tlas v and delta iv17 building sdlv could mitigate some of the workforce displacements that would result from terminating the shuttle program in its current form it also could bring new launch vehicle into the us fl eet at lower cost than developing new vehicle from scratch but pr oponents of the atlas and delta argue that if nasa usedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs33 them for the vision the cost per launch would go down making space launches more affordable for dod and nasa overall the atlas and delta also might be able to be modified to launch heavier payloads dr griffin and dr ronald sega under secretary of the air force signed letter to the director of the white hous office of science and technology policy on august 5 2005 agreeing that nasa will develop the two sdlvs described above one for crew one for cargo dr sega former nasa astronaut is the department of defenses executive agent for space in return nasa agreed that it would use the atlas v and delta iv to launch all of its other spacecraft in the 520 metric ton range including iss cargo resupply missions although new commerciallydeveloped launch vehicles may compete with the atlas v and delta iv if they become available boeing manufactures the delta iv lockheed martin manufactures the atlas v as well as the external tanks for the space shuttle system the srbs are manufactured by atk thiokol the unite d space alliance 5050 joint venture between boeing and lockheed martin is the single prime contractor in charge of most ground operations for the existing space shuttle system boeing and lockheed martin have announced plans to create similar joint venture called united launch alliance to market atlas v and delta iv to government customers another launch vehicle company spacex has filed an antitr ust suit to prevent the joint venture fy2005 budget for fy2005 nasa request ed 43 billion for the space shuttle program compared with 4 billion in fy2004 nasa informed congress in november 2004 that it needed 762 million more in fy2005 for the shuttle program but budget amendment was not submitted congre ss appropriated the requested amount and said that nasa could reprogram funds or submit supplemental request if needed accord ing to nasa briefing charts accompanying its may 10 2005 operating plan update funding was repr ogrammed as follows 55 million from the science mission director ate 20 million from space science 35 million from earth science 3758 million fro m the exploration systems mission directorate 73 million from biological and physical research 204 million from human and robotic technology and 98 million from transportation systems and 3312 million from the space operations mission directorate 160 million from the space station 170 million from

fy2006 science state justice and commer ce appropriations bill hr 2862 pl 109108 funds the shuttle at the requested level the extent to which the continuing efforts to reduce foam loss from the external tank in the wake of the discovery launch and the effects of hurricane katrina on ste nnis space center and the michoud assembly facility described earlier may require an augmentation for the shuttle budget is not clear httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs34 what should be the us strategy for the international space station program nasa began what is now known as the international space station iss program in 1984 canada japan 10 europ ean countries and russia are partners with the united states in building the sp ace station for more information see crs issue brief ib93017 space stations by marcia s smith assembly of the space station was origin ally intended to be completed by 1994 followed by 30 years of operation during whic h wide variety of scientific research would be conducted the results of that research were ex pected to have applications on earth such as new and better pharmaceuticals metal alloys and manufacturing processes the original cost timate was 8 billion in fy1984 dollars twentyone years and appr oximately 35 billion later whether those promises will be met is uncertain under the visi on nasa is to meet its commitments to the other partners finish construction by 2010 and complete its utiliz ation of the iss by fy2017 the other partners could continue to use it beyond that time the president directed that the only resear ch conducted by nasa is that needed to implement the vision not the broadly based program that was planned as discussed earlier nasa has terminated plans to launch centrifuge and its centrifuge accommodation module which wa s to be the primary facility on the iss for conducting fundamental biological research until november 2005 nasa was facing questions bout how nasa astronauts would be able to access the iss after ap ril 2006 because the iran nonproliferation act ins prohibited nasa from paying ru ssia for issrelated goods and services unless the president made determination that russia was not proliferation certain technologies to iran the linkage between the iss and the ina its implications for the future of us access to iss and congressional action are explained in crs report rs22072 the iran nonproliferation act and the international space station issues and options by sharon squassoni and marcia s smith and crs report rs22270 the international space station and the iran nonproliferation act ina the bush administrations proposed ina amendment by marcia s smith and sharon squassoni in november 2005 however congress passed an amendment to the ina which permits nasa to purchas needed goods and services from russia through january 1 2012 it was signed into law on november 22 2005 pl 109 112 thus this issue seems to be resolved for the moment nasa spends about 2 billion year on iss in addition to the costs of the shuttle program some question whether iss is worth that level of investment considering the modest research opportunitie s that remain others consider fulfilling us commitments to the other iss partners to be sufficient rationale for continued us involvement president bush pledged to fulfill us commitment to the iss partners in his vision speech dr griffin has reiterated that pledge how nasa will do that is unclear since the partners anticipated that the space shuttle with its large crew and cargo capacity would be av ailable during the opera tional phase of the iss nasa also was committed to building crew return vehicle crv that would enable the crew size to increase to at least six nasa canceled the crv thenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs35 replaced it with another program called an orbital space plane which then also was canceled dr griffin now plans to velop cev that can be used not only to take crews to and from the moon but as ve hicle to transport crews to and from iss and remain docked to the iss for long periods of time enabling it to serve in crv mode thus the united states once again is planning to build vehicle to fulfill the crv function but the termina tion of the shuttle would still significantly reduce the ability of the iss partners to take cargo to and from the iss another question is what will happen to the iss once nasa discontinues its use of the facility would it be turned ove r to the other partners would it be privatized would it be deorbited if it remains in orb it under someone elses control would the united states have any continuing liability if for example it made an uncontrolled reentry and impacted people or property on the ground or if it collided with another object in space fy2005 budget congress did not specify funding level for the iss in the fy2005 consolidated appropriations act the request was 2412 billion 1863 billion for construction and operations including 140 million in new iss crewcargo services line to pay for alternatives to the shuttle for taking crew and cargo to and from iss and 549 million for res earch included in the request for the office of biological and physical re search nasas december 23 2004 initial operating plan cut 160 million from iss constr uction and operations to help pay for additional costs for returning the space shuttle to flight status funding for research also was cut from the planned 549 million to 382 million per the december operating plan fy2005 funding for iss cr ewcargo services was identified as 98 million and nasa took 85 million of that to begin paying for damages from hurricane katrina nasa hopes to repay this account from funds made available through an emergency supplemental appropr iations request as noted earlier the reallocation request s ubmitted to congress on october 28 2005 included 3248 million for nasa out of total of 760 milli on that the agency estimated would be needed for hurricane recove ry congress increased that amount to 350 million in the fy2006 dod appropriations act pl 109149 to which the hurricane f unds were attached how much of the 350 million will be used to repay the iss crewcargo line is unclear fy2006 budget request and congressional action the original fy2006 iss request was 1857 billion for c onstruction and operations including 160 million for iss crewcargo services plus 324 million for iss research dr griffin indicated in the may 10 2005 update to the fy2005 operating plan that the iss crewcargo services activity and ssociated fy2005 funding is being moved to the exploration systems mission dir ectorate esmd the july 15 budget amendment similarly moves the fy2006 i ss crewcargo funding into esmd reducing the request for iss constructi on and operations commensurately the budget amendment identifies the fy2006 request for iss crewcargo services as 168 milli on rather than 160 million as shown in earlier nasa fy2006 budget briefing charts thus the revised fy2006 request for iss cons truction and operations is 1689 billion in the fy2006 ssjc appropriations b ill hr 2862 the house cut 10 million from iss construction and operations and 10 million from iss crewcargo serviceshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs36 program the senate cut all 160 million from iss crewcargo services b ecause nasa did not spend any of the 98 milli on provided for fy2005 as noted above nasa allocated 85 million of that funding to pay for damage from hurricane katrina the final version of the bill pl109108 cuts th iss program by 80 million 60 million of which is from the i ss crewcargo services line that would make the final budget 1777 billion us ing the original budget request 1857 billion minus 80 million or 1669 b illion under the amended budget 1689 billion minus 20 million added to that is the funding for iss research according to nasa the amount it plans to spend on iss research in fy2006 has declined from 324 million to 306 million added to the 1669 billion that would make the fy2006 iss budget 1975 billion the 2005 nasa authorization act pl 109 155 requires nasa to allocate 15 of the funds budgeted for iss research to research that is not directly related to supporting the vision the fy20002002 nasa authorization act pl 106391 imposed cost cap on the iss program see crs issue brief ib93017 space stations by marcia s smith for details under the 2005 nasa authorization act nasa must submit report to congress on how certain factors affected iss development costs and the cap is repealed 30 days thereafter should the hubble space telescope be serviced nasa launched the hubble space telescope in 1990 from the beginning hubble was designed to be serviced regularly by astronauts that design proved fortuitous when it was discovered that hubble had defective mirror that produced blurry images astronauts on the first serv icing mission in 1993 were able to install corrective optics allowing years of scientific accomplishments and generating widespread scientific nd public support additiona l servicing missions were conducted in 1997 1999 and 2002 to replace ag ing hardware and install advanced scientific instruments two more s huttle missions to hubble were scheduled another servicing mission in 2004 known as sm4 and retrieval mission to bring the telescope back to earth in 2010 in the wake of the columbia tragedy however thennasa administrator sean okeefe decided in january 2004 not to proceed with either flight his stated reason was the safety of the shuttle astronauts but many critics perceived connection with the new priorities of the vision for space exploration announced just days before the decision to cancel sm4 brought pr aise from some but also considerable congressional and public opposition the opposition initially focused on efforts to reverse mr okeefes decision and proceed with shuttle mission attention soon shifted to robotic options which dominated the public discussion of hubbles future throughout most of 2004 in march 2004 mr okeefe agreed to ask the national research council nrc to study options fo r extending hubbles life including both shuttle and robotic missions in dece mber 2004 the final nrc report surprised many by finding it unlikely that nasa will be able to extend the science life of hubble through

own propulsion system and would make an uncontrolle d reentry if propulsion module is not attached to the spacecraft an uncontrolled reentry would put people and property under hubbles orbit at risk of damage from falling debris nasa initially estimated that if hubble were left unattended it would make an uncontrolled reentry in about 2012 that date has been extended to at least 2021 by additional nasa analysis that was first reported in august 2005 mr okeefe stood by his decision not to proceed with shuttle servicing mission and by early 2005 nasas work on robotic mission to hubble was focused on deorbiting it rather than servicing it the confirmation of michael griffin as nasa administrator in april 2005 breathed new life into efforts to service hubble at his senate c onfirmation hearing on april 12 2005 dr griffin stated that while he considered robotic servicing infeasible and would like to take the robotic mission off the plate he planned to revisit the shuttle servicing option after the shuttle returns to flight after two succe ssful shuttle flights nasa would be able to reassess the risks associated with what dr griffin consider s essentially new vehicle the 2005 nasa authorization act pl 109155 section 303 calls for shuttle servicing mission after the shuttle re turns to flight successfully unless such mission would compromise astronaut safety it also requires status report on servicing plans within 60 days of the nding of the second successful rtf flight prospects for servicing hubble became more uncertain when nasa grounded the shuttle fleet again after problems w ith the first rtf launch on july 26 2005 issues remain about the prospect of serv icing hubble including the costs of the servicing mission and costs associated w ith operating the tele scope longer than expected cost estimates for hubble rvicing mission vary widely depending partly on what the mission would include and partly on how one treats the costs of the shuttle launch before the columbia tragedy hubble servicing missions were estimated to cost about 100 million each not in cluding the marginal cost of shuttle launch according to gao report in november 2004 nasa then estimated the full cost including all shuttle costs at between 17 billion and 24 billion gao considered this estimate not yet definitive19 plans for deorbiting hubble also remain an issue as noted above before the columbia tragedy hubble was to be returned to earth by the space shuttle at the end of its lifetime nasa longer plans to do this and since hubble has propulsion system of its own propulsion module must be attached to the spacecraft to permit controlled deorbit remotely attaching the required new hardware is technologically challenging however if there is shuttle servicing mission deorbit module could be attached at that time but on august 31 2005 nasa terminated work on such module ne w analysis indicates that hubble will nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32988crs38 reenter the atmosphere until at least 2021 and nasa expects new capabilities to be available by then boosting hubbles orb it during shuttle servicing mission could delay the date of reentry even further but at some point deor biting will be necessary if an uncontrolled reentry is to be avoi ded for more on the hubble space telescope see crs report rs21767 hubble space telescope should nasa proceed with shuttle servicing mission by daniel morgan fy2005 budget the fy2005 budget was released shortly after mr okeefes first announcement that the shuttle would not fly to hubble at that time nasa intended to cancel the 2004 servicing mission entirely and was only in the earliest stages of studying the possibility of robotic deorbiting for this reason the potential costs of servicing and deorbiting were not in cluded in the fy2005 request most of the 1301 million requested for hubbl was for data analysis the fy2005 appropriations conference agreement was written before the release of the nrc report at time when the debate was focused on the r obotic option it designated 291 million for development of hubble rvicing mission but it did not specify where nasa should make the offsetting reductions nasas initial operating plan for fy 2005 released after the nrc report but before the appointment of administr ator griffin reflected 175 million for development of hubble servic ing and deorbiting missions w ith the remainder of the 291 million to be determined after sign review in march 2005 the may 2005 update to the operating plan released afte r dr griffins announcement that shuttle

conf erence with administrator michael griffin april 18 2005 onlin at httpwwwnasagovpdf 113096main_mg_ presscon_041805pdfwhat is the future of nasas aeronautics program aeronautics rd has long history of government involvement starting in 1915 with the creation of the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca nasa was established in 1958 using naca as its nucleus and nacas research centers were transferred to th new agency although nasa is better known for its space programs supporters note that aeronautics is the first in nasa for several years however aeronautic s advocates have failed to halt multiyear slide in funding nasas budget for aeronautics was cut by about onethird in the late 1990s with the termin ation of programs in highspeed research and advanced subsonic technology in 2003 nasas move to fullcost accounting heightened funding concerns because res earch facilities such as wind tunnels play an especially large role in the aeronautics program20 in 2004 when the president announced the vision for sp ace exploration many foresaw that new spending priorities would increase the pressure on aeronautics further the fy2006 budget request confirmed that expectation according to administrator griffin the nation makes available to us within nasa certain amount of money the fact is that in the presidents program going forward aerona utics is not as high priority as space exploration21 new directions for aeronautics at nasa the fy2006 budget request proposed to transform the largest element of the aeronautics program vehicle systems funding for vehicle systems would be reduced by 27 relative to fy2005 there would be more emphasis on barrierbreaking demonstrations and resources would be focused on smaller num ber of research areas nasa described this new approach as pilot for tran sforming the entire aeronautics research mission directorate the restructured program would have consisted of four projects two on noise reduction one on emissions reduction and one on unpiloted research aircraft the topics eliminated would have included hypersonics rotorcraft and ultraefficient engine technology ll of which have r eceived congressional funding increases in past appropriations cycles as well as most evolutionary incremental improvements to subsonic aeronautics the proposed elimination of several entire research areas was controversial especially in the context of substantial c ontinuing reductions in total funding for the program the house appropriations committee report on hr 2862 hrept 109 118 called for nasa to continue work on hy personics and rotorcraft and expressed the view that transforming the aeronautics program was premature in light of may 2005 report by the national institute of aerospace and

directorate dr porter is seen as the driving force behind yet another reshaping of nasas plans for aeronautics which the september operating plan describes as consistent with direction received from our co mmittees the new plans will after all include core competencies in subsonic supersonic and hypersonic flight as well as rotorcraft among other changes the vehicle systems program will be rena med fundamental aeronautics to reflect its new character although there was formal amendmen t of the fy 2006 budget request the new plans appear to supersede th transformation initially pr oposed

establish initiatives in supersonic civil transport and rotorcraft and program of hypersonics research impact on nasa workforce and facilities an especially controversial consequence of the proposed funding reducti ons is reduction in staffing levels at nasa centers according to nasa fy 2006 briefing charts the reduction in aeronautics funding proposed in the fy2006 request would mean the elimination of 1100 civil service jobs at the centers by fy2007 smaller number of onsite contractor positions would also be eliminated most of the affected positions would be at langley research center in hamp ton va and glenn research center in cleveland oh but dryden flight resear ch center in edwards ca and ames research center in mountain view ca w ould also be affecte d some aeronautics research facilities at these centers would likely be closed as well but the affected facilities have not yet been identified aeronautics s upporters and leaders in the affected communities have expressed alarm at the consequences of these changes both for aeronautics itself and for the local economies surrounding the centers since taking over as nasa administrator in april 2005 dr griffin has sought to downplay the cuts at the centers he and other nasa officials insist that the goal is to transform centers not to close them and to ensure that the nasa workforce has the mix of skills

from nasas aeronautics program would other federal agencies or the us private sector conduct the research that is needed in these areas leading justification for federal aeronautics funding has been the economic importance of the us aircraft industry supporters often cite increases in european funding for aeronautics rd as threat to us competitiveness the highrisk highpayoff approach proposed in the fy2006 budget request would shift the programs value to industry towards longerterm needs some believe that this is appropriate and that industry should be responsible for its own shortterm rd but others argue that aeronautics requires unique national facilities and worldclass researchers that are not resident in any one company and that the fruits of this research add to the nations wealth not just to that of any individual company23 in the past nasa has also stated that it plays key role in increasing the performance of milita ry aircraft24 the fy2006 budget documents do not mention this goal lthough the september 30 update to the fy2005 operating plan does the air force the navy and darpa have aeronautics rd programs par ticularly in the area of hypersonics these defense department programs tend to focus on specific military missions such as rapid long range strike so they may not address all aspects of the field on the other hand much of their work has long enough time horizon that it can be applied quite generally concern that has not yet been resolved is how defense department and industrial users of nasa aer onautics facilities such as highspeed wind tunnels would be affected by possible facility closures the 2005 nas authorization act pl109155 calls for an independent re view of nasa test facilities and would prohibit closures until completion of that review

transcript from federal docu ment clearing house via factivadr griffin however has repeatedly stated that he will not take funds from science or aeronautics to pay for the vision see earlier discussion under should nasa be single mission agency implementing the vision for space exploration smd programs are feeling budget strains however they are caused primarily by cost growth in programs within the smd such as the james webb space telescope and the need to pa for congressionallydirected activities such as preserving the option to send shuttle mission to service the hubble space telescope generally speaking cost growth in one smd theme eg the universe must be covered by cutting other activities within that theme for example in order to pay for preserving the hubble servicing option and to pay for cost growth in the webb telescope funding for future sp ace telescopes was cut eg the terrestrial planet finder also although dr griffin has said that he would not take money from science to pay for the vision that does not means that money may not be redirected from science to other agency priorities for example in fy2005 55 million was reallocated from space science programs to pay some of the costs associated with returning the space shuttle to flight status among the cuts considered by nasa is terminating some of its older space science probes even though they are still retu rning useful data considerable concern was expressed in the space science community at the prospect of turning off two older probes in particular voyager 1 nd voyager 2 launched in 1977 voyager 1 has just reached the outer edge of the solar system and voyager 2 is to do so in few years nasa expects to be able to continue to receive data from the probes through 2020 when their power sources are expected to become too weak to send signals back to earth nasa explains that ther are total of 13 probes in the earthsun system theme that have fa r exceeded their design life times and are being considered for termination in order to save the 496 million requested in the fy2006 budget to continue operating them the portion of th at total for the two voyager probes is 42 million dr

activities appeared under the budget heading acade mic programs nasa reorganized its education activities in 2003 cons olidating programs that had been in its office of human resources education and the offi ce of equal opportunity programs into new office of education that office was abolished in the august 2004 reorganization however now chief education officer oversees these activities according to nasas current organizationa l structure the chief education officer reports to the chief of strategic comm unications in addition to the funding identified in the budget under education programs other nasa programs in the various mission directorates also fund educational activities these are not separately identified in nasas budget jus tification documents and therefore are not

which funds research education and public serv ice projects through universitybased space grant consortia is administered through this office the space grant program httpcalspaceucsdeduspacegrant was established by congress in nasas fy1988 authorization bill pl 100147 it funds space grant consortia in all 50 states the district of columbia and puerto rico to broaden the base of universities and individuals contributing to and benefitting from aerospace science and technology programs devoted to minority education the minority university research and education program murep focus on ex panding participati on of historically minoritydominant universities in nasa research efforts these programs develop opportunities for partic ipation by researchers and st udents from those institutions in nasa activities the objective is to expand nasas research base through continued investment in nority institutions research and academic infrastructure to contribute to the science

one of several federal agencies that participate in the epscor program among the others are the national science foundation36 the national institutes of health the department of defense and the department of energy for fy2006 nasa requested 1669 million for education programs compared to fy2005 appropriation of 2167 million per the initial operating plan the difference between the reque st and the fy2005 appr opriation is primarily due to congressionally directed funding for which nasa did not request funds in fy2006 the specific amounts for epscor and the space grant program are not provided in nasas budget justification document the senate appropriations committee specified that within the funds for education 12 million be for epscor 2955 million for the space grant program and 54233 million for other educationrelated activ ities in the final version of the bill conferees added 122 million for space grant for total of 302 million and added 82 million for epscor for total of
