01 apr 1999 124601 0100 dear tgciaers i have two questions to raise with you regarding the ipcc data distribution centre the first one concerns advice regarding gcm submission to the ddc and the second concerns mirror web sites for the ddc 1 gcm submission the lmd through herve treut has requested the runs from lmd coupled gcm be lodged with the ddc his original request july 1998 is appended below as text attachment 1 we originally rejected the submission on the grounds that the runs were not historically forced ie they were coldstart experiments with 1 pa forcing being introduced from current baseline and different to all other ddc runs however lmd have resubmitted their request for reasons outlined in attachment 2 which is an email from my ddc comanager michael lautenschlager dated 12 february 1999 in this attachment michael makes proposal to include the lmd model runs but as related modelling results rather than as full status ddc results we need to take tgcia soundings on this strictly the lmd runs do not qualify according to the criteria the tgcia established back in may 1997 the question is how flexible are we prepared to be and whether including model runs with different experimental design may either confuse impacts users andor b invalidate intermodel comparisons bear in mind also that ifwhen new gcm results forced by sres forcings are generated this summer and beyond we will need to consult again about how the ddc handlespresents these new sres runs at present the ddc does not have mandate for these either please would you submit your opinions to by monday 12 april i will then compile the views expressed and make recommendation 2 ddc mirror web sites with the ddc web site now fully operational and the cdrom about to be released we need to consider our idea for mirror sites around the world users are picking up data and information from both the yellow pages full gcm archive site and green pages synthesised gcm results observed data and other scenario data and visualisation but for some usersregionsoperations access is very slow proposed mirror sites might include csiro victoria iit delhi ncar usa and cape town safrica maybe japanese site also the mirror sites could consist only of the green pages about 05gb requirement or both green and yellow pages several gb requirement but i have not checked exactly how much with dkrz i know that we can arrange for the mirror sites to automatically refresh every 24 hours therefore reflecting perfectly any developments on the host mothersite ie the mirror sites must be perfect mirrors could i also ask for your views on the desirability of these options whether green only or green plus yellow how many mirrors and where they should be please let have your views on this also by monday 12 april in considering both these questions it is perhaps worth thinking about the longerterm future of the ddc beyond tar and into 4th ipcc assessment although tgcia and the ddc has now only mandate through the lifetime of tar for us to really learn from our experiences and to achieve full benefits for ipcc then we need to be thinking ahead beyond year 2000 mike hulme ____________________________________________________________________________ ___ attachment 1 ____________________________________________________________________________ ___ subject from herveletreutlmdjussieufr at internet date 9798 908 pm dear maria at the ipcc meeting week ago i spoke with m hulme concerming the possibility of having our simulations being integrated in the ipcc data base dda i think that our simulations meet number of the criteria the control simulation is 200 years long the model has participated to cimp1 and cmip2 it is described in details description posted on the web in the euroclivar web site httpwwwknminleuroclivar our main problem concerns the definition of the experiments we have used model without flux correction and have decided to start from observed levitus data the coupled model has some drift but it stabilizes rather quickly and the thermohaline circulation is quite stable accordingly our initial co2 value corresponds to recent past 320 ppm from that value we have increased directly the co2 concentration of 1 percent per year we have therefore not allowed for an historic increase of the co2 before the actual 1percent increase which is due to lack of understanding of the ipcc rules my feeling is that scientifically this is not too important we have cold start symptom when we look at the difference between the perturbed and controled run i have realized that in the context of the ipcc however people may think otherwise my question is twofold can our experiment nevertheless be integrated in the ipcc data base this is important to us if it cannot we will not realize the sulfate experiment we had planned to do and wait for the future scenarios to be decided i hope that i will be more easily aware of the ipcc initiatives in the future but is there any procedure through which we can make sure in advance that given experiment we decide to carry out does get approoved by the ipcc sincerely yours herve

________________________________________________________________ hamburg den 12 february 1999 1500 dear maria and mike last week i have discussion with herve letreut from lmd in paris about the ddc rejection of the french contribution to the climate scenario calculations he informed that the climate modellers are running into political difficulties because french data are contained in the ddc we have rejected the data last year because they design of his experiments are not directly comparable to the ddc requirements recalculation is not possible within short term in order to prevent the french colleagues from difficulties i suggest to install an additional section in our ddc page which may be entitled ddc related modelling results in this section herves data as well as data from other groups can be disseminated the processing priority is certainly lower than for the direct ddc data do you agree with my suggestion best regards michael dr mike hulme reader in climatology tel 44
