attorneys american law division summary justice oconnor has joined the majority of the court on many important decisions which resulted in limits on federal power in majority opinions regarding the tenth amendment sovereign immunity and the power of congress under the 14th amendment she has emphasized the dictates of the founding fathers and noted the policies underlying federalism such as the promotion of state accountability during the 1990s the supreme court issued series of 54 opinions regarding federalism and the limits of federal power these cases dealt with issues such as the tenth amendment the commerce clause s overeign immunity and 5 of the 14th amendment justice oconnor was in the majority in mo st of these cases an d wrote significant opinions in several of them1 when justice oconnor was in dissent such as when the court considered congress spending clause power it was generally to advocate for more limited federal role prior to her service on the c ourt justice oconnor served as state assistant attorney general state legislator state trial court judge and state appellate judge these experiences appear to ve given her high degree of trust in state governments and courts2 the tenth amendment the tenth amendment provides that power s not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the stat are reserved to th states respectively or to the people prior to justice oconnors service on the court the court had decided in national league of cities v usery 3 that the tenth amendment and aspects of

of c ities test for integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions had proven impractical and that the c ourt in 1976 had tried to repair what did not need repair 5 justice oconnor noted that the powers dele gated to the united states were few and definedand that the true essence of federalism is that the states as states have legitimate interests which the national government is bound to respect even though its laws are supreme id at 582 j connor dissenting 6 456 us 742 1982 7 in ferc state energy regulatory authorities were required under the public utilities regulatory

1992sovereignty limited the application of generally applicable federal laws to certain core state activities ten years later however in 54 decision the court overruled national league of cities in garcia v san antonio metropolitan transit authority4 justice oconnor authored dissent in that case in which she emphasized the founding fathers preference for two levels of govern ance with independent sovereignty5 over time the court turned to the different question of whether the tenth amendment limits the federal government from using the machinery of the state government to regulate state citizens in dissent in ferc v mississippi6 which predated garcia justice oconnor first raised th suggestion that congress could not compel states to undertake certain legislative or administrative actions7 she argued that this power was not contemplated by the founding fathers8 nor was it consistent with the policy principles underlying federalism9 these same themes were evident when justice oconnor authored her majority opinion in new york v united states10 in new york the congress provided that states must develop legislation on disposal of privately held lowlevel radioactive waste generated within the state or the state would be forced to take title to such waste which would mean that it would become the states responsibility to dispose of it the court found that although congress had the authority under the commerce clause to re gulate lowlevel ra dioactive waste it only had the power to regulate the waste directly here in effect congress had sought to commandeer the legislative process of the states justice oconnors opinion which comma nded 63 majority found that this power was not found in the text or structure of the constitution and thus the statute was violation of the tenth amendment she emphasized that the founding fathers had specifically contemplated that congress would exercise legislative authority directly uponhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22199crs3 11 505 us at 164 12 id at 168 13 521 us 898 1997 14 id at 90510 15 134 us 1 1890 16 517 us 44 1996 17 section 1 of the fourteenth amendment provides that states shall not deprive citizens of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deprive them of equal protection of the laws while 5 provides that the congress has the power to legislate to enforce the amendment 18 see katzenbach v morgan 384 us 641 1966c ourt would approve legislation if congress had established rational basis that legislation wa s necessary to protect fourteenth amendment right oregon v mitchell 400 us 112 1970rejected ability of congress to extend the substantive content of 14th amendment rights individuals without employing th states as intermediaries11 she further emphasized the inherent wisdom of this which is that to do otherwise would frustrate democratic accountability as voters would hold state acc ountable for regulation mandated by the federal government12 the doctrine established in new york was extended in the case of printz v united states13 printz considered the constitu tionality of the brady ndgun act which required state and local lawenforcement officers to conduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers justice oconnor did not author the 54 opinion but she joined the majority opinion which built on the themes found in new york this time the court struck down these provisions on the basis th at congress was attempting to commandeer state executive branch officials to implement federal program while printz reiterated arguments regarding the intent of the foundi ng fathers and the nature of federalist system it also relied heavily on the absence of historical examples of congress imposing such requirements on states14 sovereign immunity and the fourteenth amendment the eleventh amendment reads as follows the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to ex tend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state in hans v louisiana 15 however the court provided for an interpre tation of the amendment which barred all suits by citizens against state unless congress had abrogated state sovereign immunity in seminole tribe of florida v florida16 54 decision justice oconnor joined the majority opinion which held that the article i powers such as the commerce clause could not be used to waive states sovereign imm unity the court did indicate however that congress can abrogate state sovereig nty under the fourteenth amendment17 thus leading litigants to try to establish fourteenth amendment basis for federal legislation the scope of congress power under 5 of the fourteenth amendment however has been in

lowered the sta ndard used to evaluate whether law of general applicability coul d be applied to the free exer cise of religion rfra was an attempt by the congress to overturn the smith case and to require showing of compelling governmental interest in these cases in flores the court struck down rfra finding that legislation enacted under 5 of the fourteenth amendment must be congruent and proportional remedy to pattern and history of constitutional violations21 an important part of this analysis requires discerning whether there was history and pattern of unc onstitutional discriminati on and whether legislation would alleviate the problem this decision soon led to series of cases regarding what hist orical factors should be considered in evaluating congresss 5 authority22 in kimel v florida board of regents23 justice oconnor authored an opinion striking down the application of age discrimination laws to the states in kimel the court held that age is not suspect class and that the provisions of the adea far surp assed the kind of protections that would be afforded such class under the fourteen th amendment further as most age discrimination does not rise to the level of constitutiona l violation the court found evidence of pattern of state governments discriminating against employees on the basis of age consequently the court held that state could not be liable for damages under the adea commerce power from 1937 to 1995 the supreme court did not hold congressional statute to be beyond the scope of the authority vested in congress by the commerce clause24 since 1995 however the court has decided thr ee major cases impacting congresss power under the commerce clause25 in both united states v lopez 1995 and united states v morrison 2000 the court invalidated acts of congress for exceeding the scope of the commerce clause nevertheless in gonzales v raich 2005 the court upheld the federal controlled substances act as legitimate exercise of congresss power

marijuana by todd b tatelman 33 id at 2224 oconnor j dissenting stating that even if intrastate cultivation and possession of marijuana for ones own medicinal use can properly be characterized as economic and i question whether it can it has not been s hown that such activity substantially affects continuedplaces her squarely on the side of limiting cong resss authority with respect to commerce and thus protecting the preroga tives of the several states in lopez the court struck down the gunfree school zones act which made it federal crime to knowingly possess firearm in school zone26 the court held that because the act neither regulated commercial activity nor contained requirement that the possession of the firearm was connected to interstate commerce the act exceeded congresss authority under the commerce clause27 while justice oconnor did not author an opinion in this case she did join concurring opinion written by justice anthony kennedy justice kennedys concurre nce relying in part on justice oconnors majority opinion in new york v united states 28 stressed the notion that under federalist system of government there are required to be discrete lines of political accountability one between citizens and th federal government the s econd between the citizens and the states29 in addition the opinion notes that wh congress legislates in areas that have traditionally been reserved for the st ates the boundaries between the spheres of federal and state authority would blur and political responsibility would become illusory30 finally the opinion emphasizes that existing state authority was already sufficient to have enacted similar measures and noted that the effect of federal statute forecloses the states from experimenting and exercising their own judgment in an area to which states lay claim by righ t of history and expertise 31 in united states v morrison the court with justice oconnor joining the majoritys opinion again struck down federal statute the violence against women act on the grounds that the legislations creation of pr ivate right of action against perpetrators of such crimes exceeded congresss author ity under the commerce clause in gonzales v raich however which dealt with conflict between californias compassionate use act and the federal controlled subs tances act csa the cour t upheld the federal statute reasoning that congress had rational basis for its conclusion that leaving homeconsumed marijuana outsi federal control would s ubstantially affect conditions in the interstate market32 in raich justice oconnor authored dissenting opinion focusing primarily on the lack of evidence indicating that users of medicinal marijuana have discernable or significant effect on th interstate market that congress sought to regulate33 moreover justice oconnor consis tent with her majority opinion in new yorkhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22199crs6 33 continued interstate commerce 34 id at 2229 oconnor j dissenting stating that this overreaching stifles an express choice by some states concerned for the lives and liberties of their people to regulate medical marijuana differently 35 see south dakota v dole 483 us 203 20712 1987 36 see id the court held that the condition must advance the general welfare be unambiguous be related to the federal interest for which the funds are expended must not induce the states to engage in unconstitutional activities must not be so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion and the stat must remain free to reject the funds see id at 20712 37 id at 21213 oconnor j dissenting 38 id at 216 oconnor j dissenting 39 see id at 218 oconnor j dissenting rather than condition determining how federal highway money shall be expended it is regula tion determining who shall be able to drink liquor as such it is not justified by the spending powerand justice kennedys concurring opinion in lopez emphasized the importance of federalisms notion of joint sovereignty justice oconnor argued that by affirming this type of overreaching by congress the c ourt was depriving the states of their ability to make their own independent political judgments with respect to the validity of medicinal marijuana laws34 spending power the court has repeatedly held that congress via its spending power has the ability to condition the receipt of federal funds upon compliance by the states with federal statutory and administrative directives35 the court most extensively in south dakota v dole has set forth standards regarding cong resss discretion over the attachment of grant conditions36 to date it appears that federalism restraints f ound with respect to other federal powers have not been applied to spending conditions while justice oconnor has played major role with respect to the development of federalism constraints on congresss power her writings with respect to the spending clause have been limited to her dissenting opinion in dole in dole the issue before the court was the constitutionality of congresss conditioning of federal highwa funds on the states adoption of minimum drinking age of 21 the court in an opinion by chie f justice rehnquist upheld the condition as valid use of congresss spending power37 justice oconnor distinguished between permissible and impermissible conditions on fe deral funds arguing that congress has power to impose requirements on grant that goes beyond specifying how the money should be spent38 thus justice oconnor concluded that the 21year minimum drinking age was not condition on how the states c ould spend the money but rather who is eligible to purchase and consume liquor39
