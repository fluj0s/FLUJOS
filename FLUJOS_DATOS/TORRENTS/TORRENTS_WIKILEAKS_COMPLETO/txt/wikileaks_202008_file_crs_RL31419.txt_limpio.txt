prescription drugs summary the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 added new voluntary prescription drug benefit under new medicare part d effective january 1 2006 most categories of outpatient drugs used by medicare beneficiaries are covered under the new part d however there are certain categories of outpatient drugs listed in the medicare statute that have traditionally been paid for under medicare part b these drugs continue to be paid under part b these include immunosuppressive drugs following transplant paid for by medicare certain oral cancer drugs erythropoietin epo for persons with chronic renal failure who are on dialysis drugs which are not selfadministered that are administered incident to physicians professional service and drugs necessary for the effective use of covered durable medical equipment as is the case for most other part b services medicare pays 80 of the recognized amount while the beneficiary is liable for the remaining 20 known as coinsurance beginning in 1998 the amount payable was set at 95 of the average wholesale price awp this limit was intended to place some control on medicare payments however many observers contended that the payment system failed to meet this objective they stated that in many cases medicare paid substantially in excess of the acquisition price for the drug further the program was paying more than most other large purchasers there was widespread agreement that the payment system needed to be reformed mma revised the way the program pays for part b drugs beginning in 2005 payments for these drugs are based on an average sales price asp payment methodology which sets payments at the weighted average asp plus 6 the secretary has the authority to reduce the asp payment amount if the widely available market price is significantly below the asp alternatively beginning in 2006 drugs can be provided through newly established competitive acquisition program cap in addition mma increased the payments for physician practice expenses associated with the administration of covered drugs some observers have expressed the concern that payments under the asp methodology may not fully cover physicians costs of acquiring the drugs however several recent reports suggest that physicians can obtain the majority of part b drugs for less than the medicare payment amount the startup date of the cap program was delayed from january 1 2006 to july 1 2006 observers have noted that despite the fact that the law requires at least two vendors for each competition area only one vendor is participating during the initial phase this vendor is serving the entire country number of observers have also questioned how many physicians will elect to sign up for the program and meet its requirements as of this writing data is not available on the number of physicians who have signed up therefore it is too early to gauge the potential impact this report

medicare payments for covered part b prescription drugs introduction the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 mma pl 108173 added new voluntary prescription drug benefit under new medicare part d effective january 1 2006 most categories of outpatient drugs used by medicare beneficiaries are covered under the new part d however there are certain categories of outpatient drugs listed in the medicare statute that have traditionally been paid for under medicare part b they continue to be paid under part b mma revised the way the program pays for part b drugs beginning in 2005 payments for these drugs are based on an average sales price asp payment methodology the secretary has the authority to reduce the asp payment amount if the widely available market price is significantly below the asp alternatively beginning in 2006 drugs can be provided through newly established competitive acquisition program cap part b drugs covered drugs medicare part the hospital insurance program and medicare part b the supplementary insurance program cover prescription drugs under certain circumstances medicare part covers drugs provided in connection with an inpatient stay in hospital or skilled nursing facility medicares payment to the facility for the inpatient stay covers these costs medicare part b covers drugs provided in connection with outpatient hospital services in general the costs for these drugs are packaged with the payment rate for the primary procedure or treatment in certain cases the drugs are paid for separately medicare part b also covers the following categories of drugs drugs furnished incident to physicians services this category includes drugs or biologicals that are not usually selfadministered by the patient and are administered incident to physicians crs2 service1 this means that coverage is generally limited to drugs or biologicals administered by injection however if the injection is generally selfadministered eg insulin it is not covered immunosuppressive drugs drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclosporin following discharge from hospital for medicarecovered organ transplant2 erythropoietin epo epo for the treatment of anemia for persons with endstage renal disease esrd who are on dialysis coverage is available regardless of whether the drug is administered by the patient or the patients caregiver oral anticancer drugs drugs taken orally during cancer chemotherapy provided they have the same active ingredients and are used for the same indications as chemotherapy drugs which would be covered if they were not selfadministered and were administered as incident to physicians professional service also included are oral antinausea drugs used as part of an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen oral antiemetic drugs administered with particular chemotherapy treatment must be initiated within two hours of the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent and may be continued for period not to exceed 48 hours from that time hemophilia clotting factors hemophilia clotting factors for hemophilia patients competent to use such factors to control bleeding without medical supervision and items related to the administration of such factors antigens reasonable supply of antigens that have been prepared for particular patient if the antigens are prepared by physician and the physician who prepared the antigens has examined the patient and has determined plan of treatment and dosage regimen antigens must be administered in accordance with the plan of treatment and by doctor or by properly instructed person who could be the patient under the supervision of the doctor intravenous immunoglobulin ivig ivig is an approved pooled plasma derivative for the treatment of primary immune deficiency disease it is covered when the patient has diagnosed primary immune deficiency disease it is administered in the home of the patient and the physician determines that administration of the derivative in the patients home is medically appropriate items or 1 medicare has always covered prescription drugs that cannot be selfadministered in 2000 congress changed the statutory standard from drugs that cannot be selfadministered to those that are not usually selfadministered by the patient in may 2002 cms issued program memorandum clarifying how the provision should be implemented under the criteria usually is defined as more than 50 of the time for all medicare beneficiaries using the drug 2 coverage for immunosuppressive drugs continues only if the individual continues to be eligible for medicare persons under age 65 whose medicare eligibility was based solely on the fact that they had endstage renal disease lose their medicare eligibility and therefore the drug coverage three years after successful kidney transplant crs3 services related to the administration of the derivative are not covered the program also pays for supplies that are necessary for the effective use of durable medical equipment such supplies include those drugs and biologicals that must be put directly into the equipment in order to achieve the therapeutic benefit of the durable medical equipment or to assure the proper functioning of the equipment eg tumor chemotherapy agents used with an infusion pump or heparin used with home dialysis system medicare also covers the following immunizations pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine the vaccine and its administration for coverage purposes medicare does not require that doctor of medicine or osteopathy order the vaccine therefore the beneficiary may receive the vaccine upon request without physicians order and without physician supervision hepatitis b vaccine the vaccine and its administration to beneficiary who is at high or intermediate risk of contracting hepatitis b influenza virus vaccine the vaccine and its administration when furnished in compliance with any applicable state law the beneficiary may receive the vaccine upon request without physicians order and without physician supervision most categories of outpatient prescription drugs not covered under medicare part b may be covered under the new medicare part d program provided the beneficiary is enrolled in that program spending for part b drugs mma changes to the calculation of payments for part b drugs have apparently stemmed the rapid increase in payments under this category the office of the inspector general oig in the department of health and human services hhs reported that expenditures for part b drugs totaled more than 9 billion in 2005 it noted that while the program covered more than 500 drug procedure codes the majority of spending was concentrated on relatively small subset of codes3 previously the medicare payment advisory commission medpac estimated that medicare spent approximately 1034 billion in 2003 on part b drugs 22 increase over 2002 these numbers did not include drugs provided through outpatient departments of hospitals or to end stage renal disease patients in dialysis facilities in 2003 an estimated 28 billion was billed by freestanding dialysis facilities 3 hhs office of the inspector general comparison of average sales prices to widely available market prices fourth quarter 2005 oei030500430 june 2006 crs4 medpac reported that medicare part b paid for approximately 450 drugs however the top 10 drugs accounted for 56 of the spending in 2003 new drugs were replacing older ones of the top 10 drugs four were approved by the food and drug administration in 1996 or later additionally spending on injectables too new to have received their own payment codes accounted for 4 of part b drug spending further 13 of the top 20 drugs treated cancer or the side effects associated with chemotherapy4 part b payment rules as is the case for most other part b services medicare pays 80 of the recognized amount for covered drugs while the beneficiary is liable for the remaining 20 known as coinsurance balance billing above the recognized amount is permitted under the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 the amount payable was set at 95 of the average wholesale price awp this provision was intended to place some control on medicare payments however many observers contended that the payment system failed to meet this objective they stated that in many cases medicare paid substantially in excess of the acquisition price for the drug further the program was paying more than most other large purchasers there was widespread agreement that the payment system needed to be reformed mma revised the way part b pays for covered drugs for 2004 mma reduced payments for most covered drugs to 85 of the awp beginning in 2005 payments for drugs are based on an average sales price asp payment methodology the secretary has the authority to reduce the asp payment amount if the widely available market price is significantly below the asp alternatively beginning in 2006 drugs can be provided through newly established competitive acquisition program cap each year each physician will be given the opportunity either to receive payment using the asp methodology or to obtain drugs and biologicals through the cap mma specified that the following are exempt from the new payment provisions and are paid at 95 of the awp vaccines infusion drugs furnished through covered item of durable medical equipment based on the price in effect october 1 2003 and blood and blood products based on the price in effect october 1 2003 beginning in 2007 infusion drugs furnished through covered item of durable medical equipment in competitive acquisition area established for durable medical equipment and related items will be paid under such system 4 medicare payment advisory commission data book healthcare spending and the medicare program june 2005 crs5 asp methodology medicares payment equals 106 of the applicable price for multiple source drug or single source drug subject to the beneficiary deductible and coinsurance applicable prices are derived from data reported by manufacturers under the medicaid program the applicable price for multiple source drugs is the volume weighted average of the asps calculated by national drug code ndc for each calendar quarter the applicable price for single source drugs is the lesser of the volumeweighted asp or the wholesale acquisition cost in general the manufacturers asp includes sales to all purchasers with certain exceptions including those exempted from medicaids best price determination and sales at nominal charges the determination of the manufactures asp takes into account volume discounts prompt pay discounts cash discounts free goods contingent on any purchase requirements chargebacks and rebates not including medicaid rebates the secretary may include other price concessions which may be based on the recommendations of the inspector general that result in reduction in cost to the purchaser the manufacturer determines the asp on quarterly basis the payment rates are updated quarterly by the secretary based upon the manufacturers asp determined for the most recent calendar quarter for an initial period not to exceed calendar quarter in which the asp is not sufficiently available the secretary may compute the amount payable based on the wholesale acquisition cost or the methodologies in effect on november 1 2003 the law prohibits administrative or judicial review of payment amounts identification of units and package size method to allocate rebates chargebacks and other price concessions the

calculations on june 21 2006 the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the agency that administers medicare announced the payment amounts for the third quarter of calendar 2006 which were based on information from the first quarter of 2006 it reported that payment amounts across all drugs and across the top physician administered drugs increased on average weighted by medicare expenditures by slightly over 05 it further noted that preliminary 2005 data for the top physician administered drugs suggests that overall utilization of these drugs appears to have increased compared with 2004 levels for 28 out of the top 50 drugs in terms of volume the payment amounts changed 2 or less and for 24 of these drugs the change was about 1 overall the payment amounts for 30 of the top 50 drugs increased while three remained the same cms reported that for those drugs with decrease competitive forces such as multiple manufacturers alternative therapies new products recent generic entrants or market shifts to lower priced products were factor9 asp calculation manufacturers are required to report asp data to cms for part b drugs and biologicals reports are due not later than 30 days after the last day of each calendar quarter manufacturers report data by 11digit national drug codes ndcs which indicate the manufacturer product dosage form and package size of the drug manufacturers submit the number of units sold and the asp for those units cms converts the asp for each ndc into the average sales price per billing unit the health care common procedure coding system code hcpcs code more than one ndc may meet the definition of particular hcpcs code the asp per billing unit and the number of units sold for each ndc assigned to the hcpcs code are used to calculate weighted asp for the code cms weights the asp per billing unit equally for each ndc regardless of package size inspector general review mma included language specifying how to calculate volumeweighted asp based on information reported by manufacturers the reporting unit was the lowest identifiable quantity of the drug eg one milliliter one tablet however the mma allowed the secretary beginning in 2004 to use different reporting unit the 7 hhs cms medicare program revisions to payment policies under the physician fee schedule for calendar year 2005 final rule 69 federal register 66236 part iii

changed to the amount of the drug represented by the ndc the amount of the drug represented by one ndc may differ from the amount represented by another ndc recently the office of the inspector general oig of the department of health and human services issued report which stated that the method used by cms is incorrect because it did not use billing units consistently throughout the equation it stated that although cms uses billing units to standardize asps across ndcs for each hcpcs code it does not similarly standardize sales volume across ndcs it further suggested that as result cms reimbursement for the first quarter of 2005 was higher than it should have been for 46 of hcpcs codes lower than it should have been for 13 of the codes and different for the remaining 4110 cms responded to the oig report by stating that it is continuing to look at refinements to the asp methodology but has immediate plans to make changes cms further states that prices appear to be stabilizing and beneficiaries access to care has been maintained during the transition to generally lower drug prices11 monitoring widely available market price the oig is required to conduct studies including surveys to determine the widely available market price of drugs paid for under the asp provision based on these studies and other data the ig is to compare the widely available market price with the asp reported by the manufacturer as part of its medicaid submission the ig is to report to the secretary if the asp exceeds the widely available market price or average manufacturer price amp by specified percentage mma set the percentage at 5 for 2005 and specified that the percentage was to be specified by the secretary in subsequent years the secretary set the percentage at 5 for 2006 in cases where the percentage is exceeded the secretary is to adjust the payment amount for the next calendar quarter the payment is to equal the lesser of the widely available market price or 103 of the amp the widely available market price is defined as the price that prudent purchaser or supplier would pay for the drug or biological in determining the price the inspector general is required to take into account discounts rebates and other price concessions routinely made available to such prudent physicians and suppliers the manufacturers asp is defined as the average price to all purchasers except for certain exempt sales the widely available market price and the asp are different the oig issued report on asps and amps in april 200612 it reviewed volumeweighted asps for the first quarter of 2005 which cms calculated based on 10 hhs office of the inspector general calculation of volumeweighted average sales price for medicare part b prescription drugs report oei030500310

oei030400430 apr 2006 crs8 data submitted by manufacturers for the third quarter of 2004 the oig again stated that the way cms makes the volumeweighted asp calculation is incorrect and supported its own alternative approach it further stated that comparisons between asps and amps yield different results depending on the method used to calculate volumeweighted asps and volumeweighted amps specifically this has an impact on whether or not certain drugs meet the 5 threshold cms noted that the oig review was conducted during the initial implementation phase of the asp methodology it contended that much of the estimated savings identified in the report did not persist in subsequent quarters and payment limits for many codes have been revised again as it did in response to the february 2006 oig report cited above cms was not proposing to make any immediate changes to its calculations the oig issued report in june 2006 comparing asps and widely available market prices it analyzed the purchase prices for nine procedure codes for oncology drugs13 for five of the nine codes the volumeweighted asp calculated using the cms methodology exceeded the widely available market price by at least 5 for the fourth quarter of 2005 for these codes the difference ranged from 17 to 185 the oig estimated that medicare expenditures could be reduced by as much as 67 million in 2006 if the reimbursement codes were lowered to the widely available market price for these codes it further noted that the estimates did not take into account price discounts which may be offered the cms response stated that the report did not note the downward trend in drug prices occurring after the fourth quarter of 2005 however the oig stated that widely available market prices for four out of the five procedure codes still exceeded the 5 threshold other issues related to asp several additional issues have been raised in connection with the asp payment methodology concerns of oncologists as noted earlier payments to physicians for oncology drugs have constituted large portion of medicare outpatient drug spending prior to passage of mma drug payments were tied to the awp many oncologists recognized that medicare payments for drug products were in excess of their actual acquisition costs however they claimed that medicare paid too little for the practice costs associated with administering the oncology drugs they contended that they were forced to use the higher drug payments to offset inadequate reimbursement for practice expenses they also stated that they would object to any changes in the awp calculation unless changes were also made in the practice expense calculation as noted mma revised the payment methodology for drugs at the same time it increased the payments for physician practice expenses associated with the administration of covered drugs following passage of mma many oncologists voiced concerns about reductions in drug payments in response cms took several actions which were designed to increase 2005 and 2006 payments for 2005 there was demonstration 13 hhs office of the inspector general comparison of average sales prices to widely available market prices fourth quarter 2005 oei030500430 june 2006 crs9 project focusing on three areas of concern for cancer patients pain nausea and vomiting and fatigue any practitioner could elect to participate in the demonstration project those that did were required to provide information describing chemotherapy patients status with respect to these three areas participating oncologists received 130 per patient per day in 2006 cms established new one year demonstration focusing on treatment provided to beneficiaries for any of 13 cancers listed as primary diagnosis physicians who report on three measures focus of service current disease state and whether management adheres to clinical guidelines qualify for an additional 23 in addition to the payment for the service14 despite the cms changes some oncologists continue to voice concerns they have suggested that asp information is tilted toward what large purchasers are able to negotiate directly with manufactures not what individual physicians or physician practices can obtain from wholesalers further they note that wholesalers often include markup in their pricing as result they suggest that medicare payments may be insufficient to cover their costs several recent reports suggest that medicare payments are generally adequate the oig issued report in september 2005 which reviewed medicare payments to physician practices for the treatment of cancer patients during the first quarter of 2005 it found that physician practices in the specialties of hematology hematologyoncology and medical oncology could generally purchase drugs for the treatment of cancer patients at less than the mmaestablished reimbursement rates the oig based its conclusion on statistical estimate of average prices paid by physician practices for 39 payment codes that constituted more than 94 of total medicare allowed amounts for drugs associated for these specialties in 2004 it also based its conclusion on an estimate of the percentage of months that the practices were able to purchase drugs at less than the reimbursement amount the report noted that regardless of size physicians could generally purchase most but not all drugs within the 39 payment codes at less than the reimbursement amount however large practices were able to purchase drugs at greater discounts for more payment codes than smaller practices15 subsequent june 2006 oig report discussed above found that for five of nine codes for oncology drugs the volumeweighted asp exceeded the widely available market price by at least 5 for the fourth quarter of 2005 medpac issued report in january 2006 based on site visits as well as an analysis of carrier claims for the first six months of 2005 it found that medicare paid less for chemotherapy drugs in 2005 than in 2004 although the volume of drugs provided to beneficiaries increased as in previous years physicians tended to substitute newer more expensive drugs for older products although the use of chemotherapy services varied by geographic region medpac found indication of access problems in any region while larger practices were able to purchase 14 hhs cms 2006 oncology

reimbursement to physician practices for the treatment of cancer patients report to congress a060500024 sept 2005 crs10 chemotherapy drugs at lower prices than smaller practices all could buy most drugs at prices below the medicare rate though profit margins were generally low the report further noted that all physician practices considered the 2005 payment changes significant many oncologists responded by cutting costs and increasing efficiency particularly with respect to drug purchasing activities finding new sources of revenue such as imaging or selecting more profitable patients many oncologists also cited the 2005 quality of life demonstration project for ensuring their continued participation in medicare however payments under the demonstration made it difficult for medpac to evaluate the effects of the payment changes16 when cms issued its 2006 third quarter payment amounts in june 2006 it stated that it would continue to support groups representing part b drug purchasers especially small and rural purchasers to help them identify the most favorable drug prices possible17 intraveneous immune globulin ivig number of observers have expressed concerns about beneficiary access to ivig drugs which are used to treat patients with cancer or immune disorders in response cms as part of the physician fee schedule regulations for 2006 established temporary addon payment to cover the additional preadministrationrelated services required to locate and acquire adequate ivig and prepare for its infusion during period of market instability cms determined that the pricing was adequate and that there was overall product shortage however it noted that with increasing demand and manufacturer allocations of many formulations physician staff had to expend extra resources on locating and obtaining the products and scheduling infusions for 2006 only physician practices are permitted to bill the addon code cms anticipated that working with stakeholders and ongoing market corrections would help to ensure that the marketplace stabilizes over the year18 on june 21 2006 cms announced the payment amounts for part b drugs for the third quarter of 2006 the amount increased 119 for lyophilized intravenous immune globulin services ivig powdered form and 35 for liquid ivig at the same time cms noted that it and other agencies within hhs are continuing to work with stakeholders to better understand the present situation and to assess potential actions that will help to ensure an adequate supply of ivig and patients receiving appropriate and high quality care it indicated it would continue to monitor ivig marketplace developments and beneficiary access to care19 many stakeholders continue to push for reforms to address both payment amounts and access issues several have suggested making the addon payment permanent 16 medicare payment advisory commission effects of medicare changes on oncology services report to the congress jan 2006 17

secretary to pay supplying fee less the applicable deductible and coinsurance amounts to pharmacies for covered immunosuppressive drugs oral anticancer drugs and oral antinausea drugs used as part of an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen for 2006 cms established fee of 24 for the first prescription in 30day period 50 for immunosuppressives furnished during the first 30day period following covered organ transplant and 16 for each subsequent prescription during such period the program covers drugs and biologicals that are necessary for the effective use of covered durable medical equipment this includes drugs that must be put directly into the equipment such as respiratory drugs given through nebulizer ie inhalation drugs for 2006 cms established dispensing fee of 57 for 30day prescription for the first time the beneficiary uses inhalation drugs and 33 for other months in addition the program will pay 90day dispensing fee of 66 competitive acquisition program mma provisions mma required the secretary to implement competitive acquisition program cap beginning in 2006 the intent of the program was to enable physicians to acquire certain drugs from an approved cap vendor thereby enabling them to reduce the time they spend buying and billing for drugs at the same time it was expected that competition among vendors would reduce prices thereby reducing medicare costs program design under the program competitive acquisition areas would be established throughout the country for purposes of acquisition and payment for covered drugs and biologicals each year each physician would be given the opportunity either to obtain drugs and biologicals through this program or alternatively to receive payment using the asp methodology discussed above physicians electing the competition program would make an annual selection of contractor through which they would obtain the covered items claims for covered drugs and biologicals would be submitted by the contractor which would also be required to collect any beneficiary deductible and coinsurance medicare payments would only be made to the contractor and would be contingent upon the administration of the drugs and biologicals the secretary would provide for process for recoupment where payment was made but the drugs or biologicals were not actually dispensed the secretary was required to establish categories of competitively biddable drugs and biologicals the secretary was to phasein categories beginning in 2006 in such manner as the secretary determined appropriate the secretary could exclude drugs and biologicals from the competition program if the application to such drugs crs12 or biologicals was not likely to result in significant savings or would have an adverse effect on access contracts the secretary was to conduct competition among entities for the acquisition of competitively biddable drugs and biologicals for multiple source drugs the secretary would conduct the competition for the acquisition of at least one competitively biddable drug and biological within each billing and payment code within each competitively biddable category in each competitive acquisition area the secretary could not award contract for category unless the secretary found that it met certain requirements the entity had to have sufficient capacity to supply the drugs or biologicals in the area specified in the contract the entity had to have arrangements in effect for the shipment at least five days week of competitively biddable drugs and biologicals and for their timely delivery including for emergency situations the secretary was required to establish procedures for the prompt response and resolution of complaints of physicians and individuals and of inquiries regarding shipments the secretary was also to specify standards for grievance and appeals process for the resolution of disputes contracts would be awarded for three years the secretary could limit the number of contractors to two in any category and area the secretary would select among qualified entities based on bid prices for drugs or biologicals within the category and area bid prices for distribution ability to ensure product integrity customer service past experience and other factors specified by the secretary the amount of the bid for any drug or biological was to be the same for all portions of an area bidders would be permitted but not required to submit bids for all areas of the united states bids would be confidential contractor requirements contractor would be required to disclose to the secretary its reasonable acquisition costs the contract would provide for price adjustments during the contract period to reflect significant increases or decreases in reasonable net acquisition costs all drugs and biologicals distributed by contractor would be acquired directly from manufacturer or from distributor that acquired the items directly from the manufacturer contractors would be required to comply with product safety safeguards determined appropriate by the secretary they would also be required to comply with code of conduct and fraud and abuse rules contractors could only supply covered drugs and biologicals directly to the physicians and not to beneficiaries except where beneficiaries currently receive them in their homes or other nonphysician office settings the contractor could only deliver drugs and biologicals upon receipt of prescription physicians would not be required to submit prescription for each individual treatment nor would physicians flexibility be changed in terms of writing prescription the secretary was required to establish rules under which drugs or biologicals acquired through contractor could be used to resupply inventories if physicians could demonstrate that the drugs or biologicals were required immediately the crs13 physician could not have reasonably anticipated the immediate requirement the contractor could not deliver them in timely manner and they were administered in an emergency situation payments payments under the program were to be based on bids submitted and accepted the secretary was to determine single amount for each competitively biddable drug or biological in the area the secretary was to establish special payment rules for new products for which payment and billing code had not been established if the secretary excluded drug or biological under the competition program payment would be made under the asp methodology there would be administrative or judicial review for the establishment of payment amounts the awarding of contracts the establishment of competitive acquisition areas the phasedin implementation of the competition program the selection of categories of competitively biddable drugs and biologicals and the bidding structure and number of contractors report mma required the secretary to submit report to congress on the competitive acquisition program by july 1 2008 the report would include information on savings reductions in costsharing access to competitively biddable drugs and biologicals the range of choices of contractors available to physicians the satisfaction of physicians and enrollees and information comparing prices under the competitive acquisition program and those under the asp system implementation implementation of the cap program has been somewhat slower than originally anticipated program development cms issued proposed rules on march 4 200520 and an interim final rule with comment period on july 6 200521 at that time it was expected that the bidding by potential vendors would begin july 6 2005 and close august 5 200522 however effective august 3 2005 cms suspended bidding due to concerns raised by various stakeholders one issue was the fact that cms indicated that cap prices would be used in the calculation of asp prices under the asp methodology discussed above another concern was that under the rule vendors would be reimbursed only for the portion of drugs administered by the physician not for the entire amount shipped in some cases not all of drug in vial is used but must be disposed of under

or around july 1 2006 it stated that this would allow more time for refining cap operations additional testing of the claims processing system and further educational activities in november 2005 cms announced refinements to the cap program most were included in the final physician fee schedule issued november 21 200524 this regulation established processes for vendors to furnish additional drugs and newly approved drugs under the cap it also provided for more consistency between cap policy and part b drug policy on unused drugs specifically cms will consider the unused portion remaining in
