command and staff considerations the ability to move forces and material to any point in an area of operations ao is basic to the effective application of combat power and often decides the outcome of combat operations maneuver relies on this concept of assured mobility the availability of clear lines of communication loc during operations is essential to the movement of forces in actual combat route clearance missions often consist of more than just neutralizing mines along preexisting roads and trails the enemy particularly guerillas and other irregular forces may actively resist such operations and units frequently execute the much more complex task of clearanceinzone operations to ensure battlefield circulation clearanceinzone eliminates organized resistance in an assigned zone by destroying capturing or forcing the withdrawal of enemy forces that could interfere with the units ability to accomplish its mission in such operations the unit must plan to destroy the enemy first and clear the road second with the zone dictated by the route that the commander desires to clear this operation typically requires combined arms team to ensure mission success in hightempo mechanized operations route clearance may take the form of maneuver team moving to contact along route with mineroller equipped tanks leading the way after mine roller detonates mine or the team otherwise identifies minefield across its route the team executes its standard breaching drill fm 3342 combinedarms breaching operations discusses breaching operations in detail considerations for the maneuver commander the maneuver commanders at brigade and battalion task force tf levels must clearly understand the effort required to doctrinally clear and secure their routes operations to clear or secure route of any length especially in restrictive terrain require huge investment in time manpower and resources the maneuver commander must determine whether just reducing the obstacles along specific route will be adequate obstacle reduction normally requires smaller forces and less time than securing the route or clearing all obstacles along it the tf commander must decide the end state he actually needs to achieve the accomplishment of his tactical objectives he must ensure that he transmits the proper task and criteria for success to his command in addition the tf commander must understand how the execution of active route clearance operations within his sector integrates into the brigade plan the principles of breaching operations the principles of breaching operations chapter 9 fm 2032 minecountermine operations apply to the development and execution of route clearance missions the breaching tenets intelligence fundamentals organization mass and synchronization

commander task organizes his forces for route clearance missions in manner similar to that used for breaching missions the clearance team is organized into breach support and assault forces the breach force conducts clearing operations the support force isolates the area being cleared and provides nearside security for the breach force and the assault force destroys or dislodges the threat on the far side and performs security functions beyond the clearance site the assault force also assists the breach and support forces in disengagement as required table 1 shows sample task organization for

3route clearance handbooksynchronization the maneuver commander ensures the implementation of all aspects of synchronization when preparing for route clearance operations it is especially important that the clearance team conduct rehearsals at the combined arms level these rehearsals should include dismount and remount drills reaction to enemy contact reaction to an ambush breaching an obstacle

clearance site css movement routes casualty evacuation resupply of marking materials and demolitions resupply in situations where there is significant ongoing threat to units loc the maneuver commander must ensure that he maintains adequate control over traffic along his msrs this allows the teams conducting route clearance operations to rapidly clear fires without the fear of fratricide maneuver commanders should consider establishing route czar for their brigade bdebattalion bn sector this route czar controls the opening and closing of routes based on threat levels and the success of combat units in reducingclearing obstacles using positive control measures he controls movement along all routes in his sector by establishing route czar the maneuver commander can effectively track the progress of route clearance operations as well as the status of various routes the brigade commander should consider using either his executive officer xo or the forward support battalion fsb commander for this task the route czar will have the authority to deploy route clearance teams in the event of enemy activity along the routes or to provide additional security to key assets traveling along particular route with centralized control the brigade can plot the obstacles and enemy contact throughout the brigade sector the individual designated to track the roadclearance

subdivided and named convoy commander plans his movement along these routes to check for the route status outside the tf zone personnel give the route numbers p1c2c3f1 through the chain of command to the division or corps transportation officer who maintains the most current route status the brigade and battalion tocs will track each subsections status and report the routes status for example c2 and c3 were clear 15 minutes ago p1 is unknown convoy was fired on while traveling on f1 3 hours ago at grid pv909429 obstacle was reported this gives the convoy commander distinct information on

tasks support force is normally comprised of two maneuver platoons and the maneuver company team xo normally the support force must be split into two parts one for each flank the support force provides flank security and protection to the breach force destroying hostile forces before they can effectively engage the clearance team if snipers ambushes command detonated mines or side attack mines are likely to be encountered the support force must operate far enough ahead and to the flanks of the breach force to destroy these threats before they can disrupt the route clearance operation in rugged terrain or highly mined areas where the employment of groundbased support force on the flanks would be impractical or too risky aviation assets may be used to provide flank security while ground forces provide rear security the support force must also search for offroute mines and the firing wires of command detonated mines if the presence of such devices is suspected assault force is normally comprised of maneuver platoon an engineer squad mortar section medical team psyops team an eod light team or supported by one that is on call and forward observer the assault forces mission is the same as in breaching operation chapter 9 fm 2032 the clearance commander normally locates himself well forward in the assault force with his fist element close by as critical sections of route

for route clearance and then never deviating from it although this practice assures the clearance commander thorough wellcontrolled sweep it also gives the enemy the advantage of being able to predict friendly movements and actions consequently the enemy is then able to employ his mines and ambushes to inflict maximum damage consequently the clearance commander maneuver teamcompany commander will

former warring faction fwf engineerequivalent clearance teams should precede us clearance teams within the fwfs area of operations ao do not assume that fwf clearance teams will be thorough in their clearance operation treat the route as unsafe until us or coalition clearance teams have proofed the route to confirm that it is cleared methods of route clearance there are three tactical methods of route clearancelinear combat and combined the method employed depends on the situation and the time and clearance assets available if the route will regularly be used by uscoalition forces the maneuver force will establish and maintain static security positions at critical locations following the completion of route clearance linear clearance in linear clearance figure 2 the clearance team begins its mission at point and completes it at point b this method provides the best assurance of complete and consistent route coverage although this is an effective method it is not the most secure method in highthreat environment it is also timeintensive and limits the maneuver commanders flexibility figure 2 linear clearance method for official use only 19route clearance handbook msr bluepoint point bsweep routemsr white msr bluestreamcombat clearance whereas linear clearance focuses on specific route combat clearance figure 3 focuses on specific points along route ipb and eba can identify areas that are likely to contain mines or ambushes these areas become nai or objectives for combat clearance missions the combat clearance method divides route into sections according to the number of suspected highthreat areas once the clearance teams secure and sweep these areas the route is considered clear combat forces can patrol the route from these objectives to ensure that the route remains secure using this method the commander assumes some risk that his s2 and engineer have identified all highthreat areas and that the route is clear of mines combat clearance is ideal for dismounted light forces since it provides the maximum use of surprise and concealment figure 3 combat clearance method combined clearance this method combines the complete clearance capabilities of the linear clearance method with the security and surprise elements of the combat clearance method combined clearance is twophase forceintensive operation and depending on the length of route to be cleared may require battalionsize effort first the tf s2 and engineer identify highthreat areas through ipb and eba and target them as nai andor objectives to secure then the support force clears enemy forces ahead of the breach force the sweep teams of the breach force move down the road and clear all obstacles that impede or endanger movement along the msr the main advantage of this method is that it provides the tf commander with relatively rapid method of securing his msrs with degree of confidence that followon forces will be much safer subdividing the route and using multiple clearance teams can further reduce the time required to clear route in the simplest form the commander can have team start at each end of route and clear toward each other if there are friendly defensive positions along the route it may also be possible to have additional teams begin from these points as well 20 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned msr bluesweep routemsr white msr bluestream msr redobjectivesnai for clearance effortstypes of route clearance there are two types of route clearance operations deliberate and hasty these techniques can be modified to meet the time and equipment limitations of the tf but the maneuver commander must consider the risks of doing so either type of clearance can be used with any of the three methods of clearance linear combat or combined deliberate sweep deliberate sweep figure 4 is very thorough and includes complete sweep of the entire road including shoulders culverts ditches and bridges it is the most timeconsuming sweep operation and relies on electronic primary visual secondary and mechanical tertiary detection systems if the situation permits the maneuver commander should task subordinate units with conducting deliberate sweep when route is initially opened for traffic when mining is suspected and if possible every morning thereafter deliberate sweep has five elements positioning the troops securing the route clearing

along route before initiating route clearance this may be done by placing defensive positions along the route or by moving troops into position by helicopter or infiltration just prior to beginning the clearance however the maneuver commander must be cautious of establishing patterns in the employment of airmobile assets the enemy could use mines or ambushes to exploit an established routine in terms of time of day or terrain occupied the second element is securing the route for example company team performing deliberate sweep advances astride the main supply route msr in an inverted vformation figure 4 dismounted infantry platoon 1 figure 4 with an attached combat engineer team moves along each flank while carefully searching for wires and other signs of commanddetonated mines or ambushes the two infantry platoons will be far enough ahead of the engineers and the tanks of the sweep team to investigate possible sites where the enemy could observe the sweep team and activate commanddetonated mine if the infantry platoon is near tree line security team should sweep the tree line ahead of it 22 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned c127 dismounted infantry

mcap kit or improvised armor can significantly increase the effectiveness of this flank security as countermeasure to commanddetonated mines an m1 tank with trackwidth mine plow could also be used if vehicles fitted with singletooth rippers are not available one dismounted soldier with each flank security element can accomplish similar effect by dragging pick along the ground however this technique will not find deeply buried command firing wires the third element is clearing the road the minesweep teams 3 figure 4 move down the road at the point of the inverted vformation allocate one sweep team for every 15 meters of width including road shoulders on an unpaved road to be cleared depending on the width of the route to be swept ensure that additional mine detectors are provided to the engineer platoon it may be possible to get these detectors from the engineers parent or supported maneuver unit since countermine operations are rarely 100 percent effective and mines are occasionally missed some means of proofing the route is used to confirm the quality of sweep proofing devices such as minerollerequipped tanks 5 figure 4 should follow the sweep teams deploy sufficient proofing devices in echelon to provide complete coverage of the road and the road shoulders three m1 tanks equipped with mine rollers are required to fully proof road up to 6 meters wide and six m1s are required to proof road 6 to 12 meters wide the battalion countermine set issued to m1 tank battalions contains only four sets of rollers and units may need to coordinate for additional assets from another armored battalion or improvise some other means of proofing mine rollers are extremely heavy 11 tons and may damage unimproved roads the heavy minerollerequipped tank exceeds the capacity of many bridges and may be unable to negotiate some narrow choke points if rollerequipped tanks are unsuitable or unavailable improvised lightweight expendable rollers may be used if magneticinfluence fuzed mines are threat mount magnetic mine countermeasure systems to the mine roller equipped tank such systems include the improved dogbone assembly or the field expedient coil system coalition forces may possess magnetic mine countermeasures systems or they can also be improvised if standard issue items are not available mine rakes or plows are not satisfactory substitutes because they will often destroy the road surface if rakes or plows are used to clear route sufficient engineer assets must be allocated to return the route to useable condition in timely fashion tanks and other armored fighting vehicles are vulnerable to side attack mines and commanddetonated mines the support force and the sweep teams should always precede the tanks if such mines are expected to lessen the possibility of casualties if an undetected mine detonates maintain an interval of 25 meters between proofing vehicles and 50meter interval between all dismounted personnel and proofing vehicles if the enemy is expected to use roadblocks support the proofing vehicles by allocating at least two m9 aces or armored bulldozers to the breach force these vehicles can push roadblock out of the way after the sweep team has thoroughly checked it for mines and booby traps in vietnam the vietcong often emplaced roadblocks indepth but only mined or boobytrapped the last few the company command post cp will accompany the last infantry platoon 9 figure 4 which provides overwatching fires to the support and breach forces throughout the operation if the cp and infantry platoon are mechanized they remain mounted the commander carefully synchronizes the movements of this platoon to ensure continuous overwatch without disrupting for official use only 23route clearance handbookhis covering fires and the progress of other subordinate units one technique is to bound part of the overwatch team from the support force forward while the remainder continues to provide covering fires the remainder of the platoon bounds forward only after the other overwatch element is ready if bradleys or m113s are assigned to the dismounted platoons providing flank security they may either follow those platoons to provide close support or position themselves with the overwatching platoon to increase its firepower builtup and other terrain with narrow avenues of approach and restricted fields of fire present very difficult challenge in routeclearance operations units operating in such terrain may need to modify their routeclearing tactics to fit the situation the key point to countering command detonated mines is to find and neutralize the individual responsible for firing any mines or find and neutralize the firing wires to the mines before the breach force approach the mines during route clearance missions where intense close combat is likely to occur the maneuver commander must emphasize survivability and firepower when task organizing units and equipment figure 5 hasty route clearance when determining how far out and ahead the support force will operate from the breach force the clearance commander will consider the technical characteristics of the mine threat for example most side attack antitank mines have range of less than 80 meters however some of the latest versions of this type have ranges up to 150 meters most claymore type mines have range of 50 meters although the mon100 and mon200 project lethal fragments 100 and 200 meters respectively from their point of detonation additionally the support force will identify clear and secure potential sniper positions command detonated mine firing points and the far side of known or suspected obstacle locations 24 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learned assault forcesupport force breach force mpalong the route before the breach force begins obstacle reduction or clearance terrain permitting the support force should operate at least 100 meters ahead and to the flanks of the breach force to clear possible enemy directfire systems and any hostile elements that may be overwatching any mines that have been placed in the route this not only allows the breach force to focus solely on the route but also clears the area of offroute and commanddetonated mines the first time that deliberate sweep is conducted along segment of route the clearance team should perform route reconnaissance that looks at all areas of route including bypasses and turnarounds if enemy contact is made the support force fixes the threat while the assault force reacts the sweep teams withdraw to location that provides concealment andor security since the fourth and fifth elements are relatively routine for all combat units and do not include any unusual countermine requirements they will not be discussed here interested individuals should refer to the applicable manuals the deliberate sweep focuses on thoroughness and security rather than speed this method is very slow and tedious and should only be used when time is not critical factor depending on conditions deliberate sweep may advance as slowly as 80 to 100 meters per hour hasty sweep the mere existence of hastysweep procedures is tacit acknowledgment that the 100 percent solution is not always feasible and maneuver commanders accept reasonable amount of risk in these operations in situations where it is likely the clearance team will encounter ambushes side attack mines or command detonated mines the decision to use hasty sweep procedures is high risk as always the maneuver commander must determine the proper balance between risks and requirements tactics used for hasty sweep are based on those for the deliberate sweep but are modified to meet time and resource constraints hasty sweep figure 5 consists of visual inspection physical search or probing and the use of mine detectors it is the fastest most risky method and is suited for an armored or mechanized team it relies primarily on visual detection of mine indicators through the use of thermal sights or the naked eye the breach force looks for mines wire and other mine indicators visual detection is accompanied by mechanical proofing system suspicious areas such as low ground curves culverts and bridges should still be carefully inspected and searched sweep teams check all such suspected areas with electronic mine detectors the support force includes maneuver platoon that provides security for the breach force the assault force includes maneuver platoon that provides suppressive fire actions upon enemy contact are the same as in deliberate sweep the breach force focuses on identifying immediate risks to traffic neutralizing those risks and continuing on with the mission hasty sweep is used during the combat clearance method to validate the areas that were not deliberately cleared by the sweep teams it is also used if the metttc analysis does not permit deliberate sweep or if the need for road to be opened is urgent light force may not have access to an m1 tank with mine clearing roller mcr system but can conduct the same sweep method with improvised roller systems or sandbagged 5ton truck moving backwards using mcrs or their equivalent to proof the route is absolutely imperative in hasty sweeps due to the risk posed by missed mines for official use only 25route clearance handbookhasty sweep levels the four levels of sweep operations adapted from fm 3342 appendix provide maneuver commander with another way to specify the level of effort dedicated to route clearance all four levels can be modified to meet the units time and equipment limitations all four sweep levels can be used with any of the three clearance methods linear combat or combined level one this is the fastest riskiest type of route clearance it is best suited for use by an armoredmechanized team the breach force is squadsize or larger element that is taskorganized with mine detectors demolitions and possibly an ivmmd the breach force looks for mines along the road width of route this sweep relies primarily on visual detection using thermal or infrared sights or the naked eye for mine identification it is followed immediately by secondary mechanical detection system such as mcrs the primary objective of level one sweep is speed with the breach force moving at 5 to 8 miles per hour the breach force identifies immediate risks to traffic neutralizes them and continues on with the mission level two level two sweep uses electronic measures primarily mine detectors as the primary detection method in highthreat areas these areas include intersections choke points and areas within 10 meters of wood lines level two sweep employs more caution and forces the unit to update the ipb before beginning the mission this level of operation employs company team for security and command and control c2 dismounted forces clear and secure the flanks and the far side of mined area while an engineer squad clears section of the road level three level three sweep is more indepth and more timeconsuming the sweep team must examine the routes entire width including the shoulders and drainage ditches this technique ensures that followon forces are protected if they are forced to the side of the road the security and support element also moves mounted or dismounted to provide rapid response and security the breach force provides route recon report that updates current maps and further identifies highthreat areas level four level four sweep is very timeconsuming it relies on visual and electronic means for clearance platoonsize breach force is dismounted to focus attention on the routes entire length companysize support force clears and secures the flanks and front of the breach force at least 100 meters in each direction in forested areas this clears the area of snipers and ambushes as well as offroute and commanddetonated mines thus allowing the sweep teams to focus solely on the route mcrs are used to proof the route after the sweep team passes through an area level four sweeps include route and area recons and they are used when thoroughness and security not speed are critical to the mission considerations for engineers sweep team of the breach force is trained on detection and searches for mines and explosive devices the organization of the sweep team depends on the type of sweep mission

assured mobility during route clearance however effective mine detection takes time do not sacrifice engineers because of impatience do not take any more risks than the situation requires nonengineers outside the chain of command may become impatient at the delay caused by route clearance operation the senior engineer will advise them of the situation and let them determine whether or not to bypass the sweep team the support force bulldozers will be equipped with singletooth rippers that can cut narrow 24inchdeep trench and cut or uncover the firing wires to commanddetonated mines an m1 tank with trackwidth mine plow or an m9 ace fitted with an improvised singletooth ripper is also well suited to this task terrain permitting these vehicles may be employed as far as 100 meters off the road and will zigzag their routes to locate firing wires laid parallel with the road rollerequipped tanks will precede the bulldozer or ace when antitank mines are expected offroad demolition and local

drainage after the sweep is completed engineer road repair teams will be on call to repair any subsequent road damage thoroughly check all suspicious areas including road craters bypasses potholes culverts fords intersections turnaround areas abandoned roadblocks and choke points hostile forces often place more than one mine in mined area do not focus the detection effort solely on horizontal mine threat such as on the ground or in culverts the mine threat is also vertical such as in trees within walls under the eaves of buildings or attached to an overpass clearance efforts must accommodate the threedimensional battlefield observe people along the route increase alertness when normally crowded area is abandoned if questioned local civilians may provide critical information about mined areas all such information however will be carefully verified use binoculars to scan the route ahead to identify hazardous areas where increased alertness is warranted practice locating mines visually in vietnam 50 percent of the mines were detected visually and 33 percent were detected with metallic mine detectors most of these had significant amounts of metal watch for mine packing materials such as wood boxes metal cans and cardboard tubes along the side of route that may indicate mine laying activities ensure minedetector operators and probers are highly trained and experienced rotate them every 2030 minutes the average soldier can effectively operate detector for one turn every 4 hours without disturbing the object probers will uncover just enough to confirm that it is mine assume that all mines and explosive devices are equipped with antihandling devices ahds until proven otherwise once the prober confirms the presence of 32 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedmine he withdraws and notifies the senior engineer who determines how the mine will be neutralized sweep the entire road including shoulders out to minimum of 5 meters from the edge of the road this width allows most vehicles to do uturn or to pull off to the side to allow another unit to pass watch for trip wires along the shoulders dirt and gravel shoulders are normally the easiest areas of road to mine the senior engineer will ensure that the sweep teams responsible for checking the shoulders of the road look for any signs that the enemy has dug underneath the road to emplace command detonated mine consider supplementing the routesweeping teams with mine detection dogs dogs can work 3 to 4 hours in moderate climatic conditions and this period may be extended if the dogs take 15minute break every hour multiple dog teams are needed to conduct sustained operations always consult with the dog handlers for additional employment recommendations the use of dog teams in any operation requires additional support that will not come with the dog team this includes but is not limited to mine clearance after marking eod support kennel and training area needs and special veterinary support do not assume that road is cleared of mines where it passes through friendly village or outpost or if it has not been under continuous friendly observation since it was last swept in some instances the ground or road surface may be too hard to probe adequately certain compacted soil types or frozen ground if these conditions are present the senior engineer and eod representatives should consult and consider appropriate courses of action based on mission requirements mark bypass neutralize or move to alternate route if available in the initial phases of sweep operation removing all items on the road that cause positive reading on metallic mine detector will save time on subsequent sweeps by significantly decreasing the number of false positive readings on the mine detectors increase the size of the basic sweep team to allow one metallic mine detector for every 15 meters of road width including the shoulders plus two in reserve if positive reading is obtained mark the location check for command firing wires if none are found have probers search the area with assistance from the two reserve detectors while the other detector operators continue their sweep this technique allows the primary detector operators to remain together and ensures complete and continuous coverage of the road when ieds are threat look for possible trigger reference points such as sign posts or lone trees along the route and remove them if possible when ieds are threat task organize some engineers with the support force to carefully search for wires and other signs of commanddetonated mines or ambushes as well as disturbed earth or foliage used to cover firing wires in vietnam engineers located these wires by having soldier with each flank element drag pick or bush hook along the ground while he moved in zigzag pattern between the flank element and the road for official use only 33route clearance handbookif possible have the road paved with asphalt to discourage mine laying failing that coordinate for distributor to place lines of asphalt or oil along the surface of the route at the end of each day any attempts to dig hole in the road for mine will be obvious keep all radios electronic equipment and aviation assets at safe distance as specified in fm 534 engineer field data in table 92 minimum safe distance from transmitter antennas from

flash or immediate consider the following guides provide situation report at designated checkpoints and after completing route clearance send spot report in size activity location unit time and enemy salute format to the clearance commander immediately after mine is discovered or detonates the salute report must contain an accurate location coordinates of the incident forward written report

send recovered information and materials to the s2 within 24 hours provide progress reports the clearing unit submits progress and completion reports until the clearance operation is complete progress

many potential mineneutralization hazards are obvious some are not neutralization teams must proceed with caution and patience the following techniques may be employed only one member of the sweep team will neutralize mines all others will move safe distance away 300 meters in the open 100 meters in missile proof shelter in case of stacked or boosted mines the common practice is to blow in place any enemy mine detected with onepound block of explosive placed next to the mine this action often creates large crater in the road that must be backfilled and capped for example craters made by tma3 mines are usually 1218 inches deep and 3036 inches across since some cratering is inevitable road repair equipment and fill material should accompany the breach team once the prober confirms the presence of mine he withdraws and notifies the senior engineer the senior engineer must decide whether to avoid and bypass the mine destroy it in place remove it with grapnel or notify eod for hand neutralization however mines on or near routes will only be bypassed if they are part of larger minefield the clearance of which is beyond the scope of the mission assigned to the clearance team in this case the edge of the minefield should be marked and reported to the battalion tf hqs if the object uncovered turns out to be debris the prober will move to protected position and carefully remove the debris with grapnel hook be alert for booby traps or ahds wired to the debris in many situations it may be preferable to extract mines located on loc removing mines allows the road to be reopened immediately eliminates the need to repair large craters and denies the enemy an excellent location for laying their next mine in road crater filled with loose gravel additionally mines removed using this technique pose little danger to personnel to extract mine first check for stacked mines antihandling devices ahd and booby traps by thoroughly searching the mine by hand next uncover only enough of the mine to expose handle or projection then extract the mine using about 60 meters of parachute cord or wire rope etc an aframe or tripod and grapnel if there is projection engage grapnel on the bottom side of the mine opposite the direction of pull danger do not move the mine while uncovering it or attaching the rope because movement may detonate an ahd ensure that the covered area is not mined take cover and lie in prone position at least 50 meters from the mine pull the rope to remove the mine from the hole pull the mine at least 15 meters from the hole and wait at least 30 seconds before leaving cover and approaching the mine if the mine type is unknown dispose of the mine according to the unit directive or sop if multiple mines are extracted from an area pick up the pressurefuzed at mines by hand and move them to single point for demolition to save both time and explosives remember that these mines are still fuzed this technique is not normally recommended for use against ap mines which might be found along the shoulders of the route or at mines with fullwidth attack fuzes tilt rods or electronic influence fuzes because of their sensitive fuzing however if necessary rig the pull line so that 38 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedthe mine can be dragged out of the way and into suitable area before destroying it with explosives check the hole with mine detector and probe for more mines and then fill and cap it do not attempt to use this technique to lift tiltrod or magneticfuzed mines when the situation permits save time by having the sweep team or breach force mark the mines and bypass them leaving demolition to followon elements if multiple mines are to be blown in place use ring main or line main to reduce the demolition time check both ends of all trip wires both slack and taut for breakwiretype fuzes before cutting them breakwirefuzed mines should only be blown in place or neutralized with grapnel if breakwirefuzed as well as tiltrod or influencefuzed mines must be removed from sensitive location without detonation eod technical support should be requested after neutralizing mine by blowing it in place or lifting it check the hole again with metallic mine detector and probe in case the enemy stacked more mines or explosives in the same hole to enhance the effect of the mine when firing wires or mines are detected one soldier will immediately search for lead wires because all ordnance including pressurefuzed at mines can be rigged for command detonation lead wires should be traced to source if positive firing train can be determined then wires should be cut and shunted if complete firing train cannot be determined the wires should be cut remotely remember ap mines may be placed along the firing wire to protect the firing wire when new unidentified explosive device is discovered the clearance commander after consulting with his senior engineer or eod support must decide if recovery attempt is warranted this decision must be based on the essential elements of information specified in the operations order and guidance from higher headquarters if possible photograph the device before taking any actions if the decision is to recover an unidentified explosive device only one soldier preferably an eod technician attempts the recovery he digs carefully around the explosive device until grappling hook or wire can be passed through or under it then he attempts to pull it with line and small aframe if the recovery attempt becomes too dangerous in the opinion of the senior eod technician or engineer he blows the device in place under circumstances should anyone attempt to disarm an explosive device if the nco in charge does not consider it safe do not take unnecessary risks foreign mines and booby traps should only be handneutralized by eod personnel normally during route clearance operations mines are only neutralized by hand if ºthe mine is located on bridge building or other facility required for use by friendly forces ºthe mine type is unknown and recovery must be attempted for intelligence purposes as discussed above ºchemical mines are located in areas where contamination would restrict the use of the area by friendly troops handneutralization is only undertaken for official use only 39route clearance handbookºwhen neutralization by other means is not

minescutting what appears to be slack trip wire activates the minecheck both ends of all trip wires both slack and taut for unusual fuzing before cutting them 40 for official use onlycenter for army lessons learnedlowmetal ap mines laid along trip wirespersonnel tracing trip wires become casualties1 from covered position safe distance away remember that the lethal range of some directional mines is 200 meters pull the trip wire using grapnel then carefully sweepprobe the area that was under the trip wire 2 probe along trip wires do not become overly focused on the wire multiimpulse at mine is improvised by placing simple pressurefuzed at mine upside down in conical holemine detonates after repeated vehicle contacts force it to the bottom of the hole mine rollers do not reliably clear this arrangement1 employ good detection techniques 2 circular depression is visual indicator that this technique was employed surfacelaid at mines fitted with ahds appear to be hastily laidsoldiers grab the mines to throw them off the road1 assume all mines are fitted with ahds 2 use aframe or grapnel to move mines surfacelaid at mines surrounded by tripwire fuzed bouncing bettysoldiers activate the trip wires when they walk up to grab the at mines and throw them off the roadmaintain sweep discipline when approaching surfacelaid mines improvised explosive device threat military forces organic to the host nation or its enemies do not always employ mines conventionally in many cases terrorists operating along loc against coalition forces or the hostnation populace also employ them the threat increases because of the improvised methods in which the mines are frequently emplaced in conventional emplacement of mines pattern emerges from the emplacing forces doctrine and using this knowledge can easily reduce the threat there is less pattern in the case of improvised mining methods consequently highly organized and disciplined approach to detection and removal is required improvised mining has many different employment techniques in most of the techniques shown below uxo can easily be employed in place of mine coupling mines coupling is normally done by linking one fused mine to another unfuzed one usually with detonating cord when the initial mine is detonated it detonates the linked mine coupling defeats countermine equipment related technique is daisychained mines commanddetonated ap mines are commonly used in daisy chaining hostile forces link the mines with trip wires or detonating cord when the initial mine is detonated the other mines will detonate boosting mines buried mines are stacked atop one another and the farthest mine from the surface is fused this reduces the probability of detection and increases the force of the blast for official use only 41route clearance handbooksensitizing at mines on some nonmetallic at mines the pressure plate can be cracked and the spring removed or the mines explosive can be cut into smaller blocks and employed as powerful ap mines the pressure plate can be removed from metallic at mines and employed in the same manner alternatively pressurefused ap mine can be placed on the top of an at mine mixing training mines with live mines hostile forces can employ training mines at the start of minefield and emplace live mines toward the end the sweep element falsely believes that the minefield is phony and becomes complacent in its reduction activities when this technique is used live mines are painted to resemble training mines references the following three references contain current route clearance
