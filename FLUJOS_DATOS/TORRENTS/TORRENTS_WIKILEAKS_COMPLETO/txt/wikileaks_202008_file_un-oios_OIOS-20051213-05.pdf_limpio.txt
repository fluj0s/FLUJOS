continued negotiations with the landlord of com pound 1 were assumed by the unmil official 2 upon his arrival in september on september 30 2003 unmil official 2 provided landlord of monrovia liberia letter of intent to lease compound 1 the document specifically noted the intention f the united nations mission in liberia to lease the entire complex including all bungalo ws apartments and

as soon as all the residences are comp leted and occupied by the anticipated date of september 01 2004 on march 11 2004 dpko official 2 provided unmil official 2 facsimile authorizing the request 14 on march 15 2004 an agreement of lease was sig ned between the unmil staff welfare committee represented by unmil staff memb er 2 and landlord of monrovia liberia the agreement notes that the committee at its own expense provide its generators and fuel to supply electricity for the ntire compound and shall operate said generators and carry out preventative maintenance f them the agreement makes specific reference regarding electricity being supp lied to the landlord other than referring to the supply of electricity for the entire compound 15 similar proposed agreement to lease was revie wed by idoios regarding compound 2 in monrovia this compound situated ad jacent to compound 1 has been occupied exclusively by staff members commencing in july 2004 3 16 on august 6 2004 the

official 1 was on leave the re were several occasions when the generators at compound 1 were nonfunctioning the document is entitled provision of services to compound 1 as indicated in agreement tter unmil official 2 then notes the high fuel consumption of the generator because the landlords generator continues to break down unmil official 2 requests the installation of new 330 kva generator at compound 1 and acknowledges that compo und 2 has two generators on site he indicates that this is clearly disparity as compound 2 with 37 occupants has two generators while compound 1 with 80 staff members has only one 19 on february 26 2005 unmil official 2 advised ll international staff that unsecoord had authorized reimbursement for fuel for security lights from powered generators and for the hiring of private profession security guards included in the authorization was one time reimbursement for secu rity improvements to the staff members residence in march 2005 the policy was c larified to note that the authorized fuel reimbursement would be per dwelling and not pe r staff member during the course of the investigation unmil official 3 advised idoio s that staff members residing in compound 1 were not entitled to the noted reimburse ments for fuel for security lights from powered generators several senior unmil staf f members seemed to indicate this was trade off as such for the use of the gener ators 8 20 the idoios investigation commenced in april 20 05 after brief tour of the site it appears that compound 1 has been fully rest ored to its original state including the tennis courts swimming pool club house and air co nditioned bungalows generators 21 the witnesses interviewed during the course of the investigation confirmed that both compound 1 and compound 2 are supplied with generators in both compounds the landlords are also provided electric ity as generated by the generators fixed monthly reimbursement for the landlords fuel costs is provided to each respective committee the landlord of compoun d 1 resides within the complex and reimburses the committee for electricity to five bu ildings that are not included within the current agreement similar arrangements were made b the same landlord when he previously provided electricity to local telecom company th at has communications tower on compound 1 site in compound 2 the landl ord has attached an electrical cable to the generator which then leads outside of the compound and approximately 100 meters down the road to his private residence 22 on december 6 2004 senior unmil official rece ived fuel audit report as conducted by the oios internal audit division the audit specifically addressed issues surrounding fuel being provided to the compound 1 the document also notes that 500 kva owned generator is on site and that it is not clear whose authority the generator was placed free of cost to provide 24hou r electricity free on what is essentially private property the oios audit team reported that unmil official 1 explained to them that the landlords generators we re not in good working order with frequent power outages and constant power surges th at could adversely effect communication equipment as compound 1 had more th an 100 staff members including several senior officials it was decided that generator would be place on loan at the complex until electricity in monrovia is restored or when the tenants are in position to procure such generator for the property one of the recommendations stemming from the oios fuel audit was that unmil administrat ion review the present arrangement involving the use of the owned genera tor at the compound 1 some of the generators have been removed as noted in the chart below while others have remained in place 23 unmil

exceptionally poor quality the vouchers require s ignatures in blocks designating requested by approved by authorized by and received by by example staff member in the air movement units could submit request for generator the request would be approved by the head of his sectio n and then authorized by the head of engineering the final receipt of the generator in most cases would be the same person who had requested the item in the first place as th item is then charged to his personal inventory issue voucher forms reviewed during the course of the idoios investigation indicate that in most cases someone from the genera tor unit requested the generator often the approval or authorization of the issuance is the very same person who requested the item or the approval and authorization signator blocks are simply left blank several staff members also rejected official documentation which reports that generators have been assigned to their personal inventories advisin g that they had never requested nor signed any receipt for any such items generator maintenance 25 all generators require daily maintenance to ens ure proper operation this includes maintaining the fluid levels and monitorin g cool down periods during the shut downtransfer process required with dual generator systems in compound 1 the committee pays the landlord us1500 month for non employees to provide this daily service in compound 2 the same service is p rovide as part of the monthly accommodation charge notwithstanding the daily mai ntenance the generators at both compounds also receive regular scheduled maint enance by the unmil generator unit staff unmil records from november 2003 to pril 2005 indicate the following expenditures on generators and those of compound 1 landlord as listed in

stemming out of the oio s fuel audit was that unmil administration review the supply of dutyfree fuel in light of concerns r aised by some staff members the concerns expressed were that while the staff m embers residing at compound 1 and compound 2 were being provided fu at tax exempt prices staff members residing anywhere else in the mission were not they were forced to pay for fuel either direct from the source or as part of t heir monthly rent at rates which included local liberian taxes while the provision of tax fr ee fuel is common benefit provided to international staff members under status of forces agreements the oios auditors were doubt unaware of an information circular 20 04041 dated august 2004 in which unmil official 2 had subsequently authorized the pr ovision of duty free fuel to all unmil international personnel 27 the idoios investigation did corroborate the f indings of the oios audit in that each respective committee does reimburse unmil fina nce for the associated costs of fuel utilized on site plus an additional 14 fee administration costs gravel and road maintenance 28 witnesses interviewed during the course of the investigation confirmed that members of the nigerian troop contingent have utili zed graders to repair and maintain roads leading up to and on occasion withi n compound 1 they noted that graders were utilized as such throughout monrovia idoios investigators did observe several military outposts within 1 or 2 kilometers of the compound 1 including military guards at the gate providing security for the force commander and authorized senior unmil staff without specific dates and the continu ed rotation of nigerian troop contingents idoios could not locate any documenta tion authorizing road maintenance within compound 1 itself other assets 29 the unmil engineering unit had constructed he licopter landing pad within compound 1 the head of the engineering unit stat ed it was authorized in case of the need to evacuate staff members documentatio n in this regard was produced 30 other assets at compound 1 or compound 2 compounds were noted by idoios witness accounts 11 31 during the course of the idoios investigation total of 25 interviews were conducted the majority of interviews dealt with sp ecific aspects of the investigation rather than the allegations at large there was ho wever disagreement amongst anyone interviewed that the living standards of compound 1 far exceed those of any other staff accommodation within liberia compound 1 and adjac ent compound 2 were also noted to be the only approved unmil staff accommodations on the north side of monrovia due to security concerns all other unmil staff wer required to obtain private accommodations on the south side of the city the s ame area in which the unmil headquarters is located 32 numerous unmil staff members and even local i nvestor who rents out an apartment complex within monrovia to tenants on an individual basis including some unmil staff complained to idoios investigators h ow they felt that the assets provided to the landlords and staff members residin g at compound 1 and compound 2 is grossly unfair the local investor went as far to request that generators be installed at his apartment complex as well some staff members residing in compound 1 expressed concerns in that they are not 100 sure where their money goes others commented that the landlords did not seem to be paying the agreed amount for fuel charges and refused to accept any proposed increase in fuel costs intere stingly enough the price of fuel in monrovia since march 15 2004 to april 2005 has inc reased 60 and yet associated fuel price increase has ever been passed on to the landlords by either committee with regards to the compound 1 tenants committee it was revealed that the recently appointed treasurer is also unmil finance officia l while this appointment was well received by some tenants as step towards getting the books in order several of the residents have also requested audits of each respec tive committees financial records 33 unmil generator staff made several references t the direction of official 1 as the staff member who authorized the installation of the generators at the noted compounds several emails commenting on this speci fic direction were in fact provided to idoios wherein official 1 was carbon copied ema il documents which made direct reference to his authorization to install genera tors at compound 1 34 one senior staff member of the engineer section advised that the original intention of compound 1 was for unmil to lease the accommodation direct the proposal however was shelved once it was realized t hat the mission subsistence allowance 4 of the staff members residing at compound 1 would be significantly reduced unmil official 1 formerly at unmil 35 unmil official 1 confirmed his position upon hi s arrival to the mission in august 2003 he stated there was still ongoing flict in monrovia and it was not very safe place to be like other unmil staff memb ers at the time he was working out 4 msa is daily living allowance provided by the to all staff members serving on mission if however the provides accommodation or any other service associated to daily subsistence the msa i s subsequently proportionally reduced 12 of the mumba point hotel trying to both secure off ice and living accommodations he advised that compound 1 was somewhat obvious plac to consider for residency because staff members from the united nations devel opment program had utilized the facilities prior to the civil conflict in liberia compound 1 in august of 2003 however was in very poor condition while the roofs and wa lls remained everything had been looted during the years of conflict notwithstandi ng this both he and the landlord saw the benefits of securing the accommodation for unmi l staff members unmil official 1 noted that it was the landlord who wanted to secu re the agreement with establishment the landlord apparently was tired f previous hassles regarding individual rent payment and collection he was also tired of continuous concerns regarding the provisions of electricity for so many specified hou rs day the landlord was seeking lease agreement with the as an entity to avoid l the hassles as noted unmil official 1 stated however that an agreement with th as an agency at the time was not possible and as such the compound 1 welfare committ ee was eventually established 36 unmil official 1 stated that the intent behind compound 1 was to set it up as an office away from the office this was because the main hq was in the center of the city and monrovia remained very unpredictable as far as demonstrations and ongoing conflict was concerned the distance between compound 1 and the main hq in his estimate was 25 km he noted that with the exception of the sen ior official all the other heads of unmil were living in compound 1 the fact that comp ound 1 was being set up as an office away from the office is also why the helicop ter pad was installed 37 unmil official 1 was questioned directly regard ing who negotiated the terms of electricity and fuel being provided to the compound 1 landlord he confirmed that it was him to certain point and also that the landlord pproached him regarding provisions of electricity to another business unmil official 1 informed the landlord that as long as he reimbursed the committee for the fuel it could b arranged unmil official 1 did state however that upon the arrival of the unmil official 2 he was longer directly involved in the negotiations as such consideratio ns where more within the role of unmil official 2 he stepped aside unmil official 1 specifically noted the letter of intent as indication of unmil official 2s involvem ent 38 in regards to generators at compound 2 unmi l official 1 advised it was unmil official 2 who authorized the installations s compound 2 was originally being considered as an extension of compound 1 due to the large increase in unmil staff at the time insofar as unmil tax free fuel being pro vided to compound 1 tenants he admitted that this caused some concerns with other unmil staff members as they too wanted the financial benefits of tax free fuel he advised that the delay in implementing similar benefits was associated only to logistics it was difficult process to come up with fair implementation of tax free fuel when mil staff members at the time were now living in so many different compoundssituation s when compound consisted of nothing but staff members it was easy to calcula fuel costs others however lived in individual houses or compounds with nonun staff coming up with fair process of tax free fuel distribution took time according to unmil official 1 13 unmil official 2 formerly at unmil 39 unmil official 2 was an official at unmil and previous resident of compound 1 compound he also advised that in septe mber 2003 liberia was dangerous place and it was crucial that unmil find suitable office space and living accommodations at the time staff members were ei ther working out of hotel rooms or sleeping on the floor of their offices unmil offi cial 2 acknowledged that he entered into discussions with the landlord of compound 1 an d did provide him the letter of intent as the original proposal was that unmil wou ld rent the property direct upon discussions with dpko it was realized that such an agreement would significantly impact upon the msa allowance unmil official 2 advised t hat when this information was passed on to the unmil staff members interested in residing in compound 1 they refused to accept any reduction to their msa and in dicated they would seek accommodation elsewhere it was at this point that it was decided that staff welfare or tenants committee would rent the property direct 40 unmil official 2 also acknowledged the request to new york for interim financing compound 1 at the time had been complet ely vandalized during the previous civil conflict in liberia and the landlord was requ esting an upfront payment of rent to complete the repairs dpko agreed to the special r equest and the funds were paid back by unmil staff members through an appropriated dedu ction of msa in regards to the generators unmil official 2 advised there was n ever any intent to have generators installed on site permanently the init ial generators were installed on loan to assist the landlord with the immediate repairs nd to provide security lighting for unmil staff members who began to move into the prop erty as early as december 2003 he stated it was fully understood that the committe would have to purchase its own generators once the loan to dpko had been paid off insofar as the generators installed at compound 2 unmil official 2 stated he had nothing to do with this decision at the time he was out of the mission n medical leave and upon his return someone had authorized the installations when ques tioned directly he stated he did not know if this authorization had been provided by unm il official 1 he did however comment that he advised unmil official 1 not to be member of the tenants committee at compound 1 because of what was perceiv ed to be close association with the landlord ie that both unmil official 1 and the landlord are the same nationality unmil official 2 advised that unmil official 1 did not follow his recommendations and that he was in fact member of the compound 1 tenants committee upon its inception 41 with regards to unmil fuel being provided to co mpound 1 unmil official 2 acknowledged that other staff members approached hi m to complain how they felt it was an unfair senior unmil management subsequently he ld meetings on the matter and agreed it was only fair to provide unmil fuel to ot her staff members vi findings generators 14 42 in september 2003 unmil was established by resolution 1509 this was the same month that unmil official 2 provided loc businessman with letter of intent to lease compound 1 the letter noted that unmil intended to provide all power generation services 43 prior to the establishment of morss unsecoord policies in relation to residential security were covered under moss appl icable residential security moss provisions in 2003 were limited to generators only for emergency lighting and communications 44 upon review of invoices from the unmil generato r unit two 100 kva generators were installed in october 2003 36 kv generator was installed on january 10 2004 to provide back up communication system for senior unmil staff this specific installation meets the requirements of bot h the moss and security phase operations of unmil and in fact such provisions re main in place at compound 1 today there were policy provisions requests or unseco ord authorizations for the installation of generators capable of providing 24 hour amenities to the unmil staff members at either compound 1 or compound 2 45 unmil official 1s position is that compound 1 was originally set up to be an office away from the office due to the potential of conflict in the center of the city wherein the unmil headquarters were located this assertion could fall in line with the standby communications requirements but nonetheless would not require generators capable of providing 24 hour electrical capabilitie s to an entire compound his argument however loses significant credibility in that the s enior unmil official at the time resided near the unmil headquarters plus the fact t hat all unmil staff other than those residing at compound 1 were required to live on the south side of monrovia due to security concerns notwithstanding any of thi s unmil official 2 has stated that it was common knowledge that the compound 1 committee would have to purchase its own generators once the loan to dpko was paid back this statement contradicts any assumption that the compound was being set up as an office the specific payment provisions also hold little weight as the funds bor rowed from new york were merely an advance to the landlord of rental payments so that he could commence necessary repairs the funds being deducted through msa to repay dpko were really nothing different than the monthly rent the committee would have been paying the landlord all along if he had not requested an advance payment the financia l burden on the committee in march 2004 in fact was different that that of septembe r 2004 and as such there is little if any rationale to support the notion that the committee could purchase their own generators once the loan to dpko was paid off 46 during the course of the idoios investigation unmil official 2 and unmil official 1 have both indicated it was the other one who authorized the installation of the generators at compound 2 the circumstantial evide nce of emails from the generator unit staff would seem to indicate that it was unmil official 1s decision notwithstanding any of this if there was any operational rationale to support the installation of full time generators in 2003 then unmil official 2 should have 15 reassessed this decision in 2004 final determinat ions on the generator issue however really become relevant upon review of the memorandu m written by unmil official 2 to unmil official 1 on october 1 2004 in the corres pondence unmil official 2 acknowledges that compound 2 has two generators and as such feels that because of this disparity compound 1 should be provided another generator fo r the provision of services as indicated in the agreement letter acting within his official capacity of doa his memorandum has condoned the installment of generators to compound 2 in staff compound to which there is clearly operati onal requirement for full time generators and contradicts any assumption that the compound 1 committee was ever really intent on purchasing its own generators collectively the evidence adduced by the memorandum provides operational requirements or rationale to support full time generators in either compound 47 other issues surrounding the unmil generators t hat are of concern focus on the aspect of maintenance in both compound 1 and comp ound 2 non staff are providing daily maintenance on unmil assets worth ver us140000 scheduled maintenance on the generators has amounted to us12 35432 of which us147699 was provided to the compound 1 landlords privatel owned generator 48 current morss policy also requires further exam ination of the generator issue the underlying principle of morss standards dictate that 100 of the costs of determined residential security measures should be the responsibility of the organization in regards to generators morss policy states case specific where it may be shown that power fai lures are directly attributable to the security situation at duty st ation or have direct bearing on the security of staff in such cases consideratio n should be given to the hiring or purchase of basic home generators such generators should be capable of basic power for the provision of emergency lighting for t he house in cases where this was approved the maintenance and fuel would be the responsibility of the staff member 49 once again current unsecoord guidelines only llows for the consideration of generators for the provision of emergency lighti ng for the house it does not provide authorization for 24 hour amenities and in fact als notes that maintenance and fuel are the responsibility of the staff member the curren t operating procedures in unmil however provide for monthly fuel allowance rather than the hiring or purchase of basic home generators the policy in place as authorized by unsecoord seems to contradict unsecoords own guidelines there appear s to be little doubt that the intent of the policy was to address security requir ements in duty location where power is supplied but subject to interruption what case by case pr ovisions are to be provided in country where there is electrical grid is n ot specifically addressed by the morss guidelines what does remain clear however is that current morss policy provides that approved security measures are to be born entirely by the rganization and that such measures in the case of generators specifically xcluding fuel and maintenance costs would be limited to the provision of emergency lighting only 16 approved unmil mossmorss policy 50 unsecoord policy for both moss and morss emphas izes that approved security provisions are the minimum operating standards upon review of unmil mossmorss standards as approved by unsecoord the words should be installedprovided should if necessary it is ggested it is recommended contradict the most basic intention and application of mossmorss minimum standard cannot be left open to such interpretation when th validity of insurance claims the safety of staff members and financial entitleme nts are of final consequence fuel 51 under the current sofa agreement unmil internat ional staff members are entitled to fuel at tax and duty free prices in d ecember 2003 staff members at compound 1 were immediately provided these provisio ns it was not until the complaints of other unmil staff members that senior management extended this provision to others in august 2004 the perception of this issue tends to illustrate some of the concerns associated to compound 1 upon analysis the decis ion to provide generators or fuel to the occupants of compound 1 was never reall brought into question and yet similar considerations were either never or at leas t not immediately provided to other unmil staff members and only after they had compla ined the same issues of perception can be argued in relation to the lebanes landlords being provided electricity from generators using tax free fuel as negoti ated through unmil official 1 why are these provisions not written directly into the contract why have the landlords not faced any increase in fuel prices why are the re allegations that the landlords have breached their agreements in relation to the cost f fuel per dwelling not even withstanding the perception issue article 15 f the status of forces agreement notes that unmil has the right to import free of duty or other restrictions equ ipment provisions supplies fuel and other goods which are for the exclusive and of ficial use of unmil or for resale in the commissaries provided for her eafter businessmen earning living in liberia simply have legal entitlemen t to the provisions or direct benefits of tax free fuel as such the negotiations to allow the provision of tax free fuel to the landlords have facilitated tax evasion on their par t notwithstanding contravention of the status of forces agreement by unmil road maintenance 52 most of the witnesses advised that graders ar seen throughout monrovia doing road maintenance as far as the roads adjace nt to compound 1 and compound 2 are concerned there are numerous military outposts in the immediate area which would support the need for road maintenance while the i doios investigation could find actual documentation in this regard witnesses did confirm that graders on occasion had been seen within compound 1 doing road maintena nce notwithstanding the fact that the current lease agreement specifies that the landlord is responsible for all maintenance assets are evidently at least occas ionally being used 17 other issues 53 the head of engineering stated that the helicop ter pad in compound 1 was authorized in case of the need to evacuate personne l mossmorss provisions however do not support this argument as the constru ction of helicopter pads are authorized to provide for the emergency evacuation of staff from office premises only unmil official 1s argument in this regard was that compound 1 was originally set up to be an office away from the office notwithstand ing what weight this argument actually provides it was recognized by idoios tha t the force commander resides at compound 1 and as such would have the operational r equirements for immediate access to helicopters 54 the quality of the issue and handover vouchers issued by the unmil generator unit raises concern as do matters expressed by sta ff members who have assets assigned to their inventory when they never request ed them it seems evident that applicable policy is not being followed by members of the unit such infractions can be indicators of any number of things including fraud mismanagement laziness andor excessive demands on staff 55 while several parties welcomed the unmil financ official as the treasurer of compound 1 he has in fact placed himself in conf lict of interest position each month the treasurer of the compound 1 tenants committee uthorizes payment of unmil fuel deliveries utilized on site there is however cl ear conflict of interest 56 numerous tenants of the compound 1 committee re quested an audit of the books to ensure financial aspects of the lease agreement were being kept above board while idoios investigators recognize the relevance and i mportance of this request it must be remembered that compound 1 the compound 1 tenants committee and the associated lease between the two parties are not components of the united nations and therefore any such audit is not the responsibility of the organiz ation 57 one of the inherent problems behind the allegat ions and any future resolution focuses on the application of united nations staff rule 1012 n conflict of interest with the exception of the former senior unmil offic ial all senior unmil staff and the majority of departmentsection heads ie engineer inggenerators and finance reside in compound 1 the idoios investigation has establis hed that the compound 1 and compound 2 tenants committees are in fact indebted to the organization for the depreciation costs for over us278085 worth of generators and us1235432 in maintenance costs if the organization is to seek reimbursement for these losses other factors would have to be considered including adjus tments for approved security allowances and even more importantly under just wh at provisions should reimbursement be sought against current and new occupants of the compounds as compared to the numerous former occupants who are longer unmil r possibly even staff members as is evident any decision to enforce co mpensation to the organization cannot be made by staff members residing in eith er compound 1 or compound 2 without invoking the provisions of staff rule 10 12 n 18 vii conclusions 58 due to the years of internal conflict there is electrical power grid within liberia all electrical power is as such supplied by generator persons quality of life in war torn country such as liberia is influenced ultimately by reliable supply of electricity and in essence by the high cost of l and maintenance to keep generators operating 59 the idoios investigation acknowledges that wor king conditions in monrovia in september 2003 were insecure but also notes that wh atever limited considerations can be given to setting up official operations in compound 1 or which might have originally been used to justify the installation of generat ors running 24 hours day with the capacity to provide full electrical amenities to component of 80 100 staff members they cannot be legally supported now or indeed as of last year 60 the idoios investigation indicates manipulat ion of united nations policies on the part of unmil official 1 and unmil official 2 t provide staff members the significant benefit of utilizing generators cost free 24 hours day for the provision of all amenities if there was any rationale to suppo rt the installation of generators for office provisions in 2003 both unmil official 1 an d unmil official 2 failed in their responsibilities to reassess these requirements in 2004 this is further evident by unmil official 1s decision as later condoned by u nmil official 2 to install generators to compound 2 location in which there was absolutely operational requirements for generators further manipulati on of policy and the status of forces agreement by unmil official 1 has facilitated tax i nvasion on the part of investors working in liberia limited breach of assets in the provision of road maintenance by unknown staff members has also provided personal benefit to staff members and the private landlord of compound 1 viii recommendations 61 in view of these findings of this investigation idoios recommends the following recommendation 1 it is
