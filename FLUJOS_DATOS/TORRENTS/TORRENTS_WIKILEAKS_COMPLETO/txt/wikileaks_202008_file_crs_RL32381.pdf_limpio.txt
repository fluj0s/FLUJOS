summary with the upsurge in violence in iraq in recent months members of congress and others have voiced concerns about whether the 373 billion received by the army in the fiscal year 2004 emer gency supplemental pl108106 will be sufficient to fund operations for the remainde r of the fiscal year or whether second supplemental is needed before the end of th fiscal year in recent testimony before the house armed services committee chairman of the joint chiefs of staff richard myers suggested that the army is facing shortfall of 4 billion for fy2004 and stated that the department of defe nse dod was assessing whether additional resources could be found from within eith er dods regular or current supplemental appropriations or whether mo re funds would be needed using monthly obligations data on the cost of army operations in iraq this report estimates the size of the potential army funding shortf all and assesses whether suffi cient funding is likely to be available to fund the armys military personnel and operati on and maintenance om requirements for its war time missions in iraq in fy2004 as of the end of february 2004 combined funding obligations for iraq afghanistan and enhanced security for fense installations operation noble eagle for all services totaled 270 billion or about 32 billion less than forecast for the army in particular howev er obligations totaled 179 billion or about 16 billion higher than anticipated primarily becau of operations in iraq based on crs estimates for iraq the army might face shortfall in fy2004 of from 53 billion to 71 billi on for that mission depending on assumptions about likely monthly obligations for the remainder of the year at the same time however the army might be able to finance such shortfall using about 70 bi llion in funds that are available because certain other costs are proving to be lower than anticipated for example dod recently lowered rates charged to the services for transportati on of personnel and equipment because those rates exceeded costs and obligations to cover enhanced security at defense installations are running about 2 billion ss than forecast some peacetime training exercises which were slated for troops th at are currently deployed have also been cancelled this report includes monthly data on the co st of operations in iraq afghanistan and enhanced security for defense inst allations for fy2003 and fy2004 to assess estimates of costs for the rest of fy2004 or for the fy2005 supplemental it could be useful for congress to ve data beyond that currently available including

this year member s also questioned the admin istration about its initial decision to wait until january 2005 to request supplemental for the next fiscal year fy2005 because this decision would require

as funds currently budgeted for othe r services could be tapped to meet shortfall of the 652 billion appropriated to dod in the fy2004 emergency supplemental the army received about 373 billion or about 60 of the funding6 with the largest number of forces deployed in iraq and afghanistan the army is the service that is most vulnerable to unanticipated changes in cost the recent announcement by dod that additional forces will be remaining in iraq because of ongoing conflict has heighten ed concerns about the adequacy of funding in fy20047 because of the armys key role and vul nerability this report focuses on the cost picture facing the army in the second half of fy2004 and in particular on military personnel and operation and maintenance co sts because these accounts pay for the daytoday operating costs in iraq and cannot easily be deferred decisions about investment costs on the other hand typically take longer time and can if necessary be made at later time estimating the potential

calculations based on dfas monthly obligations reports 16 these estimates exclude 12 billion in army investment funds relatively small part of the total of 36 billion for the army for operations in iraq because decisions about use of procurement funds can be delayed because those funds are available for three yearsestimating the armys potential shortfall in fy2004 in recent testimony general richard myers chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told the house armed services committee that the shortfall for fy2004 could be about 4 billion14 the basis for this estimate is unclear but it may be based on the difference between the average monthly burn rat for fy2004 obligations to date of 53 billion and the projected monthly burn ra for the year of 51 billion plus 700 million to keep 20000 additional troops for three months15 dod is currently conducting midyear review to better determine the size of the likely shortfall and resources available to offset that shortfall the discussion below presents several estimates of the size of the armys potential shortfall in fy200416 the estimates rely on three alternative assumptions about average monthly costs or burn rates for military pe rsonnel and operations and maintenance spending longerterm average reflecting costs between february 2003 and february 2004 that covers from the beginning of the iraq buildup through the most recent dfas data available shorter average reflecting costs to date in fy2004 and tailored estimate based on steady state costs prior to the latest upsurge in violence with an adjus tment to reflect dod plans to keep 20000 troops incountry and high er operating tempo costs in each case these estimates are comp ared to dods for ecast of an ticipated obligations based on the fy 2004 emergency supplemental military personnel cost shor tfall may be manageable for military personnel the key factors in determining costs are force levels and the extent of reliance on reserve forces table 4 compares dods forecast with three estimates of potential costs for military personnel in iraq for fy2004 using longerterm average an average based on fy2004 and tailored estimate adjusted for recent developments based on these three estima tes the army could face shortfall in military personnel funding ranging from 120 million to 600 million in fy2004 the army has total of 411 billion in military personnel funding from the fy2004 regular and fy2004 supplem ental appropriations total force levels for operation iraq i freedom including both support forces and forces incountry were slated to drop from highpoint of 252 000 in april 2003 to 220000 in september 2003 to 157000 by september 2004 force levels inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32381crs8 17 figures from osdc briefing to house budget

baseline projects the remainder of fy2004 using the cost in october 2003 with an adjustment of 350 m illion to cover the cost of keeping an additional 20000 military personnel incountry for six months costs for army military personnel were forecast to grow from 628 million in october 2003 to high of 930 million in marc h 2004 at the height of the swapout and then fall by the end of the year to 750 million per month the armys costs do not drop in proportion with force levels pe rhaps because of dods plans to increasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32381crs9 18 during osdcomptroller briefing to the house budget committee congressional budget office on contingency operations timating funding execution february 2004 dod officials stated that the incremental costs for activated reservists was about 6000 per month compared to 1000 per month for activeduty forces 19 for example increasing the reserves share of total force levels by 2 would increase costs by about 36 because of the higher incremental cost of activating reservistsits reliance on reserves who cost about si x times as much in incremental pay costs18 dod is also using supplemental funding to finance the cost of paying about 30000 activeduty forces above its planned strength levels because the estimate of 600 million shortf all relies on an average that reflects the higher force levels in fy2003 when the army was conducting major combat operations that estimate ma be less credible usin g an estimate based on fy2004 obligations to date has the advantage of more closely capturing current force levels but the disadvantage of including spikes in costs during the winter of 2003 when incoming troops were being trained and the spring of 2004 when outgoing forces handed over duties to their replacements the tailored estimate has the advantage of capturing the armys costs before the current buildup for the rotation of for ces and also reflecting dods latest plans to keep 20000 additional forces incountry for three to six month period to be conservative this estimate assumes the additional 20000 tr oops will be kept for six months on the other hand using an av erage for october 2003 may not capture the higher costs associated with dods plans to increase its reliance on reserve forces whose incremental costs are considerably higher19 given the relatively small size of the estimated shortfalls and the uncertainty in these estimates it appears likely that the army will have sufficient resources for its military personnel in iraq if however there is shortfall the army may be able to use resources originally slated for personne l rotations which may be delayed for those troops deployed in iraq or curtail current plans to increase reliance on more costly reserve forces om costs for iraq likely to exceed forecast resources for the armys operation and maintenance om activities depend on wide variety of factors including force levels transportation costs operating tempo and overseas support costs the cost of operating and maintaining quipment varies with the size of the forces deployed and the intensity of us age which in turn depend on the types of operations conducted the cost of supporting troops overseas is also considerably different than peacetime rates because of longer supply lines higher costs for contracts high security costs and the need to build and maintain facilities overseashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32381crs10 for the three estimates shown in table 5 below all of these factors come into play the estimates in table 5 suggest that the army could require additional resources to cover om costs in 2004 in iraq ranging from 54 billion to 71 billion the extent of the potential shortf all varies with the estimating assumption table 5 army fy2004 operation

billion in transportation costs major combat operations in the spring of fy2003 and spikes in october 2003 and january 2004 which reflect large logcap contracts to build f acilities and pport troops b average during fy2004 includes some costs which appear to be onetime or may cover future costs such as stocking up supplies for higher optempo in october 2003 and large logcap contracts signed in october 2003 and january 2004 to build f acilities and support troops over the coming months c adjusted baseline projects the remainder of fy2004 uses monthly estimate of 16 billion reflecting reported obligations in february 2004 and adjustments of dods estimate of 11 billion to cover the cost of k eeping an additional 20000 military personnel incountry for six months and 20 billion to replenish spare parts and repair equipment after period of more intense operations relying on longerterm average has the advantage of smoothing out temporary dips and spikes in obligations data on the other hand using that 13 month average to project future costs includes substantial onetime costs that would not be relevant to costs in the rema inder of fy2004 for example 8 billion to transport military equipment supplies and pers onnel to the iraqi theater and high operating tempo costs because of major combat operations conducted during the spring of 2003 these higher costs are offs et to some extent by including februaryhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32381crs11 20 in testimony before the house armed services committee on april 212004 general myers chair of the joint chiefs of staff estimated that it would cost dod about 700 million to keep an additional 20000 troops in iraq for three months that total included both military personnel and om costs to be conservative crs doubled that figure assuming that those troops would be kept fo r six rather than three months the 20 billion estimate for higher optempo draws on dfas da ta showing that in october 2003 the army obligated 12 billion for higher optempo cost s just before period of heightened operations as well as other information that amount was about six times as much as during the next four months2003 the initial month of buildup and othe r months when om obligations were low using shorter average that reflects experience in fy2004 has the advantage of excluding those initial costs on the other hand included in the 11 billion in om costs in the first part of fy2004 are spikes of 1 billion for optempo costs and 16 billion for large support contract in october 2003 and 12 billion in january for another large support contract t hose support contracts may include onetime costs to build facilities for troops as well as several months of future support costs including those expenses could skew th monthly average for the period and therefore overstate costs for the remainder of the year to develop an estimate that captures both the most recent costs and higher costs for the rest of the year due to the current upsurge in violence in iraq crs created third estimate that estima assumes monthly om costs of about 16 billion based on february obligations and additions of 11 billi on to support the additional 20000 troops for the remainder of the year and 20 billion to replenish parts and maintain equipment in theater after the current surge in operations20 under those assumptions the army could face shor tfall of about 54 billion similar to the estimate based on longerterm average potential ways to cover higher army om costs for iraq to cover potential shortfall of from 53 billion to 71

transportation costs lower supply costs deferred peacetime tr aining activities transfers of funds from the iraqi freedom fund and transfer of investment funds table 6 includes estimates for these poten tial savings totaling 67 billion to 70 billion the army could use some of the savings below such as lower transportation costs without transferring funds between appropriation accounts in other cases such as savings from lower secu rity costs at air force installations dod would need to request transfer of funds from the congress with about 2 billionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32381crs12 21 congress provided dod with 3 billion in general transfer authority in the fy2004 emergency supplemental see section 1101 in pl108106 22 dod refers to this mission as operation noble eagle 23 to transfer funds from the air force to the army dod would need to submit prior approval reprogramming to congress for some time the army has been providing security services for many air force bases including providing 8000 reservists some of those services may now be provided by civilians 24 see section 332 in pl 107314remaining in its general transfer au thority for fy2004 supplemental funds dod can move monies between accounts with congressional approval21 lower costs for security at defense installations although the army is likely to face higher om costs in iraq dod may have in cluded higherthan necessary funds to cover the cost of pr oviding enhanced security for defense installations22 if monthly costs in the rest of the year reflect experience through february 2004 enhanced security may co st about 21 billion less than forecast obligations to that date are about 550 million less than forecast for the army and about 740 million less than forecast for the air force23 table

of transfers and other sources these savings may reflect in part decision by dod use civilian contractors rather than activated reservists to provide security at defense installations authority to use civilians was initially provide d in the fy2003 dod authorization act24 civilian contract security personnel may cost substa ntially less than the 72000 year average cost of activa ting reservist cited by dodhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32381crs13 25 although dod estimates of supplemental costs are intended to reflect incremental costs they do not appear to have captured the effect of spreading fixed costs for transportation and other supply services over the much larger base of wartime and peacetime usage when prices for supplying parts or providing services exceed costs cash accumulates in the working capital funds which provide those services beyond the amount needed to carry out business that excess cash can either be transf erred to the customers the services whose om accounts finance these costs or dod can lower the rates charged to the services 26 the recent lowering of rates is in addition to congressional actions in the fy2004 dod appropriations act as matter of policy th organizations that stock supplies or provided services known as working capital funds set prices to cover but not exceed the cost of providing goods and services to the various commands when the prices charged exceed the cost prices are cut in the following year or customer accounts receive refunds see for example section 8104 in hrept 107283 also srept 10887 for reductions of 200 million in the air force working capital fund to reflect excess requirements and reduction of 107 m illion in army working capital f und reductions p 41 and p 31 the defense authorizers also reduced working capital funds for the same reason excess cash balances see for example hrept 108354 p 648 to reduce cash balances in the working capital funds congress directed dod to transfer cash in the working capital funds to the om customer accounts 27 dod generally relies on the most recent cost factors used by the services to estimate the incremental cost of military operations those factors would not reflect the effects of the higher workload information from services 28 the army could apply savings in operating costs to warrelated operating costs without submitting transfer requestlower transportation nd other support costs dod has experienced unanticipated decreases in some support co sts because of the higher operating tempo due to the war and occupation of iraq and afghanistan for example the additional demand for transportation servi ces and spare parts generate d by iraq and afghanistan has reduced the average cost of providing spare parts and transportation services in part because overhead costs are spread over higher workload25 dod recently transferred about 1 billion to army om accounts to reflect the fact that the prices charged to army and other commands for transportation costs were higher than necessary to cover costs the transportation command lowered its rates for the current year for the same reason26 together these decisions reduce costs for both peacetime and warrelated ope rations below the funding that was included in the fy2004 regular and supplem ental appropriations acts for similar reasons other supplies and services may also be overpriced fuel costs may also be less than anticipated because kuwait has provided u s forces with free fuel27 deferral of peacetime training exercises because of the large number of army troops deployed considerably larger than anticipated when the fy2004 budget was constructed some planned exercises may not be conducted this year savings from those exercises could be app lied to finance the armys operations in iraq28 although the army will need to conduc t training exercises when those troops return om funds for this years ex ercises may be greater than needed transfers from the iraqi freedom fund in fy2003 congress provided 158 billion in the iraqi freedom f und flexible tr ansfer account dod ishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32381crs14 29 an additional transfer of 450 million fo r coalition provisional authority expenses appears to be pending 30 see table 3 in crs report rl32090 fy2004 supplemental appropriations for iraq afghanistan and the global war on terrorism military operation reconstruction assistance by stephen daggett larry nowels cu rt tarnoff and rhoda margesson dod would have to get approval from congress to transfer funds between appropriations account some of this funding may already have been allocated to the services permitted to transfer those funds to indi vidual appropriation account s five days after notifying congress to date dod had transferred about 12 billion of those resources to army om to fund body armo r for troops in iraq repair of oil facilities and adminis trative support costs of the coalition provisional authority29 dods forecast of obligations include d only funds from th fy2004 emergency supplemental transfers of fy2003 monies thus provide additional resources to finance expenses experienced in fy2004 and so could reduce the size of the estimated shortfa ll outlined above dod also may be holding additional funds in the iraqi freedom fund iff to be transferred to the services at later da for example there appears to be about 300 million still available from the fy2003 iraqi freedom fund that could be provided to the army about 600 million may also remain available from fy2004 iff monies that could be transferred to cover higher than anticipated army costs transferring procurement funds fr om emergency supplementals to recapitalize or replace stocks damaged or dest royed in wartime the fy20004 emergency supplemental included 59 b illion in procurement and research development test evaluati on funds some of which coul d be transferred to cover higherthananticipated operating costs if necessary30 dod has required additional justification from the services for use of these procurement monies because of concern that the funds be used only for th equipment most likely to be needed adequacy of information to assess warrelated costs the variation in the estimates above nd in the underlying obligations data suggests that congress may need more detailed information on costs in iraq and afghanistan particularly in order to assess the fy2005 supplemental although dod has provided monthly obligations data by mission those data are inherently variable it might be more useful to tr ack outlays which might better reflect costs incurred it might also be useful for dod to provide congress with monthly manpower levels by mission since september 2001 pla nning assumptions and the cost factors associated with maintaining forces inc ountry or in the surrounding areas dod did not provide this information in its jus tification materials s ubmitted with the fy2002 fy2003 or fy2004 supplemental requests w ith that information congress couldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32381crs15 better assess dods reque st taking into account antic ipated troop levels during fy2005 in addition presentation that gregates onetime from recurring costs could be particularly helpful in assessing future requests for supplemental funds in the years to come since much of the fixed cost of deploying equipment and setting up facilities for troops in iraq has been incurred table a1 monthly cost of iraq afghanistan and enhanced security october 2003 february 2004 in billions of dollars monthmission
