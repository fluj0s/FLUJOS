title vii programs was in the health education partnerships act of 1998 pl 105392 which added authority for geriatrician training and health workforce analysis among others though authority for these programs expired at the end of fy2002 congress has continued to fund most of them each year since then the effectiveness of title vii health professions programs has long been subject of debate evaluating program effectiveness is complicated by differing perspectives on the ultimate program goals by continuous evolution of the programs and by the influence of other federal and private sector programs on provider supply and demand the unresolved debate about title vii program effectiveness has resulted in recommendations from the administration to eliminate many of these programs recommendations which have persisted for many years this report will examine the legislative programmatic and funding histories of title vii health professions programs and discuss issues including

1963 responding to projections of an impending physician shortage congress passed the health professions educational assistance act pl 88129 to support the training of health professionals this act which authorized grants for the construction of new teaching facilities was the first comprehensive legislation to address health care provider supply related programs authorized in title vii of the public health service act phsa have evolved in subsequent reauthorizations beginning in the 1980s funding for these programs became more focused on alleviating geographic and speciality maldistribution of health professionals rather than increasing their overall supply in the 1990s title vii programs emphasized support for primary care professionals students from disadvantaged andor diverse backgrounds and individuals who were willing to practice in medically underserved communities in 1998 the most recent authorization of title vii programs congress regrouped programs into functional clusters pl 105392 health professions education and partnerships act this led to the creation of range of grants programs for the development of wide range of health care professionals that make up the health workforce employing primary care and public health as frameworks the legislation targeted underrepresented minorities in the health professions students and residents training in primary care medicine and dentistry faculty in health education primary health care and public health and communitybased institutions that were in support of creating and building networks for the education and training of the health workforce physicians physician assistants nurses psychologists pediatricians community health workers geriatric students pharmacy students paraprofessional and many more would receive support for education and training in the initial years of the program further pl 105392 provided support for the analysis of the nations health workforce in anticipation of pending and future needs to address supply and demand issues throughout the united states title vii programs are administered by the bureau of health professions at the health resources and services administration hrsa in the department of health and human services hhs title vii programs provide scholarships to students through grants and loans to institutions for fy2008 the enacted appropriation for title vii programs is 194 million the fy2009 presidents request contains funding for any of the title vii programs hrsa also administers two related programs in health workforce development the national health service corps nhsc is authorized under title iii of the phsa and administered by the hrsa bureau of primary health care the nhsc is scholarship and loan repayment program for certain health care workers who crs2 commit to future service in areas of the country experiencing shortage of health care providers eligible providers include primary care physicians doctors of medicine or osteopathy primary care nurse practitioners physician assistants dentists and dental hygienists certified nurse midwives social workers psychologists and other mental health providers1 the second program nursing workforce development is authorized in title viii of the phsa and administered by the bureau of health professions programs in title viii focus exclusively on programs for the education and training of nurses at basic and advanced levels of education title viii programs provide scholarships loans and grants to achieve policy objectives2 variety of other federal programs also provide support for health professions training including graduate medical education gme programs administered through the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in hhs clinical research training supported by the national institutes of health in hhs and training programs in the departments of defense and veterans affairs these other programs may or may not provide training that is targeted toward clinical specialization the hrsa programs in titles iii vii and viii of the phsa are the only federal programs intended to counter market forces that encourage specialization these programs instead aim to improve the placement of providers in underserved areas improve the racial and ethnic diversity of providers and push back against market forces favoring specialization by encouraging generalist providers those in primary care family medicine and geriatrics according to the department of labor seven of the 20 fastest growing occupations are in the health workforce home health aides medical assistants physician assistants physical therapist assistants dental assistants dental hygienists and personal and home care aides comprise the seven groups health care aides and assistant occupations are projected to grow especially quickly as organizations try to control costs individuals in these occupations may be expected to assume some duties formerly done by more highly paid health care professionals such as dentists nurses physicians and therapists furthermore continued population growth coupled with an aging populations will continue to demand high level of quality health care services3 the effectiveness of title vii health professions programs in meeting variety of stated objectives has long been subject of debate this has resulted in recommendations from the

of medicine dentistry and osteopathy in the 1970s when studies indicated that physician shortage appeared to have subsided the emphasis of title vii programs shifted through several reauthorizations in the 1970s and 1980s title vii programs were seen as means to improve maldistributions of physicians and other health professionals programs were authorized to increase the numbers of health professionals in underserved mostly rural or innercity areas and to improve the racial and ethnic diversity of the health workforce in addition programs were developed to counter the nationwide trend among medical residents toward specialization the major objective of these programs was to increase support for training and curriculum development in primary care in 1998 congress reauthorized and consolidated health professions programs in the health education partnerships act pl 105392 creating new authority for programs in geriatrician training and health workforce analysis to provide administrative flexibility congress consolidated multiple existing or new programs into clusters the clusters identify the following areas for title vii health workforce development 1 training of minority and disadvantaged professionals 2 training in primary care medicine and dentistry 3 interdisciplinary community based linkages to establish training centers in remote areas 4 health

programs have continued to receive funding through annual appropriations health professions supported by title vii programs the health workforce comprises those who provide handson medical care those who provide ancillary technical and patientcare services paraprofessional and public health workers who study and address health problems in populations rather than individuals6 generally workers providing direct medical care or patientspecific technical services have specialty training and certification and are licensed by states and territories as condition of their practice these requirements do not generally apply to the public health workforce wide range of health professionals is eligible to receive support for the education and training activities offered through title vii programs education and training requirements vary for each profession and are reflected in the period of academic study residency requirements licensure requirements and other prerequisites for practice title vii support is also available to institutions that train health professionals groups of health professionals that are eligible for title vii support include physicians dentists mental and behavioral health professionals environmental health professionals dental assistants and medical assistants some title vii programs for training providers emphasize support for primary care those health care services rendered in general medicine and dentistry family practice and pediatrics these fields which emphasize breadth of skills and care for the whole patient contrast with specialty care which is often focused on specific organs or systems primary care providers who may include physicians dentists nurses or physician assistants provide primary care through integrated accessible health care services the american academy of family physicians representing primary care physicians defines its members as those who 6 in 2001 the national advisory committee on interdisciplinary communitybased linkages asserted that the allied health special project grants authorized under section 755 in title vii have supported projects that train home health aides they reported that emerging allied health fields that encompass paraprofessional such as home health aides and nursing assistants are essential to health care delivery although they have less clinical rigor in their training the committee also noted that since 1990 139 allied health special project grants have enabled schools to fund projects that provide training for paraprofessional first annual report to the

the patient to evaluate the patients total health needs and to provide personal care within one or more fields of medicine7 title vii also supports training of the public health workforce this workforce may include nurses and physicians though they may or may not render direct patient care in the course of their work public health workers may also be administrators technicians veterinarians animal control specialists environmental engineers sanitarians educators and community outreach workers8 the national public health workforce has been estimated at roughly 450000 to 500000 employed workers employed in health departments at the local state or federal levels in health care institutions in academia and in other settings considerable overlap exists among providers of primary care and those in public health as both are strongly oriented toward prevention of illness and injury individuals in both fields often move between them or work in both concurrently during the course of their careers allied health professionals support or assist in the delivery of public health services or primary health care they are involved with the delivery of health or related services pertaining to the identification evaluation and prevention of diseases and disorders dietary and nutrition services rehabilitation and health systems management and others dental hygienists diagnostic medical sonographers dietitians cardiovascular technologists medical technologists occupational and physical therapists are some examples9 these practitioners provide many kinds of services and they work in all types of settings including managed care hospitals laboratories health departments longterm care and home care settings funding for title vii programs since fy2002 the administration has

an adequate and capable health workforce is the ability to describe workforce strength in the present and to accurately project future needs federal leadership for health workforce analysis rests in the hrsa bureau of health professions national center for health workforce analysis nchwa11 in reauthorizing title vii and viii programs in 1998 congress stated three purposes for programs in health professions workforce information and analysis 1 provide for the development of information on the health professions work force and for the analysis of work force related issues 2 provide for the development of necessary information for decisionmaking regarding future directions in health professions and nursing programs 3 provide for continued analysis of issues affecting graduate medical education12 to meet these purposes hrsa has provided grants to state or local governments health professions schools schools of nursing academic health centers communitybased health facilities and other public or private nonprofit entities in order to conduct targeted information collection and analysis research highpriority workforce questions develop nonfederal analytic and research infrastructure and conduct program evaluation and assessment difficulties in measuring the health workforce are discussed below and represent something of first hurdle in meeting the title vii goals of improving the numbers distribution and diversity of nonspecialized health practitioners when it is not possible to count an existing workforce with confidence it may not be possible to proceed to next steps projecting future workforce needs in total or as percentage of population served defining shortage areas determining whether market trends in workforce sectors will assure an appropriate future supply and evaluating whether specific title vii programs are effective defining and enumerating the health workforce each year nchwa enters into cooperative agreements with six regional centers for health workforce studies to collect analyze and disseminate information and to monitor trends in the national state and local health workforce nchwa also supports efforts to describe the health workforce state by state and has published in depth and summary state profiles on its web page13 11 see hrsa national center for health workforce analysis home page at

terminology the us department of labor bureau of labor statistics bls uses system of standard occupational classification soc to collect calculate and disseminate data about the american workforce soc categories provide consistent format for use in the decennial census for federal agencies enumerating privatesector workforces relevant to their missions and for private entities interested in studying the american workforce workers are classified into one of over 820 occupations based on similar job duties skills education or experience health care workers whose disciplines are supported by title vii programs are classified in category 290000 health care practitioners and technical occupations which is further divided into diagnosing and treating practitioners such as physicians pharmacists and dentists and health technologists and technicians which includes among others laboratory and radiology technicians and dental hygienists the suffix in category 29 allows for finer designations for example therapists are coded in the 291120 series and respiratory therapists in particular are coded as 29112614 despite its overall utility the soc system falls short when applied to title vii programs in at least two important ways first only eight subcategories of physicians are available including other category likely to become progressively less helpful if trends toward specialization persist second public health workers target group for title vii programs which has grown in importance with the national emphasis on homeland security are not described in the socs they are likely to be counted as physicians nurses technicians or other practitioners depending on which degrees they may hold if any but the classification scheme misses the fact that their practice is on populations rather than individuals an analysis of efforts to enumerate workers in the nations local health departments found that the soc system did not correspond in meaningful ways with actual workers and their roles and concluded that state or national system is in place to track local public health workers in any way15 one of the few attempts to enumerate the national public health workforce estimated it at about 448000 individuals though this effort raised as many questions as it answered what types of training do these individuals have what proportion of their time is spent solely on public health practice versus personal health care teaching or research have they also been counted erroneously toward some other health workforce16 attempts by professional associations to enumerate workers in their disciplines sometimes yield results that conflict with bls findings for example in 2000 bls data indicated that there were 598000 physicians in the united states while study of the same year by the american medical association indicated almost 814000 or 14 us dept of labor bureau of labor statistics standard occupational classification system home page at

occupational statistics and employment projections18 in 2004 analysis projected trend toward growth in health sector jobs particularly among home health home care and personal care aides 19 employment of home health aides the occupation projected to grow the fastest and of personal and home care aides classified as personal service occupation should grow very rapidly as the elderly population expands and as efforts to contain health care costs continue the emphasis on less costly home care and outpatient treatment of elderly persons rather than expensive institutional care will lead to growing numbers of aides to provide inhome health care as well as personal care and housekeeping assistance in addition patients of all ages are being sent home from hospitals and nursing facilities as quickly as possible and many of those discharged need continued health care and personal care at home nchwa supports ongoing research to project workforce needs for specific health professions in greater depth these reports generally use bls data and frequently comment on the same dominant trends in supply and demand such as aging of both the population and the health workforce and the growing opportunities for women in higherpaying fields and their attrition from lowerpaying health care jobs specific trends are also noted for certain health professions such as the growth of outpatient prescription drug use and the projected growth in demand for pharmacists20 17 karen matherlee the us health workforce definitions dollars and dilemmas national health policy forum background paper

coordinated team of nurses geriatric psychiatrists physician assistants pharmacists social workers physical and speech therapists and others the geriatric team cares for the most complex and frail of

5 2008 crs18 the effectiveness of title vii programs the effectiveness of title vii health professions programs in meeting variety of stated objectives has long been subject of debate on the one hand administrations have proposed to eliminate many of the programs recommendations which have persisted for many years on the other hand congress has continued to fund these programs and they continue to evolve complicating the task of evaluating program effectiveness numerous views on program effectiveness and ways to improve program evaluation are discussed below differing views on program goals in general evaluating program effectiveness depends on linking performance to predetermined goals this simple maxim has proved troublesome when applied to hrsa title vii programs different parties from stakeholders to the administration to the congress have articulated different goals ranging from the very broad to the very specific and sometimes in conflict this has led to wide swath of official determinations of effectiveness and historical difference of opinion between congress and the executive branch regarding the merits of these programs in addition the evolution of program goals over time adds to the script of stated purposes for example the advisory committee for section 747 primary care medicine and dentistry programs recounted chronology of purposes in authorizing legislation beginning in 1963 with support for school construction the most basic bricksandmortar foundation of longterm capacitybuilding with each reauthorization the stated purposes evolved bringing in support for minority training and geographic distribution expanding residency slots opportunities for geriatric education and incorporating family medicine and dentistry along the way51 to some the moving goalpost of program objectives stymies efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of any one step to others this simply represents the natural progression of successful programs in 1997 in preparation for the 1998 reauthorization of hrsa title vii programs pl 105392 gao testified that the effectiveness of title vii programs will remain difficult to measure as long as they are authorized to support broad range of health care objectives without common goals outcome measures and reporting requirements52 the following sections will examine program goals from variety of perspectives the cluster of section 747 primary care medicine and dentistry programs will be cited frequently as an example these programs have reasonable evidence base upon which to consider the question of effectiveness as well as rich history of debate it is assumed that some of the elements of this controversy will apply equally well to the other program clusters 51 us dept of health and human services hrsa advisory

programs into seven clusters legislative language generally articulated objectives only for specific components within each cluster but the accompanying senate report 105220 june 23 1998 provided glimpse of congressional intent toward broader goals for each cluster as follows minority and disadvantaged health professionals training purposes 1 provide for the training of minority and disadvantaged health professionals to improve health care access in underserved areas and to improve representation in the health professions primary care medicine and dentistry purpose provide for the training of family physicians general internists general pediatricians physician assistants general dentists and pediatric dentists to improve access to and quality of health care in underserved areas interdisciplinary communitybased linkages purposes 1 provide support for training centers remote from health professions schools to improve and maintain the distribution of health providers in rural and urban underserved areas 2 provide support for geriatric education and geriatric faculty fellowships and 3 provide support for interdisciplinary training projects health professions workforce information and analysis purposes 1 provide for the development of information on the health professions work force and for the analysis of work force related issues 2 provide for the development of necessary information for decisionmaking regarding future directions in health professions and nursing programs and 3 provide for continued analysis of issues affecting graduate medical education public health workforce development purpose provide for an increase in the number of individuals in the public health work force and enhance the quality of such work force nursing workforce development not applicable these programs are found in title viii student financial assistance purposes 1 continue certain loan programs which do not require federal appropriations or that guarantee the availability of loan sources in the market for health professions students and 2 continue loan program for the disadvantaged53 most of the clusters carry statements of purpose that causally link an activity eg provide for the training of minority and disadvantaged health professionals to an outcome eg to improve health care access in underserved areas and to improve representation in the health professions while congress has funded each cluster in each fiscal year since reauthorization the administration has not always 53 most of the clusters also have the stated purpose of administrative simplification an overarching goal behind creating the clusters crs20 concurred with these assumptions of causality or with the assumption that these programs are effective in general despite the administrations annual budget proposals discussed below congress provided continued funding for all program clusters in title vii each year from fy2002 through fy2008 administration views

assessment rating tool often called part assessment for fy2003 the white house office of management and budget omb found lack of clarity of purpose in title vii programs giving them collectively 13 out of 100 rating for resultsaccountability and recommending continued phaseout of most health professions grants with redirection of funds to more effective options though none were stated54 in specific the assessment found 1 there is disagreement regarding the purpose of the program and clear and focused purpose is not found in the authorizing legislation external views and program documents for example the agency believes the purpose is to address the failure of the market to distribute health providers to all areas of the country and to serve all population groups others believe the purpose is to primarily to help rural areas or to subsidize schools 2 while the program has been managed well overall it has not regularly used performance data to improve program outcomes the gao noted in 1997 that effectiveness has not been shown and the impact will be difficult to measure without common goals outcome measures and reporting the program has adopted new performance benchmarks but lacks data to demonstrate progress in her testimony to congressional appropriators regarding the fy2005 budget proposal hrsa administrator elizabeth duke expanded on the administrations rationale for cutting back or eliminating the health professions programs stating that the preference of the administration is to put more money into direct health care delivery and less money into some of the programs that have been historically used only 30 percent of the graduates of these programs actually end up in care to the underserved and the administrations position is that better way to go would be to fund direct care through the national health service corps55 views of formal advisors the advisory committee on training in primary care medicine and dentistry was created by

sess march 24 2004 crs21 advice and recommendations to the secretary of hhs regarding programs in section 747 as expected in order to provide tangible experience in program performance the committee is comprised of individuals who either work for institutions or represent professions that benefit from title vii programs the committee has issued two reports in the first published in november 2001 the committee concluded that these programs are effective in improving the numbers and distribution of targeted providers though much of the evidence cited is anecdotal and causal link between the program and outcomes is not always demonstrated56 the committee acknowledges this though in several statements about the difficulty in evaluating these programs saying several factors make it difficult to obtain direct evidence relevant to the influence of title vii section 747 programs on its primary goals first the program has continued to evolve since it began with these changes reporting methods have been modified and have not necessarily provided data relevant to the supply distribution and composition of primary care providers57 ironically the committee adds to the debate about title vii programs serving as counterweights to the marketdriven specialization trend suggesting that public funds as well as private sector forces may work against program outcomes and hamper their actual or perceived effectiveness the committee notes judgments about the effectiveness of these programs are further muddied because these programs represent only minor fraction of overall funding for medical education and training the billions of dollars in support of other national priorities such as biomedical research through the national institutes of health and the support through medicare graduate medical education in subspecialty areas have been powerful influences toward specialty rather than primary care training that dwarf the amounts expended to support title vii section 747 incentives58 stakeholder views responding to ombs unfavorable performance ratings for title vii programs the american academy of family physicians aafp has testified that omb criticized all of the title vii health professions programs as lacking focused objective however section 747 in particular has clear purpose and has been successful in achieving its goals the omb evaluation lumps all of the programs together and does not evaluate them individually by definition these programs will have different goals different levels of effectiveness and different histories making the part evaluation unsophisticated at best59 56 us dept of health and human services hrsa advisory committee on training in primary care medicine and dentistry comprehensive review and recommendations title

subcommittee on laborhhseducation in support of various continued crs22 the section 747 cluster does have stated purpose in authorizing legislation as noted above with respect to the apparent assumption by congress that subsidized training programs will lead to improved access and quality of care in underserved communities aafp points to the findings published in 2002 of comprehensive analysis of title vii programs between 1978 and 1993 in which 180000 medical school graduates were followed to evaluate their practice specialty and location in the year 2000 students who attended schools that received family medicine funding through title vii during their tenure chose family practice at rate of 102 students who attended schools that received title vii funding of any type for one or more years of their enrollment chose family practice at rate of 158 additionally title vii funding was associated with higher rates of practice in primary care health personnel shortage areas and with practice in rural area the authors concluded that title vii programs resulted in an additional 6968 family physicians involved in active patient care who would otherwise not have been with an aggregate input of 290 million in title vii funds to section 747 programs over the 15year study period60 resolving the effectiveness debate comprehensive studies such as the one about family physicians described above are few though some would argue that lack of evidence to demonstrate successful performance does not mean that title vii programs are ineffective the disagreements in evaluating section 747 programs highlight the difficult position in which congress finds itself what are the parameters of meaningful evaluation in terms of the timespan studied and the length of followup in an everchanging landscape should these evaluations be conducted by stakeholders is omb the best evaluator for process intended to aim freshman medical student at whatever shortages may exist eight years hence what is the societal value of well placed provider who would not otherwise be there adding to the challenge of evaluating effectiveness even if one concludes that title vii programs led to improved provider distributions what does that mean for access to care or to actual health outcomes for the population gao has noted that geographic measures of physician supply can be very rough measure of the actual accessibility of physician services in given area many people lack access even in an area with large number of physicians this lack of access is often due to economic facts lack of insurance medicaid coverage or low income in general may prevent many residents from receiving care from many of the 59 continued programs for fy2005 april 21 2004 at

keep the residents from seeking or receiving appropriate care61 many seek an end to the annual debate in which the administration congress and stakeholders propose eliminating or restoring budgets for title vii programs while evaluation methods continue to satisfy one the society of primary care policy fellows has called for new evaluation model saying over the 25year history of these programs extensive data have been collected but have not been effectively used to scientifically assess their impact for decade the office of management and budget and the general accounting office have repeatedly criticized hrsa for failing to perform regular objective comprehensive evaluations evaluation of the programs has also been hampered due to lack of legislated outcome measures and their reliance on the prevailing administrations priorities when it has been possible to collect data relevant to administration priorities for example to assess title viis impact on access to care in either health centers or through the national health service corps these data have not been collected for title vii this evaluation failure has meant decade of administration budget recommendations for funding62 the society recommends that an evaluator directly accountable to the congress be designated that the evaluator establish outcomesbased benchmarks and that there be routine data analysis to measure workforce production and distribution and population health the society also recommends that data be gathered to evaluate the impact of title vii programs on the distribution and deployment of the health workforce in federally qualified health centers and other underserved communities the gao has noted limitations in the part assessment process saying in particular some agency officials claimed that having multiple statutory goals disadvantaged their programs without further guidance subjective terminology can influence program ratings by permitting omb staffs views about programs purpose to affect assessments of the programs design and purpose63 this limitation may help to explain the part findings for title vii programs despite several statements in the assessment narrative itself that data for evaluation were limited suggesting finding of results not demonstrated the programs were instead rated ineffective gao noted that the part assessment process is being 61 us

lessons learned and gao recommended among other things closer coordination of omb with congress to improve the likelihood that future part assessments will accurately capture congressional intent in measuring program performance omb itself notes the limitations of its performance assessment rating tool saying information provided by performance measurement is just part of the information that managers and policy officials need to make decisions performance measurement must often be coupled with evaluation data to increase our understanding of why results occur and what value program adds performance measurement cannot replace data on program costs political judgments about priorities creativity about solutions or common sense major purpose of performance measurement is to raise fundamental questions the measures seldom by themselves provide definitive answers64 omb then describes six types of obstacles to good performance measurement and ways to mitigate them four of the descriptions apply to title vii programs as follows the programs outcomes are extremely difficult to measure this problem can result when the program purpose is not clear when the beneficiary or customer is not clearly defined when stakeholders and programs managers have different views of the program and when good data are not available omb suggests using qualitative information such as expert panel reviews when quantitative measures are lacking the program is one of many contributors to the desired outcome this problem results when several federal programs programs from various levels of government federal state local and privatesector or nonprofit activities all contribute to achieving the same goal omb recommends as one approach developing broad yet measurable outcome goals for the collection of programs while also having programspecific performance goals results will not be achieved for many years to address this issue omb suggests defining specific short and mediumterm steps or milestones to accomplish the longterm outcome goal these steps are likely to be outputoriented interim goals the program has multiple purposes and funding can be used for range of activities this problem occurs with federal programs that must offer some degree of local flexibility while still aiming toward national goals omb suggests developing both performance measures and national standards to provide joint accountability for programs and setting local targets for aggregation into national targets 64 us office of management and budget performance measurement challenges

phased out to new short and long term goals66 general trend is the elimination of goals to increase the number of providers and substitution of goals to increase the proportion of funded providers actually serving in the desired situation the shifting parameters while intended to provide more pertinent measures again reflect the difficulty in evaluating these steadilyevolving programs options for congress while congress has continued to fund title vii programs despite recent budget proposals for elimination reduced amounts put forward in budget proposals may affect budget ceilings the socalled 302b allocations for appropriations bills putting pressure on appropriators who wish to maintain title vii funding to offset the funds from elsewhere in reauthorizing title vii programs congress may wish to consider whether the annual funding cycle and evaluation process for these programs could be clarified through explicit authorizations for appropriations through specific statements of program purpose or outcomes in legislation or report language through requirements for expanded dialogue with officials at hrsa and omb to bridge the gaps between congressional and
