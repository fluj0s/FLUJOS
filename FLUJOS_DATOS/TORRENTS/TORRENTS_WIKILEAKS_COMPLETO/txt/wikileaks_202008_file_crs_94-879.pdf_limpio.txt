origins of the enlargem ent debate in central europe summary at the december 1994 nato ministerial m eeting the clinton administration will propose that the allies begin to draw criteria for possible new members poland the czech republic slovakia hungary and slovenia are the likely initial candidates russia is not under consideration proponents of nato expansion or enlarge ment believe th at it could serve to stabilize central european states seeking to build democracies and freemarket economies promote us investment and trade in the region lend stability to the whole of europe and serve to contain ru ssia should it become increasingly unstable and assertive opponents of nato enlargement believe that russia must first be engaged constructively they believe that ex pansion near russias borders instead of bringing stability would be seen as provo cative act in moscow they also contend that incorporating an unstable central europe would dilute natos political resolve and military capabilities and that enormous costs would be required to raise the level of central europes defense posture russia having traditional interests in europe opposes any extension of the alliance near its borders view held not only by nationalists but by centrist democrats and the yeltsin government nato is continuing to define mission that moves away from collective defense and towards more political objectives though few observers believe that russia is threat today the north atlantic treatys article v commitment to mutual defense will remain important until the appearance of stable democratic russia central european governments express different levels of desire to enter the alliance but all believe the article v commitment to be central to their consideration of eventual application for admittance criteria for entry will be central to any debate those believing that natos political objectives are the key to its future would require only that new members have functioning democracies and market economies those stressing the need for nato to maintain capable collective defense capacity contend that new members must also build strong militaries an ex pensive undertaking that could tax both current and future members some europeans believe that the eu ropean union eu instead of nato should guide the effort to bring stability to europe in this view because the cold war is over political and not military institutions should lead the effort to build security and the european union is more wellplaced to promote democracy and economic growth in the region in part because it is not seen by moscow as potential military threathttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94879abstract this paper captures the origins of the debate in 1994 over nato enlargement it analyzes the early rationale for enlargement and its possible effect upon russia it weighs the importance to the alliance and potential candidate states of the traditional mission of collective defense and the

political change in eur ope since 1989 has led to call for structural change in institutions meant to secure stability on the continent nato remains the principal institution through which the united states seeks to protect its interests in europe in light of greatly diminished threat from russia the alliance has sought to adjust its mission while collective defense remains its cornerstone the alliance is also attempting to meet more immediate needs such as developing an effective peacekeeping capacity and encouraging the growth of democratic institutions throughout europe the united states intends to make the expansion or enlargement of nato the principal issue at the nato minister ial meeting in december 1994 president clinton has said that enlargement would serve to anchor central european states to democracy the free market and stability however the clinton administration and congress are still in the process of clarifying us interests in central europe achieving consensus on those interests and how to secure them weighs heavily on the debate over enlargement the debate over enlargement is taking place within the context of evolving natorussian relations the united states and its european allies are attempting both to build cooperation with russia and to circumscribe moscows desire and ability to wield influence over its neighbors whether enlargement or other policies would best further these goals is the crux of the debate the debate over enlargement remains in its opening stages with the american public as yet barely engaged an extens ive public discussion of us interests in central europe has not take n place though consensus in congress and among the american people undoubtedly favors the stre ngthening of nascent democracies and free markets the more difficult issues lie in the price both economic and political to be paid to assure their survival th is report sketches the pro and arguments for enlargement analyzes us interests at stake in central europe and assesses the emerging components of the debate likel to affect decisions over expansionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94879crs2 pros and cons of enlargement not all proponents of enlargement advance the same rationale that said the following are the most common arguments in favor of enlargement enlargement would secure principal gain of the cold war by strengthening new free markets and democr acies in central europe western europe cannot enjo stability and prosper ity unless s imilar conditions prevail to the east war in the former yugoslavia and the ensuing ethnic tensions and flow of immigrants into western europe are evidence that unsettled conditions in centra l europe bring social tensions and the threat of wider instability to the entire continent central european states through mbership in interlocking european institutions could serve as bridge to mesh east and west central european states could make contribution to western security particularly through participating in peacekeeping operations should nationalistic assertive gove rnment succeed to power in russia central europe could c ontribute resources to natos defense posture and serve as an important buffer us and west european investments in central europe are growing and prospects for profitable trade are good but trade and investment require stable security environment if the european union eu expands as seems likely and nato does not decisions on european security affectin g us interests c ould be made without washingtons participation opponents of enlargement tend to stre ss issues touching upon defense and financial resources like proponents they may embrace some arguments and not others the following are the most common arguments against enlargement russia as the foremost power in europe must be engaged if not as full partner then as country with whic h europe and the united states may work to resolve key global issues enlargement would exclude russia from europes principal security instituti on and thereby risk antagonizing and isolating it an unstable central europe with et hnic tensions economic problems and questions of political leadership unresolved would dilute natos political strength and inject divisiveness into the alliance nato would see its overall defense posture weakened by the addition of central european militaries and would incur heavy costs in raising those militaries to an acceptable standardhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94879crs3 1see for example anthony lake from cont ainment to enlargement address at johns hopkins

in western europe the european union in time will devel op its own security apparatus and can take the lead in providing for european stability us interests the united states has broad range of political economic and security interests in europe there is longstanding consensus in the united states that the spread of democracy in europe and the rest of the world is in the us interest since the mid1970s more tenuous consensus has supported encouraging observance of basic human rights democracy and human rights reflect the basic values of the american people strengthen ing those values abroad serves to build other nations sharing community of interests with the united states1 the nato allies have generally joined with the united states in supporting new democracies in europe and in encouraging legal and political norms that protect human rights the allies often provide political support to the united states in such international forums as the and csce conference on security nd cooperation in europe cohesive alliance then has served to contribute to us political interests the united states also has key economic interests in europe the european union as an entity is the united states rgest trading partner from 1989 through 1993 approximately one fourth of all us trade was with the european union in each of those years the united states enjoyed trade surplus with the union2 until the end of the cold war central europe ttracted few us investors while there is commonly accepted definition for central europe increasingly the term refers among the former communist countries to the visegrad states and slovenia governments of these countries use the rm for political reasons to differentiate themselves from russia and the balkans today the picture is sharply different the united states exceeding even germany is the largest single investor in the visegrad states poland the czech re public slovakia and hungary us investment creates greater employment opportunities there factor in encouraging stability and the strengthening of democracies in contrast some us officials believe that the european union has been slow to invest in the region and has

treaty area us military presence and credible alliance defense posture have served to signal that the united states will defend such interests nato allies and infrastructure have also proved beneficial outside the treaty area as in the persian gulf war when large concentrations of forces and equipment from europe contributed to winning the conflict in essence the debate over enlargement is one to determine whether nato expansion is likely better to protect us political economic and security interests in europe or other means can better achieve that end assessment of the debate over enlargement nato has been principal instrument for securing the protection of us interests in europe propone nts of enlargement believe that stability in central europe will bring continued stability and prosperity in western europe and that nato should play role to that end opponents of enlargement tend to question that role sometimes contending in the aftermath of the cold war that other institutions such as the european union or csce are better suited to achieve ends that they believe to be fundamentally politi cal and economic article x of the north atlantic tr eaty requires unanimous agreement among member states before admitting new states the clinton administration intends to raise enlargement as principal issue at the nato ministerial meeting in december 1994 and will propose setting standards for admission which the president asserted in poland in july 1994 would probably be established sometime next year4 the administration made pre liminary soundings on the issue at the nato defense ministers meeting in seville spain in september 1994 in interviews administration officials said that the german defense minister alone expressed strong support for admitting central european states among other members only britain appears open to moving towards s upport but its enthusiasm for enlargement remains low establishment of standards or criteria for membership would be change of policy from that which has guided the partnership program partnership for peace puts adherents on the path to potential alliance membership but does not guarantee that membership in creating the partnership program the united states and its allies purposely avoided establishing criteria for nato membership because they wished to have any decision on enlargement remain solely in allied hands5 becausehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94879crs5 6the north atlantic treaty in nat handbook nato brussels 1992 p 143144 7see for example the nato participati on act adopted as an amendment to the

16 washington govt printing office 1994enlargement has great implications for nato security the alliance did not wish to hand applicants public instrument in the form of subjective criteria from which they might campaign for membership proponents of nearterm enlargement ar likely to press for criteria that prospective candidates can readily achieve opponents or those who favor more deliberate pace towards enlargement are likely to press for more difficult criteria or to oppose the establishment of any criteria criteria the north atlantic treaty does not establish explicit criteria for entry the preamble to the treaty does state that member governments are founded on the principles of democracy individual liberty and the rule of law article i obligates member states to refrain from the use of force unless attacked to resolve international disputes article ii commits them to strengthening their free institutions article iii commits them to maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack article x states that by unanimous agreement current members may admit other states in position to further the principles of this treaty6 these principles have not always been strictly applied either for applicants or for member stat portugal became member in 1949 even though it had dictatorial government t oday some members criticize turkey for its intermittent suppression of the kurd s or greece for discrimination against moslems other members such as lu xembourg and i celand have virtually military capacity or have shar ply declining defense budgets and marginally effective forces natos history then suggests th at there have not been explicit criteria applied in selecting new members or guiding existing ones should criteria emphasize political or collective defense goals variety of criteria for potential members have been suggested by administration officials and by some members of congress7 their suggestions reflect the current debate over whether nato should now place greater emphasis on its political objectives or on the continuing objective of collective defense the following criteria have been advanced by those who emphasize political objectives development of democratic rule and civilian control of the military training of military forces for peacekeepinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94879crs6 commitment by new members not to use military forces against its civilian population respect for the territorial integrity of neighboring states and renunciation of territorial claims there is greater divergence of opinion over the quality of military capability that new members should have some curre nt european nato members and some administration officials believe that strict standards contributing not only to the growth of democracy but also to building capable militaries should be applied to any potential members to assure that the alliance has capacity for collective defense and strong measure of political likemindedne ss advocates of such standards are generally concerned about potentially more assertive russia some of the most commonly mentioned standards are defense expenditures at the level of 3 percent of gdp over period of years modernization of equipment to contribute to interoperability development of specific capabilities in such areas as antisubmarine warfare and air defense acceptance of basing of allied forces of specified size and capability including nuclear forces officials advocating such standards acknow ledge that many current nato members do not meet these criteria for example interoperability of equipment among current members is fitful at best france and spain which are not in natos integrated military command system make many decisions bout the specific capabilities of their forces without guidance from nato h eadquarters howeve r these officials believe that nato is in position to demand more from central european states particularly because those states seeking to join the alliance wish above all to be embraced by the article v commitment to mu tual defense and because they would be on any forward defense line in the event of new threat from the east in developing arguments against more particularism in the alliance some us officials cited the current european uni on debate over eu enlargement some eu members oppose permitting more optouts ch as britains decision to subscribe neither to the maastricht treatys social ch arter nor to its plan for european monetary union some eu members be lieve that optouts diminish eu cohesiveness by tacitly acknowledging that responsibilities seen as upholding important principles by some states might be disparaged by others similarly some us officials express concern that permitting optouts for new nato st ates would undercut the alliances credibility in collective defense in ddition current nato members might have to bear the financial burden of raising the quality of new members military capacity if their entry is permitted before their having reached specifi ed levels of modernizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94879crs7 8news conference in berlin july 12 1994 weekly

hungary and the czech republic would likely be in first group of central european states to be admitted these countries have made progress in building democratic institutions and are in close geographic proximity to current nato members entry by the year 2000 is the rough timeframe ge nerally favored by their advocates second group of entrants at later date according to us officials might include romania and bulgaria both countries g behind the visegrad states and slovenia in progress towards democracy and free market economy and romania has range of disputes over ethnic matters with its ne ighbors the baltic states are in third group in the view of many nato military fficials their geog raphic location would make mutual defense commitment difficult to sustain poland has undertaken the strongest campa ign for membership in the view of president lech walesa stability can not co to poland primarily through strong economy in part because eu states exclude many polish products in part because foreign investors fear instability in the region nato and eu membership then would provide the needed stability for strengthening the countrys democratic institutions and free market economy the other visegrad states and slovenia are on record as favoring entry into nato however some of their officials are disappointed that nato has thus far offe red only the partnership program viewed as weak contribution to their security these governments are making strong overtures to the european union for eventual entry as means to consolidate political and economic gains but all would welcome criteria offered by nato for entry elements of the political leadership in austria sweden and finland all neutral countries have quietly begun to raise the issue of eventual nato membership the governments of these c ountries have not ma explicit overtures to nato nor are likely to do so until they undertake domestic debate on the issue the role of russia russia plays pivotal role in european affairs because it remains nuclear power asserts influence over its neighbors and has traditi onal interests in countries now being considered for membership in nato and the european

their view the partnership program because it does not include the alliances mutual defense commitment signals russia that it may pursue policy of intimidation in the region9 president clinton has said that any partnership member including russia may one day be eligible for nato membership some senior administration officials have said publicly however that russia is unlikely ever to become member of nato because russias territorial expans makes it an asian as well as european state us and allied government offi cials believe that its inclusion would fundamentally alter natos purpose as

the placing of foreign troops in states adjacen t to russia would constitute an immediate threat member of russian president boris yeltsins presidential council complained in june 1994 that the united states was using nato to preserve and consolidate its military and political leadership in europe11 group of centrist russian democrats often strongly critical of yeltsin are echoing these suspicions of the united states and its allies they warn that expansion of nato would result in qualitative and longterm increase of geopolitical isolation of russia and weakening of its international positions to prevent return to military confrontation in europe requires pr eservation of the midemilitarize d belt of states that has emerged in the center of europe12 some of the criteria for new nato members mentioned above are clearly more provocative to russian officials than others for example political criteria such as the establishment and maintenance of democratic institutions in central european

russia moscow is actively seeking agreements now that would enhance its in fluence over these countries13 in strategic terms particularly with regard to ukraine such an outcome could prove detrimental to us interests an independent democratic ukraine could promote stability on russias borders as state close to the west that abjures the maintenance and use of nuclear weapons there is ambivalence within the administration over the role of an expanded nato some administration officials c ontinue to emphasize natos longterm purpose as collective defense organizati on in february 1994 before russia joined the partnership for peace secretary of defense william perry said that the partnership program could be used to bu ild protective grouping against russia if things go wrong in moscow14 other officials tend to emphasize that nato is in evolution and will become pr imarily political organizati on they generally avoid discussion of collective defense in their view if nato expands it will not be an alliance directedagainst any particular country but rather its an attempt to expand the zone of stability and security in central europe15 there is similar ambivalence in other nat countries some german officials contend that nato expansion while it mig ht be provocative to moscow would nonetheless serve to contain an unstable russia they believe that german and allied interests would best be served by policy that consolidates emerging central european democracies and builds larger alliance reaching near russian borders however most allied governments making improved relations with russia centerpiece of their foreign policies believe that the debate on enlargement must proceed cautiously in order not to arouse russian concerns most allied european officials interviewed for this report said that should nato expand before the year 2000 russia will certainly not have reached point of stability by that date under such conditions in this view expansion would likely be interpreted by any russian government as c onfrontational move possible alternatives to enlargement some senior eu officials and some offi cials in eu governments are concerned that the

protect us and west european interests by encouraging democracy the growth of free markets and stability in central europe collective defense plays receding role in their equation for reaching stability this design advocates not has the appeal of avoiding the heavy financial costs likely under any plan for nato enlargement requiring modernization of central european militaries16 these observers believe that the european union and csce are the two principal institutions that would design the political and economic measures intended to bring stability to central europe in may 1994 under the auspices of the french government the european union began an effort intended to yield stability pact for europe both the united states and russia are participating in this effort through round table negotiations with th united states eu members and russia serving as facilitators the eus intention is to require central european countries to resolve disputes with their neighbors ove r borders and minoritie s in order to be eligible for union membership the union is using eligibility for eu membership as the incentive for resolving current disputes over borders and minorities and thereby reducing the potential for new ethnic conflicts17 csce will serve as the guardian of agreements comprising the stability pact and will likely monitor such agreements in 1993 the union drew general criteria to which the stability pact is linked for potential eu members these criteria require the development of democratic institutions respect for human rights observance of the territorial integrity of neighboring states and free market economies18 many eu states with germany at the forefront support eu expansion by 2002 to include at least the visegrad countries proponents of eu expansion be lieve that the combination of these countries desire to join the union combined with an eu intention to enforce its criteria will serve to build stability on the continent the russian government supports eu expansion as means to contribute stability to central europe but the yeltsin government also contends that csce as political institution in an era in wh ich there is credib military threat to nato should supplant the alliance as the principal security institution on the continent csce has broad mandate that includes conflict prevention

such countries as the netherlands and britain as well traditionally among the principal advocates of usled natocontrol and crisis management as well as oversight of human rights issues19 while the united states and its nato allies be lieve that csce should play role in conflict prevention and protection of human rights they reject the russian view that csce should become europes preeminen t security institution the allies also believe that csce having 53 members and requirement for unanimity in decisionmaking is cumbersome institution some european officials believe that nato has proved unable to define its postcold war mission this view is ofte n voiced by eu officials and by french government officials but is not confined to them the conflict in yugoslavia has fed this sentiment if natos mission in part is to provide stability in europe then they believe its efforts have failed an important test moreover they believe that the end of the cold war and declining us military presence on the continent are signals that the united states is on path to ter minate its involvement in european security affairs they tend to advocate efforts to strengthen the western european union weu the nascent defense arm of the union as the continents future security institution replacing nato in the long term20 others more emphatic contend that us refusal to send ground forces to th former yugoslavia is evidence that washington is unwilling to take the risk of physical involvement in the management of real crises alongside the europeans they doubt us leadership and believe that the weu must quickly begin to assu greater respons ibilities in european security21 some us state department officials and european foreign ministries such as the british contest the view that the european union can make important contributions to stability in central europe though some us officials believe that eu initiatives may contribute to building stability in europe they point out as noted above that brussels has restricted the flow of imports from cent ral europe into the union factor in retarding the grow th and flexibility of central european economies in addition there is consen in europe that favors the defense expenditures necessary to make the weu credible defense organization in the foreseeable future only france among european eu members has growing defense budget some us state and defense departme nt officials express the additional concern that eu expansion proceeding w ithout decision to enlarge nato carries with it backdoor us involvement in th security of central european states they do not necessarily oppose eu expansi on but believe that it should take place after decision is made whether to enlarge nato in this view conflict between new eu member

admit new member require it to surrender elements of its sovereignty by accepting guidelines that restructure economic and social policy and then spurn call for assistance in conflict the united states might then have an obligation under the north atlantic treaty to come to the assistance of one its nato allies drawn into such conflict several neutral countries finl and bordering russia among them22 will join the union in january 1995 many observers believe that the union will expand to include some or all of th visegrad countries by 2002 conclusion advocates of nato enlargement face dilemma clear purpose of enlargement is to contribute to central european stability and the anchoring of democratic institutions and the free market at the same time expansion would likely rouse the russian government to contest the presence of nato near its borders under such circumstances would central europe believe that its security had been enhanced given declining us and european defense budgets and continuing russian suspicions of the west nato enlargement would most likely strengthen european stability in circum stances in which nato had fully embraced new political purposes the conditions that led to the article v commitment to mutual defense had receded and minimal criteria for improvements in central europes defense posture were required the war in yugoslavia has fuelled doubts about natos credibility natos critics say that it must assure stability in europe the united states has not sent ground forces to yugoslavia because us political leadership has decided that us vital interests are not affected advocates of enlargement believe that they must now make the case that such interests are invol ved in the visegrad countries and beyond because the north atlantic treaty require s us military assistance in the event of conflict central european state is interested in nato membership without the article v commitment opponents and proponents of enlarg ement sometimes rehearse the same reasoning but with different conclusions some german officials for example believe that nato should expand because political stability in russia will deteriorate over the next decade they conclude that broadened security shield will protect them and central europe from sp illover of turmoil in russia opponents who share concerns over russian stability believe that expansion would serve only to inflame conditions in russia thereby worsening conditions in europe and drawing the allies into possi ble conflict involving new mbers that is why many opponents of enlargement believe that an expanded european union provides more certain albeit cautious path to stabilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs94879crs13 finally major political questions affect the presidents effort to begin the debate over enlargement the president should he pursue policy of enlargement would have to expend the political capital necessary to lead significant change in us commitments abroad task made more difficult if higher defense expenditures become part of the equation he has chosen brussels as the place for the administration to begin vigo rous debate over enlargemen t although us officials have not clearly raised the issue at home when the domestic debate is engaged it will likely lead to sharper delineation of us interests in western and central europe and of natos role in protecting those interests
