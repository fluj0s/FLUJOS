order to stimulate the faltering us economy is likely to bring greater attention to water infrastructure issues also likely to be of interest are programs that regulate activities in wetlands especially cwa section 404 which has been criticized by landowners for intruding on private landuse decisions and impos ing excessive economic burdens environmentalists view this regulatory program as essential for maintaining the health of wetland ecosystems and they are concerned about court rulings that narrowed regulatory protection of wetlands and about related administrative actions many stakeholders desire clariﬁcation of the acts regulatory jurisdiction but they diﬀer on what solutions are appropriate in the 110th congress committees held hearings on legislation intended to provide that clariﬁcation other issues discussed in this report that also could be of interest in the 111th congress include implementation of current programs to manage nonpoint sources of pollution as these

longstanding problems persist and new problems have emerged water quality problems are diverse ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ranches city streets and other diffuse or nonpoint sources to toxic substances discharged from factories and sewage treatment plants there is little agreement among stakeholders about what solutions are needed and whether new legislation is required to address the nations remaining water pollution problems for some time efforts to comprehensively amend the cwa have stalled as interests have debated whether and exactly how to change the law congress has inst ead focused legislative attention on enacting narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs but not any comprehensive proposals for several years the most prominent legislative water quality issue has concerned financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects house and senate committees have approved bills on several occasions but for various reasons legislation has been enacted at issue is how the federal government will assist states and cities in meeting needs to rebuild repair and upgrade wastewater treatment plants especially in light of capital costs

progress has been made in achieving the ambitious goals that congress established more than 35 years ago to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters longstanding problems persist and new problems have emerged water quality problems are diverse ranging from pollution runoff from farms and ranches city streets and other diffuse or nonpoint sources to point source discharges of metals and organic and inorganic toxic substances from factories and sewage treatment plants the principal law that deals with polluting activity in the nations streams lakes estuaries and coastal waters is the federal water pollution control act pl 92500 enacted in 1972 commonly known as the clean water act or cwa it consists of two major parts regulatory provisions that impose progressively more stringent requirements on industries and cities to abate pollution and meet the statutory goal of zero discharge of pollutants and provisions that authorize federal financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment plant construction both parts are supported by research activities plus permit and enforcement provisions programs at the federal level are administered by the environmental protection agency epa state and local governments have major responsibilities to implement cwa programs through standardsetting permitting and enforcement 1 the water quality restoration objective declared in the 1972 act was accompanied by statutory goals to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters by 1985 and to attain wherever possible waters deemed fishable and swimmable by 1983 although those goals have not been fully achieved considerable progress has been made especially in controlling conventional pollutants suspended solids bacteria and oxygenconsuming materials discharged by industries and sewage treatment plants progress has been mixed in controlling discharges of toxic pollutants heavy metals inorganic and organic chemicals which are more numerous and can harm human health and the environment even when present in very small amountsat the partsperbillion level moreover efforts to control pollution from diffuse sources termed nonpoint source pollution rainfall runoff from urban suburban and agricultural areas for example are more recent given the earlier emphasis on point source pollution discharge s from industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants overall data reported by epa and states indicate that 45 of river and stream miles assessed by states and 47 of assessed lake acres do not meet applicable water quality standards and are impaired for one or more desired uses 2 in 2006 epa issued an assessment of streams and small rivers and reported that 67 of us stream miles are in poor or fair condition and that nutrients and streambed sediments have the largest adverse impact on the biological condition of these waters 3 approximately 95000 lakes and 544000 river miles in the united states are under fishconsumption advisories including 100 of the great lakes and their connecting waters due to chemical contaminants in lakes rivers and coastal waters and one 1 for further information see

pollutant contamination mercury is contaminant of growing concernas of 2003 45 stat had issued partial or statewide fish or shellfish consumption advisories because of elevated mercury levels the last major amendments to the law were the water quality act of 1987 pl 1004 these amendments culminated six years of congressional efforts to extend and revise the act and were the most comprehensive amendments since 1972 authorizations of appropriations for some programs provided in pl 1004 such as general grant assistance to states research and general epa support authorized in that law expired in fy1990 and fy1991 authorizations for wastewater treatment funding expired in fy1994 none of these programs has lapsed however as congress has continued to appropriate funds to implement them epa states industry and other citizens continue to implement the 1987 legislation including meeting the numerous requirements and deadlines in it the clean water act has been viewed as one of the most successful environmental laws in terms of achieving its statutory goals which have been widely supported by the public but lately some have questioned whether additional actions to achieve further benefits are worth the costs criticism has come from industry which has been the longstanding focus of the acts regulatory programs and often opposes imposition of new stringent and costly requirements criticism also has come from developers and property rights groups who contend that federal regulations particularly the acts wetlands permit program are costly intrusion on private landuse decisions states and cities have traditionally supported water quality programs and federal funding to assist them in carrying out the law but many have opposed cwa measures that they fear might impose new unfunded mandates many environmental groups believe that further fine tuning is needed to maintain progress achieved to date and to address remaining water quality problems initially following enactment of amendments in 1987 major cwa legislative activity occurred comprehensive reauthorization bill opposed by the clinton administration and environmental groups passed the house in the 104 th congress 1995 but was not enacted since then comprehensive reauthorization legislation has been introduced but beginning in the 106th congress number of bills dealing with specific water quality issues and programs in the law have been enactedespecially legislation to reauthorize several existing cwa programs4 since the 107th congress the dominant cwa issue has been water infrastructure financingie extension and modification of provisions of the act authorizing financial assistance for municipal wastewater treatment projects house and senate committees have approved bills but none has been enacted the remainder of this report discusses cwa issues likely to be of interest in the 111 th congress beginning with discussion of two issues that are likely to be most prominentwater infrastructure funding and regulatory protection of wetlands it then briefly describes several other issues that could receive attention either through oversight or legislation including management of sewer overflows implementation of the cwas nonpoint source pollution management program and regulation of waste discharges from animal feeding operations it concludes with brief discussion of water quality appropriations 4 for additional information on legislative activity since pl 1004 see crs report rl33800 water quality issues in the 110th congress oversight and

anniversary of passage of the clean water act and 20 years since the last major amendments to the law while as noted there has been measurable clean water progress as result of the act observers and analysts agree that significant water pollution problems remain however there is less agreement about what solutions are needed and whether new legislation is required several key water quality issues exist evaluating actions to implement existing provisions of the law assessing whether additional steps are necessary to achieve overall goals of the act that have not yet been attained ensuring that progress made to date is not lost through diminished attention to water quality needs and defining the appropriate federal role in guiding and paying for clean water infrastructure and other activities for some time efforts to comprehensively amend the act have stalled as interests have debated whether and exactly how to change the law many issues that might be addressed involve making difficult tradeoffs between impacts on different sectors of the economy taking action when there is technical or scientific uncertainty and allocating governmental responsibilities for implementing the law these factors partly explain why congress has recently favored focusing legislative attention on narrow bills to extend or modify selected cwa programs rather than taking up comprehensive proposals other factors also have been at work these include general reluctance by most members of congress to address controversial environmental issues in view of the slim majorities held by political parties in the house and the senate and lack of presidential initiatives on clean water issues neither the clinton nor the bush administration proposed cwa legislation in addition for some time after the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 congress was more focused on security terrorism and iraq war issues than on many other topics including environmental protection as result of the 2006 midterm elections and changed congressional leadership beginning in 2007 many observers expected that the 110 th congress would pursue oversight of clean water and other environmental programs greater interest in environmental issues was apparent but comprehensive legislation was enacted particular legislative focus was water infrastructure financing legislation specifically reauthorization of the acts financial aid program discussed next in this report also on the congressional agenda was consideration of the geographic reach of the clean water act over the nations waters and wetlands in light of court rulingsincluding two supreme court decisionsthat have narrowed the laws regulatory jurisdiction but in ways that are somewhat unclear the 2008 general and congressional elections have encouraged many policymakers and stakeholders to anticipate much greater attention to many environmental issues including clean water by the 111 th congress and the obama administration the new administrations priorities in this area are not yet fully known although during the 2008 presidential campaign candidate obama supported several issues including preservation of wetlands great lakes restoration legislation water conservation regulation of large animal feeding operations and full funding of clean water infrastructure assistance programs funding for water infrastructure projects discussed next in this report is expected to receive early attention in the 111 th congress in light of growing interest in increased investment in public works projectsincluding wastewaterin order to stimulate the faltering us economy httpwikileaksorgwikicrsr40098g25g138g157g142g155g561g19g158g138g149g146g157g162g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g146g151g561g157g145g142g561g343g343 g343g157g145

nations needs to build upgrade rebuild and repair wastewater infrastructure is significant element in achieving the clean water acts water quality objectives the acts program of financial aid for municipal wastew ater treatment plant construction is key contributor to that effort since 1972 congress has provided more than 78 billion to assist cities in constructing projects to achieve the acts requirements for secondary treatment of municipal sewage equivalent to 85 reduction of wastes or more stringent treatment where required by local water quality conditions state and local governments have spent more than 25 billion of their own funds for construction as well still funding needs remain very high an additional 2025 billion nationwide for all types of projects eligible for funding under the act according to the most recent needs survey estimate by epa and the states released in january 2008 an 86 increase above the estimate reported four years earlier 5 epa reported several reasons for increased needs problems due to aging infrastructure treatment plant improvements needed to meet more protective water quality standards and additional capacity required to handle wet weather flows this current estimate includes 1344 billion for wastewater treatment and collection systems 105 billion more than the previous report 548 billion for combined sewer overflow corrections 15 billion less than the previous estimate 9 billion for stormwat er management 28 billion more than the previous estimate and 43 billion to build system s to distribute recycled water new category in this report the estimate does not explicitly include funding needed to address security issues needs related to growth and expansion in regi ons that are experiencing population growth or funding possibly needed for treatment work s to adapt to climate change impacts in september 2002 epa released study called the gap analysis that assesses the difference between current spending for wastewater infrastru cture and total funding needs both capital and operation and maintenance6 in that report epa estimated that over the next two decades the united states needs to spend nearly 390 billion to replace existing wastewater infrastructure systems and to build new ones funding needs for operation and maintenance not eligible for clean water act funding are an additional 148 billion over the next two decades the agency estimated according to the gap analysis if there is increase in investment there will be about 6 billion gap between current annual capital expenditures for wastewater treatment 13 billion annually and projected spending needs of approximately 19 billion the study also estimated that if wastewater spending were to increase by 3 annually essentially meaning doubling of rates paid by ratepayers the gap would shrink by nearly 90 to about 1 billion annually at issue has been what the federal role should be in assisting states and cities especially in view of such high projected funding needs debate over the nature of the nations efforts regarding wastewater infrastructure was central and controversial part of the 1987 amendments to the act the amendments extended through fy1990 the traditional title ii program of grants for sewage treatment project construction under which the federal share was 55 of project costs the 1987 law initiated

the states repayment was not required for grants under the title ii program to be recycled for future construction in other communities thus providing an ongoing source of financing the expectation in 1987 was that the federal contributions to srfs would assist in making transition to full state and local financing by fy1995 althoug h most states believe that the srf is working well early funding and administrative problems and continuing large funding needs have delayed the anticipated shift to full state responsibility thus srf issues have been prominent on the clean water act

interestfree loans to buy or refinance cities debt obligation or as source of revenue or security for payment of principal and interest on stateissued bond srf monies also may be used to provide loan guarantees or credit enhancement for localities loans made by state from its srf are to be used first to assure progress towards the goals of the act and in particular on projects to meet the standards and enforceable requirements of the act after states achieve those requirements of the act srf monies also may be used to implement nonpoint pollution management and national estuary programs since the srf program began states have used 26 billion to assist more than 8650 nonpoint management projects none has gone to estuary management activities all states have established the mechanisms to administer the new loan programs and have been receiving srf capitalization funds under title vi many have complained that the srf program is unduly complicated by federal rules even though congress had intended that states were to have greater flexibility congressional oversight has examined the progress toward reducing the backlog of wastewater treatment facilities needed to achieve the acts water quality objectives while newer estimates of future funding needs have drawn increased attention to the role of the srf program in meeting such needs although there has been some criticism of the srf program and debate continues over specific concerns the basic approach is well supported congress used the clean water srf as the model when it established drinking water srf in 1996 pl 104182 8 although the initial intent was to phase out federal support for this program congress has continued to appropriate srf capitalization grants to the states providing an average of 135

dealing with problems of overflows from municipal combined and separate sewers which can release partially treated or untreated wastewaters that harm public health and the environment epa estimates that the cost of projects to control sewer overflows from combined and separate sanitary sewer systems and manage stormwater runoff is nearly 64 billi on nationwide and more recently wastewater utilities have sought assistance to assess operational vulnerabilities and upgrade physical protection of their facilities against possible terrorist attacks that could threaten the water infrastructure system 10 during the bush administration epa officials took the position that infrastructure funding needs go beyond what the federal government can do on its own and the presidents budget for several years advanced the concept that federal funding would cease after 2011 and that state and local selffinancing would occur thereafter although saying that federal and state funding can help water utilities meet future needs epas principal water infrastructure initiative was to support other types of responses to help ensure that investment needs are met in an efficient timely and equitable manner in particular epa promoted strategies that it terms the four pillars of sustainable infrastructure based on concepts of better management fullcost pricing efficient water use and watershed approaches to protection epa pursued sustainable infrastructure leadership initiative in partnership with water utilities to promote the four pillars the purpose of the initiative was to identify new and better ways of doing business in the water and wastewater industries and promote them widely and thus ensure sustainability of water systems for example epa worked to encourage rate struct ures that lead to full cost pricing and will support water metering and other conservation measures epa also has encouraged consumers to use waterefficient products eg residential bathroom products with the intent of reducing national water and wastewater infrastructure needs by reducing projected water demand and wastewater flow thus allowing deferral or downsizing of capital projects

activity in the house on similar legislation during the 109th congress throughout this period several factors have contributed to problems in moving any of these bills further in the legislative process including administration opposition to authorization levels disputes over the formula for allocating clean water srf grants among the states and controversies over application of prevailing wage requirements of the davisbacon act the issue of the applicability of the davisbacon act to srffunded projects has been especially controversial because that act has both strong supporters and critics in congress and elsewhere critics of davisbacon say that it unnecessarily increases public construction costs and hampers competition while supporters say that it helps stabilize the local construction industry by preventing competition that would undercut local wages and working conditions under the original srf program authorization enacted in 1987 the davisbacon act applied to socalled first use monies provided by state from its srf that is loans made from initial federal capitalization grants but not to subsequent moni provided from repayments to the srf when that authorization expired at the end of fy199 4 davisbacon requirements also expired thus the recent issue has been whether to restore the applicability of those requirements11 for some time interest has been growing in iden tifying and developing new mechanisms to help localities pay for water infrastructure projects beyond federal grants or srfs which appear insufficient to fully meet funding needs in june 2005 the house transportation and infrastructure subcommittee on water resources and environment held hearings on alternative means to fund water infrastructure projects in the future at the first hearing witnesses focused on one way to increase funding for water infrastructure that has recently been advocated by some groups creating national clean water trust fund that would conceptually be similar to trust funds that exist for highway and aviation projects witnesses and subcommittee members discussed difficulties in identifying potential revenue sources that would be deemed fair and equitable the second hearing addressed other financing options such as expanded use of taxexempt private activity bonds and more efficient management techniques such as asset management programs and sustainable infrastructure initiatives in the 109 th congress legislation was introduced to establish 75 billion federal trust fund for wastewater infrastructure improvements this bill hr 4560 proposed to use concept for funding such projects that has been promoted by wastewater treatment industry officials other stakeholders and some environmentalists who argue it could provide new source of money for necessary system upgrades amid dwindling federal funds the bill contemplated system of user fees to create the fund but the source of revenue was not specified in the bill congress did

expanded eligibility for clean water srf assistance including for example projects that implement stormwater management water conservation or efficiency projects and water and wastewater reuse and recycling projects and it included number of provisions to make the clean water and drinking water srf programs more parallel such as allowing srf assistance to be used by private as well as public

protect the nations remaining wetlands and regulate activities taking place in wetlands has become one of the most contentious environmental policy issues especially in the context of the cwa which contains key wetlands regulatory tool the permit program in section 404 it requires landowners or developers to obtain permits for disposal of dredged or fill material that is generated by construction or similar activity into navigable waters of the united states including wetlands section 404 has evolved through judicial interpretation and regulatory change to become one of the principal federal tools used to protect wetlands although that term appears only once in section 404 itself and is not defined there at the same time its implementation has come to be seen as intrusive and burdensome to those whose activities it regulates at issue today is how to address criticism of the section 404 regulatory program while achieving desired goals of wetlands protection 12 unlike the rest of the act the permit aspects of section 404 are administered by the us army corps of engineers rather than epa although the corps uses epa environmental guidance other federal agencies including the us fish and wildlife service fws and natural resource conservation service nrcs have more limited roles in the corps permitting decisions tension 12 for additional information

wetlands under section 404 and related laws on the one hand and the desire of landowners to develop property that may include wetlands on the other hand the conflicts over wetlands regulation have for the most part occurred in administrative proceedings as congress has not amended section 404 since 1977 when it provided exemptions for categories of routine activities such as normal farming and

longstanding controversy and litigation is whether isolated waters are properly within the jurisdiction of section 404 isolated waterswetlands which are not physically adjacent to navigable surface

g21g25g3g16g5g5g561 on january 9 2001 the supreme court ruled on the question of whether the cwa provides the corps and epa with authority over isolated waters the courts 54 ruling in solid waste agency of northern cook county swancc v us army corps of engineers 531 us 159 2001 held that the corps denial of 404 permit for disposal site on isolated wetlands solely on the basis that migratory birds use the site exceeds the authority provided in the act the full extent of impacts on the regulatory program resulting from this decision remains unclear even eight years after the ruling in part because of different interpretations of swancc reflected in subsequent federal court cases while it continue s to be difficult to fully assess how regulatory protection of wetlands will be affected as result of the swancc decision and other possible changes the remaining responsibility to protect affected wetlands falls on states and localities 13 environmentalists believe that the court misinterpreted congressional intent on the matter while industry and landowner groups welcomed the ru ling policy implications of how much the decision restricts federal regulation depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied some federal courts have interpreted swancc narrowly thus limiting its effect on current permit rules while few read the decision more broadly the governments view on this key question was expressed in epacorps guidance issued in january 2003 it provides legal interpretation essentially based on narrow reading of the courts decision thus allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue but it calls for more headquarters review in disputed cases administration press releases said that the guidance demonstrates the governments commitment to nonetloss wetlands policy however it is apparent that the issues remained under review because at the same time the administration issued an advance notice of proposed

them negative according to epa and the corps environmentalists and many states opposed changing any rules saying that the law and previous court rulings call for the broadest possible interpretation of the clean water act and thus narrow interpretation of swancc but developers sought changes to clarify interpretation of swancc in december 2003 epa and the corps announced that the administration would not pursue rule changes on federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands the epa administrator said that the administration wanted to avoid contentious and lengthy rulemaking debate over the issue environmentalists and state representatives expressed relief at the announcement interest groups on all sides have been critical of confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance which constitutes the main tool for interpreting the reach of the swancc decision environmentalists remain concerned about diminished protection resulting from the guidance while developers said that without new regulations confusing and contradictory interpretations of wetland rules will continue g20g138g153g138g151g152g156g561g159g495g561g23g151g146g157g142g141g561g21g157g138g157g142g156g561 federal courts continue to have key role in interpreting and clarifying the swancc decision on february 21 2006 the supreme court heard ar guments in two cases brought by landowners rapanos v united states carabell v us army corps of engineers seeking to narrow the scope of the cwa permit program as it applies to development of wetlands the issue in both cases had to do with the reach of the cwa to cover waters that were not navigable waters in the traditional sense but were connected somehow to navigable waters or adjacent to those waters the act requires federal permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters many legal and other observers hoped th at the courts ruling in these cases would bring greater clarity about the scope of federal jurisdiction the courts ruling was issued on june 19 2006 rapanos v united states 547 us 715 2006 in 54 decision plurality of the court led by justice scalia held that the lower court had applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered by the cwa justice kennedy joined this plurality to vacate the lower court decisions and remand the cases for further consideration but he took different positions on most of the substantive issues raised by the cases as did four other dissenting justices 15 legal observers suggest that the implications of the ruling both shortterm and longterm are far from clear because the several opinions written by the justices did not draw clear line regarding which wetlands and other waters are subject to federal jurisdiction one likely result has been more casebycase determinations and continuing litigation there also has been renewed pressure on the corps and epa to clarify the issues through an administrative rulemaking on june 5

jurisdiction over others such as non navigable tributaries that do not typically flow yearround and wetlands adjacent to such tributaries will be determined on casebycase basis to determine if the waters in question have significant nexus with traditional navigable water the guidance details how the agencies should evaluate whether there is significant nexus the guidance is not intended to increase or decrease cwa jurisdiction and it does not supersede or nullify the 2003 guidance discussed above which addressed jurisdiction over isolated wetlands in light of swancc in accompanying documents epa and the corps said that the administration was considering rulemaking in response to the rapanos decision but they noted that developing new rules to interpret the decision would take more time than issuing the guidance they also noted that despite issuance of the guidance documents legal challenges to the scope of cwa jurisdiction are likely to continue the guidance took effect imme diately but the agencies also solicited public comments and left open the possibility of further changes in the future based on more than 66000 public comments received and 18 months of implementation of the 2007 guidance epa and the corps issued revised guidance december 2 2008 16 the revisions made few changes to the earlier document but did add clarification of some key terms that are important to determining cwa jurisdiction such as the meaning of the regulatory term adjacent wetlands the agencies continue to take the position that based on additional experience they could provide additional guidance or initiate rulemaking some environmental groups criticized the revised guidance saying that it continues to substantially limit the scope of waters that are protected by the cwa industry analysts said that the few changes in the guidance could make it simpler for regulators to make jurisdictional determinations

swancc decision committee members and public witnesses indicated that lack of guidance from the government clarifying its interpretation of the case had led to inconsistent regulatory decisions by corps officials in individual regions of the country and subsequent judicial decisions by other federal and state courts have been mixed at the hearing corps and epa officials testified on their efforts to develop guidance which subsequently was released in january 2003 concern about lingering confusion over the swancc decision and corps implementation was the topic of an oversight hearing by the senate environment and public works committee in june 2003 developers and others in the regulated community criticized the corps and epa saying that the january 2003 guidance document had not

accelerate congressional action on legislative proposals to address uncertainties about federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters but both the swancc and rapanos rulings remain highly controversial the house transportation and infrastructure committee held hearings on hr 2421 and related jurisdictional issues on july 17 and july 19 2007 another hearing was held april 16 2008 the senate environment and public works committee held hearing on issues related to the rapanos ruling on december 13 2007 and held legislative hearing on s 1870 on april 9 2008 proponents contend that congress must clarify the important issues left unsettled by the supreme courts 2001 and 2006 rulings and by the 2007 corpsepa guidance bill sponsors argue that the legislation would reaffirm what congress intended when the cwa was enacted in 1972 and what epa and the corps have subsequently been practicing until recently in terms of cwa jurisdiction but critics question the constitutionality of the legislation and assert that it would expand federal authority thus likely increasing confusion rather than settling it prospects for the legislation are uncertain given the divided views on how it might be interpreted by federal agencies and the courts g17g157g145g142g155g561g5g149g142g138g151g561g25g138g157g142g155g561g3g140g157g561g11g156g156g158g142g156g561 several other issues affecting

act the beach act in order to augment federal and state efforts to prevent human exposure to polluted coastal recreation waters including the great lakes this act directed coastal states to adopt updated water quality standards and epa to develop new protective criteria and standards it also authorized grants to coastal states to support monitoring and notification programs in may 2007 the gao issued report on federal and state implementation finding that epa has implemented most provisions of the act but has not yet published new or revised water quality criteria which the law required by 2005 17 in the 110th congress senate and house committees held hearings on the status of implementation of the beach act and bills to extend authorization for appropriations for the acts grants were introduced the house approved one such bill hr 2537 it would have would allowed states to use beach act funds to track sources of pollution and would require states to use rapid testing methods of

sewers where domestic sanitary sewage industrial wastes infiltration from groundwater and stormwater runoff are collected these systems serve approximately 40 million persons mainly in older urban and coastal cities normally under dry weather conditions the combined wastes are conveyed to municipal sewage treatment plant properly designed sized and maintained combined sewers can be an acceptable part of citys water pollution control infrastructure however combined sewer overflow cso occurs when the capacity of the collection and treatment system is exceeded due to high volumes of rainwater or snowmelt and the excess volume is diverted and discharged directly into receiving waters bypassing the sewage treatment plants often the excess flow that contains raw sewage industrial wastes and stormwater is discharged untreated many combined sewer systems are found in coastal areas where recreational areas fish habitat and shellfish beds may be contaminated by the discharges to manage csos cities are subject to policy issued by epa in 1994 that requires implementation of nine minimum controls that generally are based on combinations of management techniques such as temporary retention of excess flow during storm events and structural measures such as construction of separate storm sewer systems one issue concerning some cities is the problem of overflows from municipal separate sanitary sewers ssos that are not csos because they transport only sanitary wastes discharges of untreated sewage from these sewers can occur from manholes broken pipes and deteriorated infrastructure and undersized pipes and can occur in wet or dry weather epa estimates that there are about 18000 municipalities with separate sanitary sewers all of which can under certain circumstances experience overflows explicit epa or statutory control policy for addressing ssos currently exists funding for cso and sso projects is major concer n of states and cities the most recent clean water needs survey found that the largest needs category totaling 55 billion and representing 27 of total water infrastructure needs is to address csos in 2000 congress passed legislation the wet weather water quality act authorizing twoyear 15 billion grants program to reduce wet weather flows from municipal sewer systems both csos and ssos section 112 of division b pl 106154 however congress provided appropriations for these wet weather grants during the two years of authorization fy2002fy 2003 as described above in march 2007 the house passed legislation to reauthor ize this grant program hr 569 the 110 th congress also addressed related issue that of notification to the public when sewer overflow event occurs the house passed hr 2452 bill intended to ensure that sewage treatment plants monitor for and report discharges of raw sewage from combined or separate sewers the bill would have required epa to issue criteria to guide plant operators in assessing whether sewer overflow has the potential to affect human health or imminently and substantially endanger human health the senate environment and public works committee approved s 2080 with an amendment providin g the text of housepassed hr 2452 but further action occurred g16g152g151g153g152g146g151g157g561g18g152g149g149g158g157g146g152g151g561g15g138g151g138g144g142g150g142g151g157g561 prior to the 1987 cwa amendments

pollution uncontrolled nonpoint sources have become relatively larger portion of remaining water quality problemsperhaps contributing as much as 50 of the nations water pollution nonpoint pollution is rainfall or snowmelt runoff from farm and urban areas as well as construction forestry and mining sites in 1987 congress added new section 319 to the act to strengthen the law regarding this major contributor to water pollution by requiring states to develop and implement programs to control nonpoint sources of pollution states were required to identify waters not expected to meet water quality standards because of nonpoint source pollution and to implement plans for managing pollution from runoff federal grants totaling 400 million were authorized over four years to cover as much as 60 of the costs of implementing states management plan in recent years actual appropriations for section 319 grants have averaged about 205 million annually at issue today is what progress is being ma to manage nonpoint source pollution and what additional efforts may be needed involving section 319 or other public and private activities several concerns have been raised about the program such as whether state plans have comprehensively addressed their nonpoint pollution problems some observers are critical of the largely voluntary nature of the section 319 program consisting of all carrot but stick while others argue that the types of individual land management decisions that are needed to address nonpoint source pollution cannot be regulated in the same ways that industrial sources are controlled ie through discharge limitations and permits funding has become an important issue as states moved from assessment and plan development to management since congress intended that section 319 funds be used primarily to implement nonpoint pollution controls on the ground precis estimates of management costs are not available because so much depends on the sitespecific nature of problems and solutions without adequate funding to implement state manage ment plans it is doubtful that much will be achieved under section 319 to control nonpoint source pollution because agricultural activities are known to be significant source of nonpoint pollution nationwide the adequacy of efforts to address these sources has received much attention questions have been raised about the 319 grant programs efficacy and overlap with farm bill conservation funding 18 in particular the white house office of management and budget omb found that epa had not demonstrated results under the program and has urged the agency to shift its focus away from implementing projects in agricultural areas regardless of water quality status and toward implementing projects specifically in wate rs that have been identified as impaired are failing to meet established water quality standards state officials have been concerned that omb is not fully aware of the extent to which section 319 funds address range of nonpoint pollution control needs beyond the agricultural sector

risks to water quality and public health contributing pollutants such as nutr ients sediment pathogens and ammonia to the environment clean water regulations issued in the 1970s required discharge permits for the largest afos termed confined animal feeding operations cafos however epa acknowledged that compliance and enforcement of these permit rules was poor less than onethird of covered facilities actually have permits and that the regulations themselves were outdated in 2003 epa issued revised rule to regulate waste discharges from cafos among the key elements the rules include requirements for development of nutrient management plans to better manage land application of manure farm groups generally supported the regulation as being consistent with environmental initiatives
