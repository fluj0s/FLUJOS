economy marc labonte and gail makinen government and finance division june 15 2007 abstract noticeable phenomenon of the 1980s was the growth in the us trade deﬁcit to record pro portions from slight surplus in 1980 and 1981 the trade deﬁcit grew to record 25 of gdp in 1986 the trade deﬁcit then declined to low of about 02 of gdp in 1991 it then began to rise reaching record high of 39 of gdp in 2000 the last full year of the 19912001 expansion the growth of the deﬁcit was especially rapid over 19982000 during 1998 the deﬁcit was 22 of gdp whereas in 1997 it was only 11 of gdp the advent of the recession in 2001 and the subsequent recovery and expansion did not produce decline in the trade deﬁcit rather it continued to rise reaching 56 of gdp during 2005 and 54 in 2006 in all of the computations above exports imports the diﬀerence between the two and gdp are measured in 2000 dollars all the trade data are taken from the national income and product

significantly in recent years over the economic expansion of 19912001 it grew from 02 of gdp in 1991 to record high of 39 of gdp in 2000 which exceeded the previous high of 28 reached in 1986 this growth was particularly rapid over the period 19982000 during 1997 the trade deficit was modest 12 of gdp the deficit continued to rise during 20012006 period of economic contraction recovery and expansion during 20042006 it averaged 55 of gdp four major reasons have been given for the growth of the deficit the inflow of foreign capital motivated by either profit or safety the dumping of foreign goods in the american market recessions or slower growth in the economies of major us trading partners and barriers imposed against us goods and services by foreign countries compelling case can be made based in part on movements in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and in part on the necessity for the trade deficit to balance savinginvestment shortfalls that the dominant cause of the deficit and its growth is the inflow of foreig n capital from both private and official sources the inflow of foreign capital and the related trade deficit has number of discernable effects on the us economy first as component of aggregate demand growing trade deficit reduces the growth of domestic demand as american spending is diverted from domestic goods to foreign substitutes second because it represents foreign saving coming to the united states it reduces american interest rates and encourages the growth of interestsensitive domestic spending by businesses on such things as plant and equipment and by households on housing automobiles and appliances on balance the net effect on spending is negative third and indirect effect is that lower interest rates in the united states encourage higher asset prices such as those related to real estate and stocks higher asset prices are thought to be an important determinant of consumer spending and thus positive influence on aggr egate demand fourth the inflow of foreign capital enables the united states to put in place larger capital stock than would otherwise be the case finally while the expansions of the 1980s and 1990s have demonstrated that large trade deficits are barrier to attaining full employment they do affect the types of jobs that are created in the united states over the longer run growing foreign ownership of the american capital stock means that growing fraction of us income growth will have to be transferred abroad and this is increasingly evident in us data during the period 19791984 us net earnings abroad averaged 334 billion per year during 20012006 the average net inflow had declined to 21 billion in both 2005 and 2006 it was about 12 billion this report will be updated as events

in seeking an answer to this question is to look at the national income and product accounts of the united states in this framework foreign trade deficit is equal to the difference between domestic saving and domestic investment where domestic saving includes the net budget position of the government or public sector this situation arises because resources used for domestic investment can exceed the resources made available as result of domestic saving

of trade deficit1 similarly any excess of domestic saving over domestic investment must be sent abroad which is the essence of trade surplus as explained below the mechan ism for ensuring that this happens involves domestic interest rates relative to those in foreign countries and changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar thus any explanation for the trade deficit must show how it causes domestic saving to be different from domestic investment if it cannot do so then it not valid answer to the question of what has caused the trade deficit and its behavior over time four major explanations can be found for the growth in the trade deficit 1 foreigners desire to invest in the united states 2 the dumping of foreign goods in the american market 3 different rates of economic growth in the economies of asia and the other major trading partners of the united states and 4 barriers imposed on us goods and services by foreign countries although some of these explanations will be shown to have possible validity the first explanation is the only one consistent with the requirement imposed by the national income and product accounts that the trade deficit arise from an imbalance between domestic saving and domestic investment the alternative explanations fail to meet this test

from one country to another as individuals in pursuit of the highest yield available in the world economy purchase foreign assets this sets in motion chain of events the end result of which is trade deficit or reduced surplus for example assume that the government budget in the united states moves from balance to deficit decreasing the saving available in america all else held constant american interest rates will rise as less saving is available relative to the demand for it for investment or capital goods purposes this rise in interest rates will attract foreign capital however before foreigners can buy these now high er yielding american assets they must first buy dollars this increases the net demand for the dollar in the foreign exchange market as result the dollar will rise in price or appreciate with appreciation the prices of american exports will rise in foreign countries and import prices will fall in the united states thus american exports will tend to fall and imports rise in short trade deficit will emerge the essence of the net capital inflow and be equal to the shortfall in domestic saving relative to domestic investment the same phenomenon can be set in motion by alternative circumstances in which americans want to add to the domestic stock of capital at faster rate than previously in this case domestic investment would rise relative to domestic saving domestic investment would now exceed domestic saving leading to rise in american interest rates above those in the outside world this rise would then attract foreign capital nd the sequence explained above would again come into play to explain the emergence of trade deficit equal in magnitude to the excess of domestic investment over domestic saving 1 technically borrowing from abroad is equal to the current account deficit which consists of the trade deficit plus net investment income plus net unilateral transfers in 2006 the current account deficit equaled 811 billion and the trade deficit comprised 93 of the current account deficit thus for laymans purposes the trade deficit and net foreign borrowing can be thought of as equal

this explanation suggests that foreigners for whatever reason offer their goods at belowmarket prices as result americans switch from buying domestic substitutes to the now cheaper foreign goods this increases imports and given exports trade deficit it is argued will result however this shift from domestic goods to foreign substitutes does not affect the domestic savingdomestic investment balance and hence cannot be cause of trade deficit rather the shift in demand is selfcorrecting although it does lead to more imports it also increases the net supply of dollars in the foreign exchange market as result the dollar should fall in price or depreciate 2 the depreciation will be large enough to generate additional net exports and reestablish balance between exports and imports thus what this explanation neglects is the behavior of the foreign exchange rate subsequent to the shift in domestic demand from american goods and services to foreign substitutes

economies of several asian countries including japan but excluding china and india as well as those of the other major trading partners of the us including the euro area did not match the high growth rates enjoyed by the united states in the 19952000 and 20022006 periods when the income growth of foreign countr ies slows their ability to buy goods is reduced or slowed relative to american ability to buy their goods since some of these goods are made in america it might be expected that us expo rts will be adversely affected thus the argument runs the decline in export growth combined with the acceleration in import growth will generate trade deficit for the united states again what is wrong with this argument is that it provides explanation why decline in demand for us goods caused by differential growth rates between the united states and its trading partners should cause an imbalance between domestic investment and domestic saving because it does not relative differences in growth rates by themselves should not lead to trade deficit as in the preceding explanation what the proponents of this explanation neglect is that the exchange rate does not stay constant any tendency for us imports to grow more rapidly than exports means that the net supply of dollars on the foreign exchange market rises leading to dollar depreciation as described above dollar depreciation leads to sufficient additional net exports to reestablished balanced trade 3 g346g495g561g22g155g138g141g142g561g4g138g155g155g146g142g155g156g561 each year the office of the us trade representative issues lengthy report that among other things details various practices foreign governments use to discriminate against american goods 2 note that the fact that foreign goods are offered at lower price in the united states is not dispositive of conclusion of dumping the fall in the dollar price of foreign goods is part of the adjustment mechanism in section 1 above by which foreign capital comes to the us 3 there are two possibilities by which differential growth rates can lead to trade imbalance the first is if they are associated with different interest rates in the respective countries thus should faster growth in the us be associated with higher interest rates than in the slower growing countries world capital would tend to flow to the us and trade deficit would occur however the cause of the differential gr owth rates is likely to be differential rates of investment growth and if so explanation above is relevant thus faster growth is correlated withbut not the ultimate cause ofan increase in the trade deficit the second occurs if the exchange rate between the faster and slower growing countries is fixed rather than floating this case is covered in

these practices did not exist us exports would be larger and the trade deficit would be smaller although there is doubt that us exporters face trade barriers imposed by foreign governments there is substantial doubt that these barriers are either responsible for the trade deficit itself or for the growth in the deficit over the 1990s and beyond the reason for this conclusion is straightforward trade barriers do not lead to an imbalance between domestic investment and domestic saving instead they lead to dollar depreciation and smaller volume of trade between countries to see this suppose that trade between the united states and the rest of the world is balanced the dollar value of us exports is equal to the dollar value of us imports suppose now that the rest of the world imposes barriers on us exports tariff such that exports fall as exports fall in value the net demand for dollars falls in the foreign exchange market leading to dollar depreciation as explained above cheaper dollar leads to fall in imports sufficient to restore balance to the trade accounts the net result is that whereas the trade barriers reduce exports the subsequent depreciation of the dollar reduces imports resulting in an overall fall in world trade

the behavior of americas trade deficit has been matter of congressional concern since the early 1980s number of explanations have been forthcoming to account for its origin size and continuation many sound convincing and it is often difficult to discern the valid ones from those that sound convincing but are not to be tenable the explanation must contain some reason why it produces an imbalance between domestic saving and domestic investment which is equal to the trade imbalance unless it can do so it is not an explanation for the trade deficit among those reviewed above only the movement of capital to the united states that begins with an imbalance between domestic investment and saving produced either by fall in domestic saving or rise in domestic investment passes the test imposed by the national income and product accounts the other explanations given above are really explanations for the expected behavior of the exchange rate incorrectly claiming to be explanations for the trade deficit

real assets not all economists concede that capital movements drive the trade balance as the above analysis suggests those holding this view argue that cause and effect are the other way around the trade balance drives capital movements which renders the above analysis incorrect what is the nature of this argument and is it relevant to recent american experience the type of capital movement noted in the previous section is referred to in the literature as an autonomous capital movement or one motivated by such factors as desire to earn higher rate of return abroad or fear of capital loss if it is retained at home as such they are associated with movements in the exchange rate of the type presented above when countrys net autonomous capital inflow increases its currency appreciates in value and the net inflow of capital is represented by trade deficit

referred to in the literature as an induced capital movement because it is induced by prior movements in exports and imports suppose for example that the united states grew more rapidly than its trading partners and thus spent more on imports than the partners spent on american exports4 under normal circumstances this would lead to depreciation of the dollar and closing of the trade imbalance as discussed earlier this need not be the case if all of these goods and services were paid for by checks and foreigners did not use the proceeds to purchase us goods and services foreign banks or central banks would acquire net claim on us banks represented by the trade deficit these balances are capital flow in the same sense as if foreigners had purchased us bonds or equities they are however an induced capital inflow this inflow would not have occurred without the prior trade imbalance in goods and services also oil is priced internationally in terms of dollars the rising price of oil has increased the amount of dollars spent abroad on oil imports this has resulted in an increase in foreign ownership of us assets these socalled petrodollars can be thought of as an induced capital movement is the growing inflow of capital to the united states dominated by an induced inflow case can be made that it may have been factor in the past couple of years 5 the reason being that an induced capital inflow should have very little effect on the exchange rateit is in effect exchangerate neutral as the above analysis makes clear an induced capital inflow prevents the exchange rate from depreciating to restore equilibrium between the value of exports and imports and in the case of oil it is paid for in dollars themselves thus if induced flows dominate the net inflow one would expect the growth in the trade deficit to go handinhand with little movement in the exchange rate and from figure 2 it can be seen that this is the case the growth in the trade deficit during 20032007 has been associated with little change in the value of the dollar and this is the movement ggested by net inflow dominated by induced capital movements in the late 1990s by contrast the rise in the trade deficit was accompanied by an appreciating dollar consistent with capital inflows that were primarily autonomous 6 4 even more to the point this imbalance could be caused by the imposition of trade barriers on american goods and services by foreigners 5 the likely sources of the induced capital flows are east asia in particular china and japan and the middle east from 2002 to 2006 the official foreign exchange reserves of china rose 860 billion and appear to have been motivated by desire to maintain the ex isting yuandollar exchange rate during th at period japanese reserves rose by 485 billion large increases have also been recorded by india russia south korea and taiwan in the middle east high oil prices in the past couple of years may have led oilproducing countries to hold the receipts from higher oil exports to the united states in us assets 6 for greater detail see crs report rs21951 financing the us trade deficit role of foreign governments by marc labonte and gail

three discernable effects on the economy g343g495g561g3g144g144g155g142g144g138g157g142g561g6g142g150g138g151g141g561g152g155g561g21g153g142g151g141g146g151g144g561 the direct effect of trade deficit or the growth of trade deficit is to reduce aggregate demand or the growth in demand for american goods and services this is because spending on imports represents demand by americans for foreign output because trade deficit means that demand is not offset by foreign spending on american output us exports on balance the net demand for american output must be lower than it would be without the deficit thus the direct effect of growing trade deficit is reduction in the grow th in aggregate demand in the united states however trade deficit has several indirect effects that tend to expand spending for american goods and services first because the trade deficit is the way foreign capital or saving comes to the united states it reduces american interest rates from what they otherwise would be and lower interest rates stimulate interestsensitive spending by american businesses and households this includes spending on such durable goods as plant and equipment housing automobiles and appliances second lower interest rates tend to increase the prices of assets including equities which augments the financial wealth of households feeling wealthier households are supposedly induced to save less and spend higher proportion of their disposable income it has been argued that such consumer spending has played an important role in the current economic expansion in general the trade deficit has usually been associated with periods of robust growth in aggregate spending in recent decades the trade deficit has acted as natural release valve that has allowed the economy to remain in equilibrium despite high spending growth in the absence

inflationary pressures because spending was growing faster than productive capacity but the trade deficit tamed those pressures by meeting demand through foreign production overall the trade deficit did not prevent the economy from generating adequate aggregate spending and achieving an average growth rate in excess of 40 during the 19972000 period when the deficit was growing rapidly7 that has also been the case from 2002 to the present g344g495g561g22g145g142g561g23g495g21g495g561g5g138g153g146g157g138g149g561g21g157g152g140g148g561 an important attribute of growing economy is growing net per capita capital stock how much that stock can grow is basically determined by the net saving rate of country or how much of its gross saving is left after being used to replace the capital that is depreciated or used up in the process of producing output the net national saving rate of the united states has been falling over the postworld war ii period and is now lowaveraging about 12 of gdp during the period 20022006 versus about 11 during the decade of the 1960s and nearly 9 during the decade of the 1970s with trade deficit during the 1990s that averaged about 11 of gdp the united states was able to add to its net capital stock at much faster rate than without this net inflow of foreign capital the net inflow rose to 22 of gdp in 1998 and 31 in 1999 of course portion of the net capital stock is now foreign owned and the rewards to that capital will accrue to foreigners this will require that rising portion of us output be transferred abroad 8 and in fact this is occurring before the large trade deficits that began in the mid1980s the united states received net income from its foreign capital holdings that averaged about 334 billion during the peak years 19791984 during the period 20012006 the average inflow declined to 21 billion an average annual decline of some 12 billion although the united states is net debtor nation it still receives net investment income because its foreign holdings earn higher rate of return than the debt payments it makes to foreigners the fact that the united states still receives net investment income suggests that the trade deficit has not become burdensome thus far g345g495g561g22g145g142g561g16g138g157g158g155g142g561g152g143g561g12g152g139g561g5g155g142g138g157g146g152g151g561 from the discussion above it can be seen that growing net inflow of capital usually implies rise in the amount spent on imports and fall either absolute or relative in the amount spent on exports this translates into decline in jobs that are or would be created in the import competing and export sectors of the economy this is offset to degree by jobs that are preserved or created in the interest sensitive sectors of the economy this change in the employment mix should be distinguished from the total employment in the economy during both the long expansion of the 1980s and the 1990s the united states managed to achieve full employment if not overfull employment9 the unemployment rate fell to threedecade low in 2000 at time when the trade 7 the popular mundellfleming open economy macromodel suggests that if the assets of the various trading countries are perfect substitutes for each other then the trade deficit will have effect on real gdp growth and employment since these assets are unlikely to be perf ect substitutes trade deficits might be ex pected to have some slowing effect on gdp growth 8 however some of the rewards of foreign investment will accrue to american workers enabling them to enjoy higher standard of living than they otherwise would 9 macro economists define full employment relative to stable rate of inflation thus the full employment rate of unemployment is the unemployment

the socalled twin deficit theory this was not the case in the 1990s in fact the opposite occurred as the federal budget moved from deficit into surplus the trade deficit grew absolutely and as fraction of gdp during 20012006 as the federal budget shifted from surplus to deficit the trade deficit grew as fraction of gdp10 what does this mean it basically means that trade deficits can have several causes in the 1980s the prevailing view was that the growth in the federal budget deficit by decreasing national saving put upward pressure on us interest rates other things constant abroad this led foreigners to desire to buy american assets and in the process of doing so the dollar appreciated and the resulting trade deficit represented the net inflow of capital to the united states as result domestic investment as fraction of gdp did not decline as it would have in the face of falling domestic saving rate the period from 2001 to 2006 is reminiscent of the 1980s the shift from federal budget surplus to budget deficit has once again caused the national saving rate to fall this decline has been exacerbated by fall in the household saving rate these two declines make the story repeat of that told above 11 however the rise in the trade deficit has been largely due to the large inflow of capital motivated by the purchase of dollardenominated assets by foreign central banks and treasuries the 1990s presented more complicated picture the rise in the productivity of us capital not widely experienced abroad is believed to have raised the desired level of investment in the united states since domestic saving was insufficient to accommodate domestic investment foreign capital was drawn in to the country addi tionally financial turmoil in asia and russia caused foreign saving to flee to the safety of the united states making higher domestic continued for the 1990s places that rate in 5 to 6 range estimates using data through the 1980s would produce similar range 10 the relationship between the budget and trade deficits is fraught with much misunderstanding largely this is because budget deficits or surpluses can be created by congressional actions that affect taxes and expenditures and they can also be created because the budget responds to the economy in recessions for example tax revenue tends to fall and expenditures rise if the budget was near balance at the peak of the business cycle it will move into deficit in downturn even if there are legislative changes affecting tax rates andor expenditures to clear up this ambiguity the position of the budget in this discussion is relative to what would prevail if the economy were at full employment in the literature this is referred to as the structural budget deficit or surplus thus in th discussion in this section shift from budget deficit or surplus or the reverse must be understood as shift in the full employment measure of the budget they are not shifts caused by changes in the economy the structural shifts are frequently referred to as change in fiscal regime 11 between 2000 and 20032004 the federal budget went from surplus of 28 of gdp to deficit of 25 of gdp net shift of 53 of gdp the deficit fell in 2005 and 2006 the personal or household saving rate between 2000 and 2006 declined from 17 of gdp to 08 of gdp or net shift of 25 of gdp

appreciated and the trade deficit grew to reflect the enlarged net inflow of capital to the united states in both cases the growth in the trade deficit resulted from desire to purchase american assets in that sense the proximate cause of the trade deficit is the same the motivation for doing so or the ultimate cause however may have been different in the 1980s and the early 2000s it was lower national saving that resulted from shift in american fiscal regimes whereas in the 1990s it was primarily desire to participate in the enhanced productivity of the american economy through investment

government were to adopt policy to reduce or eliminate the trade deficit what policy tools could it use the discussion above implies that barriers to trade would not affect the trade deficita reduction in imports caused by barriers would be replaced by an increase in net imports caused by dollar appreciation even if stronger economic growth abroad could reduce the trade deficitand the analysis above suggests that it may notit is doubtful that us policy can do much to boost growth abroad the discussion above implies that the current trade deficit is primarily result of more attractive investment opportunities in the united states than can be accommodated by domestic saving alone to reduce the trade deficit this imbalance must be reduced obviously policy to reduce profitable investment opportunities in the united states would be counterproductive instead policy to reduce the trade deficit must aim to increase the domestic saving rate the government may be able to do so by making saving more profitable and increasing the incentives to save the government can make saving more profitable by lowering the taxes on saving it can increase the incentives to save through the expansion of taxfavored savings accounts the empirical evidence about the effectiveness of lower taxes and government saving incentives as policies to increase saving is mixed however 13 for instance the taxation of saving has been reduced significantly in recent years but the household saving rate has continued to decline however there is more direct way for the government to increase the national saving rateit can return to policy of structural budget surpluses national saving is determined by households corporations and the government when the government runs surplus all else equal it results in more domestic saving being available for private investment g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 the us trade deficit is made possible by the net purchase of us assets

trade deficit is component of aggregate domestic demand and sudden fluctuations in the deficit can cause sudden changes in income growth and employment congress has been concerned about its growth especially the sharp increase during 19972006 an increased desire by foreigners to purchase american assets can affect the economy in several ways first it directly reduces the growth in aggregate demand because the difference between the value of exports and imports is component of demand this is offset in part by the lower interest rates made possible by the capital inflow as consequence it would be difficult for growing trade deficit to actually cause aggregate demand to contract in the united states second the inflow of capital makes possible larger addi tion to the net national capital stock than would be possible from net domestic saving alone third it can affect the composition of jobs that are created but history has shown that the trade deficit is barrier to achieving
