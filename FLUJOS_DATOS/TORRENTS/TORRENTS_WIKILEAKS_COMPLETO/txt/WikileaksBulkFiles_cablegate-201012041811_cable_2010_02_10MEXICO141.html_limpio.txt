summit back to the future ref 10 mexico 127 10 santiago 51 10 santo domingo 67 derived from dscg 051 b d 1 c summary mexicos ambitious plan to use its final rio group presidency summit cancun 2223 february to create new more operational forum for regional cooperation failed dramatically the twoday event was dominated by press accounts of alba country theatrics and their usual proclivity towards third world antiimperialist rhetoric nothing practical was achieved on the two pressing regional priorities haiti president preval did attend but the discussion was an obscured footnote and honduras pres lobo was not even invited in deference to venezuelaalba and brazil and the alba countries outmaneuvered the mexicans leaving the details of the new organization in the hands of latin american and caribbean summit calc structure that will be managed by brazil and venezuela in 2011 end summary 2 c notwithstanding president calderons best intentions to create more practical regional forum for regionally dealing with latin american priorities ref mexicos latin american unity summit in the tourist resort of cancun 2223 february was poorly conceived inadequately managed and badly executed the cancun declaration presents long laundry list of issues without specifying any details on how they will be operationally translated into effective international action the meeting did not agree on name for the new organization see below on date for when it will be launched or on any practical details secretariat funding etc that would indicate how the new organization would develop worse yet was the press play and unofficial commentary from informed sources that were downright derisive of the meeting and the contradictory message it sent about mexicos interests and foreign policy 3 c already at the ceremonial opening on monday 22 february it was clear that things were not going well negotiations on the declaration had ground down on the operational details of the communique and brazil and the alba countries were firmly resisting mexicos proposal that the new forum be constituted immediately with agreement on institutional details brazilian president lula did not want to see the calc be subsumed before the end of his presidency and venezuelan president chavez wanted to leave his calc summit venezuela assumes the calc presidency from brazil in 2011 on schedule and available for grand launching of the new forum that as he said to the press would commemorate the realization of the bolivarian themes of latin american solidarity in the birthplace of the great liberator chavez was his usual over the top self in proclaiming the death of the organization of american states oas in lending hand to argentine president kirchners protest against british drilling for oil in the malvinas and in almost coming to blows with colombian president uribe over the latters protest of venezuelas economic embargo against colombia bolivian president morales played the supporting role as chavez factotum parroting chavez speeches and lavishing praise and compliments on raul castros cuba ecuadorian president correa used the meeting to try and divert money laundering allegations leveled against ecuador by suggesting the need for new more balanced regional mechanism to address the issue 4 c even calderons own pan party officials were privately dismissive of the event pan international affairs coordinator rodrigo cortez characterized the meeting as sad spectacle that does nothing to project our partys views on international priorities and the importance of the relationship between mexico and the united states he decried the public images of calderon hugging and cavorting with chavez morales and castro and was pessimistic from the start that anything practical would come from the meeting we did not even invite honduras leaving them out of the meeting in order to ensure alba participation decision that turned the meeting upside down with regard to our concrete security and other interests mexico 00000141 002 of 003 5 c the low point of the meeting was the verbal exchange between uribe and chavez at the opening day official lunch uribe raised venezuelas economic embargo on colombia terming it unhelpful and inconsistent with the regions economic interest and at odds with venezuelas strong criticism of the us embargo on cuba colombias ambassador in mexico luis camilo osorio told the polmincouns that contrary to press accounts uribe raised the issue in nonconfrontational way according to osorio and press accounts chavez reacted emotionally accusing colombia of having sent assassination squads to kill him and ended verbal and physical tirade with you can go to hell i am leaving the lunch uribe responded dont be coward and leave just to insult from distance verbal and body language continued to escalate until raul castro stepped in to urge civilized discussion outside of the dining room venezuelan security officials were scuffling with mexican security guards in an attempt to assist their president 6 c osorio was very critical of the summit terming it the worst expression of banana republic discourse that blames all of the regions problems on others without any practical solutions of their own osorio said the colombians had proposed working jointly on concrete agenda during calderons recent visit to colombia the mexicans he said were not interested confident that they had everything under control osorio opined that calderon had simply put bunch of the worst types together in room expecting to outsmart them instead brazil outplayed him completely and venezuela outplayed brazil there was practical planning there was management of the agenda and there was none of the legwork that would have been needed to yield practical and useful outcome 7 c brazilian dcm antonio francisco da costa silva neto conveyed his countrys view that brazil had done better job of managing the summit than the mexican hosts brazil was able to ensure that the new rio group would emerge not from the summit but from ongoing discussions in the rio group and the calc where brazil could exert its influence the calc survived and brazil would be managing that process as part of the troika when it turned over the presidency to venezuela 8 c we heard similar themes from exambassador jorge montano priconnected former respected senior mexican diplomat he echoed cortez criticism channeling it into an elegant but critical oped in mexico daily universal feb 26 montanos piece entitled with or without the oas reviewed briefly the history of latin american regional forums also criticizing us lack of attention to the region eg summit of americas but noting the practical achievements realized in the oas he called the summit unnecessary and inconsistent with mexicos interests and called for immediate damage control montano told us that he received separate calls from calderon and from foreign secretary espinoza irate over his criticism 9 c the media coverage did not in any way suggest practical forum and there was good supply of criticism in addition to montanos piece which was respectful in its choice of words the most damning criticism was political cartoon in the leading daily reforma feb 24 which depicted large chavez gorilla with small castro perched on his back playing an accordion labeled cancubazuela group with small image of calderon dancing to the music and waving marimbas osorio told us at same day central bank event with leading mexican businessmen that there were abundant references to the cartoon and its apt characterization of the summits result comment 10 c in the end mexico was limited to agreement on new forum but without any specific commitments on institutional details the cancun declaration is bulging rhetorical exercise mexico 00000141 003 of 003 that reflects the lack of agreement with its general and nonspecific language the press play leaned towards the critical side and even those who recognized calderons wellmentioned effort focused more attention on the paltry results even on the issues that mexico argued to us before the summit were reasons for bolstering the rio group success on colombiavenezuelaecuador problem the summit result was directly contrary to hopes for new more operational mechanism in the region 11 c we have not had yet received the official gom postsummit readout from our sre and presidency sources they have been busy finishing the declaration and doing follow up work with the latin american missions we will be shortly following up with their analysis and comments on the way ahead and their plans for deepening trade and investment through new arrangement with brazil announced at the end of the summit whatever their read out this is not playing here as diplomatic success except in some very general sense of raising the need for more effective regional action unfortunately the cancun latin american unity summit was not an example of new and bold step into the future but rather reminder of mexicos at times conflicting message on how it sees the future of the region and mexicos role as one of its leaders
