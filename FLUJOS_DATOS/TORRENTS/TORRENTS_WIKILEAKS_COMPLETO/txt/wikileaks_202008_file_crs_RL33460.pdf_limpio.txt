geostrategic significance many russian po liticians as well as or dinary citizens have never been fully reconciled to ukraine s independence from the soviet union in 1991 and feel that the country should be in russias political and economic orbit the us and european view especially in central and eastern europe is that strong independent ukraine is an important source of regional stability from the mid 1990s until 2004 ukraines political scene was dominated by president leonid kuchma and the oligarch ic clans groups of powerful politicians and businessmen mainly base d in eastern and southern ukraine that supported him kuchma was elected president in 1994 and reelected in 1999 he could not run for third term under the ukrainian constituti on his rule was characterized by fitful economic reform albeit with solid economic growth in later years widespread corruption and deteriorating human rights record ukraine held presidential elections on october 31 november 21 and december 26 2004 the oligarchs chose prime minist er viktor yanukovych as their candidate to succeed kuchma as president th chief opposition candidate former prime minister viktor yushchenko was prore form prowestern figure international observers criticized the ection campaign and the firs t and second rounds of the election as not free and fair citing such factors as governmentrun media bias in favor of nukovyc h abuse of absentee ballots barring of oppos ition representatives from electoral commissions and inaccurate voter lists nevertheless yushchenko topped the first r ound of th vote on october 31 by razorthin margin over yanukovych other candidate s finished far behind after the november 21 runoff between the two top candidates ukraines central election commission proclaimed nukovych the winner yushchenkos supporters charged that massive fraud had been committed hundreds of thousands of ukrainians took to the streets in what came to be known as the orange revolution after yushchenkos chosen campaign color they blockaded government offices in kiev and appeal ed to the ukrainian supreme court to invalidate the vote the court invalidated the runoff election on december 3

populist leader with sometimes combative political style who campaigned effectively on yushch enkos behalf she is controversial figure due in part to her alleged invol vement in corrupt schemes as businesswoman and government minister during the kuchma regime the orange revolution sparked good deal of interest in congress and elsewhere some hoped that ukraine could finally embark on path of comprehensive reforms and euroatlantic integration after years of halfmeasures and false starts however subsequent events led to some disillusionment among orange revolution supporters yushchenko dismissed prime minister tymoshenkos government in september 2005 the atmo sphere between the two leaders was poisoned by accusations of corruption lodged by supporters of each against the other sides partisans including over the highly lucrative and nontran sparent natural gas industry in order to secure support for new government yushchenko then made political nonaggression pact with his oppone nt from the presidential election viktor yanukovych and promised not to pros ecute yanukovychs key supporters for electoral fraud and other crimes some s upporters of the orange revolution viewed the move as betrayal of one of the key principles of their movement some began to question whether the new government was better than the old regime given ongoing government corruption scandals and the perception that the orange revolution might be reduced to squabblin g over the redistribution of property among the old oligarchs and wouldbe new orange ones1 on march 26 2006 ukraine he ld parliamentary elections the largest vote getter in the elections was the party of regions headed by yushchenkos former presidential election rival viktor yanukovy ch after the failure of protracted attempts to reconstitute th orange revolution coaliti on the socialist party formerly part of it changed sides and formed coalition with the party of regions and the communists which put forward yanukovych as its candidate for prime minister yushchenko reluctantly appointed yanukovych as prime minister and the ukrainian parliament approved the new gove rnment on august 4 2006 yanukovychs government and the parliamentary major ity led by the party of regions worked steadily to whittle away at yushchenkos powers and political influence the government and par liament removed ministers ppointed by yushchenko and rejected his proposed candidates to repl ace them the government refused to implement yushchenkos decrees hoping to stem the threat to his power president yushchenko dissolved the ukrainian parliament on april 2 2007 cla iming that the defection of individual members of the opposition to the majority s opposed to whole faction made the ruling majority illeg

2007 to end the crisis according to many observers this political crisis underlined the fact that the country still needs to make substantial pr ogress in developing smoothly functioning democracy the poorly defi ned separation of powers in ukraines constitution has invited conflict and needs to clarified another key problem is the persistence of postsoviet political culture in which winnertakeall ttitudes and unscrupulous tactics take precedence over genuine respect for the rule of law current political situation on september 30 2007 ukraine held early parliamentary elections the party of regions remains the largest party in the new legislature it won 3437 of the vote and 175 seats in the 450seat parliament the yuliya tymoshenko bloc which won 3071 and 156 seats is the second largest our ukrainepeoples defense came in distant third with 1415 and 72 seats the communist party received 539 of the vote and 27 seats the lytvyn bloc was the only other party to reach the 3 vote barrier for representation in the parliament it won 396 of the vote and secured 20 seats these results were not dramatic departure from the results of the march 2006 election the party of regions lost 11 seats but its communist allies gained six the our ukraine bloc lost nine seats however its former orange revolution partner the yuliya tymoshenko bloc gained 27 seats the socialists perhaps punished by the electorate for betraying their former orange allies fell below the 3 and lost all ofukraines main political groups party of regions the largest party in ukraines parliament it draws its support from eastern ukraine where suspicion of ukrainian nationalism is high and support for close ties with russia is strong it defends the economic interests of powerful oligarchic groups in eastern ukraine yuliya tymoshenko bloc mainly vehicle for the ambitions of the charismatic tymoshenko it has little ideological cohesion of its own it is the second largest group in the ukrainian parliament largely because many ukrainians see tymoshenko as the most stalwart defender of the populist anti corruption ideals of the orange revolution our ukrainepeoples self defense bloc the main political gr oup supporting president yushchenko it favors free market economic reforms and prowestern foreign policy it draws its support from western ukraine where ukranian nationalism is strong communist party now shadow of its former self overtaken by the party of regions in its eastern ukraine strongholds and faced with an aging electorate it strongly opposes market economics and favors strong ties to russia lytvyn bloc centrist bloc headed by volodmyr lytvyn former top official in the kuchma regime lytvyn has changed sides several times in ukraines political struggles backing the side with the

inroads there as compared to the previous election just over year earlier perhaps opening the way to future as mocratic ukraines fi rst truly countrywide party negotiations over new government were protracted on december 6 the parliament approved ar seniy yatsenyuk as chairman of the rada yatsenyuk from our ukrainepeoples self defense wa s formerly ukraines foreign minister president yushchenko nominated tymoshenko as his candidate for prime minister the parliament approved ty moshenko as prime minister on december 18 by vote of 2260 the parliament then approved tymoshenkos government the party of regions communist party and lytvyn bloc did not take part in the votes the extreme fragility of her majority has made tymoshe nkos task as prime minister difficult in midjanuary 2008 the party of regions and the communist party blocked the parliament from meeting their ostensible reason was yatsenyuks signature on letter with yushchenko nd tymoshenko to nato secretary general jaap hoop scheffer requesting member ship action plan map for ukraine at the nato summit in bucharest on april 24 2008 they said yatsenyuk had right to speak for the parliament on such controversial issue without their consent the parliament resumed operations on march 6 2008 after it passed resolution stating that the parliament would consider legislation to join nato only after public referendum appr oved nato membership another problem has been escalating tension between tymoshenko and yushchenko yushchenko has of ten criticized tymoshenkos policies including her privatization plans efforts to renegotiate energy relations with russia and alleged failure to fight rising inflation he has pressed for constitutiona l reforms giving the presidency greater powers over the gove rnment yushchenko appointed now former highranking leader from the party of regions as secretary of the national security and defense council to the rprise of yanukovych analysts say that yushchenko may be building bridges to prag matic elements in the party of regions especially key businessmen such as rinat akhmetov in order to balance tymoshenkos power persons close to yu shchenko have created new party

2008 ukraine slowing growth suggests stagflation risk oxford analytica august 14 2008 tymoshenko hit back by calling for parliamentary republic that would weaken the presidency such move would require the support of the party of regions which also favors weaker presidency these moves suggest early jockeying for power in advance of pr esidential elections in 2010 in which yushchenko and tymoshenko could both be candidates at present yushchenko appears to be in the weaker position as opi nion polls have consis tently shown him to be much less popular than tymoshenko on september 3 2008 our ukraine announced that it was leaving the governing coalition in ten days unless tymoshe nko reversed herself on the recent passage of laws by the par liament reducing the presidents powers the tymoshenko bloc and the party of regions provided the votes for the measures our ukraine also demands that tymoshenko join yu shchenko in condemning russias military assault on georgia in early august tymoshenko voided commenting on the issue if the government collapses yushchenko has warned that he will exercise his powers under the constitution to call new parliamentary elections if new government is not formed within 30 days the elections would be ukraines third in three years some analysts believe our ukraine would likely suffer sharp defeat in such elections judging from current opinion polls if new government is formed without elections it would like be composed of the tymo shenko bloc and the party of regions current economic situation ukraine is experiencing strong ec

by the government tymoshenko plans to rapidly privatize key firms such as the telecommunications monopoly ukrtelecom and the odesa portside plan chemical firm in part to pay for her plan to co

exploit that the terms of the psa were too generous and that the license holders were planning to sell control of the field to gazprom tymoshenko may also have been upset th at one of vancos partners is rinat akhmetov powerful oligarch and po litical opponent of tymoshenko us ambassador to ukraine willia m taylor criticized tymosh enkos move saying that it would hurt prospects for foreign investment in ukraine as well as ukraines energy security in may 2008 president yushchenkos security and defense council ordered the government to resci nd its cancellation of the groups psa prime minister tymoshenko has pledged to battle corruption in ukraine which many experts and us officials view as key problem hindering ukraines economic development in march 2008 the parliament repealed state procurement law that had been widely criticized for promoting corruption the government says that crackdown on tax evasion and customs fraud has substantially increased government revenues ukraines foreign policy until yushchenkos election in 2005 ukrainian foreign policy was characterized by an effort to balance ties with russia with those with the united states and western countries previous l eaders gave lip service to joining nato and the european union but did little to meet the standards set by these organizations ukrainian leaders also promised closer ties with russia in exchange for russian energy at subsidized prices but balked at implementing agreements with russia that would seriously compromise ukraines sove reignty such as ceding control over ukraines energy infrastructure to moscow after taking office president yushch enko put integration into the global economy and euroatlantic institutions at the center of ukraines foreign policy one key foreign policy goal has been for ukraine to join the world trade organization wto ukraine joined the wto in may 2008 in addition to helping ukrainian exporters wto membership may give ukraine political leverage

general jaap hoop scheffe r requesting membership action plan for ukraine at the april 24 nato summit in buchares t romania on march 17 yushchenko and tymoshenko sent letters to hoop scheffer ge rman federal chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy reiterating ukraines request for map the party of regions and the communist s are strongly opposed to map for ukraine they responded to the first lette r by blocking the functioning of the parliament yanukovych threatened to hold public demonstrations against the governments request for map pub lic opinion polls have shown that less than onequarter of the population supports nato membership both president yushchenko and prime minister tymoshe nko have launched public information campaign to educate ukrainians about nato they have also agreed that ukraines entry into nato would have to be ndorsed beforehand by public referendum perhaps in an effort to defuse domestic and russian criticism president yushchenko has said that ukraine will not allow the establishment of nato bases on ukrainian soil he has noted that the ukrainian constitution does not permit the establishment of foreign military bases with the temporary exception of russias current black sea naval base the lease for which runs out in 2017 nato declined to offer ukraine map at the bucharest summit despite strong support from the united states and almost all central european nato members germany and france played the leading role in blocking the effort they raised questions about ukraines qua lifications for map and so expressed concerns that granting map to ukraine would hurt relations with russia however the allies agreed that kiev could receive map as early as the nato foreign ministers meeting in december 2008 if remaining ques tions over its application are resolved in move that surprised many observers the summit communique also contained anhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33460crs8 unqualified statement that ukraine and ge orgia will become members of nato without specifying when that might happen the ambiguous result of the summit cause d varying reactions within ukraine president yushchenko and the ukrainian government hailed the summit as key steppingstone on kievs path toward nat membership pointing in particular to the commitment made to admit ukraine into the alliance in contrast yanukovych and the opposition applauded the denial of map at the summit viewing it as blow to yushchenkos pronato policy the conflict between russia and ge orgia in august 2008 may have an important impact on ukraines hopes of receiving map european nato countries that have opposed map for uk raine may be even more reluctant to agreed to one fearing sharp deteriorati on in relations with moscow and perhaps even being embroiled in military conflict with russia in the future supporters of map for ukraine have argued that the refusal to grant map to kiev and tbilisi at the bucharest summit may have emboldened moscow to use massive military force against georgia they believe that map for ukraine and georgia would send strong warning signal to russia to not repeat the use of such aggressive tactics it would also signal natos rejection of mosc ows assertion of sphere of influence in postsoviet countries domestic political infighting in ukraine may also hurt ukraines map prospects either by convincing some nato members that ukraine lacks the political maturity for candidate status or if the collapse of the current government results in the creation of new one that includes th party of regions such government could downplay or even renounce the cu rrent governments map aspirations european union ukraine seeks to open talks on an association agreement with the european union that would clearly state ukraines status as candidate eu member many countries in the eu have been cool to ukraines possible membership perhaps because of the huge burden large poor country like ukraine could place on already strained eu coffers indeed eu officials have tried to dissuade ukraine from even raising the issue however not all eu states are reluctant to consider ukraines eventual membership poland and the baltic states have advocated ukraines joining the eu in part because they see stable secure ukraine as bulwark against russia nevertheless even supporters of ukrain eu membership acknowledge that it could be more than decade before kiev is ready to join but believe that formal eu recognition of ukraines candidacy could speed the reform process in ukraine ukraine

it will offer ukraine and other eastern european countries perspective of eu membership in september 2008 the eu agreed to call the new ukraineeu accord currently under negotiation an association agreement however unlike the association agreements signed by other european countries in the past the new accord will not contain an explicit recogn ition of ukraines eu membership aspirations russia

to exclude such vessels from ukraine on august 13 yushchenko issued decr ee requiring russia to provide advance permission for movement of russian military ships planes and personnel on ukraines territory russia said the decree was antirussian and in contradiction to the 1997 treaty that gave russia the right to ba its fleet in crimea prime minister tymoshenko also criticized the yushchenko decree saying she would not permit conflict to occur between russia and ukraine over the fleet the russian vessels that participated in the georgia conflict later reportedly returned to their crimean

2006 in 2005 the russian governmentcontrolled natural gas monopoly gazprom insisted on mo re than fourfold increase in the price that it charges ukraine for natural gas when ukraine balked at the demand russia cut off natural gas supplies to ukraine on december 31 leading also to cuts in gas supplies to western europe the gas supplie s were restored two days later after new gas supply agreement was signed in early 2007 with the more prorussian yanukovych government in power russia and ukraine agreed to gradually increase the price of russian natural gas to ukraine over the next five years at which time it will reach the world market price gazprom announced natural gas price of 17950 for 2008 significant increase over the 130 ukraine paid in 2007 but still well short of world market levels another issue is the involvement of shadowy company rosukrenergo as the nominal supplier of russian natural gas to ukraine some analysts are concerned about possible involvement of an organize d crime kingpin in the company as well as corrupt links with russian and ukrainia n officials the us justice department has reportedly investigated the firm6 perhaps more troubling for ukraine the 2006 accord with gazprom called for the creation of ukrgazenergo joint venture between rosukrenergo and the ukrainian statecontrolled gas firm naftogaz that grants the former access to

welloff residential consumers prime minister tymoshenko has sh arply criticized the presence of rosukrenergo as middleman from the ukrainian natural gas market in january 2008 she sharply reduced the amount of ga s ukrgazenergo can sell to ukrainian consumers the role of middlemen in the ukrainian gas market may also be reduced by market forces rosukrenergos profits are based on selling cheap

russia supports genuinely transparent energy relationship with ukraine on march 35 2008 gazprom reduced gas supplies to ukraine by 50 alleging nonpayment of debts by ukraine ukrainian gas company officials warned that they might divert gas intended for western europe to make up the difference the two sides reached agreement on the debt on march 5 and supp lies were restored on march 12 the two sides agreed to eliminate ukrgazenergo from the domestic gas trade but gave gazprom direct access to the most lucrative part of ukrainians domestic market supplies to large enterprises the agreement said the fate of rosukrenergo would be determined by fu ture negotiations however tymoshenko appeared dissatisfied with parts of the acco rd she remains dete rmined to eliminate rosukrenergo as soon as possible the ukrainian government made significant unilateral changes to the agreement including barring rosukrenergo from the profitable practice of reex porting central asian gas from ukraine to
