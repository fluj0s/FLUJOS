updated july 12 2006 joe richardson domestic social policy division congressional research service the library of congress charitable choice rules and faithbased organizations summary president bushs administration has advanced charitable choice agenda aimed at expanding the ability of faithbased organizations to provide federally funded social services and encouraging states to do likewise charitable choice rules are intended to ensure that faithbased organizations participate more fully in federally funded social service programs and offer services without abandoning their religious character or infringing on the religious freedom of applicantrecipients they deal with issues such as faithbased organizations ability to remain independent of governmental controls to discriminate in their hiring practices and to conduct inherently religious activities while at the same time providing governmentfunded services prior to the administrations initiative congress enacted charitable choice rules for temporary assistance for needy families tanf the community services block grant csbg and substance abuse prevention and treatment programs but after congress failed to enact charitable choice rules for more programs the bush administration issued an executive order eo 13279 that directed that most rules covered under the charitable choice rubric be followed by wide range of social service programs unless otherwise directed by law in addition the administration and congress have provided money for range of specific grantsprojects in which faithbased organizations play substantial role including the compassion capital fund charitable choice rules represent shift in how government treats religious organizations applying for social service grants they are intended to deny aid for inherently religious activities as opposed to the preexisting policy that generally barred assistance to pervasively sectarian religious organizations for congress there is continuing debate over whether to accept the existing situation where the executive order has effectively put in place most but not all charitable choice principles for the bulk of social service programs except where barred by law or challenge it or enact the provisions of the executive order and possibly added rules and cover more programs proponents of congressional action are concerned that an executive order may not be enough to support the policy in the longer term and would like to see some rules and programs not included in the order added opponents of the executive order or writing charitable choice rules into law are primarily worried over their implications for hiring discrimination and the prospect that religious content may be infused into federally funded programs most recently pending changes to the workforce investment act the older americans act the community services block grant and head start law would affect participation by faithbased organizations in addition

regulation intended to enhance the ability of faithbased organizations to provide federally funded services without impairing their religious character or the religious freedom of beneficiariesapplicants1 these rules have been strongly supported by the bush administration at present only three federal program areas have specific charitable choice rules stipulated in law temporary assistance for needy families tanf the community services block grant csbg and substance abuse prevention and treatment grants administered by the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa under the public health service act perhaps the broadest example of charitable choice rules are those established primarily for tanf by the 1996 welfare reform law pl 104193 after the 107th congress took up but did not approve legislation to extend charitable choice rules to cover many more programs title ii of hr 7 the charitable choice expansion act of 2001 the bush administration issued an executive order that directed that most but not all rules covered under the charitable choice rubric be followed by wide range of social service programs executive order eo 13279 december 12 2002 attempts to expand the coverage of charitable choice rules by law also failed in the 108th congress the 109th congress faces continuing debate over whether to accept the existing situation where the eo has by regulation effectively put in place most but not all charitable choice principles for the bulk of social service programs except where barred by law or challenge it or enact the provisions of the eo and possibly other rules it does not include and cover more programs than now are covered by law other items of related interest in the charitable choice arena include the role of stateslocalities which actually administer the majority of federal social service grant money litigation over the constitutionality of charitable choice rules whether set by law or regulation and the status of and funding for the compassion capital fund program providing direct grants to faith and communitybased organizations to help them expand their services 1 throughout this report the terms religious organization and faithbased organization are used interchangeably when asked for definition of faithbased by one commentor on its charitable choice regulations the department of health and human services hhs said that it used the terms religious organization and faithbased organization interchangeably and added that neither the us constitution nor relevant supreme court precedents contain comprehensive definition of religion or religious organization crs2 what are charitable choice rules charitable choice rules are aimed at ensuring that faithbased organizations can participate in federally funded social service programs on the same footing as other nongovernmental providers and can offer services without abandoning their religious character or infringing on the religious freedom of recipients2 so far they have taken five different forms 1 the original rules established by the 1996 welfare reform law 2 the rules enacted for the csbg in 1998 3 the rules legislated for public health service act substance abuse prevention and treatment programs in 2000 4 the provisions in hr 7 of the 107th congress and 5 the principles set forth and implemented by regulation under the bush administrations eo 13279 the original 1996 charitable choice rules charitable choice rules were first laid out in the 1996 welfare reform law section 104 of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act pl 104193 and cover all states tanf activities and to lesser degree ie to the limited extent services are provided states administration of food stamps medicaid and the supplemental security income ssi program these rules like the rest of the law governing tanf and certain other programs were set to expire on september 30 2002 however series of temporary extensions that were enacted kept them and the rest of tanf law in force on february 8 2006 pl 109171 the deficit reduction act of 2005 was enacted this law extends the life of tanf law including its charitable choice provisions through fy2010 the provisions of the 1996 law are probably the most farranging set of rules so far set out and have been basic model for charitable choice provisions since enacted proposed or established by regulation the laws major charitable choice provision bars government from discriminating against an organization applying to provide publicly funded services on the basis of its religious character so long as the program is implemented in manner consistent with the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment to the us constitution moreover it stipulates the following rules with regard to faithbased organizations applying for or receiving public funds and applicants forrecipients of services religious organizations remain independent of government and retain control over the definition development practice and expression of their religious belief government may not require religious organizations to change their form of internal governance or to remove religious art and other symbols as condition of participation 2 for details as to how the various charitable choice laws proposals and regulations differ see 1 crs report rl31043 public aid to faithbased organizations charitable choice in the 107th congress background and selected issues by david ackerman 2 crs report rl31042

employment practices regardless of their receipt of public funds like other granteescontractors religious organizations use of public funds is subject to audit except that when government funds are segregated only those moneys are subject to audit any party seeking to enforce its rights under charitable choice provisions of law can assert civil court action for relief against the entityagency allegedly committing violation funds provided directly as opposed to indirectly through vouchers may be spent for sectarian worship instruction or proselytization3 federal charitable choice rules are not to be construed as preempting any provision of states constitution or laws regarding aid to or through religious organizations faithbased organizations may not discriminate against beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries on the basis of religion or religious belief government must provide accessible alternative providers where individuals have an objection to the religious character of the organizationinstitution from which they receive or would receive services community services block grant csbg charitable choice rules in 1998 the 105th congress enacted charitable choice language covering the csbg section 201 of pl 105285 this law generally follows the provisions of the 1996 welfare reform act but does not include its authority for civil actions for relief in cases of violations its stipulation that federal charitable choice rules do not preempt state constitutionslaws its requirement for alternative providers or its prohibition on discrimination against applicantsrecipients based on religion or religious beliefs efforts to reauthorize the csbg during the 108th congress failed in part due to disagreement over provisions that would have amended the programs charitable choice rules to prohibit grantee discrimination in their hiring practices and mandated that organizations separate their religious servicesactivities from programs using csbg funds in the 109th congress house bill providing for reauthorization hr 341 is pending it includes relatively noncontroversial provision that would bar csbg grantees from discriminating against those seeking services based on religion or religious beliefs however as with the 108th congress it is likely that amendments dealing with hiring practices and separation of religious servicesactivities will be offered if reauthorization legislation is pursued4 3 provision of indirect aid in the form of vouchers means that faithbased organization that redeems voucher may avoid this prohibition 4 for more information on the csbg and legislation affecting it see crs report rl32872 community services block grant csbg funding and reauthorization by karen spar and garrine p laney crs4 substance abuse prevention and treatment program charitable choice rules in 2000 the 106th congress enacted two measures adding charitable choice amendments to the law governing substance abuse prevention and treatment services under titles v and xix of the public health service act section 3305 of pl 106310 and section 1 of pl 106554 these provisions generally track those of the 1996 welfare reform law except that it is unclear to what extent their federal charitable choice rules could preempt state constitutionslaws and to what degree basic public health service act employment nondiscrimination provisions apply hr 7 charitable choice rules on july 19 2001 the house passed the charitable choice expansion act of 2001 title ii of hr 7 of the 107th congress but it died in the senate this is the most recent comprehensive congressional action on charitable choice rules5 as with earlier laws this measure generally followed the charitable choice provisions of the 1996 welfare reform act with some significant differences it would have extended coverage of charitable choice rules to list of new programs eg juvenile delinquencyjustice programs crime prevention and aid to crime victims and offenders families housing programs workforce investment act wia programs older americans act oaa programs programs dealing with domestic violence hunger relief activities assistance for students obtaining secondary school diploma equivalents and activities relating to outsideofschool hours programs but it included language regarding federal preemption of state constitutionslaws and added provisions 1 stating that organizations getting direct public funds must offer any religious activities on voluntary basis and separate from the assisted program and 2 when consistent with the purpose of covered program allowing the federal government to require that some or all of the funds in given program be in the form of indirect aid like vouchers aimed at permitting faith based organization redeeming vouchers to avoid the general prohibition on using funds for worship instruction or proselytization 5 in other action the house voted to eliminate provisions in head start law and the workforce investment act wia that forbid religious service providers to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices votes were taken on may 8 2003 hr 1261 wia and july 25 2003 hr 2210 head start on apr 3 2003 the senate passed s 476 the care act without provisions that senator santorum had sought for equal treatment of religious organizations as providers of federally funded social services to win passage of the care act which contained provisions that would have expanded tax incentives for charitable giving increased funding for the social services block grant and established new taxcreditfinanced individual development accounts senator santorum agreed to compromise version that added technical assistance compassion capital fund and funding for maternity group homes but lacked an equal treatment charitable choice title on sept 17 2003 new version of hr 7 entitled the charitable giving act was passed by the house it provided for tax incentives for charitable donations would have authorized compassion capital fund grants and funding for maternity group homes and would have extended expiring provisions for individual development accounts however it did not include charitable choice language or more funding for the social services block grant crs5 eo 13279 charitable choice principlesregulations expansion of charitable choice by executive order after the senate failed to approve the housepassed bill hr 7 of the 107th congress to extend charitable choice rules on new terms to wider range of programs president bush issued an executive order eo directing most cabinet departments and the agency for international development to adopt what he identified as charitable choice principles and policymaking criteria in the regulations governing their social service programs to the extent permitted by law with some notable exceptions these principles criteria and the regulations implementing them largely follow the rules set out in hr 7 as passed by the house in 2001 the eo says that faithbased organizations should be eligible to compete for federal financial assistance used to support social service programs without impairing their independence autonomy and religious expressioncharacter and that organization should be discriminated against as provider of federally funded social services on the basis of religion or religious belief covered social service programs are defined broadly to include all programs administered by the federal government or by statelocal government using federal financial assistance that provide services directed at reducing poverty improving opportunities for low income children revitalizing lowincome communities helping lowincome families and individuals to become selfsufficient or otherwise aiding people in need6 the principles set forth in eo13279 bar faithbased organizations from using direct federal financial assistance to support any inherently religious activity such as worship religious instruction or proselytization and specify that organizations that engage in inherently religious activities must offer them to beneficiaries separately in time and location from programsservices supported with direct federal funds participation in religious activities must be voluntary for service recipients on the other hand faithbased organizations may use their facilities to provide federally funded social services without removing or altering religious symbols or changing religious terms in their name select board members on religious basis and include religious references in mission statements and other charteringgoverning documents as with most earlier charitable choice initiatives the eo forbids religious organization from discriminating against beneficiaries or potential beneficiaries on the basis of religion religious belief or lack of religious belief 6 examples given in the eo include child care services protective services for children and adults foster care and adoption services services to meet special needs transportation assistance job training and employment services informationreferralcounseling services services related to soup kitchens and food banks health support services literacy promotion activities mentoring services to prevent and treat juvenile delinquency and substance abuse services related to domestic violence and housing assistance expansion under the eo is covered with more detail in 1 the expanding administrative presidency george w bush and the faithbased initiative report authored by anne farris richard p nathan and david j wright and issued under by the roundtable on religion and social welfare policy see the additional resources section of this report for the roundtables website and 2 crs report rs21924 charitable choice expansion by executive action by joe richardson crs6 absent from eo 13279 are three major provisions of hr 7 as passed by the house in 2001 1 authority to convert assistance into vouchers or some other form of indirect aid7 2 provision dealing with faithbased organizations right to discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices8 and 3 language requiring that alternative service providers be furnished for beneficiaries objecting to the religious character of provider also missing from eo 13279 are provisions in the original 1996 welfare reform law dealing with 1 audits 2 enforcement through court action and 3 preemption of statelocal laws9 to carry out the principles set out by the executive order the departments of agriculture education health and human services housing and urban development justice labor and veterans affairs as well as the agency for international development have issued series of regulations information about these regulations as well as certain other policy changes are available at httpwwwwhitehousegovgovernmentfbciregulatorychangeshtml finally eo 13279 also amended an existing executive order eo 11246 dating from 1965 concerning employment discrimination to specify that religious organizations that contract to provide goods or services directly to the federal government or participate in federally assisted construction contracts can discriminate on religious grounds in their employment practices and the labor department has followed up with regulatory revision10 7 as noted earlier indirect aid may be used for religious activities because organizations would receive funds only as result of private choices of beneficiaries 8 the eo does not include language on employment discrimination but two publications of the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives make clear the administrations stance that barring contrary provisions of law like the laws governing the head start program and workforce investment act programs faithbased organizations receiving federal funds are to be allowed to discriminate in employment 1 protecting the civil rights and religious liberty of faithbased organizations why religious hiring rights must be preserved and 2 guidance for faithbased and community organizations on partnering with the federal government moreover in the samshas final rule implementing the eo the bush administration held that the public health service acts general nondiscrimination hiring rules are inapplicable to religious organizations demonstrating that they would substantially burden their exercise of religion the administration maintained that the religious freedom restoration act of 1993 pl 103 141 forbids the government from substantially burdening persons exercise of religion unless this is the least restrictive way of furthering compelling government interest see the federal register of september 30 2003 68 fr 5642956449 9 although the eo contains provisions as to audits publication of the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives guidance to faithbased and community organizations on partnering with the federal government notes that like the rule in the 1996 law audits should be limited to federal funds when segregated 10 eo 11246 applies to contract for the construction rehabilitation alteration conversion extension or repair of buildings highways or other improvements to real property it is applicable to all federally assisted construction contracts that arise in the course of carrying out federal grant contract loan insurance or guarantee also see crs report rl32195 charitable choice legal and constitutional issues by angie welborn crs7 what is the faithbased initiative the components of the initiative soon after taking office in 2001 president bush put forward an agenda to enlist equip empower and expand the heroic works of faithbased and community groups across america it included an expansion of tax incentives for charitable giving covered in separate report crs report rs21144 tax incentives for charity an overview of legislative proposals by jane g gravelle and extension of charitable choice rules see the discussion of charitable choice rules above to most federally supported social service programs of particular concern was assurance that smaller congregation based organizations would be helped in competing for social services grant money as already discussed congress has not enacted an expansion of charitable choice rules beyond those put in law in 1996 1998 and 2000 but the administration has put in place most charitable choice rules for many federally supported social service programs through an executive order eo 13279 and accompanying regulations as part of his faithbased initiative the president also has established white house office of faithbased and community initiatives eo 13199 and has set up centers for faithbased and community initiatives in 11 agencies the departments of agriculture commerce education health and human services homeland security housing and urban development justice labor and veterans affairs as well as the small business administration and the administration for international development eo 13198 eo 13199 eo 13280 eo 13342 eo1339711 these offices have the role of ensuring that faithbased and community organizations have improved access to social services program funding fourth component of the initiative is the compassion capital fund program operated by the department of health and human services administration for children and families that provides direct grants to faith and communitybased organizations to help them expand their services this program is covered in separate report crs report rs21844 the compassion capital fund brief facts and current developments by joe richardson in addition to the compassion capital fund the initiative also is perceived to encompass number of specific projects in which faithbased organizations play or are expected to play substantial role eg the samshas access to recovery grants for substance abuse treatment matching grant program to mentor children of prisoners prisoner prerelease pilot project maternity group home program pilot project to increase participation of faithbased organizations in community development programs responsible fatherhood projects and antigang efforts directed at youth and several agencies have used preexisting authorities to fashion initiatives that are primarily focused on faithbased and community organizations eg the national nonprofit humanitarian initiative run by the agriculture departments farm service agency labor department competitive grant pilot project for grassroots faithbased and community organizations supporting existing job trainingplacement efforts and providing postjobplacement services 11 the department of homeland security center for faithbased and community initiatives is the most recently created e0 13397 march 7 2006 crs8 sixth component of the presidents initiative is encouraging states to adopt charitable choice principles in their grantmaking policies both for federal funds they administer and state money under eo 13279 federal agencies with oversight of social service funds that states actually administer are changing the federal rules governing the use of these funds to ensure that charitable choice principles and policies are followed later section of this report entitled what are states doing covers state activity finally the presidents initiative includes continuing series of 1 regional conferences giving general overview of the initiative information about the federal funding process and available funding opportunities and requirements on recipients of federal funding and 2 targeted workshops offering federal grantwriting instruction in both cases the events encompass background on the basic elements of charitable choice rules and are supported and often sponsored by the federal agencies responsible for making grants the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives also plays significant role in many of these meetings and has sponsored national conferences on opportunities for faithbased and community based organizations funding there is pot of federal money specifically for social services provided by faithbased and community organizations under the presidents initiative the closest approximation is funding provided by the compassion capital fund which helps faithbased and community organizations build their ability to tap funding sources and provide services but does not make grants for the actual provision of services see crs report rs21844 the compassion capital fund brief facts and current developments by joe richardson instead funding for faithbased organizations providing social services can come 1 directly through federally administered generally competitive grants under regular social service programs 2 indirectly as subgrants from federal agency awards or 3 through federal formula grant programs where the award decisions as to how to spend federal money are made by states or localities complete picture of the extent to which faithbased organizations are receiving social service dollars with the advent of the presidents initiative is not available however information gathered by two sources the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives and the roundtable on religion and social welfare policy provides sketch of how they fare in obtaining direct federally administered funding according to the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives in fy2005 total of 215 billion in funding for faithbased organizations was provided under 130 federally administered competitive grant programs for social services run by six departments agriculture education health and human services housing and urban development justice and labor and 28 program areas at the agency for international development aid this represented 11 of the 197 billion spent by the surveyed programs12 the three 12 further details on federal competitive grant spending through faithbased organizations are available at the website for the white house office of faithbased and community continued crs9 agencies having the largest pools of funding available for competitive grant programs for which faithbased organizations would be eligible reported 7 the department of health and human services 67 programs 14 the aid 28 program areas and 24 the department of housing and urban development 11 programs the white house office also reports that direct federal support for faithbased organizations has increased over the past few years for the five agencies providing information for fy2003 through fy2005 the departments of education health and human services housing and urban development justice and labor money going to faithbased organizations went up from 81 of the total available under the surveyed programs in fy2003 to 103 in fy2005 and the dollar amount they received rose from 117 billion in fy2003 to 14 billion in fy2005 even as the total available shrunk somewhat from 145 billion in fy2003 to 137 billion in fy200513 when the two agencies for which data are available only for fy2004 and fy2005 the agriculture department and the agency for international development are included in the white house figures similar trend is evident total seven agency funding for faithbased organizations went from 103 2 billion in fy2004 to 109 215 billion in fy2005 however total dollars available also increased by about the same amount from 195 billion fy2004 to 197 billion fy2005 on the other hand separate study done under the auspices of the roundtable on religion and social welfare policy presents somewhat different picture14 it indicates that faithbased organizations 1 received steady 1718 of funding under the 99 programs or program areas in nine agencies it tracked over the fy2002fy2004 period and 2 saw their share of grants rise from 116 to 128 however while the number of participating faithbased organizations and grants to 12 continued initiatives httpwwwwhitehousegovgovernmentfbci under the heading data collection spending figures do not include subgrants through intermediary organizations or grants of federal funds administered by states and localities as such they are underestimates 13 another way to look at the degree of support for faithbased organizations is the portion of grants not dollars they receive this is especially important because many are congregationbased groups running small projects specifically targeted for help under the faithbased initiative for example according to the white house office the number of faithbased organization grants given by surveyed programs in the five agencies with fy2003fy2005 figures went up markedly from 1634 fy2003 to 2250 fy2005 14 this study getting piece of the pie federal grants to faithbased social service organizations is available through the roundtables website see this reports section on additional resources primarily because this study attempts to track grantmaking policy over the threeyear time period and for example does not include grants under initiatives begun after 2002 it is substantially less comprehensive than the yearbyyear snapshots represented by the data used by the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives discussed above for example in fy2004 it covers over 20 fewer programsprogram areas and pool of grant awards totaling only 20 35 billion of the white house office total available funding estimate 195 billion crs10 these organizations grew 14 and 28 respectively the actual dollar amount received declined by 66 from 670 million to 626 million this study also notes that in the 20022004 period grants to the faithbased organizations it surveyed shifted to larger organizations as opposed to smaller congregationbased groups how do charitable choice rules differ from preexisting practices charitable choice rules represent shift in how the government treats faith based organizations applying for social service grants the preexisting general policy often barred aid to pervasively sectarian organizations unless they segregated their governmentprovided funding or governmentsupported services or provided servicebenefit that was effectively secular in nature under charitable choice rules aid is denied for inherently religious activities like worship religious instruction or proselytization unless they are indirectly funded through vouchers and the like examples of this change include allowing religious organizations and staff to receive government funds as long as they separate their religious activities from the provision of governmentfunded services in time and place permission to use government money for construction projects to the extent money is devoted to non religious purposes allowing religious symbols and mission statements and authority for discrimination in employment practices under precharitable choice practices many faithbased organizations participated in federally supported programs federal grants typically provided that private or nonprofit entities were eligible to participate including religious and other private organizations for example religious organizations have and continue to run major portions of head start housing older americans act employment and training emergency feedinghousing like soup kitchens and homeless housing initiatives and school meal programs as well as activities financed through child care and development block grants and social services block grants such entities as religiouslysponsored schools and local organizations catholic charities usa lutheran services in america the salvation army united jewish communities habitat for humanity and numerous other religiously affiliated or religiously sponsored organizations have long participated in publicly funded social service programs these groups often are incorporated separately from their sponsoring religious organization and have taxexempt status under section 501c3 of the internal revenue code they also tend to be relatively large organizations however interpretations and applications of the establishment of religion clause of the first amendment to the us constitution as well as policy decisions by administrators generally required programs operated by religious groups that receive direct federal funding to be essentially secular in nature if they wish to receive federal funds15 religious symbols and art have sometimes had to be removed religious worship instruction proselytizing have been barred as condition for receipt of government money and construction financed with federal 15 for more information see crs report rl32195 charitable choice legal and constitutional issues by angie welborn crs11 money has been denied to faithbased groups moreover faithbased entities in which religion is pervasive element in all that they do have until recently been found to be pervasively sectarian and in many cases forbidden government aid this view was put forward by the clinton administration in statements following on or accompanying signing the 1996 welfare reform law the 1998 csbg amendments and the two substance abuse prevention and treatment program measures enacted in 2000 mentioned above these statements typically noted that it was the administrations position that it would be unconstitutional if and to the extent it the charitable choice provision were construed to permit governmental funding of pervasively sectarian organizations as the term has been defined by the courts and construed the law in question as forbidding the funding of pervasively sectarian organizations and as permitting federal state and local governments involved in disbursing funds to take into account the structure and operations of religious organization in determining whether such an organization is pervasively sectarian16 why are charitable choice rules controversial charitable choice rules have effectively overturned longstanding practice governing how faithbased organizations are treated when applying for government assistance in effect charitable choice rules change the ground rules for faithbased organizations applying for government grants they are to be judged by whether their activitiesare governmentfunded rather than by their religious character while government aid provided through religious organizations in itself is not major point of controversy the conditions attached to this assistance are17 many of the specifics of charitable choice rules and how they are implemented are of concern to opponents they include the lifting of limits on hiring discrimination by grantees the possibility of clash between charitable choice rules and statelocal laws and state constitutional provisions the potential for conversion of benefits to indirect eg voucher aid in order to avoid prohibitions against spending on religious activities rules regarding alternative service providers where applicantsrecipients object because of the religious character of the program and provisions that may allow recipient faithbased organizations to infuse religious 16 see 1

important to note that court interpretations relating to the pervasively sectarian test and other related issues have been changing see crs report rl32195 charitable choice legal and constitutional issues by angie welborn 17 charitable choice opponents have not objected to the array of government aid through faithbased organizations predating charitable choice rules crs12 content not necessarily worship religious instruction or proselytization which are denied funding into their federally funded social service programs eg the potential weakness of audit mechanisms and the vagueness or potentially narrow interpretation of provisions relating to religious content in the services provided18 charitable choice supporters claim that precharitablechoice rules effectively discriminated against religious organizations particularly smaller congregationbased projectsorganizations precharitablechoice rules often interfered with what supporters see as religious organizations right under title vii of the civil rights act to use religious criteria in their hiring practices limiting their access to federal aid19 faithbased programs can attract volunteer time staff have sense of mission that inspires those they serve these organizations often help in ways typical government aid cannot providing love and friendship as well as services meals training and guidance charitable choice rules have been written to protect constitutional values regarding the practice of religion and the religious liberty of beneficiaries charitable choice rules protect the religious character of faithbased service providers and help ensure that their strengths and commitment can be brought into play in providing services others maintain that charitable choice rules may lead to the use of government funds to promote religious practices or beliefs given the difficulty of separating religious activitiescontent from governmentsupported services since money is fungible government funds given for secular purpose could indirectly help fund faithbased organizations religious purposes undermining governmental neutrality toward religion 18 as to the final concern about the ability to separate religious activitiescontent and services being funded the recent settlement of case american civil liberties union of massachusetts v leavitt see the following section on are charitable choice rules being litigated has provided what some see as potential model guidance for grantees it includes list of required safeguards on how to allocate costs and separate programs presentations by site and time religious materials and advertisements and any invitation to religious program from federally funded activities 19 for more information on the title vii employment discrimination debate see 1 crs report rl32195 charitable choice legal and constitutional issues by angie welborn and 2 the march 2 2005 house floor debate over hr 27 amendments to the workforce investment act crs13 increased participation in social service programs may if overall funding does not rise lead to reduced support for secular providers with proven track records charitable choice rules can require the government to decide what is legitimate religion and what constitutes worship preaching and proselytizing expansion of direct grants to religious groups could make churches dependent on government eroding their mission and tending to secularize them and charitable choice rules promote governmentfunded discrimination by allowing religious organizations to hire and fire on the basis of religion

settlement was reached regarding federal grants to silver ring thing for sexual abstinence education program which it was alleged improperly included religious messages and proselytization while grants to silver ring thing have been terminated the settlement contains significant and detailed list of required safeguards that the department of health and human services crafted for use in bringing the program into compliance this list is viewed by some as useful blueprint for grantee compliance with some of the limits inherent in charitable choice rules23 what are states doing part of bush administrations charitable choice agenda is an effort to encourage states to pursue charitable choice initiatives and open up grants they administer with federal and their own funds to faithbased programs state and local governments using federal financial assistance for social services programs are supposed to adhere to the principles of eo 13279 to the extent the regulations governing their use of federal money have been changed to reflect it moreover more than 30 states have set up offices or liaisons for faithbased and community initiatives that perform outreach and other functions similar to those carried out by the various federal offices for faithbased and community initiatives24 23 the terms of the settlement including the appended list of safeguards required can be found at httpwwwreligionandsocialpolicyorgdocslegalcasessrthhs aclu_settlement2022406pdf 24 state contacts and federal offices may be identified through the white house faithbased and community initiative website httpwwwwhitehousegovgovernmentfbci crs15 state actions are important because the majority of social service assistance is administered through state agencies that receive federal support not directly by federal agencies however number of states and localities have rules built into their constitution eg socalled blaine amendments or set up by law that may limit their ability to expand the use of faithbased organizations in providing services eg employment discrimination provisions limits on giving funds to religious organizations25 and others may be reluctant to revise longstanding policies be unsure of how to make changes or already have substantial faithbased organization participation to date there is only limited amount of information about how extensively states are pursuing policy of expanded grantmaking to faithbased groups firsttimeever survey of very small sample of state and locally administered federal programs released by the white house office of faithbased and community initiatives shows relatively small percentages of fy2004 funding going to faithbased organizations when compared to federally administered grant programs 55 in the department of justice juvenile justice part iib program 29 in the education departments 21st century community learning centers program 23 in the labor departments workforce investment act wia youth programs 22 under the department of housing and urban developments community development block grant and 17 in the agriculture departments special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children the wic program26 on the other hand in sixth surveyed program the child care and development fund which typically provides benefits through vouchers under which recipients choose their provider representative survey found that faithbased organizations comprise 33 of participating child care centers separate study published by the roundtable on religion and social policy scanning the policy environment for faithbased social services in the united states what has changed since 2002 results of 50state study describes notable but minimally quantifiable increase in statelevel activity related to provision of social services by faithbased organizations for example it found that the majority of states have enacted legislation with reference to faithbased organizations over the last two years that there has been large increase in the number of states with offices or liaisons for faithbased organizations that more than half of the states engaged in significant administrative activities to affect government partnerships with faithbased social service providers and that more than 20 of states had provided capacitybuilding or startup grants to make it easier for faith based organizations to compete for grants and contracts this report and other information sources including some state case studies is available at the website for the roundtable on religion and social
