terrorism the homeland security act established the department of homeland security dhs and the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act restructured the us intelligence community to better assist in terrorism preparedness and response these key laws not withstanding host of important state and local homeland security policy issues remain which the 109th congress might address some of the issues include reportedly unmet emergency responder needs the proposed reduction in appropriations for federal homeland security assistance the determination of state and local homeland security risk assessment factors the absence of emergency responder equipment standards the development of state and local homeland security strategies and the limited number of state and local officials with

deemed important because they arguably identify critical homeland security needs and policy questions that have not been fully addressed since september 2001 one could argue that the primary state and local homeland security issue is the widely reported unfair and inadequate distribution of federal homeland security assistance this report however does not address that issue for information

the same hearing christopher j lynch new cannan connecticut chief of police stated that emergency responder agencies needed to increase volunteer staff due to the lack of funding for hiring new personnel10 in january 2005 50 house of representatives members sent bipartisan letter to the president asking for significant increase in the administrations fy2006 budget for the hiring of first responders11 on may 1 2003 former dhs secretary tom ridge testified before the senate governmental affairs committee that it was not the federal governments role to pay the salaries of state and local employees12 even with the testimony of state and local officials dhs continues to prohibit the use of federal homeland security funding for the hiring and retention of emergency responder personnel with the increased role state and local personnel have in homeland security activities congress might consider authorizing the use of federal homeland security assistance funding for hiring and retaining emergency responders one might argue that without sufficient number of emergency responder personnel states and localities might have difficulties performing daytoday operations and responding to homeland security emergencies on the same subject in february 2005 the administration proposed in its fy2006 budget request to reduce funding for cops and eliminate jag13 on february 7 2005 the international association of chiefs of police iacp released press statement announcing its displeasure with the administrations proposal14 the proposed cut in cops funding and the elimination of jag could further reduce state and local homeland security capabilities by reducing the amount of federal funding used to hire and retain emergency responders one bill in the 109th congress passed

governmental affairs committee s 21 homeland security enhancement act of 2005 propose to provide funding for overtime expenses related to homeland security activities neither bill however authorizes federal homeland security funding to be used for the hiring and retention of emergency responders interoperable communications according to national governors association nga survey conducted in august 2004 only 22 of the states that responded have developed statewide interoperability communications while 73 of those that responded stated they are still in the process of developing interoperability15 on june 15 2003 iacp released list of antiterror needs and stated that one of their priorities is interoperable communications among all emergency responder entities16 the fy2006 hsgp guidelines authorize states and localities to purchase communications equipment17 interoperable communications equipment however is but one of many types of equipment on the dhs authorized equipment list ael even with this funding source nga states developing statewide interoperability for emergency responders is the chief priority and states are working diligently to bolster this capacity many are struggling with the dual challenges of funding and time states must either replace outdated equipment with new models or install software that allows incompatible equipment throughout the state to communicate with each other18 additionally nga stated that the survey respondents indicated that additional grant funding would facilitate the acquisition of new technology to enable interoperability19 one might assume that because dhs has not provided separate funding source or specific amount of grant funding for communications equipment the department does not recognize the state and local need for interoperable communications this assumption however does not address the issue of state and local governments responsibility for prioritizing their homeland security needs the house appropriations committee recommended in hr 2360 fy2006 dhs appropriations total of 319 billion for federal homeland security assistance reduction of 420 million from fy2005 funding see

use to fund interoperable communications the ability of emergency responders to communicate has been identified as one of the primary national priorities in the national preparedness goal21 the proposed reduction in funding could result in states and localities not funding interoperable communications at the level needed to meet the national priority of strengthening this capability reduction in federal homeland security assistance the reduction of federal homeland security assistance funding is another homeland security issue states and localities face in fy2005 congress appropriated approximately 361 billion for state and local homeland security assistance22 in the fy2006 budget request the administration proposes total of 336 billion for federal homeland security assistance reduction of 250 million from fy2005 funding additionally the fy2006 budget request provides line item funding for the law enforcement terrorism prevention program letpp it proposes however to direct states and localities to allocate less than 20 of shsgp and uasi funding for lettp activities23 apparently this would be reduction in shsgp and uasi funding for equipment training exercises and planning which states and localities were authorized to fund with 100 of their allocated amount in fy2005 one could argue that the proposed overall funding reduction of 250 million and the administrations requirement for states and localities to allocate less than 20 of their shsgp and uasi funding to letpp activities would represent further reduction of funding for state and local homeland security activities the administrations budget proposal requests 500 million for fire in fy2006 cut of 30 from the fy2005 appropriated level priority would be given to grant applications enhancing counterterrorism capabilities grants would be available only for training vehicle acquisition firefighting equipment and personal protective equipment under the budget proposal activities such as wellnessfitness and fire station modification would not be funded activities such as prevention public fire safety education and awareness and fire code enforcement would be funded under separate fire prevention and firefighter safety grant program for fy2006 the administration is requesting funding of the staffing for adequate fire and emergency response safer grants which provide

need for equipment standards or require dhs to provide information to states and localities on voluntary standards the lack of equipment standards may result in states and localities purchasing equipment which does not meet their homeland security needs it may also result in states and localities purchasing equipment that is not compatible with other jurisdictions equipment the need for multiple jurisdictions to use the same equipment or compatible equipment might become evident if multiple jurisdictions were to respond jointly to homeland security emergency state and local official

provide security clearances to state and local officials the federal bureau of investigation fbi provides numerous state and local law enforcement officials with security clearances state and local officials may also possess security clearances provided by the department of defense as result of military reserves and national guard service while hundreds of state and local officials have federally sponsored security clearances dhs is unable to provide an accurate number of them35 this limited and uncertain number of state and local officials with security clearances might affect the ability of dhs or other federal departments and agencies to provide classified information to states and localities they in turn might not be able to adequately prepare for respond to and recover from terrorist attacks without access to classified information additionally states and localities might not be able to coordinate with other government entities federal or state and local if information cannot be shared due to lack of security clearances security clearances are problem not only for state and local officials but also according to the government accountability office gao for port security officials gao reported in april 2005 that port security officials are having difficulties getting homeland security information due to delays in obtaining security clearances delays as determined by gao have occurred because us coast guard field representatives did not know that the coast guard was responsible for contacting nonfederal port security officials concerning security
