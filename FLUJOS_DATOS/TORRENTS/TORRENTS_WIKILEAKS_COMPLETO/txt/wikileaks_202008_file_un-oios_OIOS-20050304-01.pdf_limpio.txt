oversight services idoios received request fro m unon official 1 to inquire into allegations that locally recruited united nati ons office at nairobi unon staff may have engaged in improper conduct by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments showing longer contract duration dates to obtain loans from the united nations cooperative savings and credit society lim ited unsacco which operates within unon premises 2 the request was prompted by an earlier report bmitted to unon management by unon official 2 on scheme whereby locally recruited staff members from the nairobibased united nations child rens fundsomalia support centre unicefsomalia obtained unsacco loans by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments to unsacco the primary co ncern of unon management was that similar fraudulent scheme might have spr ead to unon and other nairobi based united nations agencies 3 at the time of the request two idoios investig ators were on mission to nairobi on another matter but given the concerns xpressed by unon managers the idoios investigators were directed by idoios mana gement to look into this matter with celerity and did so from 14 through 1 8 february 2005 4 the purpose of this report is to present the fin dings of the preliminary idoios investigation together with recommendations for appropriate action by unon management ii background information unsacco 5 according to information provided in leaflet attachment 1 unsacco was created in 1975 to establish forum for unit ed nations staff in kenya to save their disposable income and borrow at minimal cost to meet their socioeconomic needs at present unsacco has capital of us 135 million with about 2500 members and is managed by management committee lected at an annual general meeting of the society on

or passport and copy of hish er letter of contract 8 copy of the letter of contract is required to ensure that the applicant holds valid contract which covers the agreed period of t ime for the

guarantors in the event of the borrowers default the guarantors must also be sacco members 10 the applications for loans are reviewed by uns acco staff and credit committee which approve defer or reject the appl ication b unicefsomalia fraud 11 on 10 february 2005 while settling the separat ion payment of former locally recruited unicefsomalia staff member an dministrative officer who worked on the matter noted that the staff member d borrowed large amount of money from unsacco in january 2004 and that at the time of hisher separation she still owed unsacco about onethird of the amo unt borrowed 12 the administrative officer learned from unsacc management that the loan was granted based upon letter of appointment submitted to unsacco by that staff member which showed that hisher contract wo uld be renewed through 31 december 2006 however the contract was actually only from 1 january 2004 to 31 december 2004 13 the administrative officer requested copy of the appointment letter and found that it was fraudulent in that the date of t he expiration of the contract was false and the signature of unicef operations officer na med in the letter was forged upon further inquiries from unsacco managers unic efsomalia management started an inquiry and found that other unicefsoma lia staff members had obtained similarly improper loans unicefsomalia has only pproximately 20 staff members 14 the results of this inquiry were described in report on the preliminary investigation of case of fraudulent signatures an d use of office stationary and official seal unicef somalia nairobi dated 11 february 2005 which included copies of the false letters of appointment and writ ten statements of several locally recruited unicef staff who admitted their improper conduct attachment 5 iii investigative details c interviews with unicef staff 3 15 upon request from idoios unicef management ag reed to cooperate with the idoios inquiry by providing access to its file s and staff members involved in the fraud however unicef management insisted and id oios agreed that idoios interviews of their staff be conducted at unicef pr emises and in the presence of two senior unicef managers the objectives of these int erviews by idoios were to confirm andor rule out involvement by unon staff m embers in similar cases and to obtain information to ensure that unon management s afeguard mechanisms to avoid similar occurrences at unon 16 idoios could not interview all unicef staff or former staff involved in the fraud for example one staff member passed away an d another who had left unicef declined the interview in addition the icef inquiry was not final and information obtained primarily through the intervie ws of unicef staff by idoios suggested that there might be more unicef staff inv olved than initially envisaged 17 during their interviews with idoios the conce rned unicef staff confirmed that they misused unicef letterhead and official indicated that they forged the signature of unicef operations officer and that t hey provided unsacco with incorrect information about the duration of their c ontracts in order to obtain loans all of them mentioned the ease with which they accessed official unicef stamps stationeries and computers although given the limi ted responsibilities of some of them for example the drivers such access should not have occurred 18 further most interviewees stated that they act ed alone and with one exception all denied that either their unicef or u non colleagues assisted them in their fraudulent activities or had been otherwise ware of or involved in such improper actions d interviews with unsacco and unon staff 19 unsacco and unon staff members interviewed by the idoios investigators provided general information about th eir operations and otherwise cooperated with the idoios inquiry by providing hindered access to their files however these interviews did not produce conclusiv information to either suggest or completely rule out improper conduct on the part of unon staff members additional investigative steps 20 documentation obtained from unsacco shows that about 2500 staff members from unon and other united nations related organizations have requested and obtained unsacco loans about one thousand of whom are unon staff given the large number of records to review which would then need to be compared to similar records from unon and the absence of any i dentified subjects the idoios investigators decided to do thorough review of sampling of cases files were selected for review where the loan amount was high the duration of the contract long or the applicant was also guarantor on other loan s 21 further whenever the idoios investigators not ed apparent irregularities concerning letters of appointments or other similar documents produced by these staff to unsacco for example letters suggesting that th eir contracts would be renewed 4 beyond the expiration date of their contracts the idoios officers made copies of those documents and compared them with the correspo nding documentation available in the official status files of those staff andor confirmed with unon officials whose signatures appeared on those letters that the had indeed signed them 22 the idoios investigators noted with concern th at in january 2005 one senior unep manager had informed unsacco managemen t that the contract of particular staff member is likely to be extended fo r further two years subject to satisfactory performance during the managers inte rview with idoios she admitted she had written letter at the request f the staff member and advised that such letters are sometimes provided to unsacco so that locally recruited staff can obtain loans idoios cautions managers that the i ssuance of these letters may give the impression that staff members contract will be renewed 23 in this regard it should be noted that most i f not all letters of appointments issued by the organization provide that fixedterm appointments do not carry any expectation of renewal or of conversion to any othe r type of appointment and expire automatically and without prior notice on the expir ation date specified in the letter of appointment 24 this position is consistent with the jurisprude nce of the united nations administrative tribunal unat which has establish ed that good performance by staff member does not by itself create any legitima expectation for renewal of any fixedterm contract see judgement 562 dated 2 july 1993 iv findings 25 given the absence of concrete information conce rning improper conduct by unon staff and based upon the review of limited number of unsacco and unon files idoios finds that while there is evid ence of improper conduct on the part of some unicef staff members in obtaining loan s from unsacco there is evidence that such similar improper conduct also oc curred at unon 26 in fact as noted above rather than producing information about possible involvement of unon staff in similar fraud the i nterviews of unicefsomalia staff yielded more information about further possib unicef subjects involved in the same type of fraud who had either not been ide ntified in the unicef preliminary inquiry or had not been interviewed moreover thes interviews also suggested possible improper conduct by one unicef manager wh may have contributed to the fraud by providing letter which suggested th at the contract of one staff would be extended further beyond its normal term 5 27 the review of likely candidates for such frauds ie those with large loans and long contracts did not produce single instance f fraud however idoios cannot exclude the possibility that locally recruited unon staff members have submitted fraudulent letters to unsacco to obtain loans as had their unicef colleagues without concrete leads or thorough review of all of the numerous files of the unon staff members who have obtained unsacco loans it is not possible to rule out similar fraudulent schemes undertaken by unon staff 28 idoios noted with concern the ease with which locally recruited unicef staff such as drivers obtained access to official unicef stamps stationeries and computers unon should ensure that there are adequa controls in place to prevent such abuses in unon 29 further while analysing the fraudulent scheme at unicefsomalia idoios noted that when requests for letters of appointment suggesting contract renewal were denied staff members produced fraudulent letters f appointment which were accepted by unsacco management although they were clearly different in style and format from legitimate letters 30 furthermore as noted above in one case detect ed by idoios letter of appointment which stated that renewal for two year s was subject to satisfactory performance was provided to unon staff member such letter even from one with the authority to do so is improper may be us ed to demonstrate staff members right to renewal and should stop immediately v conclusions and recommendations 31 in light of the foregoing idoios offers the f ollowing recommendations which could reduce the risk of the occurrences of s imilar fraudulent activities as the one described in this report recommendation 1 it is recommended that unon management inform sacco management that henceforth they should requir original official unon documentation from unon staff members and any susp icions about the veracity of such documentation should be promptly reported to u non and the authenticity of those documents verified id rec iv0505001 recommendation 2 it is recommended that unon ascertain if its perso nnel officers are aware of instances of staff members requesting letters or documentation averring that their contracts would be renewed beyond their expiration dates and such requests were denied if so unon management should liaise with unsacco management to determine whether such staff members then submit ted fraudulent documentation to obtain loans id rec iv0505002 recommendation 3 it is recommended that unon management ensure tha t its official unon sealsstamps are placed in secured pl aces and are used solely by authorized unon officials to prevent the risk of th eir misuse by other persons id rec iv0505003 6 recommendation 4 it is recommended that unon management requests u n sacco management to systematically confirm with n personnel offices any information related to employment duration provided to them by unon staff members id rec iv0505004
