over all crimes of the worst nature affecting manki nd was urged in order to end impunity for any and all perpetrators of largescale atrocities the general assembly voted to establish an ad hoc committee on the establishment of an international criminal court16 and created preparatory committee charged with preparing widely acceptable consolidated text of conventi on for an international criminal court as next step towards consideration by conference of plenipotentiaries17 the preparatory committee held six ssions between march 1996 and april 1998 to prepare text for consideration at the rome conference18 the most contentious issue at the c onference revolved around the vel of independence the icc would have visàvis national courts and the u n security council the preparatory commission considered two basi c options for defining the jurisdiction of the icc the icc might assert jurisdiction over all relevant crimes exercising primacy over national courts without rega rd to the nationality of the victims or perpetrators under this option rogu regimes would be unable to insulate themselves from responsibility for crimes committed against opposing forces or ethnic minorities even during internal ar med conflicts many countries including the united states objected to the idea as an intrusion into the sovereignty of nations second the iccs power to try cases could be complementary to that of national courts where the icc would exercise juri sdiction only when nati onal courts of the country in which the crime took place or whose national was accused were unable or unwilling to prosecute the second model which the united states had supported was adopted in principle19 the adoption of the complementarity model of jurisdiction led to the even more intractable question of how and when the icc would take case possible options included recommendation by the s ecurity council recommendation by country with personal or s ubject matter jurisdiction over the crime or the accused or upon the initiative of the icc itself taki ng the position that treaty regimes should apply only to those states that choose to b ecome parties and not to those that

would have jurisdicti on over citizens of nonconsenting nonparties only in cases referred or authorized by the secur ity council which woul d have allowed the united states and other permanent member s of the council to veto any attempt to prosecute their citizens but would allow for the prosecution of state architects of genocidal policies for example as long as the political support could be generated in the security council the conferees rejected this proposal on the grounds that it would essentially mirror the present application of ad hoc tribunals bringing some perpetrators of crimes against humanity to justice while allowing others to escape with impunity21 additionally in their view treaty that subjects citizens of nonparties to an international cour ts jurisdiction does not bind the nonparty state to do anything and thus does not infringe on its sovereignty22 aliens who commit crimes are subject to the jurisdiction of local courts in any event under this view assuming that the referring state would have the jurisdiction to try or extradite an alien accused of crime on its territory the referring state could just as legitimately cede its jurisdiction over the accused to an international court23 the us delegation also proposed to exempt from the courts jurisdiction conduct that arises from the official ac tions of nonparty state acknowledged as such by the nonparty the united st ates it was argued would willingly acknowledge the official nature of conduct related to peacekeeping missions or other foreign affairs activity and thus gain an exemption from the courts jurisdiction for alleged crimes arising from such missions24 this it proposed would eliminate the disincentive for nonparty states to partic ipate in peacekeeping missions dictators it said

the final rule allows the icc to take case on the recommendation of one of the countries with the appropriate juri sdiction the security council or the icc prosecutor the us delegation to rome led by da vid scheffer then ambassadoratlarge for war crimes issues argued that allowing the prosecutor to initiate cases would potentially put us military personnel in jeopa rdy of being summoned in front of the icc on groundless charges the united states is in unique position in the world scheffer argued in which it is frequently called upon to respond to international crises often by deploying us troops nd government officials to hostile countries if those countries could retaliate by accusing the united states and its officials or military personnel of war crimes for exampl the united states could find itself hamstrung in its peacekeeping efforts the rome delegates adopt ed four methods to accommodate us concerns regarding abus of prosecutorial discretion limiting the power of the icc prosecutor requiring th consent of country which would have jurisdiction over an allege d crime before initiating prosecution narrowly defining the crimes for which person may be pros ecuted and creating role for the security council26 though not adopting the us suggestion which would have allowed any permanent member of the security council to veto any proposed prosecution instead the rome conferen ce adopted the socalled singapore proposal which rather than requiring unanimity of the pe rmanent members of the security council to initiate prosecution would require unanimity in order to block prosecution temporarily27 because the permanent five woul d have to coopera in order to authorize peacekeeping mission in the first place it was reasoned all five could be expected to agree to block any unwarranted icc prosecutions that might arise28 this proposal would not guarantee immunity in the case of unilateral action on the part of the united states however and failed to gain the

reach balance between the two extremes how to bring perpetrators of atrocities to justice while protecting innocent persons from frivolous prosecuti on and unjust punishment the conferees finally adopted somewhat complex system of triggering mechanisms to control how cases were to be referred to the icc for possible prosecution although the iccs jurisdiction over the class of suspected criminals is based on the concept of universal juri sdiction for the covered crimes113 the icc may not establish jurisdiction over accused persons unless certain prec onditions are met first unless case has been referred to th icc by the security council the iccs jurisdiction is complementary to that of national courts the icc will try cases only when the state with custody of th accused is unable or unwilling genuinely to prosecute114 where that is determined to be the case the icc may take jurisdiction if either the state on whose territory th conduct occurred or the state of nationality of the person accused is party to the rome statute or consents to the jurisdiction of the icc triggering mechanisms there are three avenues through which cases may be referred to the icc either state party to the statute the icc pr osecutor or the security council115 may refer cases to the icc in accordance with corresponding articles of the statute the security council may also defe r an investigation referred by state or the prosecutor for renewable period of 12 months by adopting resolution under chapter vii of the charter to that effect116 during the negotiations the united states sought more powerful role for the security council in which any permanent member would be able to veto referral the conferees ultimately re jected this proposal because it was seen to reintroduce political considerations to the prosecutions that are perceived to be responsible for the phenomenon of impunity the icc is intended to avoid the statute as finally adopted allows single

confidentiality of all such information in accordance with the rome statute and rules of procedure and evidence125 if the prosecutor concludes that there is reasonable basis for an investigation in given situation he or she must first submit request to the pre trial chamber for authorization to proceed the chamber in turn must determine both that there is reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation and that the case appears to fall within the jurisdiction of the court victims may make presentations to the pretrial chamber but there does not appear to be an opportunity for state with jurisdiction to intercede at this juncture once the investigation is authorized the prosecutor must notify relevant parties as in the case of referral by state party126 at that time state with jurisdiction over the crime may submit its request for deferral if the prosecutor determines that sufficient basis for an investigation does not exist he or she must inform those who provided the information127 but there is opportunity for the referring persons or tities to challenge the decision however the pretrial chamber may initiate its own review giving the prosecutor deadline for the submission of observations128 as noted above the security c ouncil may issue stay preventing the prosecutor from proceeding in cases submitte d by states parties or initiated by the prosecutor there

council he or she determines whether or not an investigation is warranted using the same procedure as in the case of any other type of referral the security council may request that the pretrial chamber review decision of the prosecutor not to initiate an investigation but may not require the prosecutor to proceed the most important difference between referral by the secu rity council and the other type s of referrals is that the consent of neither the state of nationa lity of the accused nor the state on whose territory the crime was committe d is necessary for the icc to assert its jurisdiction the prosecutor need not info rm states with jurisdicti on in accordance with art18 in order to give such states the opportunity to request deferral how ever it appears that those states retain the right to contest the jurisdiction of the icc based on complementarity icc jurisdiction over ci tizens of nonparties the aboveoutlined triggering mechanisms for jurisdiction of the icc make it possible for the icc to investigate and try citizens of states that have not signed or ratified the rome statute thus under cer tain circumstances the icc could exercise jurisdiction over us citizen accused of one or more of the crimes specified in the treaty even if the united states does not ratify it if the united states voluntarily consents to the exercise of icc jurisdic tion or if the state on whose territory an american citizen has allegedly committed the crime consents the icc could try case despite the fact that neither state has ratified the treaty132 if an american citizen is accused of committing one of the covered crimes on the rritory of state party consent is automatic on the part of the territorial state but either state can supercede the iccs jurisdiction by undertaking to pr osecute the crime in its domestic courts thus us nationals could be subject to investigation and trial by the icc if the country in which the alleged crime occurred is either party to the rome statute or consents to the iccs jurisdiction and has or is able to gain custody of the alleged us offender this possibility appears to exist mainly with respect to us military personnel stationed or found in such country it also appears to exist with respect to us public officials whose actions are alleged to have cause d one of the crimes designated in the rome statute should that official be found in or extradited to the country where the crime allegedly occurred133 such exercises of jurisdiction overhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31437crs26 134id art 13 the concurrence of the state in which the crime took place would be necessary for the icc to maintain its jurisdiction the icc can also exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to referral from the security council whether or not the state of nationality or territoriality concurs because the us possesses veto in the security council such referral could only occur if the us consented 135such country would also have the option of tr ying the case in its own courts or extraditing the prisoner to the united states the rome st atute provides that states parties who receive request for surrender from the icc and request for extradition from nonparty state with which it has an extradition treaty or the like shall decide which course to take based on the dates of the requests the interest of th requesting state in prosecuting the crime and the possibility of subsequent surrender of the person between the icc and the nonparty state rome statute art 19 if there is obligation to extradite the requested state should give priority to the icc id under article 98 of the rome statute the icc may not proceed with request for surrender or assistance whic h would require the requested state to act inconsistently with its oblig ations under international law regarding state or diplomatic immunity or an agreement not to surrender the countrys national to the icc unless the icc gains the cooperation of that third state it is unclear whether treaty violation that results in the iccs custody of an accused is grounds for challenging the iccs jurisdiction either by the accused or the state of nationality of the accusedus nationals could occur pursuant to the initiative of the state where the crime allegedly occurred or of the prosecutor134 given the nature of acts covered as cr imes that can be prosecuted by the icc it is thought to be rare situation in whic h an american citizen acting in his or her own capacity could commit such crime americans who are not servicemembers or government officials could at present presumably fall under the jurisdiction of the icc only if they participate in insurgencies abroad or commit any of the covered acts on behalf of foreign government or entity if the united states is able to and does assert jurisdiction over the crime and the accused the icc could not proceed with prosecution unless it were to find the united states unwilling or unable genuinely to investigate or prosecute the crime if another c ountry has jurisdiction and decides to surrender us person accus ed of covered crime to the icc the united states could appeal the jurisdiction of the icc135 if the jurisdiction of the icc eventually is expanded to include terrorism and drug trafficking there is arguably greater probability that americans abroad could be tried by the icc as those crimes may not require as prerequisite showing that they are part of greater scheme however it has been noted americans abroad who are accused of perpetrating rrorist act or engaging in illicit drug trade are subject to the laws and legal system of the country where the crime took place without regard to whether the united states consen ts to such jurisdiction some observers have raised the possibility therefore th at in such cases accused americans could conceivably enjoy more comprehensive proce dural due process rights before the icc than they would receive in the domestic courts of some foreign states complementarity and other challenges to jurisdiction according to article 17 of the rome statute the icc must find it has jurisdiction where state with jurisdiction is investigating or prosecuting the crimehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31437crs27 136see rome statute art 17 paragraph 1 provides the icc shall determine case is inadmissible where the case is being investigated or prosecuted by state which has jurisdiction over it unless the state is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution b the case has been investigated by state which has jurisdiction over it and the state has decided not to prosecute the person concerned unless the decision resulted from the unwillingness or inability of the state genuinely to prosecute c the person concerned has already been tried for conduct which is the subject of the complaint and trial by the court is not permitted under article 20 paragraph 3 d the case is not of sufficient gravity to justify further action by the court 137id art 20 138id art 18 state has one month after receipt of the notification to advise the icc that it is investigating or has inves tigated the situation the prosecutor must then defer unless he or she obtains an authorization to investigate from pretrial chamber 139presumably this language refers to both the state where crime allegedly occurred and the state whose national allegedly perpetrate d it even though the acceptance of only one of them is required for the icc to find jurisdiction 140 see finalized draft text of

conducted solely for the purpose of shielding the individual from prosecution by the icc or if it was otherwise conducted in manne r inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice137 in order to give the appropria states the opportunity to take charge of given situation the prosecutor is required to inform all states parties and other interested states when there is reasonable basis to commence an investigation except in cases referred by the security council138 the united states may thus challenge the iccs jurisdiction over its national in preliminary proceeding on the basis th at it is willing and able to undertake investigation itself the statute also provides that state from which acceptance of jurisdiction is required under article 12 may challenge the c ourts jurisdiction139 presumably the united states could challenge the iccs jurisdiction over crime allegedly committed by its national even if us court has jurisdiction over the crime by challenging one of the other prerequisites for admissibility of the case for example the united states could argue the gravity of the crime of which its national is accused is not sufficiently severe to warrant trial at the icc or that the crime is merely an isolated incident and not part of larger campaign as required for covered crimes140 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31437crs28 140continued conflict and

us and the icc supra note 27 at 179thus many supporters of the rome st atute believe that the principle of complementarity properly applied is sufficient to insulate us servicemembers and civilians from prosecution at the icc after all they argue it is virtually inconceivable that the american judicial system will suffer such massive breakdown as one that would render it ble to obtain the accused or the necessary evidence and testimony or otherwise unable to carry out its proceedings141 neither is it likely that the united states would be unwilling to investigate alleged atrocities committed by its own troops or officials abroad142 s m h v s u g g s t d t h t changes in us statutes to broaden the ju risdiction of federal courts to cover all crimes over which the icc might asse rt jurisdiction could enhance the implementation of complementarity by precluding finding by the icc that the united states is unable to prosecute one of its citizens143 opponents of the icc however question whether complementarity will operate as promised or whether the icc judges will focus on perceived deficiency in us trial or courtmartial practice to declare that particular us prosecu tion or investigation was not conducted in manner consistent with t he intent to bring the pe rson concerned to justice144 thus the primary issue regarding complementarity is the extent to which the icc will defer to national d ecisions regarding the hand ling of purported crimes under the jurisdiction of the icc it is unclear for example whether the icc would defer to decision by nation to constitute truth and reconcilia tion commission where such commission could grant amnesty to the perpetrators of genocide in exchange for full accounting of the events underlying the charge the granting of amnesty is arguably contrary to the intent to bring criminals to justice but nation recovering from the effects of genocide might find it in its interest to form such commission rather than try to prosecute the alleged perpetrators145 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31437crs29 146see eg the international criminal court hearing before the house comm on international relations 106th cong

does not appear to have been major point of contention for us participants during the negotiations of the rome statute this may be true because the americans considered most at risk us service members are subject to court martial under the uniform c ode of military justice ucmj and are not entitled to trial by civil jury151 american civilians who are accused of crimes overseas are subject to the

innocence the rome statute provides that every one shall be presumed to be innocent until proven guilty before the court 157 it also places the burden of proof on the prosecutor and sets the standard for conviction to proof beyond reasonable doubt158 the prosecutor must first have confirmed by the pretrial chamber that there are sufficient grounds to believe the accused committed the crime as charged159 the accused may object to the charges challe nge the evidence against him or present his own evidence160 once the pretrial chamber has confirmed the charges the case will come before trial

in police custody169 the icc statute requires such warning whenever the prosecution has grounds to believe that the person being questioned has committed crime the defendant also has right not to tes tify before the icc or to refuse to make incriminating statements170 defendants invocation of the right to remain silent may not be used by the judges in determining the guilt or innocence of the

procedure approved by the supreme cour t the rome statute provisions for protective measures must be ordered by the icc taking into consideration all the relevant circumstances182 and such measures shall not be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and fair and impartial trial183 the protection against double jeopardy the statute bars the icc from trying any person who has been tried and convicted or acquitted by nother court unless that trial was for the purpose of shielding the person concerned from cr iminal responsibility or was otherwise inconsistent with an intent to bring the person concerned to justice184 the ne bis in idem rule in the rome statute is in some ways more protective of the accused than the united states constitution which allows person to be tried by more than one sovereign federal or state cour t or in some cases for separate crime arising out of the same conduct185 in contrast the rome statute specifies the icc may not try person who has been tried by any other cour t for the same conduct unless it finds the trial or investigation to be improper for one of the enumerated reasons thus the danger of the icc trying person who has already been tried by national court will ultimately depend on the iccs deference to national judicial decisions186 the rome statute further provides that person shall be trie d by another court for

freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures although the rome statute does not contai n an express reference to the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seiz ures it does provide for an

development of relevant practice in particular the ex tent to which the exclusionary rule of the icc will apply to evidence derived from unlawfully seized evidence remains to be seen the right to be present at trial the rome statute provides that the accused shall be present during the trial197 the trial chamber may order the accused removed from the courtroom in exceptional circumstances wh the accused causes continuous disruption but only for such duration as is necessary and ma make provision for the accused to observe the trial and direct counsel from outsi the courtroom through applicable communications technology198 in us jurisprudence the confrontation clause of amendment vi guarantees the accuseds right to be present in the courtroom at every stage of his trial199 however as long as the defendant is present at the beginning of the trial the trial will not be rendered invalid if the defenda nt voluntarily absents himself during later stages of the trial200 the rome statute does not address the voluntary absence of the accused once the trial begins the right to effective assistance of counsel article 67 of the rome st atute provides that the accused shall be entitled to have legal assistance assigned by the court where the interests of justice so require and without payment if the accused l acks sufficient means to pay for it201 defense counsel must also

seventy days after an indictment or original appearance before the court209 in courtsmartial the time limit is 120 days from the preferral of charges or the imposition of restraint whichever date is earliest210 statutes of limitations for crimes also guard against undue delay between the governments discovery of evidence and its prosecution of an accused person denial of the right to speedy trial results in dismissal of the indictment211 however if the accused is found to have waived the right or the circumstances and justice othe rwise require it delay may not be fatal to the prosecution212

over the icc has brought out tension be tween enhancing the international legal justice system and encroaching on what so countries perceive as their legitimate use of force the review by the inte rnational criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty of allegations that nato bombing in kosovo might be deemed war crime is illustrative of this tensi on many opponents of the icc and members of the us military were outraged that the issue was even considered they questioned the legitimacy of the tribunals actions and their anger was not assuaged by the tribunals ultimate decision that there was basis for opening an investigation into any of those allegations or into other incidents relating to nato bombing264 while opponents of the icc interpre t this event as an indication that the icc is likely to pursue spurious and politically motivated cases against us citizens proponents of the icc see it as illustrating that similar unfounded allegations would be dismi ssed by the icc prosecutor the united states has often been leader in the struggle against impunity and the quest for peace justice and human rights the united states led the world community in calling for

the united states as proponent of human rights others however argue that despots lik cambodias pol pot or iraqs saddam hussein have not weighed possible future legal ramifications before committing massive crimes266 in their view establishment of the icc might have the effect of hardening the resolve of ruthless tyrants w ho may feel they have nothing to gain by giving up their power to more democratic or less ruthless regimes as general pinochet did in chile or duvalier in haiti the critical element from this perspective is simply the treatys entry into force not whether the us ratifies it other than perhaps to provide support to an argument challenging the legitimacy of the icc us allies such as france and canada which also deploy forces abroad in peacekeeping and other interventions initially shared us concerns about the iccs ability to judge the actions of their nationals particularly with regard to use of force during negotiations these countries c oncluded that the iccs larger value outweighed any potential risk posed to their nationals or foreign policy while some americans fear the icc could be used for political purposes many us allies see the icc as more limited in their view the icc would intervene to prosecute crimes of genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes only when country fails to try its own citizens for committing such act s some countries are adopting war crimes provisions as part of their own domes tic laws with the thought that the icc would never be called on to intervene for example france amended its constitution before ratifying the rome statute267 for the us government the situation appears to be more complicated with several hundred thousand pers ons stationed abroad ofte n involved in undertakings that might be

congressional committees of his intent to do so and reporting that the icc has entered into binding agreement that prohibits it from exercising jurisdiction over covered us and allied persons from

the event that the president takes the position that the prohi bitions of sections 2004 and 2006 infringe upon his constitutional authority in certain cas he might assert that congress has power even to require waiver unde r section 2003 section 2011 appears to ensure notification of congress at least at some point after the action has been taken regardless of whether the president belie ves that sections 2004 and 2006 impinge his constitutional authority the effect of sec 2011 is not entir ely clear depending as it does on the interpretation of the presidents executive powers under article ii section 1 of the constitution and his authority as commander in chief of the armed forces interpreted broadly the constitutional executive power includes the power to execute the law meaning the execution of any law whether statutory or constitutional or even international law such an interpretation would seem to render the waiver provision of sec 2003c superfluous inte rpreted narrowly the executive authorities cited above could refer to those powers which the president does not share with congress under narrow interpretation congress would be deemed to be without authority to regulate such actions in any event in which case it would appear to make little sense to restrict its application to sections 2004 and 2006 the language could be construed by court to imply waiver authority apart from the restrictions outlined in section 2003 the american servicemember and citizen protection act of 2002 the american servicem ember and citizen protection act of 2002 hr4169 introduced april 11 2002 issues findings that under the us constitution and international law the presidents signat ure on treaty without ratification by the senate is not binding on the united states and that
