crafting an an worship team i used to be full gospel church of san diego song leader with respect to operations we will run this within the framework of the azca joint staff agreement respectfully bobfacilitator church of jesus christ christian arizona worship team worship team definition the worship team consists of those persons involved in leading the people in corporate worship although we generally only think of the worship leader and musicians as making up the worship team it in fact consists of at least the following individuals musicians hand signers singers overhead projectionists mixing board operators home group attendance we believe that at new wine home care groups are our life blood until god tells us otherwise our vision is to build new wine upon relationships rather than on talents and gifts and the home care groups serve as the primary centres for building these relationships it is in the home care groups and through the relationships developed there that our vision of the church is imparted to new members of new wine it is not out of desire to see prospective worship team members perform that attendance is required rather it has been our experience that until new members of new wine become committed to home care group they do not integrate fully into the life of the church therefore we require that until one is committed to home care group he will not be considered for membership on worship team worshipper first the father seeks true worshippers those who worship in spirit and in truth also in the body of christ we lead through service therefore as it is the purpose of the worship team to lead the people in worship it is necessity that worship team members be able to worship regardless of their place in the church or the surrounding circumstances if an individual cannot worship then he will be unable to lead others in worship being worshipper is more important than being musician or technician servant second in the body of christ we lead by serving unless worship team member is willing to give himself to service he will be unable to lead others in worship while not everyone has service as primary motivational gift everyone can develop servants heart all christians should be seeking this heart attitude in any case team member third worship team members are just that members of team unless they are able to submit themselves to the team leadership and integrate and work with the other members of the worship team they will hinder rather than help lead the people in worship we do not expect that conflict will never exist but team members need to be able to allow iron to sharpen iron by dying to self crucifying the flesh doesnt mean nailing your brother to the cross whether prospective worship team member fits in can only be determined as relationships are built between existing and prospective worship team members while new wine presently has single worship team we may eventually have more than one and we recognize that prospective team member may fit better into one group than another musiciantechnician fourth excellence not perfection is demanded of worship team members team members must be proficient enough with their instruments and equipment to perform the duties required whether member is proficient enough will be determined on individual basis as always attitude is as important as aptitude as christians we are called to do everything as unto the lord in other words we are to perform our duties in excellence from performance perspective excellence is different for someone with years experience than for ten year veteran however there shouldnt be any difference in attitude between two such individuals must be teachable matter how long we perform task there is always room for improvement members of the worship team must always remain teachable that we may continually hone our skills god is always doing something new and unless we remain soft and flexible we will not be able to move with him it is also expected that team members will individually pursue further training where it is appropriate for seasoned musicians this may take the form of refresher courses in technique or further theory while for technicians it would probably involve something else common vision prospective worship team member must share the vision we have for worship or he must be willing to buy into new wines vision unless all team members share common vision there will be unnecessary tension within the team for example if one team member wants cw sound and another rock sound there will always be friction any such friction will hinder the teams effectiveness in ministry _________________________________________________________________ stay in touch with old friends and meet new ones with windows live
