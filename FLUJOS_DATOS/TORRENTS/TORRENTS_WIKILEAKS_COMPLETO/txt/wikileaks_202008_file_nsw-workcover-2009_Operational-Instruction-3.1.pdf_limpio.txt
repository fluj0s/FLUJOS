banking where the itc entitlement is between 0 and 100 d questioning any policy where the employer has advised that their itc entitleme nt is 10 as this may indicate that the employer has confused the itc rate with the gst tax rate an employers itc can change during the period of policy in line with changes to its operations however provided the employer has not advised of change to its itc the rate applying at the start of the policy period should be assumed to apply for all claims in the forthcoming 12 months accordingly it is essential that scheme agent seeks an employers itc entitlement rate and advises the employer of the consequences of non notification whenever their policy is renewed in addition to the mandatory tax invoice requirements the annual workers compensation renewal documents will require the employer to advise its itc entitlement if less than 100 pe rcent b advise in the event of non notification of lower itc entitlement that premium based on 100 percent

is determined as follows if the scheme agent had schedule of payments on the invitation t renew and that schedule had printed on it this will become tax invoice once the instalment is paid then the gst liability arises in the period when the next instalment for the instalment option selected by the employer is due if the scheme agent iss ues tax invoice for each instalment prior to the due date the gst liability arises when the invoice is issued otherwise the gst liability arises when the payment is received even if after this date the scheme agent issues tax invoice for the instalme nt that has been paid the above tests are cascading once test is met the gst arises normally the first instalment is recognised on cash received basis if an employer has not paid the first instalment by the due date one month after the commenceme nt of the policy term then their right to pay by instalments is lost and it can be assumed for taxation purposes that the employer has elected to pay the premium in full impact of premium being written the writing of premium only results in gst liab ility if the employer is not entitled to pay the premium in instalments if an employer is not able to pay by instalments the scheme agent is to issue tax invoice to the employer for the full amount of the premium the transaction is to be included in the bas return for the month that the tax invoice was issued for those employers able to pay premium by instalments once the initial premium for the year has been determined the remaining instalments for the year can then be determined the scheme agent is required to issue schedule of instalments that contains the amount of the instalment the amount of gst included in that instalment and the date that the instalment is to be paid this schedule is to clearly indicate that it replaces all previous sc hedules of instalments issued to the employer for that policy renewal year to avoid the necessity to issue tax invoice in advance of each instalment or tax invoice after each payment is received the scheme agent should ensure that the schedule is c omplying tax invoice that contains the words this will become tax invoice once the instalment is paid however where premium is written and the level of that premium now enables an employer who was not previously entitled to pay by quarterly instalme nts to pay by monthly instalments then the employer is to be provided with two schedules of instalments one for quarterly payments and the other for monthly payments the scheme agent should ensure that the schedule is complying tax invoice that conta ins the words this will become tax invoice once the instalment is paid whichever instalment the employer selects then becomes the basis for determining when gst liability arises the above procedures also apply to where an employer who was not prev iously able to pay by instalments is now able to pay by instalments either quarterly monthly or either due to the increase in the amount of the written premium impact of instalment payment defaults if an employer fails to pay an instalment within the required timeframe they will default on their rights to pay by instalments the scheme agent must then issue an invoice for the balance of the premium outstanding and attribute gst when the tax invoice is issued operational instruction 31 document name operational instruction 31
