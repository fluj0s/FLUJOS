security in few key cities classified by nas director keith mines reasons 15 b d 1 c summary at dinner hosted by pgr for visiting doj delegation national security coordinator tello peon and undersecretary for governance gutierrez fernandez told the delegation they would like to explore seriously focusing our joint efforts on two or three key cities to reverse the current wave of violence and instability and show success in the fight against the dtos in the next 18 months they suggested starting in ciudad juarez tijuana and one other city with joint planning cell to review what resources we could collectively bring to bear they believe the symbolism of turning several of the most violent cities would be potent sending signal to the rest of the country that the fight against organized crime can be won and combating the current sense of impotence felt by many mexicans they believe it would also go long way toward stitching up the countrys damaged international reputation end summary 2 u acting attorney general alcantara hosted dinner for deputy attorney general for the criminal division lanny breuer september 21 in mexico city other attendees included gom national security system coordinator jorge tello peon undersecretary for governance segob geronimo gutierrez fernandez pgr dag siedo marisela morales pgr dag victor emilio corzo cabanas pgr director for analysis and strategic information oscar rocha dobrowski us deputy assistant ag bruce swartz deputy assistant ag for criminal division kenneth blanco special assistant to the ag paul rosen doj attache tony garcia nas director keith mines gom wants full transfer of intel technology and training 3 c alcantara opened the meeting with two requests from oscar rocha first he said pgr would like to develop more general exchange of intelligence information and capacity not the casebycase exchange we now have second they would like for us to provide full exchange of technology for use in intelligence gathering not just the loan of equipment for specific cases but the transfer of the knowhow and training as well morales added that the fbi is helping to create cyberunit in mexico but it would be beneficial if it were expanded and replicated more broadly the ssp she said already has cyberunit but the real mandate rests with pgrsiedo the us side offered that there is great capacity in ccips in the criminal division and they would be happy to find ways to offer training and capacity building to their mexican counterparts we would be pleased breuer said in the effort to press high value targets to get our mexican counterparts to the point where they can do these things themselves it will take the development of strong trust through proper vetting and good training but it would be excellent to get to the point where there is longer impunity for chapo guzman because his operating space has been eliminated 4 c rocha then spoke of the technological leap about to take place in the coming years in the intelligence field he cited the targetfinding equipment used by the usms with mexican counterparts but asked if it would be possible to acquire not only such equipment for gom officials but also the training and full technology transfer that would go with it he suggested we work with vetted units first to provide such equipment and training and then move it out more broadly both to pgr and cisen the us side suggested getting together in the appropriate working group to see what could be done rocha reiterated that his intent would be to develop indigenous to the pgr all the capacity they currently have only in conjunction with the usms strategic miscalculations in merida 5 c gutierrez fernandez then turned to the merida initiative saying that in retrospect he and other gom officials realize that not enough strategic thought went into merida in the early phase there was too much emphasis in the initial planning on equipment which they now know is slow to arrive and even slower to be of direct utility in the fight against the dtos of more immediate importance is building institutions that can effectively use the equipment he was careful to point out that all the equipment is needed and will be put to good use but wishes that there had been more direct focus on institution building and supported the current shift in merida focus to capacity building and creating more effective institutions we have eighteen months 6 c gutierrez went on to say however that he now realizes there is not even time for the institution building to take hold in the remaining years of the calderon administration we have 18 months he said and if we do not produce tangible success that is recognizable to the mexican people it will be difficult to sustain the confrontation into the next administration he lamented the pervasive debilitating fear that is so much part of contemporary mexican society where even people in the yucatan with european levels of security are afraid because of the instability in few distant cities he expressed real concern with losing certain regions it is damaging mexicos international reputation hurting foreign investment and leading to sense of government impotence gutierrez said dont shy away from the hardest challenges 7 c gutierrez believes what is needed is clear roadmap for the remaining years of security cooperation between the us and mexico under president calderon that targets few joint projects in few cities rather than doing little of everything tello peon agreed suggesting that there is not time for pilot projects and certainly not time to work in few relatively safe cities such as nuevo laredo as has been suggested in order to develop the experience to take on the real challenges 8 c instead he believes we need to confront the cities with the largest insecurity and fix them if we could turn around tijuana ciudad juarez and one other city such as culiacan it would solve 60 of the violence and send signal to the mexican people that the war can be won politically he and gutierrez said mexico must succeed in juarez because calderon has staked so much of his reputation there with major show of force that to date has not panned out even if it is not completely solved by the time calderon leaves office if they can get things moving in the right direction setting the conditions for ultimate success it will be enough there was brief chicken and egg8 discussion with one side suggesting that wellplaced and effective federal forces could push back the dtos sufficiently for the state and local forces to function while others believed that wellfunctioning state and local forces will be precondition for the federal forces to produce stability moving forward together 9 c gutierrez thought that to start we need good joint assessment of organized criminal groups that makes explicit their vulnerabilities we have he said five things to put into the fight resources training joint operations technology and cooperation and we need to mobilize effectively all of them he especially mentioned the need to synchronize our joint efforts citing the recent show of force the us promised on our side of the border that could not be matched by anything on the mexican side leaving it hollow tello peon suggested we form planning cell few experts on each side who could focus on few programs in few places for the next 2 years 10 c in addition to the intelligence and operational cooperation that would be at the heart of the new approach gutierrez and tello peon mentioned the importance of cultural and political factors politically mexico may have federal system gutierrez said but historically it has been more centralized like colombia or france the federal government however longer has the ability to manage the system from top to bottom he suggested it would be necessary for success to break through the impasse produced by mexicos currently dysfunctional federal system and ensure programs can be synchronized with the states tello peon also said there will be need to work on the cultural factors required to produce culture of lawfulness8 that would mobilize the societal support necessary for success culture and politics will be very complex he said but can be made to work clearly articulated and strong doctrine will help get people behind the strategy 11 c tello peon ended the discussion by saying he arrived at the dinner somewhat fatigued but would leave energized he thought it was an excellent mix of people and welcomed the honest exchange of new ideas mexico he summarized is committed to staying the course which is sustainable with few clear successes 12 c comment we will follow up with tello peon and gutierrez in the coming weeks to see how committed the gom is to the strategy of selecting few key cities and working to turn security if it is their strategy and they plan to execute it we should get behind it using the new strategic framework to build regional program to take on the biggest challenges in key border cities considerable amount could be done with existing funding and marginal increase in staffing we would use the remainder of the calendar year for planning and have new series of programs ready to roll out in the new year visit mexico citys classified web site at httpwwwstatesgovgovpwhamexicocity and the north american
