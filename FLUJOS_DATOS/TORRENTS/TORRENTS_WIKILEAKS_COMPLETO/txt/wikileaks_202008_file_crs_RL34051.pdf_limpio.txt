creation of an antimissile system to protect against longrange ballistic missile threats from adversary states the bush administration believed that north korea and iran represent strategic threats and questioned whether they could be deterred by conventional means the bush administrations position on this issue remained unchanged even after the intelligence community assessed that the iranian nuclear weapons program halted in 2003 the bush administration built longrange missile defense bases in alaska and california to protect against adversary missile threats especially north korea although the system has been tested most agree that further testing is necessary the bush administration proposed deploying groundbased midcourse defense gmd element of the larger ballistic missile defense system bmds in europe to defend against an iran ian missile threat the system would include 10 interceptors in poland radar in the czech republic and another radar deployed in country closer to iran all to be completed by 2013 at reported cost of at least 4 billion the proposed us system has encountered resistance in some european countries and beyond critics in poland and the czech republic assert that neither country currently faces notable threat from iran but that if american gmd facilities were installed both countries might be targeted by missiles from rogue statesand possibly from russia the bush administration signed agreements with both countries permitting gmd facilities to be stationed on their territory however the two countries parliaments decided to wait to ratify the accords until after the obama administration clarified its intentions on missile defense policy nato has deliberated longrange missile defense and has taken actions that many interpreted as an endorsement of the us gmd system the gmd plan has also affected usrussia relations former president putin and his successor vladimir medvedev have argued that the proposal would reignite the arms race and upset us russianeuropean security relations us officials dispute russias objections noting that the interceptors are intended to take out iranian missiles aimed at europe or the united states and could not possibly act as deterrent against russia some argue that russia has been attempting to foment discord among nato allies in mid2007 russia offered to cooperate on missile defense proposing the use of russianleased radar in azerbaijan but urging that us facilities not be built in eastern europe president bush welcomed the idea in principle but insisted upon the need for the european sites despite ongoing discussions over the issue sharp russian criticism of the program has continued medvedev has said that russia might deploy iskander tactical missiles to kaliningrad but later stated that moscow would not do so if the united states reversed its plan to emplace gmd facilities in poland and the czech republic for fy2008 congress examined the european gmd proposal and eliminated proposed funding for initial site construction pending formal agreement with poland and the czech republic independent studies on missile defense options for europe and dod certification of the proposed interceptor the fy2009 request for the european site was 712 million which congress largely supported with funding for site construction available only after czech and polish ratification

defense budget the bush administration requested about 310 million to begin design construction and deployment of groundbased midcourse defense gmd element of the ballistic missile defense system bmds in europe1 according to the administration the proposed gmd european capability would help fend us forces stationed in europe us friends and allies in the region as well as to defend the united states against longrange ballistic missile threats namely from iran for fy2009 the administration requested 712 million for development fielding and military construction of the european gmd element the proposed system would include 10 silobased interceptors to be deployed in poland fixed radar installation in the czech republic and anot her transportable radar to be deployed in country closer to iran deployment of the gmd european capability is scheduled to be completed by 2013 at current estimated cost of 4 billion includes fielding and operation and support according to the bush administration the prospect of gmd capability based in europe raises number of significant international security and foreign policy questions central to the debate for many is how the proposed us

missile defenses that were operationally effective in her january 2009 nomination hearings for undersecretary of defense for policy michele flournoy said the obama administration will review plans to deploy elem ents of missile defense system in europe 3 flournoy said the plans should be reviewed as part of the qdr quadrennial defense review and in the broader security context of europe including our relations with russia noting that any final policy decision should consider it in the interest of the united states if washington and moscow could agree to cooperate on missile defense flournoy also said the final contours of any decision would require close consultations be tween the administration and congress at his nomination hearing before the senate armed services committee for deputy secretary of defense william lynn responded to question suggesting he would support making the mdas 1 some were calling for such an effort in europe before the administration formally requested funding in early 2007 for instance in october 2006 sen sessions noted nato steps in developing an alliancewide theater missile defense capability and encouraged the deployment of us longra nge missile

similar to the military services i think that all our military programs should be managed through those regular processes he said and that would include missile defense i would think any exceptions should be rare and fully justified4 representative ellen tauscher d calif head of the house armed services strategic forces subcommittee reportedly predicted such changes would be made in the new administration5 on the white house website the obama administration says it will support missile defense but ensure that it is developed in way that is pragmatic and cost effective and most importantly does not divert resources from other national security priorities until we are positive the technology will protect the american public6 g22g145g142g561g22g145g155g142g138g157g561 the bush administration argued that north korea and iran constituted major strategic threats north korea claims to have tested nuclear device and has ballistic missile program the bush administration argued that iran continues to acquire and develop ballistic missiles of various ranges 7 until recently the bush administration argued that iran had an active nuclear weapons development program in november 2007 us national intelligence estimate nie stated that in fall 2003 tehran halted its nuclear weapons program but that iran is also keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons at some point the iranian nuclear weapons program reportedly also included developing warhead that could fit atop an iranian ballistic missile 8 the bush administration regarded both countries as unpredictable and dangerous and did not believe they could be constrained by traditional forms of military deterrence diplomacy or arms control on trip to attend meeting of nato foreign ministers in early december 2007 secretary of state rice told reporters i dont see that the nie changes the course that were on to deploy european missile defense system9 accompanying her on the trip undersecretary of state john rood lead us negotiator for the european missile defense talks added the missile threat from iran continues to progress and to cause us to be very concerned missile defense would be useful regardless of what kind of pa yload whether that be conventional chemical biological or nuclear10 according to longstanding unclassified us intelligence assessments iran may be able to test an icbm intercontinental ballistic missile or longrange ballistic missile capability by 2015 if it receives foreign assistance such as from russia or china many in congress and elsewhere share this specific assessment or that the potential threat may not emerge by 2015 but is sufficiently worrisome to begin addressing it now many therefore believe it prudent to move forward with plans to deploy longrange missile defense syst em in europe to defend us forward deployed forces in europe friends and allies and the united states against longrange ballistic missile threats some in the larger international security policy

unpersuasive additionally the iranian government reports which ca nnot be verified that iran has limited missile capability with range of about 1200 miles11 and that it has stopped development of icbm range missiles although some europeans have expressed concern about irans suspected nuclear weapons program some us friends and allies in europe question the administrations assessment of irans potential icbm threat hence some question the need for gmd element of the us bmds in europe in december 2008 the european council of the european union approved twoyear study of ballistic missile proliferation trends g22g145g142g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g561 the us department of defense began deploying longrange missile interceptors in alaska and california in late 2004 to address longrange missile threats primarily from north korea currently the us gmd element of the bmds includes about more than two dozen silobased interceptors in alaska and several in california as part of an integrated ballistic missile defense system bmds capability the united states also has number of groundbased radars in operation around the world spacebased assets supporting the bmds mission command and control networks throughout the united states and the pacific as well as groundmobile and sea based systems for shorterrange bmd what remains necessary as part of the global bmds according to the bush administration is an ability in the european theater to defend against intermediatetolongrange ballistic missiles launched from iran the department of defense dod argues it is important to us national security interests to deploy gmd capability in europe to optimize defensive coverage of the united states and europe against potential threats both into europe and against the united states there have not been large number of intercept flight tests of the deployed gmd element nonetheless the bush administration and many us military leaders expressed confidence in the deployed system 12 most agree there is the need for further operational testing some observers continue to question how much confidence there should be in the systems potential operational or combat effectiveness based on the types of tests conducted and the test results to date 11 there are reports that iran is developing other mediumra nge ballistic missiles with ranges greater than those now deployed but short of what is considered icbm range ie more than 5500 kilometers 12 for instance 1 general cartwright commander us strategic command said the july 4 2006 north korean missile tests spurred limited operational activation of the bmd system we learned that the ballistic missile defense system procedures and personnel perf ormed well and demonstrated credib operational missile defense capability for homeland defense testimony before the senate armed services committee march 21 2007 2 admiral mullen on his nomination hearing to be chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said he believes the us has viable initial operational capability and we are maturing the system toward full operational capability answers to advanced policy questions senate armed services committee july 26 2007 and 3 dr charles mcqueary director operational test and evaluation said i can state that th ballistic missile defense system has demonstrated limited capability against simple foreign threat coupled with the successes of other elementlevel testing and mdas integrated ground tests the bmd system is definitely maturing my assessment is bolstered by the fact that the mda is increasing the operational realism

built on several earlier longrange bmd programs with decidedly mixed results themselves since the early 1980s since 2002 some gmd intercept flight tests have taken place with mixed results13 in each of these tests most all other flight test objectives were met in 2002 the gmd moved to the operational booster and interceptor the interceptor system flew two developmental tests in 2003 and 2004 and the gmd element of the bmds was deployed in late 2004 in alaska and california two planned intercept flight tests of the new configuration for december 2004 and february 2005 were not successful after technical review the interceptor successfully demonstrated booster flyout in 2005 in september 2006 successful flight test exercise of the gmd element as deployed took place although missile intercept was not planned as the primary objective of this data collection test an intercept opportunity occurred and the target warhead was successfully intercepted additional intercept flight tests of the deployed element whose primary objectives were intercepts of longrange ballistic missile targets were originally scheduled for later in 2006 but then subsequently postponed then may 2007 intercept test was scrubbed when the target missile failed to launch as planned followon attempt scheduled for summer 2007 was completed successfully on september 29 2007 the missile defense agency reported successful intercept in december 2008 but some were critical of this assessment as the test objective was for the intercept to occur amidst field of decoys which decoys failed to deploy from the test target supporters and many military officials express confidence in the deployed system but others continue to question the systems potential effectiveness based on the mixed intercept flight test record most observers agree however that additional successful flight testing is necessary supporters add that significant number of nonflight tests and activities are conducted that demonstrate with high confidence the ability of the gmd element to perform its intended mission 14 what would the european element of the bmds look like the proposal is to deploy up to 10 groundbased interceptors gbi in silos at former military base in poland it should be noted that the proposed gbi for the european gmd site will not be identical to the gbis deployed now in alaska and california although there is significant commonality of hardware there are some differences for example the european gbi will consist of two rocket stages in contrast to the threestage gbi deployed today15 this particular 2stage configuration has not been tested and is basis for additional questions about the proposed systems effectiveness proponents of the system would argue that the 2stage version is fundamentally the same as the 3stage system 13 two tests in march and october 2002 using an older interceptor successfully intercepted their intended targets three flight tests ift10 ift13c and ift14 using the gbi in planned intercept attempts failed in those attempts for various reasons 1 december 2002 the kill vehicle failed to deploy 2 december 2004 the gbi launch aborted due to software error in the interceptor and 3 february 2005 the gbi did not launch due to problems with the test facility launch equipment in the may 2007 flight test the target missile second stage booster failed in flight so the interceptor was not launched as planned in september 2006 and 2007 successful intercepts were achieved 14 the bush administration maintained that since 2002 it has fielded longrange bmd capability where none existed previously furthermore the united states now has operationally capable upgraded early warning radars command control and battle management systems navy cruisers and destroyers capable of conducting longrange ballistic missile search and track missions and about 20 gbi fielded in alaska and california this element of the bmds was transitioned to alert in july 2006 when north korea launch ed several ballistic missiles including longrange ballistic missile 15 boost vehicle plus report to congress march 1 2007 missile defense agency for official use only

achieve the range needed to intercept its intended target17 this issue has raised the question for some observers as to whether other us systems designed for shorter or mediumrange ballistic missile threats such as patriot thaad terminal high altitude area defense or aegis seabased bmd might be more appropriate for addressing the current and prospective iranian ballistic missile threat to europe dods missile defense agency mda believes these systems would not be adequate to counter prospective iranian ballistic missile threats over the midterm and longer deployment of the silos and interceptors in poland is scheduled to begin in 2011 with completion in 2013 final decision on specific locations took into consideration detailed site and environmental analyses as well as an overall security and support assessment the field of the 10 interceptors itself is likely to comprise an area somewhat larger than football field the area of supporting infrastructure is likely to be similar to small military installation in addition an american xband radar narrowbeam midcourse tracking radar that was being used in the pacific missile test range would be refurbished and transported to fixed site at military training base in the czech republic the xband radar with its large ballshaped radome radar dome is several stories in height second transportable forward acquisition radar would be deployed in country to be determined but closer to iran some european press accounts once mentioned the caucasus region but the bush administration never publicly indicated where this radar might be located additionally the proposed gmd european capability would include communications network and support infrastructure eg power generation security and force protection systems etc few hundred us pe rsonnel would be engaged in securing and operating both the interceptor and radar sites the administration intends for the united states to have full command authority over the system the fy2008 request was 3104 million for the proposed european gmd across several program elements of the missile defense agency mda budget the total reported gmd costs for the european site are about 4 billion fy200 7fy2013 including operation and support costs through 2013 although relatively small in us defense budget terms the fy2008 request represented significant commitment to the proposed european system the fy2009 request was for 712 million in 2007 both the house and senate armed services committees asked for studies of alternatives to the administrations proposed european gmd deployment see congressional actions this classified review was provided to congre ss in august 2008 some such as representative tauscher suggested the administration consider instead combination of seabased aegis sm 3 and landbased systems pac3 thaad mda director general henry obering has argued that most of the current aegis fleet would be required to defend europe and that the cost would be considerably greater than the current bush administration proposal 18 mdas assessments however assume the need for 247 coverage assessments based on deployment on contingency basis or crisis reduce significantly

government requested that formal negotiations begin agreements have been struck with both countries and if the polish and czech parliaments approve the projects construction on the sites could begin relatively soon according to mda officials the two governments have grappled with several issues as the debate has evolved g18g152g149g138g151g141g561 some analysts maintain that in poland the notion of stationing american gmd facilities was more or less accepted early on in the discussions and that the main questions subsequently have revolved around what the united states might provide warsaw in return some poles believe their country should receive additional security guarantees in exchange for assuming larger risk of being targeted by rogue state missiles because of the presence of the us launchers on their soil in addition many poles are concerned about russias response both of the past two polish governments reportedly requested that the united states provide batteries of patriot missiles to shield poland against short and mediumrange missiles 20 formal negotiations on the base agreement which will require the approval of the polish parliament began in early 2007 under the populistnationalist law and justice pis party led by jaroslaw kaczynski as talks began civic alliance po then the leading opposition party had questions about the systemparticularly the command and control aspectsand urged the government to ensure that it be integrated into future nato missile defense program the former ruling leftist party supported deployment of the missiles but also called for greater transparency in the decisionmaking process the smaller parties of the governing coalition expressed some skepticism mainly for reasons of sovereignty and indicated support for public referendum 21 in snap elections on october 21 2007 poles turned out pis and replaced it with centerright twoparty coalition led by po its leader donald tusk became prime minister during the campaign

government to approve the missile defense proposal arguing that an agreement would strengthen relations with the united states in postelection news conference however tusk was cautious about the plan if we recognize that the antimissile shield clearly enhances our security then we will be open to negotiations if we recognize jointly in talks with our partners from the european union and nato that this is not an unambiguous project then we will think it over two weeks later however newly minted defense minister bogdan kl ich stated that poland should again weigh the benefits and costs of this project for poland and if that balance results unfavorably we should draw conclusion from those results 22 foreign minister radek sikorski later indicated that the new government would discuss the

additional air andor shortrange missile defenses23 on february 2 2008 during visit by sikorski to washington dc us secretary of state rice voiced support for strengthening polands air defenses although there was said to be agreement in principle on the missile defense issue an accord was not signed when prime minister tusk visited the united states in the following month24 the major sticking point in the negotiations was the question of us assistance for polands military modernization mainly in the form of pac3 air defense during prime minister tusks visit to washington dc in march 2008 however president bush declared before my watch is over we will have assessed polands needs and come up with modernization plan thats concrete and tangible nevertheless the meeting of the two leaders did not result in deal being struck in addition poland has been anxious that the two projects not be too explicitly linked for fear of further alienating russia concerning the likely

stand with us now than they did before now that they have seen what the russians have done in georgia 28 under the agreement poland received from the united states enhanced security guarantees which

battery of patriot air defense missiles which reportedly would be redeployed from germany and would initially be manned by us military personnel polls have consistently indicated that majority of poles disapprove of missile defense base being established in their country most objections appear to be based on concerns over sovereignty as well as over the belief that the presence of the system would diminish rather than increase national security and might harm relations with neighboring states and russia however the russian military action in georgia and its subsequent threats to place tactical missiles in kaliningrad see below may have increased support in poland for the missile shield and for the battery of patriots 30 the polish parliament did not immediately ratify the agreement

elections about the missile defense issue former prime minister kaczynski singled out russia as threat48 opponents however contend that this is not valid reason for accepting missile defense facilities because the two countries which joined nato in 1999 already enjoy security guarantee through the alliances mutual defense clause polish missile defense skeptics also maintain that their country does not need to improve its bilateral security relationship with the united states because it has already shown its loyalty through its significant contributions to the military operations in iraq and afghanistan and the global war on terrorism some polish and czech political leaders reason that the united states may proceed with missile defense with or without them so they may as well be on board however the missile bases are unpopular among the czech and polish public and any government that agreed to host such facilities might lose political support in addition some czechs and poles may be speculating whether it would be worthwhile to expend political capital on the gmd bases as the issue may become moot if gmd proponents are voted out of office in the ited states and the project is discontinued poland will become an international laughingstock 49 czech member of parliament noted that if the us congress determines not to fund european arm of missile defense the usa will thus

critics claim that the program is another manifestation of american unilateralism and argue that because of opposition by major european partners polish and czech participation in the gmd program could damage those countries relations with fellow eu members 52 supporters however counter that the establishment of missile defense system would protect europe as well as the united states some european leaders have asserted that the bush administration did not consult sufficiently with european allies or with russia on its gmd plans german foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier faulted the bush administration for failing to adequately discuss the proposal with affected countries former french president chirac cautioned against the creation of new divisions in europe bush administration offici als however maintained that these arguments were disingenuous as they had held wider anging discussions on gmd with european governments and with russia both bilaterally and in the framework of the na torussia council 53 in addition critics charged that establishing european gmd base to counter iranian missiles implied tacit assumption on the part of the bush administration that diplomatic efforts to curb irans nuclear and ballistic missile aspirations were doomed to failure and that irans future leaders would be undeterred by the prospect of nuclear annihilation finally an analyst with the swedish transnational foundation research center has argued that the us missile defense system is being built in order to enable the use of first strike 54 europeans also have raised questions about the technical feasibility of the program as well as its costeffectiveness according to wire service report luxembourgs foreign minister jean asselborn called the us missile defense plan an incomprehensible waste of money 55 other european leaders however including thos of denmark and britain indicated that they supported the missile defense project as means to protect europe from threats from rogue states in addition some european allies do not appear to be averse to the missile defense concept per foreign minister steinmeier indicated that germany and other countries were

feasibility study of such program called for in the 2002 prague summit was completed in 2005 in the final communiqué of their 2006 riga summit nato leaders declared the alliance study had concluded that longrange bmd is technically feasible within the limitations and assumptions of the study and called for continued work on the political and military implications of missile defence for the alliance including an update on missile threat developments supporters contend that the us facilities currently under negotiation in eastern europe are intended to be good fitand therefore not inconsistent withany future nato missile defense however other policymakers have recommended that the establishment of any antimissile system in europe should proceed solely under na to auspices rather than on bilateral basis with just two nato partners us officials maintain that the more na to is involved in gmd the better 57 some observers have suggested that the bush ad ministration chose not to work primarily through nato because consensus agreement on the system was unlikely however in midjune 2007 alliance defense ministers did agree to conduct study of complementary bolton antimissile capability that would protect the southeastern part of alliance territory that would not be covered by the planned us interceptors american officials interpreted the move as an implied endorsement of the us gmd plan and an adap tation of nato plans to fit the proposed us system in addition nato secretary general jaap hoop scheffer stated the roadmap on missile defense is now clear its practical and its agreed by all 58 the bush administration hoped that na to would endorse missile defense at its 2008 summit meeting held april 24 in bucharest romania59 the summit declaration stated that the alliance acknowledges that ballistic missile proliferation poses an increasing threat it further affirmed that missile defense is part of broader response and that the proposed us system would make substantial contribution to the protection of the alliance it declared that the alliance is exploring ways to link the us assets with current nato efforts to couple with any future natowide missile defense architecture the declaration also directed the development by the time of the 2009 summit of options for antimissile defense of any alliance territory that would not be covered by the planned us installations these options would be prepared to inform any future political decision in addition the document declared support for ongoing efforts to strengthen natorussia missile defense cooperation and announced readiness to look for ways to link united states nato and russian missile defense systems at an appropriate time finally alliance members stated that they are deeply concerned over the proliferation risks implied by the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of iran and north korea and called upon those countries to comply with per tinent security council

contribution that the long range interceptor site could make to alliance security and to make cooperation with na to cornerstone of its missile defense proposal62 in the final communiqué of their december 3 2008 meeting the foreign ministers of nato member states reiterated the language on missile defense that had been included in the bucharest summit declaration while also noting as relevant development the signature of agreements by the czech republic and the republic of poland with the united states regarding those assets the communiqué also called upon moscow to refrain from confrontational statements including assertions of sphere of influence and from threats to the security of allies and partners such as the one concerning the possible deployment of shortrange missiles in the kaliningrad region see below the latter statement was likely included at warsaws insistence 63 european opponents of the proposed us plan also contend that statements by russian officials are evidence that deployment of the us system would damage western relations with russia at february 2007 security conference in munich former president putin strongly criticized gmd maintaining that it would lead to an inevitable arms race russia has threatened to abrogate the 1987 intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty which eliminated this class of us and thensoviet missiles that were stationed in europe putin also announced that russia had suspended compliance with the conventional forces in europe cfe treaty64 and on another occasion indicated russia might now target poland and the czech republic and transfer medium range ballistic missiles to the russian exclave of kaliningrad some us and european officials dismissed russias alleged concerns and have noted that moscow has known of this plan for years and has even been invited to participate65 gmd proponents maintain that the interceptors are intended to take out launched iranian missiles aimed at european or american targets and could not possibly act as deterrent against russia which has hundreds of missiles and thousands of warheads the chief of the czech general staff has noted that by simple arithmetic russian generals can see that us missile defenses cannot imperil moscows arsenal some russians contend however that the modest gmd facilities planned for eastern europe are likely just the harbinger of more ambitious program russian officials have also argued that north korean or iranian missiles would not likely enter european airspace and that the real reason for gmd is to emplace us radar in eastern europe to monitor russian missile sites and naval operations czech military officer dismissed the charge of electronic espionage as absolute nonsense arguing that the radar monitors the already

nato member states and to draw attention away from russias suppression of domestic dissent its aggressive foreign policy actions and its nuclear technology cooperation with iran observers note that russia blustered about na to expansion too and argue that russias veiled threats may actually stiffen resolve in prague and warsaw some observers note however that russian acce ptance of nato expansion was conditioned on tacit understanding that nato or us military expansion into the new member states would not occur the european gmd in this regard is seen as unacceptable to russia on june 7 2007 during the g8 meeting in germany putin offered to partner with the united states on missile defense and suggested that sovietera radar facility in azerbaijan be used to help track and target hostile missiles that might be launched from the middle east president bush responded by calling the proposal an interesting suggestion and welcomed the apparent policy shift the following day putin suggested that gmd interceptors be placed in the south in us nato allies such as turkey or even iraq or on sea platforms military and political representatives from both countries have met to discuss the proposal but some experts point out that azerbaijan is technically not the ideal place to locate the radar because it would be too close to potential iranian launch sites they also argue that the radar is outmoded in the meantime putin urged the united states not to deploy elements of gmd until his offer had been examined one week later however us defense secretary robert gates stated that even if the united states were to accept russias offer to share use of the azeri radar that facility would be regarded as an additional capability to complement the proposed gmd sites planned for europe 67 in late july 2007 mda director obering said the united states was looking at the proposal very seriously he said the azeri radar could be useful for early detection of missile launches but that it does not have the tracking ability to guide an interceptor missile to target which the proposed czech radar would be able to do at july 12 2007 meeting in kennebunkport putin expanded on his counterproposal by recommending that missile defense be coordinated through offices in brussels and moscow he also suggested the possible use of radar in south russia and said that cooperation could be expanded to other european countries through the use of the natorussia councileliminating he added the need for facilities in poland and the czech republic president bush reportedly responded positively to putins new proposal but insisted on the need for the eastern european sites 68 despite ongoing discussions over the issue russian criticism of the program has continued edged at times with sarcasm during an october 2007 visit to moscow by secretaries gates and rice president putin remarked of course we can sometime in the future decide that some anti missile defense system should

secretary gates had discussed month earlier including joint assessment of threats russian experts presence at missile shields sites and readiness to keep the system nonoperational if there is actual

icbms aimed at the united states however critics assert that russian counterstrike could not be prompted so easily and mistaken ly in february 2008 putin reiterated earlier warnings that if construction commenced on the missile defense facilities russia would retarget icbms toward the missile sites70 during president bushs postbucharest meeting with putin at the russian resort of sochi the two leaders reportedly sought to find common ground on missile defense they agreed to introduce greater transparency in the project and to explore possible confidencebuilding measures in the meantime russia remains opposed to the proposed european bases the two sides agreed to intensify their dialogue on missile defense cooperation after the meeting however irans ambassador to poland warned that if the missile defense system is installed the united states will acquire supremacy over russian nuclear forces71 following the signing of the uspoland agreement russia once more vociferously objected to the missile defense plan on august 16 highly placed russian general officer stated that polands acceptance of the interceptors could make it target for nuclear attack later

shortrange iskander missiles to the russian exclave of kaliningrad which borders poland and lithuania if the us gmd system is built however medvedev later told french newspaper that it the united

appeared to backtrack somewhat saying every country is sovereign to decide whether it hosts an antimissile shield or not 75 some observers believe that the ongoing dialog between russia and the united states may help reduce tensions eventual russian cooperation in missile defense could remove significant impediment to the program and could dampen criticism by european and other leaders it also may

an independent assessment of european missile defense options should be done in timely manner in the senate defense authorization bill the armed services committee recommended limiting the availability of funding for the european gmd site until two conditions were met 1 completion of bilateral agreements with poland and the czech republic and 2 45 days have elapsed following the receipt by congress of re port from an ffrdc federally funded research and development center to conduct an independent assessment of options for missile defense of europe79 the committee recommended

interceptor missiles for the european system until the secretary of defense certified to congress that the proposed interceptor to be deployed had demonstrated through successful operationally realistic flight testing that it had high probability of working in an operationally effective manner the committee noted that the proposed 2stage version of the interceptor has not been developed and

ratification of formal bila teral agreements which mda estimates would not take place before 2009 finally the committee notes there were number of nearterm missile defense options to provide defense
