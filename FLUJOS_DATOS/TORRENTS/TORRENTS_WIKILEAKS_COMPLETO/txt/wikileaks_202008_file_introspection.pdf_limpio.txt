technica l breakth rough of 1973 the intro spec tion rd i have made technical breakthrough which possibly ranks with the major discoveries of the twentieth century it is certainly the greatest advancement of 1973 and is now being released after final wrapup of research it is called the introspec tion rundown the purpose of the introspec tion rd is to locate and correct those things which cause person to fixate his attention inwardly on himself or his bank this rd extroverts the person so that he can see his environment and there fore handle and control it research in 1970 the actual cause of psychosis was isolated as given in hcob 28 nov 70 cs series 22 psyc hosis in the ensuing years this has been proven beyond doubt to be totally correct but what is psychotic break man has never been able to solve the psychotic break in fact human beings are actually afraid of person in psychotic break and in desperation turn to psychiatry to handle psychiatry despera in its turn without effective tech resorts to barbarities such as heavy drugs ice picks electric and insulin shock which halfkill the person and only suppre ss him the fact remains there has never been cure for the psychotic break until now the key is what caused the person to introspect befor the psychotic break the breakthrough was made on person who after series of wrong indications went into fullblown psychotic break violence destruction and all the psychiatrist at this point would have sharpened up his ice pick filled his syringes with the most powerful and deadly drugs he could find and turned up the volts his handling would have been final destruction of the individual what was done was an auditor went into the room sat the person down and corrected the last severe point of wrong indication subsequent times of wrong indication in his life were cleared up the person came out of the psychotic break and into present time this means the last reason to have psyc hiatry around is gone 579the psychotic break the last of the unsolvable conditions that can trap person has been solved and its quite simple really theory def introsp ect ion l from introspice re to look within looking into ones own mind feelings reactions etc observation and analysis of oneself websters new world dictionary def introvers ion from intro l vertere to turn 2 tendency to direct ones intere st upon oneself rather than upon external objects or events websters new world dictionary the essence of the introspec tion rundown is looking for and correcting all those things which caused the person to look inward worriedly and wrestle with the mystery of some incorrectly designated error the result is continual inward looking or selfauditing without relief or end in normal person this becomes diminished activity unhappiness or illness in an rlser this becomes insanity and psychotic break occurs at the last severe point of wrong indication the pc who originates to the examiner about his case or writes notes to the cs or auditor is introverted and should have this rundown preclears who are low on the grad chart and not yet up to running engrams as well as clears and ots are run on the steps of the rundown omitting the r3ra steps recalls are used in running out the evil intentions found by ln auditor training auditors selected to do this rd must have done pro tr course and the antiqa materials and be class va gradua auditors they must be able to recognize rock slam which is particular emeter phenomenon they must be class va gradua auditors of proven skill on routine cases they must not themselves be rse rs the last requisite is waived in selfsalvage coaudit group where all rs they need flawless trs qa this rundown is very simple but cannot be flubbed as that will compound the errors and cause further introspection in the pc it is better not to deliver this rd than to flub any part of it cse s take note it is an ethics offense to attempt this rundown without the auditor having done the prerequisite training and further offense for an auditor to flub on it steps of the rd steps 0 and 00 are for person in psychotic break not normal person put this checklist on inside front cover of folder as program when running the following procedure r3ra quad is run unless the person is clear ot or not yet up to running engrams in which case recalls quad are run where specifically

case indicate the fact of it having been unnecessary and get an fn then run objective havingness if the ta goes high or low and wont come into range assess cs 53rm and handle in the case of pc in psychotic break the cs would have to locate the last severe wrong indication indicate the fact to the pc and get it corrected as with wrong item as the first action extroversion def extro version means nothing more than being able to look outward an extroverted personality is one who is capable of looking around the environment person who is capable of looking at the world around him and seeing it quite real and quite bright is of course in state of extroversion the problem s of work the end phenomena of the introspec tion rd is the person extroverted longer looking inward worriedly in continuous selfaudit without end the ep on person in psychotic break is the end of the psychotic break the rd is very simple and its results are magical in effectiveness flubs can wreck it so dont permit them you have in your hands the tool to take over mental therapy in full you need not fear the insane or the psychotic break any longer here also is the cure for the continual selfauditing pc

consists of doing arc break s long duration triplequad and 2wc recent actions taking up the best reading overt and running responsibility on it ie what about could you be responsible for if major increase in responsibility take up another reading overt and run responsibility on that do this until there is significant increase in responsibility follow this with running all reading evil purposes brought up during the introspec tion steps of the rd with r3ra omit on clears and ots if the pc was found to rs during the rd the cs would program him for rs handlingeither expanded dianetics or ned for ots additionally the cs would note areas of low responsibility and order ow run on those areas progr ami ng d ata in the case of psycho it is necessary to tailor the introspection rd steps to the pc instead of following it as rote sequence at the risk of running unreading items on the pc on any pc this is deadly in psycho it is pure dynamite to do this the cs would order the subjects of the rd steps assessed then handled in order of largest reads the auditors tr 1 and metering must be such that he can make meter read the rd could be made to fail on this point by missing hot subjects the clea red cannibal fact or when you clear cannibal what do you have experientially you have cannibal his experiential track is such that hes been cannibal for ages thats how hes handled life and people around him thats what he knows how to do this person is unaware of his responsibilities to other dynamics and is unfamiliar with proper behavior and responsible actions towards others in the case of an sp he has been busy destroying others for so long that when hes somewhat cleaned up on this he does not know what else to do or how to act its rather pathetic actually isol ation with someone in psychotic break it is necessary to isolate the person for him to destimulate and to protect him and others from possible damage while in 611isolation the person receives the introspec tion rd done flawlessly on shortsession basis gradiently winning and gaining confidence between sessions the muzzled rule is in force one speaks to the person or in his hearing there comes point where the cs must decide to release the person from isolation to do this the cs must know that the person can take responsibility for his actions as regards others as well as toward himself cs action clea red cannibal step the css action is direct comm line to the person by notes the person is provided with paper and pen to reply the cs must determine the persons responsibility level example dear joe what can you guara ntee if you are let out of isolation if the persons reply shows continued irresponsibility toward other dynamics or fixation on one dynamic to the exclusion of others damaged the cs must inform the person of his continued isolation and why example dear joe im sorry but go on coming out of isolation yet your actions threatened the survival of hundreds of people indirectly and six families directly by burning down their houses you are unaware of the effects this could have had and still only concerned about your own welfare you must hate the human race quite bit the cs has draw n conclusion based on the information he has and lets the person know where he stands he does not reintrovert the pc by asking him why did you burn down those houses he draws an accura conclusion and indicates it this will elicit protest from the person and bring about an involvement in the dynamics concerned it also serves to bring about an awareness of consequences example but but i never meant to threaten others survival i just wanted to burn down the houses because i like fires gosh i didnt mean it i dont hate the human race oh i really dont hate the human race cognition the persons auditing is continued between these exchanges the auditor may have to clean up some arc breaks as the protest is coming off skillfully done thats all the auditor should have to clean up except maybe some more ows when it is obvious the person is out of his psychosis and up to the responsibility of living with others his isolation is ended summar handling the csing and auditing on this rd requires real understanding of new era dianetics and expanded dianetics basics and the utmost precision of application its results are nothing short of miraculous i hope this will be of further assistance to

1974 remimeo expanded dianetics auditors cses m7m4 starrate clay demo intro spect ion rd second addition info rmation to c ses fixated attent ion ref the creation of hum an ability r239 and r223 sometimes the cs runs into the case whose attention is solidly fixed on something when attention is fixed we have an unawareness of other things than the object of fixation and lessening of selfdeterminism to point of other determinism example the pc is always bringing up cars he has trouble with cars has arc breaks about cars whs about cars commits overts on cars it worries him all the time is constant problem the fixated attention case appears not to asis and is usually stuck on the track in the quiet portion of an incident ahead of it and behind it is extreme randomity this is not easily confronted so is notised the solution is to get the pc to exercise his attention putting it here and there introversion and attentio n the pc whose attention is fixated manifests it in several ways he will be continuously introverted on the area will bring it up often in session but it doesnt seem to blow it also shows up in correspondence to the cs frequent originations at examiner fixed vague stare all evidence of introversion the pc may not originate it anatomy and remedy this fixation shows up as problem but it is usually hidden standard special problem the pc thinks must be resolved before auditing can be seen to have worked hence the ncg case gain aspect it is always an old problem of long duration the remedy basically involves getting the terminal connected with the area of fixation located and having the pc put his attention on the terminal and take his attention off the terminal the pro ces s step 1determine exactly what the pc has attention fixed on by folder inspection or 2wc for bd fn item 613step 2g et the area translated into terminal this will read well and have high degree of pc interest step 3fit the terminal in the commands put your attention on termi 2 take your attention off terminal clear and run it alternate repetitive to the ep of pcs attention longer fixed on the area fn cog vgis this is called attention subjective repetitive step 4se lect two objects best are red pen and blue pen two bowling pins will also do place them three to four feet apart at distance of three to four feet from the pc place them on white paper for visibility step 5name the objects and fit them in the commands put your attention on the red pen put your attention on the blue pen clear the commands and run them alternate repetitive to the ep of pc in control of his attention fn cog vgis this is called attention objective repetitive alternate step sname the objects and fit them in the following commands decide to put your attention on the red pen tell when youve done so put your attention on it then decide to put your attention on the blue pen tell when youve done so put your attention on it run this alternate repetitive until the pc is doing the decision step each time then you can drop out the tell when youve done so run it to the ep of pc in control of his attention fn cog vgis this is called attention objective decision repetitive note with both these objective attention processes the pc may swear you are hypnotizing him or something the process actually runs out hypnotism the pc will come through band of robotism and come out the other end in contr ol of his own attent ion vital proce ss data it would never be okay to run attention subjec tive repetitive on significance nomass thing it must be run on terminal this is one shot process depending for its effectiveness on the correctness of the first item selected this item is usually unmistakable in truly fixated case progr ami ng attention subjective and objective repetitive fits in sequence on the introspec tion rd between steps 6l and 7 if the terminal connected with the area of fixed attention could not be located then the area could not be addres sed with attention subjective repetitive but in some other manner it is unlikely that terminal could be found on truly fixated attention case isol ation when person is released from isolation after terminated handling of psychotic break it is usual to welcome them back and restore any lost arc for them from the group if needed with an announcement in the oods the person would be interviewed as to whether he wanted to stay or go and what his intentions were 614formal notification would be made that the person was back in good grace s and he would be allowed to make up for any damage done but not forced to do so in the case of crew member it would be expected he would be assigned to the rpf where there was one and told to make good additional clea red cannibal step there is an additional tool for use by the cs in raising the pcs responsibility the cs sends to the pc hcob 21 jan ad 10 just ification with note asking the pc to please read the hcob then tell the cs if it has any application this would be done as the first of the series of cs notes and pc replies on the cleared cannibal step if the cs receives any rant and rave in reply he would order it dated and located as the pc would be answering out of an incident regardless the justification hcob would have to be followed by ows as the pc has whs there to be restimmed and not running out the ows could cause the ta to skyrocket csing on psy cho s csing and auditing psychos is very precise and even touchy business there must be mistake s and you cannot be heavyhanded on them they are at the lowest point on the effect scale and therefore delicate at best and easily overw helmed it is also policy that cs takes it easy on auditors handling psychos they are very hard to audit and difficult to control so dont berate the auditor if they get any kind of result three cheers integ rity it has always been rule that actions of one rd are not mixed in with another action or used randomly outside of the rd recently i found that technique from the introspection rd was used to indicate bypassed charge or something when handling ruds this is very wrong this happened in the field as an isolated instance but is worth mentioning the integrity of any rd must be maintained or its effectiveness is reduced when parts of rd are used at random by cs it actually starts the pc on rd that is left incomplete so dont extract bits of this rd

infinitive phrases like to go to the store that appear to be evil purposes but in actual fact are statements of future actions or condi tions not intentions example pc says i was doing fine then joe came along and caused to cave in to cave in is not an evil purpose as stated it wasnt the pcs intention not valid example pc says i was trying to hold on to the rope and he forced to fall off the
