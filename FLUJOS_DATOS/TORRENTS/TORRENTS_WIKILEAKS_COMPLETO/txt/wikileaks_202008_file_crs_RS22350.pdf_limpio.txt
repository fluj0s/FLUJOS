railroad worker receives rrb benefits equal to or greater than the social security benefits they would have received if the workers railroad work had been covered by social security if worker does not qualify for rrb benefits his or her railroad work counts toward social security benefits retirement benefits for railroad workers at age 60 railroad workers with at least 30 years of covered railroad work may receive full retirement annuities at full retirement age which is gradually increasin g from 65 to 67 insured workers with fewer than 30 years of service may also receive full retirement annuities5 these workers may receive reduced retirement annuities starting at age 62 retirement annuities are not payable to workers who continue to work in covered railroad job or who return to

i nd tier ii benefits described below6 tier i annuities tier i benefits are equivalent to social security benefits tier i benefits are calculated using the social security benefit formula with the rrb age and service requirements and are based on both rrb and social securitycovered employment after tier i bene fits are first paid they increase annually with cost of living adjustment cola in the same manner as social security benefits7 tier i benefits may be reduced for retirees who receive social security benefits or government pensions retire early or continue to work after retirement generally social security benefits are subtracted from tier i benefits since work covered by social securityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs22350crs3 8 the reduction at age 62 social securitys earlie st eligibility age is rising from 20 to 30 9 during the calendar year that retiree will reach the full retirement age the formula for calculating the early retirement reduction changes benefits are

for the highest 60 months of earnings times their years of service less 25 of any vested dual benefit 11 people have current connection if they worked in covered railroad job for at least 12 of the 30
