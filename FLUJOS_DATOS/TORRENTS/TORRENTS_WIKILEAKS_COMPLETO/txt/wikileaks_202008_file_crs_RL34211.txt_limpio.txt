specialist in public finance government and finance division state and local taxes and the streamlined sales and use tax agreement summary state sales and use taxes are consumption taxes that are levied according to the destination principle the destination principle prescribes that taxes should be paid where the consumption takes place sales tax that is collected by vendors at the point of sale implicitly assumes consumption takes place near the point of transaction use taxes in contrast are levied on products consumers purchase from outofstate vendors usually over the telephone or internet the rate of tax is based on the destination principle in this case the delivery address sales and use taxes are almost always the same rate in given jurisdiction under current law states cannot reach beyond their borders and compel outof state vendors without nexus in the buyers state to collect the use tax owed by state residents the supreme court has ruled that requiring remote vendors to collect the use tax would pose an undue burden on interstate commerce states are concerned because they anticipate gradually losing more sales tax revenue as the growth of internet commerce allows more residents to buy products from vendors located out ofstate and evade use taxes estimates put this loss at approximately 8 billion in 2003 congress is involved because interstate commerce typically falls under the commerce clause and in some cases due process clause of the constitution new congressional action on the remote collection issue is uncertain opponents of remote vendor use tax collection cite the complexity of the myriad state and local sales tax systems and the difficulty vendors would have in collecting and remitting use taxes proponents would like congress to change the law and allow states to require outofstate vendors without nexus to collect state use taxes these proponents acknowledge that simplification and harmonization of state tax systems are likely prerequisites for congress to consider approval of increased collection authority for states number of states have been working together to harmonize sales tax collection and have created the streamlined sales and use tax agreement ssuta the ssuta member states hope that congress can be persuaded to allow them to require outofstate vendors to collect taxes from customers in ssuta member states in the 110th congress s 34 senator enzi and hr 3396 representative delahunt would grant ssuta member states the authority to compel outofstate vendors in other member states to collect sales and use taxes related issue is the internet tax moratorium the moratorium prohibits 1 new taxes on internet access services and 2 multiple or discriminatory taxes on internet commerce congress has extended the internet tax moratorium twice the most recent extension expires november 1 2014 the moratorium is distinct from the remote use tax collection issue but has been linked in past debates for

third 319 of their total tax revenue approximately 227 billion in fy2006 local governments derive 115 of their tax revenue approximately 55 billion in fy2006 from local sales and use taxes1 both state and local sales taxes are usually collected by vendors at the point of transaction and levied at percentage of products retail price alternatively use taxes typically levied at the same rate are often not collected by the vendor if the vendor does not have nexus loosely defined as physical presence in the consumers state consumers are required to remit use taxes to their taxing jurisdiction compliance with this requirement however is quite low state and local governments are concerned that the expansion of internet commerce the census bureau of the department of commerce estimated that internet commerce jumped 95 from the second quarter of 2007 to the second quarter of 2008 will gradually erode their tax base2 this concern arises in part because the us supreme court ruled outofstate vendors are not required to collect sales taxes for states in which they the vendors do not have nexus3 in hopes of stemming the potential loss of tax revenue several states are participating in an initiative to simplify and coordinate their tax codes called the streamlined sales and use tax agreement ssuta the member states hope that congress could be persuaded to allow them to require outofstate vendors to collect taxes from resident customers congress has role in this issue because interstate commerce in most cases falls under the commerce clause of the constitution4 congress will likely be asked to choose between taking either an active or passive role in the debate in the 110th congress s 34 senator enzi and hr 3396 representative delahunt would grant ssuta states the

approach by congress could involve states implementing the ssuta without congressional approval state enforcement of remote collection would likely face legal challenges and the outcome of these legal challenges is uncertain this report intends to clarify significant issues in the remote sales tax collection debate beginning with description of state and local sales and use taxes state and local sales and use taxes in 1932 mississippi was the first state to impose general state sales tax5 during the remainder of the 1930s an era characterized by declining revenue from corporate and individual income taxes 23 other states followed suit and implemented general sales tax6 at the time the sales tax was relatively easy to administer and raised significant amount of revenue despite relatively low rate7 given the relative success of the sales tax in raising revenue 45 states and the district of columbia added the sales tax to their tax infrastructure by the late 1960s the last of the 45 states to enact general sales and use tax was vermont in 19698 components of the sales and use tax the revenue generated by sales and use tax assuming given level of compliance depends on the base of the tax and the tax rate the narrower the base the higher the rate required to raise an equivalent amount of revenue states often have similar consumption items included in their tax base but they are far from uniform tax rates can also vary considerably depending on the states reliance on other revenue sources tax base the sales tax which is considered consumption tax is perhaps better identified as transaction tax on the transfer of tangible personal property expenditures on most services such as medical services are typically excluded from the state sales tax base9 in most states 31 groceries are also exempt from the sales tax or taxed at lower rate another seven states see table 1 true consumption 5 mississippi added use tax the companion to the sales tax in 1938 use tax is tax on the use of product in the early years of the sales tax states began with general sales then added the use tax eventually states adopting sales tax included the use tax in the enacting legislation 6

june 30 2008 crs5 businesstobusiness transactions are often exempt from the retail sales tax particularly in cases where the purchaser is using the good as an input to production these transactions are exempt because including the transactions could lead to the pyramiding of the sales tax for example if coffee shop were to pay retail sales tax on the purchase of coffee and then impose retail sales tax on coffee brewed for the final consumer the total sales tax paid for the cup of coffee would likely exceed the statutory rate products that business purchases for resale are typically not assessed retail sales tax for similar reason if coffee shop buys beans only for resale levying sales tax on the wholesale purchase of the beans and then on the retail sale would more than double the statutory rate the tax treatment of business purchases is not uniform across states according to some estimates approximately 18 of business purchases are taxable depending on the state11 many individuals and organizations are also exempt from state sales taxes entities wishing to claim the sales tax exemption are often issued certificate indicating their taxfree status and are required to present this certification at the point of transaction nonprofit organizations such as those whose mission is religious charitable educational or promoting public health often hold sales tax exempt status the ssuta would establish system where states would use common definitions for goods and services once uniform definition is established states would then indicate whether the good or service is taxable in addition states would identify which entities would be exempt from paying sales taxes eg nonprofit or religious organizations tax rate the second component of sales tax is the tax rate applied to the base described in the previous section in 35 states local governments piggyback local sales tax which often varies among localities within the state on the state sales tax 10 states and the district of columbia levy single rate see table 2 with local taxes some states in the group of 35 may collect uniform local tax along with the state tax and send the local revenue share back to the localities this structure would look like single rate to the consumer because vendors typically do not differentiate between the state and local share for example vendors in virginia levy 50 sales tax on purchases and remit the entire amount to the state the state then sends what would have been raised by 10 tax back to the local jurisdiction where the tax was collected the state of virginia keeps the remaining 40 indiana mississippi new jersey rhode island and tennessee have the highest state sales tax rate of 70 in 2008 however alabama had the highest potential combined state and local rate of 120 residents in high sales tax rate jurisdictions could gain from internet purchases and tax evasion more than those in low tax rate states recognizing this potential revenue drain many

business inputs council on state taxation special report jan 25 2005 crs6 mailorder catalog purchases12 as suggested earlier states with high rates and whose residents have greater incentive to evade

bureau of census column f and g authors calculations identifies the 10 states that do not have local sales tax table 2 presents the sales tax rates for the 50 states and the district of columbia and includes the top local rate also reported in table 2 is the reliance as measured by crs of state and local governments on the general sales or gross receipts typically levied against the vendor tax even though gross receipts taxes have more in common with traditional business taxes the bureau of the census has traditionally crs8 combined them with general sales taxes13 depending on the state law and the vendor revenue generated by internet transactions with outofstate purchasers may or may not fall under the gross receipts tax14 state and local governments in arkansas louisiana south dakota tennessee and washington rely on sales tax revenue for over 40 of total tax revenue economic issues during the debate about socalled streamlining legislation there are several economic issues congress may consider 1 how will the ssuta influence the economic efficiency and equity of state tax systems 2 what will be the impact of changes in the treatment of internet transactions on states that are more reliant on the sales tax 3 what will the potential revenue loss be absent changes in the treatment of internet transactions summary of these issues follows efficiency commonly held view among economists is that good tax or more precisely an efficient tax minimizes distortions in consumer behavior broadly speaking economists maintain that individuals should make the same choices before and after tax is imposed the greater the distortions in behavior caused by tax the greater the economic welfare loss sales tax levied on all consumer expenditures equally would satisfy this definition of efficiency as noted earlier however under the current state sales tax system all consumption expenditures are not treated equally the growth of taxfree internet transactions both businesstobusiness and businesstoconsumer will likely amplify the efficiency losses from altered consumer behavior an alternative theory concerning economic efficiency in sales taxation is referred to as optimal commodity taxation under an optimal commodity tax the tax rate is based on or determined by what is termed the price elasticity of demand for the product sometimes called the ramsey rule products that are price inelastic meaning quantity demanded is unresponsive to changes in price should be levied higher rate of tax in contrast products that are price elastic should have lower rate of tax if products purchased over the internet are relatively more price elastic then the lower tax rate created by effectively taxfree internet transactions may improve economic efficiency as behavioral changes are reduced however the price elasticity of products available over the internet is difficult to measure and the efficiency gain if any is suspected to be small15 13 the bureau of the census also collects data on excise taxes and selective sales we do not report these receipts because they are typically collected at the wholesale level not at the point of retail transaction for example the gasoline excise tax is typically paid by the carrier tanker truck at the point of collection the end of the pipeline not at retail sale 14 under gross receipts tax grt vendor remits designated percentage eg 5 in new mexico of monthly gross receipts or sales revenue to the state gross receipts tax is different from the sales tax because the vendor not the purchaser is legally responsible for paying the tax under the sales tax the vendor acts as the collection agent for the taxing jurisdiction and is not technically paying the tax the buyer is paying the tax 15 equity has both horizontal and vertical components tax is defined as horizontally continued crs9 an additional economic inefficiency arises if vendors change location to avoid collecting sales taxes the location change would likely result in higher transportation costs in the long run it is conceivable that the higher transportation costs would erode the advantage of evading the sales tax16 for example consider virginia consumer who wants to buy set of woodworking chisels the local virginia hardware store sells the set for 50 including profit an internet savvy hardware store in georgia is willing to sell the same chisel set for 52 inclusive of profit and shipping costs so before taxes the local retailer could offer the chisels at lower price the marginal customer who is indifferent between the two retailers before taxes even though the internet is more expensive it is more convenient is therefore just as likely to buy from the internet retailer as from the local retailer17 virginia imposes state and local sales tax of 50 thus yielding final sales price to the consumer of 5250 given the higher relative price inclusive of the tax the marginal consumer along with many other consumers would likely switch to buying chisels from the georgiabased internet retailer assuming these consumers do not feel compelled to pay the required virginia use tax on the internet purchase the diversion from retail to the internet in response to the noncollection of the use tax represents loss in economic efficiency the additional 2 in production costs 52 less 50 represents the efficiency loss to society from evading the use tax18 note that if in the absence of sales and use taxes the internet vendor in the above example may yield to market forces and close up shop however if the internet vendor continues to operate even without the tax advantage it could be the case that consumers are willing to pay higher prices for the convenience of internet shopping if this were true then the higher production costs for internet vendors would not necessarily result in an efficiency loss 15 continued equitable if people of equal circumstances pay equal taxes tax is defined as vertically equitable if people with greater ability to pay carry greater tax burden than those less able to pay an optimal commodity tax would likely violate accepted principles of vertical equity 16 dennis zimmerman the internet sales tax debate sorting through the economic issues paper prepared for the 94th annual conference national tax association baltimore md nov 810 2001 17 the pretax absolute price difference between the two retailers is unimportant the internet price inclusive of shipping could actually be lower before taxes the application of the use tax makes the local retailers product relatively more expensive regardless of what the prices were before taxes 18 shipping costs can be thought of as cost of production the local retailer probably also paid shipping costs to have the product on the shelf those costs are included in the price of the good because the local retailer likely bought in bulk the shipping cost per unit would be considerably lower than the internet retailer crs10 equity the sales tax is often criticized as regressive tax tax that disproportionately burdens the poor19 assuming internet shoppers are relatively better off and do not remit use taxes as prescribed by state law they can avoid paying tax on larger portion of their consumption expenditures than those without internet access at home or work20 consumers without ready internet access are not afforded the same opportunity to evade the sales and use tax in this way electronic commerce may arguably exacerbate the regressiveness of the sales tax at least in the short run as computers and access to the internet become more readily available the potential inequity arising from this aspect of the digital divide could diminish equity issues also arise with respect to businesses currently local retailers are required to collect sales taxes for the state at the point of sale internet retailers in contrast are not faced with the administrative burden thus two otherwise equal retailers face different state and local tax burdens in relatively high tax rate states this disparity may be significant as noted above consumers in these high tax rate states have greater incentive to purchase from outofstate vendors exacerbating the tax burden differential differential effect among states the growth of internetbased commerce will have the greatest effect on the states most reliant on the sales and use tax in addition to having more revenue at risk high reliance states also face greater efficiency losses because of their generally higher state tax rates as noted earlier higher rates drive larger wedge between the retail price inclusive of the sales tax and the internet price and thus exacerbate the efficiency loss from the sales tax states with low rates and less reliance would tend to have smaller wedge between the two modes of transaction states with both high rate and high reliance would tend to recognize the greatest revenue loss from ban on the taxation of internet transactions based upon crs calculations of state and local sales tax revenue as portion of total tax revenue the state and local governments of arkansas louisiana south dakota tennessee and washington are the most reliant on the sales and use tax21 in those states over 40 of total tax revenue is derived from the sales tax this result is not surprising south dakota washington and tennessee do not have comprehensive personal income taxes and arkansas has relatively high 115 combined sales tax rate ordinal rankings of sales tax reliance appear in the last column of table 2 note that six of the seven states with sales tax and income 19 regressive tax collects smaller percentage of income as income increases economists will usually avoid normative questions of what is equitable because such statement implies an interpersonal comparison of utility 20 goolsbee and zittrain 1999 found that the average internet user had on average two more years of education and 22000 more in family income than noninternet users 21 in addition those three states were well above the average state tax rate in the united states of just over 53 of the 45 states with state sales tax and the district of columbia the state tax rates for those three states were as follows washington 65 florida 6 and tennessee 7 crs11 tax are in the top 14 on the reliance index22 the third column c of table 2 reports the highest local sales tax rate for those states that levy local sales taxes revenue loss estimates economists donald bruce and william fox estimated in july 2004 that the new ecommerce loss in 2003 was approximately 8 billion23 new ecommerce as measured by bruce and fox is the lost revenue from states not collecting the use tax on remote internet transactions this estimate excludes purchases made over the telephone or through catalogs that would have occurred anyway an earlier government accountability office gao report estimated that the revenue loss in 2003 from internet sales would be between 10 billion and 124 billion24 the wide range of the gao estimate reflects the degree of uncertainty on the size of the potential state and local revenue loss from commerce the streamlined sales and use tax agreement the entity that drafted the original streamline sales and use tax agreement ssuta the streamlined sales and use tax project sstp was created in 2000 by 43 states and the district of columbia these states and the district of columbia wanted to simplify and better synchronize individual state sales and use tax laws its stated goal was to create simplified sales tax system so all types of vendors from traditional retailers to those conducting trade over the internet could easily collect and remit sales taxes the member states believe that simplified relatively uniform tax code across states would make it easier for remote vendors to collect sales taxes on goods sold to outofstate customers the sstp was dissolved once the ssuta became effective on october 1 200525 the latest amendments to the ssuta were approved june 18 2008 the following is brief description of the agreement as of this writing description of the ssuta under the ssuta member states request that remote sellers voluntarily collect sales taxes on items purchased by customers outside their home state vendors in participating states who voluntarily collect the

burden of collecting taxes to ease tax collection for sellers the states obligations under the ssuta include the following requirements26 standard definitions of products states participating in the ssuta must define all goods in the same way27 for example in many states food is exempt from taxation whereas candy is taxable common definition of candy or food must be agreed upon to implement streamlined sales tax regime each state retains the choice over whether or not the item is taxable local governments in state must use the same tax base and definitions simplified tax rates in many states local jurisdictions tax goods at different rates this complication is mostly remedied under the ssuta as each state will be permitted only one state tax rate with an exception for second state rate on food and drugs28 each state can add one additional local jurisdiction rate based on zip code29 the member state must maintain catalogue of rates for all zip codes for zip codes with multiple rates an average rate for that zip code would apply standard rate sourcing rules for crossjurisdictional sales sourcing rules have not yet been finalized under ssuta it has been proposed that for sales within member state between local jurisdictions the vendor would collect the sales tax at the rate applicable for the vendor location this is identified as origin sourcing for sales into member state from an outofstate vendor the vendor levies tax at the agreed upon statewide rate applicable in the destination state this is identified as destination sourcing there is some debate about the sourcing aspect of the ssuta the single statewide rate which is set by each member state would be combined state and local rate if the combined statewide rate is the state rate plus an average of local rates it is possible that some consumers will pay higher combined tax rate than is required it has been proposed that the member states would be required to include provision in the implementing legislation that would allow consumers that overpay to receive credit for overpayments simplified administration businesses will longer file tax returns with each state and sometimes local government where they conduct business as is often the case where the ssuta has not gone into effect30 instead sales taxes will be remitted to single state agency thus states will bear some of the administrative cost of the technology employed to implement the new system vendor compensation is still under negotiation 26 for more information see httpwwwstreamlinedsalestaxorg 27 section 302 of the ssuta 28

and are identified as members another seven states are associate members only the member states will have taxes collected by remote vendors the following is listing of the status of ssuta adoption in each state member states as of february 27 2008 there were 17 member states that have changed their sales tax laws to fully conform with the agreement arkansas indiana iowa kansas kentucky michigan minnesota nebraska new jersey north carolina north dakota oklahoma rhode island south dakota vermont west virginia and wyoming associate member states at present five states have begun implementing all the requirements of the project and are considered associate members nevada ohio utah tennessee and washington these five states will become full members when they adopt into law all the rules and regulations that accompany full membership other remaining states and the district of columbia are participating as advisors but are not close enough to qualify as either full or associate members nonparticipating states the following states are not participants because they do not levy statewide sales tax alaska delaware montana new hampshire and oregon colorado levies statewide sales tax but has chosen not to participate alaska does allow some localities to levy local sales tax but these localities are not represented in the ssuta compact the stakeholders the streamlined sales tax enjoys the support of the national governors association nga the nga has endorsed the ssuta with hopes that the agreement will address the supreme courts concerns about the burden on interstate commerce of collecting remote taxes the association believes that requiring remote vendors to collect sales and use taxes under new simplified system will survive legal challenges the official statement of the nga follows governors call on the federal government to enact legislation to require remote vendors to collect sales and use taxes on sales of taxable products destined for each state adhering to the agreement31 the nga support is shared by other state and local government organizations including the national conference of state legislatures ncsl the federation of tax administrators fta and the multistate tax commission mtc support also comes from large retailers who must collect sales taxes and believe the current system provides an unfair advantage to internet retailers who do not collect such taxes many large brickandmortar companies with strong internet presence generally comply with guidelines like those under ssuta and generally collect taxes on remote sales several retailers however are taking the middle 31 national governors association edc10 streamlining state sales tax systems feb 27 2008 the policy position statement is available online at httpwwwngaorg crs14 ground in this debate they understand the states desire to more efficiently collect sales tax revenue in fair manner but they ask for greater simplification and increased vendor compensation from the states for collecting state sales taxes opponents of ssuta legislation include state and local governments who feel the administrative obstacles to streamlined sales taxes are too costly to overcome and may actually exceed the potential revenue gain these governments suggest that increased compliance with use tax laws may better be achieved through elevated consumer awareness and more enforcement activities in addition some business groups maintain that the collection requirement even with streamlining would still be too burdensome also opposing the ssuta are several antitax groups who see the ssuta as new tax burden rather than simplification of the current tax system32 antitax groups also argue that states compete to attract businesses and customers through lower tax rates and that this competition is good for consumers ssuta legislation in the 110th congress in the 110th congress s 34 senator enzi and the companion legislation in the house hr 3396 representative delahunt would grant ssuta member states the authority to compel outofstate vendors in member states to collect sales and use taxes33 both bills would respond to the supreme courts recommendation in quill corporation v north dakota that congress act under the commerce clause to clarify state sales tax collection rules more specifically the legislation would allow states that have fully adopted the ssuta to collect sales taxes from sufficiently large businesses even if those businesses do not have nexus in the state sufficiently large business is defined in the legislation as one with nationwide sales of greater than 5 million under s 34 and hr 3396 congress would grant authority to states to compel outofstate vendors to collect sales taxes on the condition that 10 states comprising at least 20 of the total population of all states imposing sales tax have implemented the ssuta34 the legislation also includes additional requirements for administering the new sales tax system after the ssuta adoption threshold has been achieved these requirements include but are not limited to centralized onestop multistate registration system uniform definitions of products and productbased exemptions 32
