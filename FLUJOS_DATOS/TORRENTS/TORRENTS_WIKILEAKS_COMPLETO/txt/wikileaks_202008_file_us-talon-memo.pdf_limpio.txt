entities and subject that information to careful analysis for indications of foreign terrorist activity new reporting mechanism the talon report has been established to provide means to capture nonvalidated domestic threat information flow that information to analysts and incorporate it into the dod terrorism threat warning process talon report consists of raw information reported by concerned citizens and military members regarding suspicious incidents information in talon reports is nonvalidated mayor may not be related to an actual threat and by its very nature may be fragmented and incomplete the purpose of the talon report is to document and immediately disseminate potential threat information to dod personnel facilities and resources the talon mechanism is not

analysis of terrorist threats to dod within the united states background the talon system is designed to report anomalies observations that are suspicious against the steady state context and immediate indicators of potential threats to dod personnel andor resources talon reports are raw nonvalidated information which mayor may not be related to an actual threat and by their very nature maybe fragmented and incomplete information contained in talon reporting is designed for use by commanders at all levels that have force protection responsibilities and for analysts to use to help determine the aggregate terrorist threat to dod people and resources talon reports are of tactical nature with rapid reporting as the goal and may be less refined than intelligence information reports iirs talon reports are designed to capture raw threat data that does not meet iir criteria critical to the reports is the proper documentation of the basic interrogatories who all people involved what when where why and how the sources knowledge of these and clear definition of facts versus opinion sources or reporters talon reports augment but are not designed to replace standard reporting mechanisms iirs information files operational files and substantive investigations case files and associated reports are to be documented as directed by existing policies and directives as general guide to the maximum extent possible t alan reports should be classified at the lowest possible level to ensure maximum distribution of the information the use of the law enforcement sensitive caveat and higher classifications should be kept to minimum talon information must be swiftly briefed locally to commanders and security officials so appropriate actions can be taken before this information is released outside the installation level talon reports are to be sent using automated information systems or via email attachment as word document either on the niprnet for unclassified reports or on siprnet to respective component headquarters reports will be made as soon as possible after developing the information respective elements in designated components will provide the talon reports to the dod counterintelligence field activity cifa as directed in the main policy memo of this attachment the cifa will ensure the jitfct has full access to the raw nonvalidated information designated
