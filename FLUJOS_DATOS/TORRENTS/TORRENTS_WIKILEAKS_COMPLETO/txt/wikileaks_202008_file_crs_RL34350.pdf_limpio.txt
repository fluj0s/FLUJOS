employees who ve significant supervisory duties such as hiring and firing are supervisors howe ver disagreement occurs with respect to employees who have nor supervisory duties in 2001 the us supreme court ruled that the test administered by the national labor relations board nlrb or the boa rd to determine whether an employee is supervisor was inconsistent with the nlra in response to nlrb v kentucky river community care inc the board issued september 2006 decision in oakwood healthcare inc in which it established new finitions for three key terms that are used to identify supervisors for purposes of the nlra to assign and responsibly to direct employees and to exercise independent judgment applying the new definitions the nlrb concluded that 12 permanent charge nurses employed by oakwood healthcare we re supervisors the board found that the nurses exercised independe nt judgment in assigning employees to patients and assigning overall tasks to other employees however the board found that none of the charge nurses at oakwood healthcare responsibly directed other employees following the decision in oakwood healthcare inc representative robert andrews and senator chris dodd introduced the reempowerment of skilled and professional employees and construction tradesworker s respect act hr 1644s 969 the respect act would eliminate assign and responsibly to direct from the current definition of supe rvisor in the nlra in addition the act would add limiting phrase to the definition of supervisor under the act employees would be classified as supervisors if they are engaged in supervisory activities more than 50 of the time currently an employee may be classified as supervisor if the employee acts as supervisor for at least 1015 of the employees worktime this change would reduce the number of employees who are classified as supervisors and therefore increase the number of employees protected by the nlra the respect act if it were enacted may have significant impact on foremen in 1947 the supreme court upheld the position that the board followed at the time that supervisors were included in the definition of employee in response congress amended the nlra to exclude supervisors from the definition of employee the new definition was included in the labor manage ment relations act of 1947 pl 80101 because the respe ct act would eliminate responsibly to direct as supervisory function foreme n and employees with similar duties may longer be classified as supervisors they could therefore receive the same protections as other employees

responsibly to direct them or to adjust their grievances or effectively to recommend such action if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of merely routine or clerical

this language the kentucky river case and oakwood healthcare inc in nlrb v kentucky river community care inc the us supreme court considered whether certain nurses should be classified as supervisors for purposes of the nlra when their judgment was base d on professional or t echnical training or experience kentucky river community care the operator of care facility for individuals with mental

issue in kentucky river was the second part of the test although the c ourt recognized the nlrbs discretion to clarify the meaning of the term independent judgment it maintained that it was inappropriate for the board to characterize judgment that reflects ordinary professional or technical judgment as failing to be independent judgment the court said that the nlrbs reference to ordinary professional or technical judgment established startling categorical exclusion that was not suggested by the statutory text of the nlra7 the court observed what supervisory judgment worth exerci sing one must wonder does not rest on professional or technical skill or experience if the board applied this aspect of its test to every exercise of supe rvisory function it would virtually eliminate supervisors from the act8 moreover the court indicated that it was unaware of any nlrb decision that concluded that supervisors judgment ceased to be independent judgment because it depended on the supervisors professional or technical training or experience9 the court maintained that when an employee exercises one of the functions identified in section 211 with judgment that possesse s sufficient degree of independence the nlrb invariably finds supervisory status10 four justices dissented from the majo ritys position on independent judgment11 the dissent maintained that the nlrbs in terpretation of indepe ndent judgment was fully rational and consistent with th nlra the dissent noted the term independent judgment is indisputably ambiguous and it is settled law that the nlrbs interpretation of ambiguous nguage in the nlra is entitled to deference12 in september 2006 the nlrb revisited the issue of supervisory status in oakwood healthcare inc 13 oakwood healthcare empl oyed approximately 181 registered nurses rns in 10 patient care units at an acute care hospital many of the nurses served as charge nurses who we re responsible for overseeing their patient care units and assigning other rns tec hnicians and medical personnel on theirhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34350crs4 14 id at 2 15 348 nlrb at 3 thus exercisi ng our discretion to interpret ambiguous language in the act and consistent with the supreme courts instructions in kentucky river we herein adopt definitions for the terms assign respons ibly to direct and independent judgment as those terms are used in section 211 of the act 16 see 348 nlrb at 4 17 id 18 id 19 348 nlrb at 8shifts some of the rns worked permanently as charge nurses while others rotated into the charge nurse position oakwood healthcare sought to exclude both the permanent and the rotating charge nurse s from proposed bargaining unit on the grounds that the nurses were supervisor s within the meaning of section 211 oakwood healthcare maintained that the charge nurses were supervisors because they used independent judgment in assigning and responsibly directing employees14 the nlrb viewed oakwood healthcare inc as an opportunity to define the terms assign responsibly to direct and independent judgme nt as those terms are used in section 211 of the nlra15 for each term the nlrb considered the language used by congress as well as th nlras legislative history applicable policy considerations and supreme court precedent16 the nlrb concluded that the term assign should be construed to re fer to the act of designating an employee to place such as location or departme nt appointing an employee to time or giving significant overall duties or tasks to an employee17 the nlrb noted that in the health care setting the term enco mpasses the charge nurses responsib ility to assign nurses and aides to particular patients18 the term would not apply however to an individual who simply chooses th order in which an employee will perform discrete tasks within an assignment citing the legislative history of section 211 the nlrb interpreted the term responsibly to direct to apply to indi viduals who not only oversee the work being performed but are held responsible if the work is done poorly or not at all the nlrb observed for direction to be responsible the person directing and performing the oversight of the employee must be accountable for the performance of the task by the other such that some adverse consequence may befall the one providing the oversight if the tasks performed by the employee are not performed properly this interpretation of responsibly to direct is consistent with post kentucky river board decisions that considered an accountability element for responsibly to direct19 according to the board to establish accountability for purposes of responsible direction it must be shown that the employer delegated to the putative supervisor thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34350crs5 20 id 21 348 nlrb at 9 22 348 nlrb at 10 the nlrb did indicate however that the mere existence of company policies would not eliminate independent judg ment from decisionmaking if the policies allow for discretionary choices 23 348 nlrb at 89 24 in two other decisions issued on the same day as oakwood healthcare inc the nlrb applied its new definitions and concluded that charge nurses at nur sing home in hibbing minnesota and socalled lead persons at manufacturing facility in mccomb mississippi were not supervisors see beverly enterprisesminnesota inc

for the putative supervisor must also be established with regard to the term independent judgment the nlrb maintained that at minimum an individual must act or effectively recommend action that is free of the control of others and form an opinion or evaluation by discerning and comparing data21 the board further elaborated that judgment is not independent if it is dictated or controlled by detailed instructions in company policies the verbal instructions of higher authority or the provisions of collective bargaining agreement22 the nlrb sought to interpret th term independent judgment in light of the phrase not of merely routine or clerical nature which appears before independent judgment in sec tion 211 the nlrb stated if there is only one obvious and selfevi dent choice or if the assignment is made solely on the basis of equalizing work loads then the assignment is routine or clerical in nature and does not implicate independent judgment23 applying the new definitions for the term s assign responsibly to direct and independent judgment th nlrb concluded that 12 permanent charge nurses employed in 5 of 10 patient care units at oakwood healthcare were supervisors for purposes of the nlra24 within the new meaning of the terms assign the board found that 12 charge nurses assigned employees to patients and assigned overa ll tasks to other employees responsibly to direct the board did not find that any of the charge nurses at oakwood health care responsibly directed other employees the board concluded that the ch arge nurses were not subject to discipline or lower evaluations if employees they directed failed to adequately perform their tasks independent judgment finally the board found that the 12 charge nurses exercised independe nt judgment in assigning other staff the charge nurses made assignments in light of the skills of employees and the nursing time that would be required during given shifthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34350crs6 25 348 nlrb at 16 26 id 27 348 nlrb at 20 28 348 nlrb at 24the nlrb noted that the process of equalizing work loads at the hospital involves inde pendent judgment25 although oakwood healthcare maintained written policy for assigning nursing personnel to deliver care to patient s the board observed that charge nurses were given cons iderable latitude in making decisions on how to assign nursing personnel th board concluded that when charge nurse makes an assignment based on the skill experience and temperament of nursing pers onnel and the patients that nurse has exercised the requisite discretion to make the assignment supervisory function requirin g the use of independent judgment26 in addition the board found that because the 12 charge nurses served in that capacity on every shift that they worked they spent regular and substantial portion of their work time performing supervisory functions the board also found that charge nur ses in the emergency room were not supervisors the board concluded that the nurses did not exercise independent judgment in assigning employees to places within the emergency room finally the board found that none of the rotating charge nurses was supervisor dissent in oakwood healthcare inc the dissent in oakwood healthcare inc maintained that the definitions established by the nlrb would have the effect of removing collective bargaining rights from many employees with only minor supervisory responsibilities the dissent noted that the language of the nlra its structure and its legislative history all point to significantly narrower interpre tations of the ambiguous statutory terms assign other employees and responsib ly to direct them than the majority adopts27 the dissent was especially critical of the majoritys definition of the term assign by defining the term to include the assignment of tasks the dissent said that the majority disregarded the syntax of section 211 whic h states in relevant part the term supervisor means any indi vidual having authority in the interest of the employer to assign other employees citing kentucky river the dissent noted that the word employees serves as the grammatical object of the verbs identifying supervisory functions in secti on 211 the dissent stated simply in short it must be the employees who are being assigned not the tasks28httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34350crs7 29 348 nlrb

definition of the term responsibly to direct citing the legislative history of the term the dissent maintained that the term refers to the general supervisory authority delegated to foremen overseeing

definition failed to recognize the scope and scale of supervisory function that responsibly to direct was intended to capture30 the respect act following the decision in oakwood healthcare inc representative robert andrews and senator chris dodd introduced the reempowerment of skilled and professional employees and construction tradesworker s respect act hr 1644s 969 the respect act would creat narrower definition of supervisor than exists under current law supporters of the legislation argue that the respect act would ensure that only true superv isors are excluded from protection under the nlra31 opponents maintain that the gislation would change the defin ition of supervisor that has been in place for 60 years32 the respect act would amend the nl ras definition of supervisor by removing two supervisory functions from th existing 12 functions and by adding limiting phrase the legislation would elimin ate assign and responsibly to direct from the current supervisory functions33 in addition the act would add immediately after in the interest of the employer the phrase and for majority of the individuals worktime this addition would seem to respond to the nlrbs decision in oakwood healthcare inc in its decision the board maintained where an individual is engaged part time as supervisor and the rest of the time as unit employee the legal standard for supervisory determination is whether the individual spends regular and substantial portion of hisher work timehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34350crs8 34 348 nlrb at 11performing supervisory functions under the boards standard regular means according to pattern or schedule as opposed to sporadic substitution the board has not adopted stri ct numerical definition of substantial and has found supervisory status where the individuals have served in supervisory role for at least 1015 percent of their total work time we find reason to depart from this established precedent34 under the respect act an employee would be classified as supervisor if he or she was engaged in supervisory activities at least 50 of the time the respect act would not apply to ra ilroad or airline employees workers in both industries are covered by the railway labor act nor would the legislation apply to most federal employees who are covered by the civil service reform act on may 8 2007 the house education and labor subcommittee on health employment labor and pensions held hearing on the respect act on september 19 2007 the full committee approved the measure by vote of 26 to 20 to date the senate has not taken action on the legislation potential impact of the respect act the respect act would create more rest rictive definition of supervisor than exists since the decision in oakwood healthcare inc the measure would reduce the number of supervisory functions from 12 to 10 for larger employer many of the remaining functions eg hiring firing or transferring may be performed by human resource department because the act would eliminate responsibly to direct as supervisory function foremen and em ployees with similar duties may longer be classified as supervisors under current law an employee may be classified as supervisor if the employee performs supervisory functions at least 1015 of the employees worktime the respect act would raise this threshold to anything more than 50 even if the functions assign and responsib ly to direct were not removed from the current definition of supervisor this ch ange would reduce the number of employees who are classified as supervisors because they would be included in the definition of employee they would receive the protections provided by the nlra foremen the respect act may have significant effect on foremen and employees with similar duties in 1947 the supreme court upheld the position that the board followed at the time that supervisors were included in the definition of employee in response congress amended the nlra to exclude supervisors from the definition of employee the new definition was in cluded in the labor management relations act of 1947 pl 80101 commonly calle d the tafthartley act after its main sponsors robert taft and fred hartley jr httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34350crs9 35 national labor relations board legislative history of th labor management relations act 1947 washington us govt print off 1985 pp 304 410411 1303the house report on legislati on approved in the house said that the legislation excluded foremen and other superv isory personnel from the definition of employee in the senate senator ralph flanders ffered an amendment to add responsibly to direct to list of 11 supe rvisory functions that were in the senate bill senator flanders said the definition of supervisor in this act seems to cover adequately everything except the basic act of supervising ma ny of the activities described in section 211 are transferred in modern practice to personnel manager or department in fact under some modern management methods the supervisor might be deprived of authority for most of the functions enumerated he is charged with the responsible direction of his department and the men under him he determines under general orders what job shall be undertaken next and who shall do it he gives instructions for its proper performance the senate report on its ve rsion of the labor manage ment relations act said that the amended definition of employ ee distinguishes between straw bosses leadmen setup men and othe r minor supervisory employees on the one hand and the supervisor vested with such genuine ma nagement prerogatives as the right to hire or fire discipline or make effective recommendations w ith respect to such action the report went on to say that without the change in definition management would be deprived of the undi vided loyalty of its foremen35 by eliminating the function responsib ly to direct employees from the definition of supervisor the respect act may increase the number of employees protected by the nlra estimating the impact of oakwood healthcare inc and the respect act regardless of how the decision in oakwood healthcare inc is applied it is difficult to estimate how many employees may be affected similarly it is difficult to estimate how many employees may be affected by the respect act if it were enacted data from household and employer surveys that are often used to estimate the potential impact of policy changes may not include enough information to identify whether an employee is superv isor under the nlra for example persons occupation or job title may not be sufficient to determine whether an employee should be classified as supervisor equally important surveys usually do not ask respondents how much time they spend on different tasks information that would be needed to determine the percentage of time that an employee spends on supervisory activities nevertheless removing the phrase responsibly to direct from the definition of supervisor may result in many foremen and similar workers being reclassified as employees for purposes of collective barg aining 2002 report by the
