over the past 25 years an important change s occurred in the structure of employersponsored retirement plans in the private sector although the percentage of the workforce who participate in employersponsored retirement plans has remained relatively stable at approximately half of all workers the type of plan by which most workers are covered has changed from defined benefit db pensions to defined contribution dc plans the responsibilities of managing db plan making contributions investing the assets and paying the benefits to retired workers and their survivorslie mainly with the employer in typi cal dc plan the worker must decide whether to participate in the plan how much to contribute how to invest the contributions and what to do with the money in the plan when he or she change s jobs or retires as result of the shift from db plans to dc plans workers today bear more responsibility for preparing for their financial security in retirement according to data collected by the federal reserve board 45 of households in which the householder or spouse was employed contribute d to employersponsored retirement plans in 2004 and 58 owned retirement account of any kind among marriedcouple households in which the householder was under age 35 the median balance in all retirement accounts owned by the household was 19000 in 2004 among unmarried householders the median retirement account balance in 2004 was just 7000 among marriedcouple households headed by individuals between 45 and 54 years old median retirement assets in 2004 were 103200 unmarried householders aged 45 to 54 had median balance of 32000 most households that participated in defined contribution plans in 2004 contributed between 3 and 10 of pay to the plan younger households with median earnings contributed about 5 of pay while median earnings households 45 and older contributed about 6 of pay the report also presents the results of an analysis of the amount of retirement savings that households might be able to accumulate by age 65 under number of different scenarios the analysis shows how varying the age at which households begin to save for retirement the percentage of their earnings that they save and the rate of return on investment can affect the amount of retirement savings the household will accumulate using monte carlo methods that simulate the variability of investment rates of return we found that marriedcouple household that contributed 8 of pay annually for 30 years beginning at age 35 to retirement plan invested in mix of stocks and bonds could expect have accumulated 468000 in 2004 dollars by age 65 if rates of return were at the median over the 30year period nevertheless given the variability of rates of return there is 5 chance that the couple would have 961000 or more and 5 chance that the couple would have 214000 or less higher contribution rates and longer investment periods lead to higher account balances but also increase the impact of the variability of investment rates of return at 10 contribution rate over 30 years the household could expect to accumulate 594000 with 90 probability that account would total between 301000 and 12 million saving 8 of pay over 40 years the household could expect to accumulate 844000 with 90 probability that the account would total between 370000 and 2 million this report will not be updated

measure of the workers average salary at retirement benefits typically are paid as an annuity that provides the retiree with monthly income for life the employee retirement income security act of 1974

of workers participate in 401ktype plans rather than in traditional defined benefit pensions these are called defined contribution dc plans defined contribution plans are much like savings accounts maintained by employers on behalf of each participating employee in typical dc plan the worker must decide whether to participate in the plan how much to contribute how to invest the contributions and what to do with the money in the plan when he or she changes jobs or retires thus in dc plan it is the employee who bears the investment risk and who is ultimately responsible for prefunding his or her retirement income as result of the shift from db plans to dc plans workers today be ar more responsibility for preparing for their financial security in retirement decisions that workers makeor fail to makefrom the time that they first enter the workforce can have substantial impact on their wealth and income many decades in the future understanding how workers have responded to these challenges and 1 erisa governs only privatesector plans retirement plans offered by state and local governments to their employees are governed by the statutes of those jurisdictions retirement plans for federal employees are governed by title 5 of the united states code unlike private plans most governmentsponsored db plans require employee contributions

collected by the federal reserve board on the retirement savings accumulated by workers and the rates at which they are saving for retirement the report also presents the results of an analysis conducted by crs on the amount of retirement savings that workers might be able to accumulate by age 65 under number of different scenarios the analysis shows how varying each of several factors including the age at which households begin to save for retirement the percentage of their earnings that they save and the rate of return on investment can affect the amount of retirement savings the household will accumulate the accumulated savings is then converted into an annuity to illustrate the share of preretirement earnings that the accumulated retirement savings could replace

growth of defined contribution plans began in the 1980s in 1978 congress added section 401k to the internal revenue code which allowed employees to contribute part of their current pay into retirement plan on pretax basis2 in 1981 the internal revenue service irs published regulations for cash or deferred arrangements established under 401k into which employees can make pretax contributions and in which interest dividends and capital gains accrue on taxdeferred basis until the money is withdrawn 3 since that time dc plans have overtaken defined benefit pensions in the number of plans the number of participants and total assets in 2006 only 20 of all workers in the private sector were included in defined benefit pension plans while 43 participated in defined contribution plans about 12 of workers participated in both types of plan4 db and dc plans also differ with respect to pa rticipation in general all workers who meet the requirements for coverage under db plan automatically earn benefits under the plan the employer prefunds the benefits that will be paid to all eligible employees when they reach retirement age in contrast in most dc plans the employee must elect to participate the employee also must decide how much to contribute to the plan and how to invest the contributions according to the us departme nt of labor 20 of workers whose employers sponsored dc plans did not participate in these plans in 2006 5 one way to boost enrollment in dc plans would be to enroll all eligible employees automatically more firms particularly among large employers have adopted automatic enrollment in recent 2 defined contribution plans had existed for many years but prior to enactment of irc 401k they were funded by employer contributions or aftertax employee contributions 3 401k plans cover mainly workers in forprofit businesses in the private sector workers in nonprofits are sometimes covered under 403b plans and workers in state and local governments are sometimes covered under 457 plans 4 the labor department reports that 51 of private sector workers were in any type of plan twenty percent were in db plans and 43 were in dc plans 43 20 51 12 5 fiftyfour percent of workers in the private sector worked for employers who sponsored defined contribution plans in 2006 and 43 of privatesector workers participated in dc plans assuming that all

profit sharing401k council of america 17 all 401k plans had automatic enrollment in 2005 up from 11 in 2004 automatic enrollment had been adopted by 34 of plans with 5000 or more participants by 2005 compared to just 4 of plans with fewer than 50 participants the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 contains provisions that are intended to encourage employers to adopt automatic enrollment in defined contribution plans plans with this feature will be exempted from certain tests for discrimination in favor of highlycompensated employees practice that is prohibited by law with the trend away from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans workers now bear much of the responsibility of preparing for retirement workers whose employers offer savings or thrift plans such as those authorized under 401k 403b and 457 of the internal revenue code can accumulate assets on taxdeferred basis while they are working most people with earned income also can contribute to an individual retirement account ira in 2007 ira contributions of up to 4000 or 5000 for people 50 and older are taxdeductible for workers who are not covered by retirement plan at work 6 in these plans taxes are paid when the funds are withdrawn and penalty may apply if the withdrawal occurs before retirement another option is to save for retirement in roth ira roth iras accept only aftertax contributions however withdrawals from roth ira during retirement are taxfree 7 the sur v ey of consumer finances this congressional research ser vice report prese nts data on r etirement plan pa rticipation and

more comparable to the census bureaus definitio n of household than to its definition of family for more information see bucks kennickell and moore federal reserve bulletin 2006 9 there were 1121 million households in the us in 2004 and 847 million households 756 in which either the householder or the householders spouse was employed at the time the survey was conducted we counted households as participating in the plan if the household the employer or both contributed to plan httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33845g20g142g157g146g155g142

participate because their employer does not offer plan however data from the department of labor indicate that among worker s whose employer offers dc plan 20 do not participate10 participation in employersponsored defined contribution plans varied with the age and marital status of the householder participation was lowest among households in which the householder was under age 35 37 and highest among households in which the householder was between the ages of 45 and 54 52 participation was higher among marriedcouple households 51 than among unmarried householders 36 partly because marriedcouple households had more workers however marriedcouple households had higher participation rates at all ages than households headed by unmarried persons table 2 also shows the percentage of participating households in which either the household the employer or both contribute to the plan ninety percent of participating households reported that they contributed to the plan in which they participated while 83 reported that the employer contributed to the plan 11 threefourths of all participating households reported that both the household and the employer contributed to the plan

when evaluating the adequacy of households retirement savings couples obviously need more income to support themselves than single persons although they do not necessarily need twice as much income 12 younger workers have more time to save than older workers and can reap the benefits of compound interest over longer period as the data presented later in this report will demonstrate workers who wait until middle age to start saving for retirement face an uphill struggle in accumulating adequate retirement assets table 3 shows the retirement account balances of households that owned one or more retirement accounts in 2004 categorized by the age and marital status of the household head the first column shows the balances in all of the dc plans at the current main jobs of the householder and his or her spouse the second column shows the balances in all retirement accounts owned by the household including accounts at their current jobs balances held in accounts at former employers and balances in individual retire ment accounts iras the third column of table 3 shows the ratio of household retirement saving to annual household earnings for example the second row of table 3 shows that among marriedcouple households in which the householder was under age 35 the median balance in all retirement accounts owned by the household was 19000 this amount was equal to 267 of the dian annual earnings of those households similar ratios are used later in this report to illustrate measure of the adequacy of retirement savings 10 see national compensation survey employee benefits in private industry us department of labor bureau of labor statistics summary 0605 august 2006 some workers whose employer offers plan may not be eligible to participate if they are under age 21 have less than one year of service or work less than 1000 hours in year 11 in any particular instance it is possible that only the household or the employer contributed to the plan assuming that each household answered the survey questions correctly those that reported that the household did not contribute to the plan would be participating on the basis of employer contributions only 12 in these tables the householder is classified by his or her legal marital status at the time the interview was conducted httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33845g20g142g157g146g155g142

words th reefourths of marriedcouple households headed by persons under age 35 had total retirement assets of 44000 or less in 2004 while onefourth of all such households had total retirement assets of more than 44000 at the 25th percentile married couple households headed by persons under age 35 had total retirement assets of 5400 in 2004 among marriedcouple households headed by i ndividuals between 45 and 54 years old median retirement assets in 2004 were 103200 households headed by unmarried individuals had retirement assets that were lower at every age than those of married couples both in absolute terms and as ratio of their current earnings among households headed by single persons between the ages of 45 and 54 for example median retirement assets in 2004 were 32000 or less than third of the median retirement assets of marriedcouple households in this age group likewise at the 75 th percentile households headed by unmarried individuals between the ages of 45 and 54 had total retirement assets of 80000 compared to assets of 275000 among married couple households in this age group at the 25th percentile households headed by unmarried individuals between the ages of 45 and 54 had total retirement assets of 11400 compared with assets of 30000 among married couple households eventually most households will have to begin spending their retirement assets most choose to do so through periodic withdrawals while others choo to convert some or all of their retirement assets into guaranteed stream of income by pur chasing an annuity an individual retiring at age 65 in

households contributed more to dc plans than households headed by unmarried persons among both marriedcouple hous eholds and single households and across all age groups employee salary deferrals into

described the amounts that households had accumulated in retirement savings accounts and how much they were contributing to their retirement plans in 2004 as reported in the federal reserve boards survey of consumer finances this section uses income data from the census bureaus current population survey and statistical software that simulates the variability of investment rates of return to timate future retirement account balances and to demonstrate how several variables can affect the amount of retirement savings that households could accumulate by age 65 17 as was shown by the data displayed in table 2 only 45 of working households participated in employersponsored defined contribution plans in 2004 some households that did not participate in employersponsored plans saved for retirement in individual retirement accounts iras but data from the scf indicate that most households that did not participate in an employersponsored plan also did not own an ira 18 households that do not save for retirement may be reducing their future incomes significantly but by how much if household starts to save what variables might affect the amount that they have accumulated by the time the householder reaches age 65 these questions are addressed in this section of the report as noted in the introduction workers must deci not only whether to save for retirement but also how much to save how to invest their savings and what to do with their accumulated savings each time they change jobs and when they reach retirement number of variables can affect the amount that households have accumulated in their retirement accounts by the time they reach retirement age including the following 19 household earnings the amount that the household saves 17 the cps rather than the scf was used as the source of earnings because its much larger sample size more than 70000 households allowed us to estimate household earnings among marriedcouple and unmarried householders by individual year of age rather than in age groups our estimates of future retirement accumulations are based on annual contributions as percentage of earnings therefore the scf asset data were not needed 18 according to the 2004 scf 388 million households had balances in dc plans in 2004 326 million households owned an ira and 150 million had both dc plan and an ira of 733 million us hous eholds that did not own dc

estimate household savings household earnings also had to be estimated for the base year of our analysis earnings were estimated in 2004 at every age from 25 through 64 for marriedcouple and unmarried households at the 75th 50th and 25th percentiles of earnings from the march 2005 cps this produced an ageearningsmarital status matrix with 240 cells see appendix table a1 for each later year in the simulation earnings were increased by 11 which is the estimated longrun growth rate of real wages as projected by the office of the actuary of the social security administration for example the median earnings in 2004 of marriedcouple household headed by 25 yearold was 41000 to estimate the same households earnings one year later when the householder would be age 26 the 2004 median earnings of marriedcouple households headed by 26yearold 45600 were multiplied by 1011 which resulted in estimated household earnings of 46102 the following year when the householder would be age 27 we estimated household earnings as 51106 which is the 2004 earnings of married couple household headed by 27 yearold 50000 multiplied by 1011 2 the process for each household through age 64 was repeated for simplicity we assumed that marriedcouple households would remain marriedcouple households throughout the period of the analysis and that unmarried households would remain unmarried having estimated household earnings each year we next had to choose the percentage of earnings that each household would contribute to its retirement account annually the data on contribution rates from the 2004 survey of consumer finances indicated that most households contribute between 3 and 10 of earnings to their employersponsored retirement plan based on these data we estimated the retirement savings that would accumulate by age 65 assuming that households contributed either 6 8 or 10 of household earnings to the account every year starting at age 25 age 35 or age 45 20 assuming the householder retires at age 65 these starting dates would result in periods of saving for retirement lasting 40 years 30 years and 20 years respectively households that do not save every year would accumulate less than was estimated for those that contribute consistently to estimate the amount that households would have accumulated in their retirement account by age 65 the annual rate of return on the funds invested in those accounts had to be estimated rather than assume that the rate of return in each year would be the longterm average rate of return on mixed portfolio of stocks and bonds we used monte carlo simulation process in which the rate of return in each year was randomly selected from the range of likely rates of return implied by the historical returns on stocks and bonds many financial advisors recommend that investors shift their portfolios away from stocks and into bonds as they approach retirement therefore in our simulations households allocated 65 of assets to the standard poor s 500 index of stocks from the ages of 25 to 34 60 to stocks from 35 to 44 55 to stocks from 45 to 54 and 50 to stocks after age 55 in each case the remainder of the portfolio was assumed to be invested in aaarated corporate bonds the accounts were rebalanced after each year of the 20 the amounts represent the total annual contribution to the plan as percentage of earnings we do not differentiate between worker contributions and employer contributions httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33845g20g142g157g146g155g142 g150g142g151g157g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g156g497g561g10g152g160g561g15

30year investment period was significantly higher than average or lower than average based on the history of stock and bond returns from 1926 through 2005 and given the allocation of investment assets that we chose there is 5 chance that the households retirement account would earn an average annual real rate of return of 17 or less over the 30 year investment period the historical record of returns suggests that such low rate of return has approximately oneintwenty chance of occurring in any given 30year period in the event that investment returns were at the 5 th percentile the household would have 214000 in 2004 dollars in its retirement account when the householder reached age 65 this is less than half of httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33845g20g142g157g146g155g142

over the period when the household is saving for retirement in which case it will accumulate more assets than it would have in period of average investment retu rns based on historical returns in any 30year investment period there is 95 probability that the average real rate of return on the mix of assets in the households retirement account would be 93 or less however there is 5 chance that average real rate of return would be higher than 93 if the household were to attain 93 average real rate of return on its investments over 30 years it would have retirement account balance of 961000 in 2004 dollars at age 65 the amounts displayed in figure 1 illustrate that variability in rates of return will inevitably lead to some uncertainty in retirement planning households can decide when to begin saving for retirement and how much to save but variability in rates of return is beyond their control and yet has great impact on their assets at retirement

that he or she has accumulated at retirement age beginn ing to save at younger age results in larger total contributions and allows investment gains to compound over longer time figure 2 shows the retirement account balance at age 65 of marriedcouple with median household earnings that contributes 8 of pay each year to retirement account invested in mix of stocks and bonds over periods of 20 30 and 40 years the household that begins saving at age 25 saves for 40 years while the households that begin saving at ages 35 and 45 save for 30 years and 20 years respectively for each of the three investment periods we show the account balance at age 65 if the average rate of return for the investment period were equal to the median rate of return and if the average rate of return were significantly below the median at the 5 th percentile of likely rates of return or significantly above the median at the 95th percentile of likely rates of return if the couple were to begin saving at age 25 and earned the median rate of return over 40 years their account balance at age 65 would be 844000 in 2004 dollars delaying the start of retirement saving until age 35 would result in an account balance of 468000 or just 55 of the amount they would have accumulated had they started saving at age 25 waiting until age 45 to begin saving for retirement would result in an account balance of 213000 at 65 or onefourth of the amount they would have had at 65 if they had contributed 8 year starting at age 25 of course couple that delays the start of saving until age 45 might get lucky and invest during period of aboveaverage rates of return for example if rates of return during the twenty years when they were saving were in the 95 th percentile of the likely rates of return the couple would accumulate 372000 in 2004 dollars by age 65 or about 75 more than if rates of return during that period were at the 50th percentile on the other hand even couple that begins to save at age 25 may have the misfortune to invest duri ng period of belowaverage returns couple with median household earnings that contributes an amount equal to 8 of earnings annually for 40 years to retirement account that is invested in mix of stocks and bonds could expect to accumulate 844000 in 2004 dollars by age 65 if investment returns over that period were in the 50th percentile of likely returns but they would have just 370000 if investment returns were at the 5th percentile of likely rates of return workers cannot control the variability of investment rates of return but they can choose to begin

return can affect retirement accumulations significantly even for those who contribute greater amount to their retirement account for example the results displayed in figure 3 show that if the average real rate of return over 30 years were in the 5 th percentile of likely rates of return couple that contributed 6 of pay annually to retirement account invested in mix of stocks and bonds could expect to have accumulated just 170000 in 2004 dollars by age 65 this is less than quarter of the amount that they would have accumulated if rates of return during that period had been at the 95th percentile

g3g141g142g154g158g138g140g162g561 for most people the main purpose of saving for retirement is to have money available to replace the earnings that they will lose when they stop working the proverbial threelegged stool of retirement incomeprivate pensions social security and personal savingsis missing leg for many households because the number of defined benefit pensions has declined substantially over the past 25 years most workers in the usabout 96are covered by social security but social security is not designed to replace all of workers earnings 21 the social security administration estimates that for careerlong averag ewage earner retiring at the full retirement age social security will replace about 41 of their careeraverage earnings for careerlong lowwage earner social security will replace an estimated 55 of average earnings for careerlong highwage earner social security will replace just 27 of their average earnings the percentage of preretirement earnings that is replaced by social security pensions or other income is called the earnings replacement rate the estimated value of retirement accounts at age 65 in constant 2004 dollars is an absolute measure of retirement assets the earnings replacement rate is relative measure of retirement assets to calculate earnings replacement rates we first needed to decide on an appropriate measure of earnings for most households relevant measure would be their average earnings in the years just before they reach retirement age as our measure 21 most workers not covered by social security are employees of state and local governments that have elected not to participate these governments are required to provide them with pensions about onefourth of state and local workers are not in social security httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33845g20g142g157g146g155g142 g150g142g151g157g561g21g138g159g146g151g144g156g497g561g10g152g160g561g15

marriedcouple and single person households headed by persons 60 to 64 years old we used average earnings in 2004 as reported on the cps for households headed by persons 60 to 64 years old as the base measure of earnings and projected these amounts forward at growth rate of 11 per year to calculate the earnings replacement rate from households retirement savings we converted the account balance into stream of income this was done by calculating the annuity value of the retirement account an annuity is contract between an individual and financial institution usually an insurance companyin which in exchange for premium paid by the annuity purchaser the insurer promises to pay the individual an income for life or for fixed period of years the premium for an immediate income annuity is usually single payment which the insurer then invests life annuity insures the purchaser and his or her surviving spouse in the case of joint and survivor annuity against longevity risk which is the risk that the individual will outlive his or her retirement assets we calculated the percentage of preretirement earnings that would be replaced if the households entire retirement account balance were converted to life annuity 22 for example if marriedcouple household with median earnings contributed an amount equal to 8 of earnings to retirement account each year for 30 years and earned the median rate of return over that period of time the couple would have accumulated 468000 in 2004 dollars when the householder reached age 65 in january 2007 this amount would purchase joint and 100 survivor annuity that would replace 42 of the households average annual earnings in the five years before the householder reached age 65 23 on the cps income is reported before taxes the replacement rate here is pretax annuity income divided by pretax earnings

figure 5 combines in single graph the effect that variation in investment rate of return length of investment period and contribution rates can have on earnings replacement rates for marriedcouple household with median household earnings in this graph the value of the households retirement account at age 65 measured in 2004 dollars has been converted to joint and 100 survivor annuity and the income from the annuity is compared with average household earnings over the five years before retirement on the vertical axis the graph shows the annuity value of the households retirement account measured as the percentage of average preretirement earnings the annuity would replace on the horizontal axis we show three investment periods of 20 30 and 40 years which correspond in our analysis to saving for retirement starting at ages 45 35 and 25 respectively the vertical bars show the range of replacement rates that could be achieved from converting the households retirement account to joint and 100 survivor annuity at age 65 depending on the percentage of pay that the household contributed to its account each year and the investment rate of return on each bar the replacement rates corresponding to low average and high rates of return are represented by the square circle and diamond respectively for example the leftmost and shortest vertical bar in figure 5 shows that if married couple with median earnings invested 6 of household earnings for 20 years their retirement account balance at age 65 could purchase an annuity that would pay an amount equal to just 8 of their final average pay assuming that investment returns over the 20year period were in the 5 th percentile of likely returns the annuity value of their account would replace 14 of their final average earnings if investment returns were at the median and the annuity would replace 27 of their final average pay if investment returns over the 20year period were in the 95th percentile of likely returns moving from left to right across figure 5 the vertical bars representing earnings replacement rates both begin and end at higher replacement rates representing the effects on retirement savings of higher contribution rates and longer investment periods the greater length of the bars as contribution rates rise and investment periods grow longer illustrates the impact that variability of rates of return can have on retirement account accumulations and in turn on the annuity income that one could purchase with those accounts looking at the leftmost panel we see that if household were to begin saving 8 of earnings at age 45 the annuity value of its retirement account could vary by more than 20 percentage points depending on whether the real rate of return in the period is significantly above average

the 95th percentile of likely returns medianearning couple saving 8 of earnings per year would have retirement account balance that if converted to an annuity could replace 180 of its average preretirement household earnings in other words if they converted their entire retirement account to an annuity the income would be almost twice their average household earnings in the five years preceding retirement if investment returns during that period were significantly below average at the 5 th percentile of likely returns the annuity value of their retirement account would replace only about onet hird of the couples preretirement average earnings the account balance that household would accumulate over 40 years of investing during period of belowaverage returns would be much less than the amount that the couple would have accumulated if theyd had the good fortune to have invested during period of aboveaverage rates of return nevertheless in our simulations the annuity value of an account accumulated by contributing 8 of earnings over 40 years of very low investment returns was almost the same as the annuity value of an account accumulated by contributing 8 of earnings over 20year period of well aboveaverage investment returns workers who begin to save at young age can accumulate substantial retirement assets even in periods of low returns and they will be far better off

would be lower than that of an unmarried householder purchasing singlelife annuity24 if over 30year investment period total rates of return on stocks and bonds were at their historical median marriedcouple with median ea rnings that contributed 8 of pay annually to retirement plan invested in mix of stocks and bonds could accumulate an estimated 468000 in 2004 dollars by age 65 this is almost twice as much as the estimated 247000 that would be accumulated by an unmarried householder with median earnings contributing 8 of pay to retirement account over the same period nevertheless the annuity value of the retirement account expressed as percentage of preretirement earnings would be higher for the unmarried householder than for the marriedcouple household see figure 7 the higher earnings replacement rate for the unmarried householders is due largely to the fact that in these examples the annuity estimates are based on joint and 100 survivor annuity for the marriedcouple household and singlelife annuity for the unmarried householder if the marriedcouple household elected to purchase an annuity without survivor benefit ie singlelife annuity based on the age of the

six types of household as defined by household earnings and the marital status of the householder table 6 shows the estimated retirement account balance at age 65 resulting from annual contributions equal to 8 of pay over periods of 20 30 and 40 years depending upon whether the average real rate of return on investment during that period was at the 95th 50th or 5th percentile of likely returns for example medianearning marriedcouple h ousehold that began contributing 8 of pay annually at age 35 to retirement account invest ed in mix of stocks and bonds could expect on average to have accumulated 468000 in 2004 dollars in its retirement account by age 65 this is the amount that would result if investment returns over those 40 years fell in the middlethe 50th percentileof the likely range of possible returns based on the distribution of real rates of total return on stocks and bonds that occurred between 1926 and 2005 if rates of return over the investment period were well above averageat the 95th percentile of likely returnsthe households estimated retirement account balance at age 65 would be 961000 in 2004 dollars httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33845g20g142g157g146g155g142

if the average rate of return earned over the investment period was well below averageat the 5th percentile of likely rates of returnthe household would have accumulated just 214000 in 2004 dollars by age 65 table 6 also displays two relative measures of retirement savings the ratio of the account balance to the households average earnings in the five years before the householder reached age 65 and the annuity value of the retirement account balance at age 65 for example the estimated retirement account balance at age 65 of 468000 i n 2004 dollars for medianearning married couple household that contributed 8 of pay annually to retirement account over 40 years beginning at age 25 would be equal to 70 times the households average earnings in 2004 dollars during the five years when the householder was ages 60 to 64 based on current interest rates if this amount were converted to level joint and 100 survivor annuity it would replace an estimated 42 of the households average earnings in the five years that the householder was ages 60 to 64 in our simulations given an annual retirement plan contribution equal to 8 of earnings the ratio of account balances at age 65 to household earnings from ages 60 to 64 ranged from low of 14 times earnings for lowearning marriedcouple and unmarried households that begin to save at age 45 and invest during period of low investment returns to high of 31times earnings for highearning unmarried householder who begins saving at age 25 and invests during period of high investment returns replacement rates ranged from low of 10 for

of social security and the declining prevalence of definedbenefit pensions that provide guaranteed lifelong income have put much of the responsibility for preparing for retirement directly on workers saving for retirement will be especially important for workers who are not included in definedbenefit pension where they are employed which includes about 80 of all workers in the private sector even among those who are saving for retirement retirement account balances are generally low when compared to household earnings as the data displayed in table 3 showed the median account balance in 2004 among marriedcouple households headed by persons 55 to 64 years old was equal to just 16 times the median earnings of those households among unmarried householde rs between the ages of 55 and 64 median retirement savings were equal to just 14 times median earnings the low rate of personal saving in the united states and the lack of any retirement savings accounts among millions of american households indicate that there is need for greater awareness among the public about the importance of setting aside funds to prepare for life after they have stopped working most workers in the united states will need to begin saving more of their income if they wish to maintain standard of living in retirement comparable to that which they enjoyed while working the alternatives would be to work longer or to greatly reduce their standard of living in retirement employers in the united states are not required to offer pensions to their employees and workers are not required to save for retirement because both of these activities are voluntary most policy proposals for boosting workers retirement saving are intended to make workers more aware of the importance of saving and to make the act of saving easier for both workers and employers although most defined contribution plans continue to require employees to elect to participate growing number of plans have adopted automatic rollment of eligible workers and the pension protection act of 2006 pl 109280 included provis ions intended to encourage more employers

another option to boost retirement saving would be to promote greater use of payroll deduction for individual retirement accounts iras because iras are not employersponsored plans there would be little administrative burden for employers and payroll deduction would be an easy way for workers to send money directly to retirement account26 the pension protection act also made permanent the retirement savings tax credit originally enacted in 2001 and provided for indexing the income thresholds over which the credit is phased out some policy analysts have suggested that if this credit were made refundable it would encourage more lowerincome workers to save for retirement27 another proposal would disregard amounts in retirement savings plans for purposes of determining eligibility for certain means tested federal aid programs on the employer side it has been proposed to give employers tax credit for the cost of maintaining retirement savi ngs plans to encourage more employers to offer such plans with respect to promoting secure lifetime income for retirees policy proposals have focused on providing incentives for people to purchase life annuities for example under one proposal individuals would not pay federal taxes on onehalf of the income generated by annuities that promise lifetime payments there would be an annual limit of 20000 on the amount of annuity income that an individual could exclude from federal taxes each year another policy option would be to require employers that offer defined contribution plans to offer retiring workers the opportunity to purchase an annuity through the employer as is currently required of defined benefit plans g5g152g151g140g149g158g156g146g152g151g561 are americans saving adequately for retirement there is simple answer to this question because circumstances vary so greatly from one household to another data from the federal reserve boards survey of consumer finances indicate that fewer than half of all working households participated in an employersponsored retirement savings plan in 2004 and fewer than third of all working households owned an individual retirement account for this report we estimated the amounts that marriedcouple househol ds and unmarried householders with high medium and low earnings could accumulate in their retirement accounts by age 65 depending on the percentage of earnings that they save the age at which they begin saving and the total real rate of return in stock and bond markets during the period that they are investing two of these three variablesthe contribution rate and the age at which they begin to saveare more or less under the control of the worker as the results displayed in figure 5 illustrate starting to save while young and doing so consistently every year is perhaps the single most effective way to assure that one reaches retirement with adequate savings for household with median annual earnings even relatively 25 see crs report

median likely rate of return grow over 40 years to an amount that if converted to an annuity would replace more than half of the households average preretirement earnings at 10 contribution rate the annuity value of the account would replace more than 90 of the households preretirement earnings assuming rates of return are at the median it is also important to note that our estimates are based on the assumption that the household contributes to re tirement plan every year for period of 20 30 or 40 years because of interruptions in employment unexpected expenses and other reasons many households do not contribute to retirement plan every year unfortunately we cannot safely assume that rates of return over the next 20 30 or 40 years will be average in our analysis we simulated the variability in rates of return through monte carlo process we found that although the average annual rate of total return over 30 years on the mixed portfolio of stocks and bonds that we chose for our analysis would be 55 there was 5 chance that the real rate of return would be 17 or lower and 5 chance that it would be 93 or higher this variability in rates of return is something over which workers have control and which will inevitably lead to some uncertainty in retirement planning while it may be easier for workers to focus on what they are likely to accumulate in their retirement accounts on average ignoring the variability of investment rates of return could lead to poor decisions that might be avoided if workers were better informed about the way that variability in investment rates of return can affect their retirement savings over time worker who is told that the most likely real rate of return on his or her investments is 55 might save more or less than if he or she were told that the most likely real rate of return will be between 17 and 93 both statements are true but the second more clearly conveys the uncertainty that characterizes any estimate of likely future rates of return on investment
