embodied in the accountability provisions of the elementary and secondary education act esea as ame nded by the child left behind act of 2001 nclb pl 107110 is that of adequa yearly progress ayp in order to be eligible for grants under esea title i part education for disadvantaged pupils states must implement ayp polic ies applicable to all public schools and local educational agencies leas based primarily on the scores of pupils on state assessments schools or leas that fail to meet ayp standards for two or more consecutive years face variety of consequences the primary model of ayp under the nc lb is group status model such models set threshold levels of performan ce expressed as percentage of pupils scoring at proficient or higher vel on state assessments of reading and mathematics that must be met by ll pupils as group as well as pupils in designated demographic subgroups in or der for public school or lea to make ayp current law also includes sec ondary model of ayp safe harbor provision under which school or lea ma make ayp if among pupil groups who did not meet the primary ayp standar d the percentage of pupils who are not at the proficient or high er level declines by at least 10 substantial interest has been expressed in the us of individualcohort growth models to meet the ayp requirements of the nclb such ayp models are not consistent with certain stat utory provisions of the nclb as those were originally interpreted by the us partment of education ed however under pilot program ed has approved app lications from 11 states to be granted waivers to use growth models to make ayp determinations and proposed regulations would allow an unlimited number of states to apply fo r this option many proponents of growth models of ayp see them as being more fair and accurate than the models generally employed to meet nclb requirements primarily because they recognize the fact that different schools and pupils have different starting points in their achievement levels and recognize progress bein g made at all levels growth models of ayp have the disadvantage of implicitly setting lower initial thresholds or expectations for some pup ils although any growth model consistent with the nclb would need to incorporate the acts ultimate goal of all pupils at proficient or higher leve l of achievement by 20132014 ch models used currently in state nonnclb accountability plans do not include such goals and might allow disadvantaged schools and pupils to remain at relatively low levels of achievement for significant periods of time growth models of ayp may be quite complicated and may address the accountab ility purposes of the nclb less directly and clearly than the currently statutory ayp models the authorization for esea programs expired

this report will be updated re gularly to reflect major legislative developments and av ailable information substantial interest has been expressed in the use of growth models to meet the ayp requirements of the nclb such ayp models are not consistent with certain statutory provisions of the nclb as they were originally interpreted by the us department of education ed in n ovember 2005 the secretary of education announced growth model pilot program under which up to ten states would be allowed to use growth models to make ayp determinations for the 20052006 school year in december 2007 the secretary lifte d the cap on the number of states that could participate in the growth model p ilot and regulations published in october 2008 incorporate this expanded policy thus far the applications of 11 states httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs2 north carolina tennessee arkansas laware florida iowa ohio alaska arizona michigan and missour i have been approved to participate in the pilot program this report discusses growth and other models for ayp determinations and analyzes issues related to the use of growth models to meet the ayp requirements of the nclb the range of possible models for measuring ayp for schools and leas while ayp definitions or standards may vary in multitude of respects their basic structure generally falls into one of three general categories the child left behind act statute as implemented by ed currently places primary emphasis on one of these models while incorporating second model as an explicitly authorized alternative in recent years critics of cu rrent policy have increasingly focused their attention on third model of ayp which is the prima ry topic of this report the three basic structural forms fo r ayp of schools or leas are the group status successive group improvement and individualcohort growth models in the context of these terms group or subg roup in the case of detailed demographic categories refers to collection of pupils that is identified by their grade level and usually other demographic characteris tics eg race ethnicity or economic disadvantage as of point in time such as all hispanic 3rd grade pupils enrolled in school or lea in particular year the actual pupils in group may change substantially or even comple tely from one year to the ne xt in contrast cohort refers to collection of pupils in which the same pupils are followed from yearto year such as the hispanic pupils who entered 3rd grade in school lea or state in fall 2002 and have been followed as cohort since that time the key characteristic of the group status model is fixed annual measurable objective amo or required threshol d level of achievement that is the same for all pupil groups schools and leas statewid in given subject and grade level under this model performance at point in time is compared to benchmark at that time with direct consideration of changes over previous period the key characteristic of the successive group improvement model is focus on the rate of change in achievement in subject area from one year to the next among groups of pupils in grade level at school or lea eg the percentage of this years 5th grade pupils in school who are at proficient or higher level in mathematics compared to the percentage of last years 5th grade pupils who were at proficient or higher level of achievement finally the key characteristic of the individualcohort growth model is focus on the rate of change over time in the level of achievement among cohorts of the same pupils such models may compare current performance of specific pupils or cohorts to past performance or may pr oject future performance of pupilscohorts based on past changes in their perfo rmance level growth models are longitudinal based upon the tracking of the same pupils as they progress through their k12 education careers while the progress of pupils is tracked individually results arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs3 4 there is variant of the group status model sometimes called an index model under which partial credit would be attributed to performance improvements below the proficient level eg from below basic to basic 5 scores may be combined for pupils in all assessed grade levels in schooltypically aggregated when used for acc ountability purposes aggregation may be by demographic group by school or lea or othe r relevant characteristics in general growth models would give credit for mee ting steps along the way to proficiency in ways that status model typically does not4 to help illustrate the basic differences among these three ayp models simplified examples of basic aspects of each are described below the reader should keep in mind many other variations of these model types are possible group status model such as the current primary model of ayp under the nclb described further below establishes series of threshold levels or amos which are percentages of pupils scoring at proficient or higher level of achievement on state standards based assessments of reading and mathematics these amos have starting point and series of increases toward in the case of the nclb an ultimate goal of 100 of pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement covering multiyear period for the nclb the period of 20012002 through 20132014 these amos are specific to each grade level and subject reading or mathematics at which state assessments are administered key feature of the amos in this model is that they are the same for all pupil groups the all pupil group as well as each of the demographic subgroups specified under the nclb pupils with disabilities pupils from low income families pupils with limited glish proficiency etc this model focuses solely on current year performance of the pupils currently enrolled in each schoollea for every grade level at which assessments are administered5 comparisons to previous year performance play role in ayp determinations an example of simplified successive group improvement model is the secondary safe harbor model authorized under the nclb under this model as embodied in the nclb the basic structure of the ayp system is the same as described above but the primary focus shifts to the change from the previous year for each group assessed if any specified demographic group fails to meet the primary group status ayp criteri on described above the school or lea is still deemed to meet ayp standards if the percentage of pupils scoring below the proficient level declines by 10 in comparison to the previous year for pupils in that grade level and demographic group thus the primary focus shifts to the change in achievement from the previous year comparing for example this years pupils from lowincome families in the particular schoolleagrade level to last years pupils from lowincome families enrolled in that schoolleag rade level ie the pupils arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs4 6 one state massachusetts has injected partial growth element into its safe harbor provision in that state sc hool or lea that fails to meet the standard ayp requirements still makes ayp if the number of pupils in relevant groups and subjects scoring below the proficient level declines by 10 or more from the previous year or declines sufficiently to put them on track toward proficiency by the end of the 20132014 school year 7 see for example issues in the design of accountability systems by robert l linn cse technical report 650 national center for rese arch on evaluation st andards and student testing april 2005in the same demographic category but are not necessarily the same pupils6 an individualcohort growth model begins by tracking the performance of individual pupils over multiple at least two years the performance of pupils in the same grade level who share relevant demographic characteristic s within school lea or the state overall may be combined into cohort the change in scores for this cohort is compared to standard of expected growth the expected growth may be either datadriven eg the statewide average rate of achievement growth for all pupils or the predicted rate of growth statewide for pupils with similar demographic characteristics or policydriven multiyear growth path sufficient to meet an ultimate goal such as the nclb requirement for all pupils to reach proficient or higher level of achievement by 20132014 school or lea is deem ed to meet ayp requirements if the achievement growth of each relevant cohort of pupils meets the expected level of growth the path of expected growth as well as the starting points for the grow th path will likely differ for each relevant demographic group of pupils some growth mode ls often called valueadded models also incorporate variety of statistical controls adju stments to account fo r pupil demographic characteristics or past achievement to sharpen the focus on estimating the impact of specific teachers schools or leas on pupil achievement and to measure pupil growth against predicted growth for pupils with similar characteristics but these are not essential elements of ll growth models proponents ar gue that such models with their controls for background characteristic s and past learning maximize the focus on factors that are under the c ontrol of teachers and other sc hool staff the tennessee valueadded assessment syst em tvaas is one specific form of growth model that uses pupil background ch aracteristics previ ous performance and other data as statistical controls in order to focus on estimating the specific effects of particular schools districts teach ers or programs on pupil achievement7httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs5 8 it has occasionally been said that the ayp systems approved by ed for few states before initiation of the growth model pilot announ ced in november 2005 incorporate growth elements however such claims appear to be based primarily on the inclusion in the ayp systems of pupil achievement indexes ie the index models referred to in the first footnote under the section the range of po ssible models for measuring ayp for schools and leas above that give partial credit for achievement gains below the proficient level comparing this years pupil groups with last years they do not meet the defin ition of growth model as used in this report 9 this is determined by ranking all public sc hools of the relevant grade level statewide according to their percentage of pupils at th proficient or higher level of achievement based on all pupils in each school and settin g the threshold at the point where onefifth of the schools weighted by enrollment have been counted starting with the schools at the lowest level of achievement 10 under program regulations 34 cfr 20016c2 the starting point may vary by grade span eg elementary middle etc and subjectthe ayp models explicitly authorized by the nclb the primary model of ayp under the nclb currently is group status model as noted in the example above group status models set as their amos threshold levels of performance expressed specifica lly in terms of the percentage of pupils scoring at proficient or higher advanced level on state assessments of reading and mathematics these amos must be t by any school or lea both overall and with respect to all relevant pupil subgr oups in order to make ayp whatever the schools or leas starting point for the multiyear period covered by the accountability policy or performance in the pr evious year this amo uniform bar is applicable to all pupil subgroups of sufficient size to be considered in ayp determinations the threshold levels of achievement are to be set separately for reading and math and may be set separa tely for each level of k12 education elementary middle and hi gh schools for example it might be required that 45 or more of the pupils in any of stat public elementary schools score at the proficient or higher level of achievement in readin g in order for school to make ayp8 the initial minimum starting point for the uniform bar is to be the greater of the percentage of pupils at the proficient or advanced level of achievement for the lowestachieving pupil subgroup in the ba year 20012002 or b the percentage of pupils at the proficient or advanced level of ach ievement for the lowest performing quintile 5th9 of schools statewide in the base year10 the uniform bar must generally be raised at least once ever three years although in the initial period it must be increased after more than two years such group status models attempt to emphasize the importance of meeting certain minimum levels of achievement for all pupil groups schools and leas and argu ably apply consistent expectations to all pupil groupshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs6 11 this secondary ayp provision of nclb is sometimes referred to as growth model but it is not consistent with that term as used in this report in part because it is based on pupil group averages and not the longitudinal or projected performance of individual pupils or cohort of such pupils 12 as noted earlier under the accountab ility policy approved for use in massachusetts school or lea also meets the safe harbor re quirement if the number of pupils in relevant groups and subjects scoring below the proficient level declines sufficiently to put them on track toward proficiency by the end of the 20132014 school year 13 under nclb state ayp systems must in clude at least one indicator other than achievement test scores for senior high schools the additional indicator must be the graduation rate typical additional indicat or for elementary and middle schools is the attendance rate 14 the senatepassed bill would have authorized states to use index systems with limited growthrelated element under an index syst em states could have combined different demographic groups of pupils with greater weight applied to pupils whose level of achievement was initially furthest below the proficient level the secondary model of ayp under the nc lb currently is the safe harbor provision an example of successive group improvement model11 this is an alternative provision under wh ich schools or leas that fail to meet the usual requirements may still be deemed to have made ayp if they meet certain other conditions school where aggregate achie vement is below th level required under the group status model descri bed above would still be d eemed to have made ayp through the safe harbor provision if among relevant pupil groups who did not meet the primary ayp standard th percentage of pupils who are not at the proficient or higher level in the school declines by at least 10 not 10 percentage points12 and those pupil groups make progress on at leas t one other academic indicator included in the states ayp standards13 for example if the standard amo is 45 and school fails to meet ayp because of th performance of one pupil group eg the mathematics scores of white pupils and the percentage of such pupils scoring at proficient or higher level the previous year was 30 then the school could still make ayp if the percentage of white pupils scorin g at proficient or higher level increases to at least 37 the 30 from the previous year plus 10 of 10030 or seven percentage points during debates over the adoption of nc lb in 2001 much of the attention was focused on successive group improve ment models of ayp not group status or individualcohort growth models both th senatepassed vers ion and the primary elements of the housepassed version of the bill hr 1 107th congress that became nclb embodied ccessive group improvement concepts of ayp14 relatively little attention wa s paid to individualcohor t growth models during consideration of nclb the group status model adopted by the conferees on hr 1 as the primary ayp concept under nclb substantially rese mbled the prenclb ayp definition used in the state of texas possible reasons why relatively little atte ntion was devoted to individualcohort growth models of ayp durin g consideration of nclb in 2001 include the fact that they were used by few states at the time to meet accountab ility requirements under either state law or under federal law pr eceding nclb the improving americashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs7 15 during the immediate prenclb period fe w states identified schools as failing to make ayp if they failed to meet expected growth in performance based on factors such as initial achievement levels and statewide average achievement trends the growth models used by states in the prenclb period were generally much closer in structure to the successive group improvement model as described in this report than to the individualcohort growth model 16 as noted earlier the safe harbor provis ion requires 10 reduction in the percentage of relevant pupils whose performance is below the proficient level for pupil group currently at 20 this would require an increa in 8 percentage points to 28 but for group currently at 80 this would require an increase of only 2 percentage points to 82 17 see issues in the design of accountability

office gao report published in july 2006 child left behi nd act states face challenges measuring academic growth that educations initiatives may help address gao06661schools act of 199415 the implicit demand for resources both extensive pupil level longitudinal data systems and analytical capacity in state educational agencies their relative complexity compared to the status and improvement models their assumed requirement for annua l pupil assessments throughout all or at least most of pupils k12 education careers which very few states had in place and the difficulty although not the impossibility of integrating into growth models an ultimate goal of all pupils at proficient or higher level of achievement by specified time the remainder of this report will fo cus almost totally on individualcohort growth models of ayp versus group status models and little fu rther attention will be paid to successive group improvement models of ayp this is primarily because the safe harbor alternative model of ayp is already available unlike the individualcohort growth mode l alternative and becau it has reportedly been invoked relatively infrequently some analysts argue the safe harbor provision is used infrequently because it sets very ch allenging standard at least for pupil groups that are currently at relatively low levels of proficiency16 and that the required 10 reduction in pupils below the proficient level should be reduced perhaps to 3417 growth model alternatives to nclbs statutory models of ayp for the sake of simplicity in the remainder of this report we will refer to the three ayp models by the abbreviated titles of status improvement and growth models in recent years as experience with nclb requirements for ayp has been accumulated within states leas and school s increased attention has been devoted by some analysts and administrators to the possible use of growth models of ayp under nclb18 while there are many possible variations of growth models they would all appear to violate certain explic it statutory provisions of nclb at least as those were originally interp reted by ed at the least growth model would involve the use of differing amos fo r different pupils and this w ould violate the uniform barhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs8 19 it is sometimes said that index systems incorporated into the ayp standards of three states massachusetts minnesota and oklahoma constitute growth model elements allowed by ed under current law however th distinctive element of these ayp standards is the use of indexes that give partial credit for achievement gains at levels below proficient such as moving from below basic to basic such provisions have been allowed by ed at least for these three states with the add itional criteria that ayp must be calculated separately for each required subject area and subgroup incorporate the goal of all pupils at proficient or higher level of achieveme nt by 20132014 not give extra credit for moving beyond proficient have amos and not allow school to make ayp without increasing the number of students at the proficient level over the previous year 20 see

model of nclb19 growth models would also provide for different starting points or impr ovement paths for different pupils growth model pilot in november 2005 the secretary of ducation announced growth model pilot program under which up to 10 states would be allowed to use growth models to make ayp determinations for the 2005 2006 or subsequent school years20 in december 2007 the secretary lifted the cap on the number of states that could participate in the growth model pilot and regu lations published in october 200821 incorporate this expanded policy the models proposed by th states must meet at least the following criteria in addition to variety of criteria applicable to all state ayp policies that is measure achievement separately in readinglanguage arts and mathematics they must incorporate an ultimate goal of all pupils reaching proficient or higher level of achievement by the end of the 2013 2014 school year achievement gaps among pupil groups must decline in order forschools or leas to meet ayp standards annual achievement goals for pupils must not be set on the basis of pupil background or school characteristics annual achievement goals must be based on performance standards not past or typical performance growth rates the assessment system must produce comparable results from grade tograde and yeartoyear and the progress of individual students must be tracked within state data system in addition applicant states must have their annual assessments for each of grades 38 approved by ed and these assessments must have been in place for at least one year previous to implementa tion of the growth models in january 2006 ed published peer review guidance for growth model pilot applications22 in general this guidance ela borates upon the requirements described above with special emphasis on the follo wing pupil growth targets may nothttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs9 consider their raceethnicity socioeconomic status school ayp status or any other nonacademic factor b growth targets ar to be established on the basis of achievement standards not typical growth patterns or past achie vement and c the state must have longitudi nal individual pupil data system capable of tracking pupils as they move among schools and leas within the state the requirements for growth models of ayp under this pilot are relatively restrictive the models must be consistent with the ultima goal of all pupils at proficient or higher leve l by 20132014 major goal of the statutory ayp provisions of nclb more significantly they must incorporate comparable annual assessments at least for each of grades 38 plus at l east one senior high school year and those assessments must be approved by ed and in place for at least one year before implementation of the growth model further all performance expectations must be individualized and the state must have an infrastructure of st atewide longitudinal database for individual pupils proposed models would ve to be structured around expectations and performan ce of individual pupils not demographic groups of pupils in school or lea although individual resu lts would have to be aggregated for the demographic groups designated in nclb two states north carolina and tennessee were initially approved by ed to use proposed growth models in making ayp determinations based on assessments administered in the 20052006 school year nine additional states arkansas delaware florida iowa ohio alaska arizona michigan and missouri have been approved to participate in the pilot program subsequently contingent in the cases of ohio and missouri on adoption of uniform minimum group size for all pupil groups the models for these st ates are briefly described below north carolina the north carolina policy does not actually provide for separate ayp model but rath er the addition of projection component to the current group status model if the achievement level of nonprof icient pupil is on trajectory toward proficiency within four years then the pupil is added to the proficient group all other provisions of the current group status and successive group improvement models w ould continue to apply thus the ultimate goal becomes by the end of the 20132014 schoo l year all pupils will be either at proficient or higher level or on fouryear trajector toward proficiency without use of confidence intervals the trajectory cal culations will be made for pupils in the 3rd through 8th grades sea staff estimate that 4 of the schools in north carolina that failed to meet ayp standards based on 20042005 assessment results would have met ayp standards if this growth model had been in place tennessee under the tennessee policy schools and leas will have two options for meeting ayp meeting either the ayp standards under the group status or successive group improvement models of current law or meeting ayp standards according to projection model unde r the projection model pupils are deemed to be at

provisions and using the states growth model school will meet ayp standard s if it qualifies us ing either method individual pupil performance will be tracked from one year to the next specified numbers of points up to 300 will be awarded based on chan ges if any in pupils performance level points will be awarded for partial move ment toward proficie ncy but the points awarded for movement to adva nced levels beyond proficienc will be the same as for movement to proficienc maintaining level of pr oficient or higher awards 300 points as well the average growth scores for schools and leas to meet ayp standards increase steadily until 20132014 by which time all pupils would be expected to achieve at pr oficient or higher level23 arkansas under the arkansas policy ayp will be calculated each year based on both statutory provisions and using the st ates growth model school will meet ayp standards if it qualifies using either method under the growth model pupils in grades 48 will be deemed to be proficient if they are on growth path toward proficiency by the end of 8th grade pupils already prof icient must be on path to continue to be proficient through grade 8 ie growth path criteria will be applied to all pupils proficient and nonproficient individua l annual proficie ncy thresholds and growth increments are designed to enable nonproficient students to reach proficiency by grade 8 and pr oficient students to continue to be proficient mobile pupils will be associated with the school they attended at th time of assessment administration in the previous year florida under the florida model ayp w ill be determined separately for each pupil subgroup in each school or lea ie not fo r schools or leas as whole using the statutory models status and safe harbor plus growth model the school or lea will meet ayp standards if each pupil subgroup makes ayp using one of the three models floridas growth model will be essentially the same as the current status model except that proficient pupils will include bot h those currently scoring at proficient or higher level plus those who are on an individual path toward proficiency within three years the combined percentage of pupils rated proficient will be compared to the standard amo the model will be applied to ayp determinations for grades 3 10 with some modifications for pupils in gr ade 3 in its

schools without out of total of 3200 schools iowa under the iowa model pupil tests score ranges below proficient have been divided into 3 categories hi margin marginal and weak student who rises from one of these levels to higher level and has not prev iously attained the higher level will be deemed to have met adequate yearly growth ayg ayg is considered to be more than typical years growth over oneyear period for schools and leas that have not met ayp t hough application of the standard status and safe harbor models students making ayg will be added to those scoring proficient or above nd this combined total will be us ed in determining whether the school or lea makes ayp for the year st udents scoring below th proficient level must continue to move to higher subproficient level each year in order to be included in the combined proficient ayg student count this implies that students beginning at the weak level must reach proficiency within three years those beginning at marginal must become proficient within two years and those beginning at hi marginal must reach proficiency within one year by 2014 the growth model would longer be used and all pupils will be expected to achieve at proficient or higher level confidence intervals will continue to be applied to determine whether the combined proficient ayg student count meets the required threshold to make ayp this growth model will be applied statewide to test scores for grades 38 and 11 and to grades 9 and 10 as well in the leas that administer the iowa tests in those grades the iowa growth model does not currently include students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who take the iowa alternate assessment ohio ohio has adopted variation of the projection or on track to proficiency approach that is common to the models for all of the other participating states except delaware and iowa after pplication of the standard status and safe harbor models if any pupil group fails to meet ayp then determination will be made if sufficient proportion of pupils in the group is on track toward meeting the required proficiency threshold as of target grade in the case of elementary and middle schools the target grade will be eith er the grade level following the highest grade offered by the school ie for k5 school the 6th grade or 4 grades beyond the pupils current grade whichever comes fi rst in the case of high school pupils would have to be on track to ward proficiency by the 11th grade pupils currently scoring at proficient level but who are projected to be below the proficient level by the target grade will not be considered to be proficient in ohios projection model student achievement trajectories will be projected on an individual basis projections will be based on past test results in all subjects but with greater weight applied to past test results in the same subject for each pupil alaska under alaskas growth model pupils will be included in the proficient group if their achievement level trajectory is on growth path toward proficiency within 3 additional years for pupils in grad 49 or within 2 additional years for pupils in grade 10 alaska currently has standardsbased assessments for grades beyond 10 pupils in the 3rd grade the earliest grade at which state assessments are administered will be measured based on status only not growth the growth modelhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs12 24 most states use confidence intervals in th eir ayp determinations however in most cases the confidence intervals are applied to group average percentages of students scoring proficient or above not individual student scoreswill not apply to pupils with disabilities who ta ke alternate assessments although alaska had proposed that confidence interv als be applied at relatively low level 68 under the growth model the state ag reed to drop this in the approved version in its application alaska estimated that approximately 13 of pupils currently not proficient are on track towa rd proficiency under the rms of the states growth model arizona in arizona the growth model will be applicable to pupils in grades 48 only pupils will be included in the pr oficient group if thei r achievement level trajectory is on growth path toward pr oficiency within three years or by 8th grade whichever comes first pupils in the 3rd grade the earliest grade at which state assessments are administered will be measured based on status only not growth unlike some other states participating in the growth model pilot pupils with disabilities who take the states alternate assessment aimsa will be included in the arizona growth model such pupils with disabilities who move up one performance level ie from f alls far below to approaches or from approaches to meets the proficiency standard will be deemed to have met their growth target missouri in missouri schools and leas w ill first be evaluated under the status model of ayp if the school or lea doe s not make ayp under that model the growth model will be applie d if the school or lea s till does not make ayp after application of the growth model then safe harbor calculation will be applied if the school or lea does not meet any of thes 3 criteria then it fails to make ayp in the growth calculation it will be determined whether students currently scoring below proficient level are on track to be proficient within either four years or by 8th grade whichever occurs first if so they will be added to the number of students currently scoring at proficient or higher level students in grades 3 and 8 will be evaluated on the basis of the status model and safe harbor only grade 3 scores will be used as the baseline for growth trajectory calculations confidence intervals will be applied to growth model calculations only the current status and safe harbor models will used for ayp determinations fo r grades 912 students with disabilities including those taking the states alternate assessment for students with the most severe cognitive disabilities will be included in the growth model applying trajectories and achievement levels associated with either the regular or alternate assessments michigan in michigan the approved growth model provides third option for deeming student achievement to be proficient for purpos of ayp determinations currently michigan students are deemed to be proficient if their achievement test scores are at proficient or advanced level or if the sc ores of individual students are within 2 standard errors of measurement in effect 95

adds third category of students on trajectory towa rd proficiency to determine whether students are on trajectory toward proficiency each of the four proficiency leve ls not proficientbelow basi c partially proficientbasic proficient and advanced is divided into three sublevels low middle high similar but slightly different procedures are applied to michigans alternate assessment for students with mild cognitive impairment the growth model does not cover high school students or stude nts with disabilities taking alternate assessments who have moderate or severe cognitive impairment if students performance improves over the previous year by number of sublevels such that if the improvement continued at the same rate in the future they would reach proficiency within three years they are counted as being on trajectory toward proficiency confidence intervals will not be applied to the growth model determinations thus the number of students deemed prof icient will be the total of students scoring proficient or above plus students on trajectory to proficiency plus students provisionally proficient if this number of students divided by total students tested meets or exceeds the annual measurable obj ective then ayp is met with respect to the subject and student group in question because many students may meet both the trajectory toward proficiency and the provisi onally proficient criteria it will first be determined whether students are on traj ectory then whether any remaining non proficient students meet the provisionally proficie nt criterion it is estimated that use of the growth model will add only minima lly 0713 to the number of students already deemed to be proficie nt or provisiona lly proficient most of the growth models appr oved by ed thus far are based upon supplementing the number of pupils scoring at proficient or higher level with those who are projected to be at proficient level within limited number of years nine of the eleven approved models follow this general approach among these states distinction may be made be tween seven states north carolina arkansas florida alaska arizona missouri and michigan that combine currently proficient pupils with those not proficient who are on track toward profic iency and two states tennessee and ohio that consider only pr ojected proficiency levels for all pupils ie currently proficient pup ils who are not on track to re main proficient are counted as not proficient in cont rast the models used by two other states delaware and iowa focus on awarding credit for movement of

states that could participate in the growth model p ilot and regulations published in october 2008 incorporate this expanded policy issues regarding growth model alternatives to ayp models in the nclb statute why is there increased interest in gr owth models for determining ayp under nclb what might be the major advantag and disadvantages of growth models of ayp in comparison to status or imp rovement models these questions are addressed in the following pages are growth models of ayp more fair and accurate than status or improvement models many proponents of growth models fo r schoollea ayp see them as being more fair to both pupils and school staff and accurate than status or improvement models primarily because they can be designed to take into consideration the currently widely varying levels of achievement of different pupil groups growth models generally recogniz the reality that different schools and pupils have very different st arting points in their achieve ment levels and recognize progress being made at all vels eg from below basic to basic or from proficient to advanced giving credit for all improvements over previous performance growth models would likely increase th ability to attribute pupil achievement to their current school as opposed to thei r past schools or background characteristics especially but not only if controls and or predicted growth elements are included in the model they more directly meas ure the effect of schools on the specific pupils they serve over period of years attempting to track the movement of pupils between schools and leas rather than applying si ngle standard to all pupils in each state they have the ability to focus on the speci fic effectiveness of schools and teachers with pupils whom they have actually taught for multiple years rather than the change in performance of pupil groups among whom there has usually been substantial amount of mobility they can directly s well as indirectly adjust for nonschool influences on achievement comparing the same students across years and reducing errors due to student mobility proponents of growth mode ls often argue that status models of ayp in particular make sc hools and leas accountable for f actors over which they have little control and that status models focu s insufficiently on pupil achievement gains especially if those gains are below the thre shold for proficient performance or gains from proficient to an adva nced level status models such as the current primary model of ayp under nclb might even cr eate an undesirable in centive for teachers and schools to focus their attention at l east in the short run on pupils who are only marginally below proficient level of achievement in hopes of bringing them above that sole key threshold rather than the most disadvantaged pupils whose achievement is well below the proficient level the cu rrent status model of ayp also confers nohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs15 credit for achievement increases above the pr oficient level that is bringing pupils from the proficient to the advanced level at the same time growth models of ayp have the significant disadvantage of implicitly setting lower thresholds or ex pectations for some pupil groups andor schools although any growth model deem ed consistent with nclb would likely need to incorporate that acts ultimate goal of all pupils at profic ient or higher level of achievement by 20132014 see below the majority of such models used currently or in the past do not include ch goals and tend to allow disadvantaged schools and pupils to remain at relatively low levels of achievement for considerable periods of time growth models of ayp may be quite complicated and may address the accountability purposes of nclb less directly and clearly than status or to lesser extent improvement models if the primary purpose of ayp is to determine whether schools and leas are succeeding at raising the achievement of their current pupils to challenging levels with those goals and expectations applied consistently to all pupil groups then the current provisions of nclb might more simply and directly meet that purpose than growth model alternatives pupil mobility among schools and leas is substantial and has important implications for all models of ayp howe ver its implications are multifaceted and do not necessarily favor par ticular ayp model growth models have the advantage of attempting to track pupils through longitudi nal data systems but if they thereby attribute the achievement of highly mob ile pupils among variety of schools and leas accountability is dispersed at the same time the presence of highly mobile pupils in the groups considered in dete rmining ayp under status and improvement models may seem unfair to school staff however th impact of such pupils in schoollevel ayp determina tions is limited by nclbs provision that pupils who have attended particular sc hool for less than one year need not be considered in such determinations are growth models of greater value than status or improvement models for purposes other than accountability growth models of ayp may offe r increased value for purposes other than meeting the school and lea accountab ility requirements of nclb these other purposes may include diagnosing pupil need s conducting educati onal research or pinpointing the specific impact of teachers schools or other educational resources on pupil achievement these advantages rive largely but not solely from the incorporation of longitudinal pupil track ing systems within growth models of course current law doe s not prevent the use of growth models under state authority as diagnosticresearchalterna tive accountability tool separate from the ayp and other requirements of nclb while the current statutory text and policy guidance associated with nclb discourage the use of separate state and federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs16 26 for example nclb provides that each par ticipating state shall demonstrate that the state has developed and is implementing single statewide state accountability system nevertheless several states have continued to administer separate accountability systems authorized under state law while also im plementing the ayp provisions of nclb 27 aimee guidera director of the data qu ality campaign as quoted in

about half of the states have statewide individual student record data sy stems necessary to implement growth models of ayp 29 this program is authorized by section 208 of the education sciences reform act of 2002 pl 107279 the authorized funding level is 80 million for fy2003 and such sums as continuedaccountability systems for schools and leas26 they are not prohibited in practice and separate accountability systems are cu rrently being used by several states alongside the ayp system re quired by nclb finally the usefulness of model of ayp for purposes other than accountability may be of limite d relevance to debate over whether such model should be used for the accountability purposes of nclb do states have sufficient resources to develop and implement growth models it is generally agreed that growth models of ayp are more demanding than status or improvement mode ls in several respects especially in terms of data requirements and analytical capacity for longitudinal data system sufficient to support growth model it is likely that stat would need to have pupil data systems incorporating at least the following 1 unique statewide student identifier 2 the ability to

students 5 student level gra duation and dropout data 6 statewide audit system27 although the availab ility of information on state data systems is insufficient to enable one to determine with precision how many states could or could not currently implement such models if they chose to do so it is very likely that growth models generally require resources and data systems that many states currently lack28 this concern is being addr essed in part through an ed program intended to help states design develop and implement statewide longit udinal data systems an initial appropriation of

academic growth within all subgroups specified by the child left behind act of 2001 there will also be an emphasis on encouraging data sharing among states while at the same time protecting the security and privacy of data are growth models consistent with nclbs ultimate goal most growth models used before initiation of eds growth model pilot or still used as part of statesp ecific accountability systems have not incorporated an ultimate goal such as the one under nclb that all pupils r each proficient or higher level of achieve ment by 20132014 nonnclb growth models have generally incorporated one of two ty pes of growth target the how much improvement is enough aspect of the mode l data drivenpredicted growth or b policy drivenrequired growth targets the first type of growth target has been most common while nclbs ultimate goal w ould represent growth target of the second variety with separate paths with presumably separate starting points for each relevant pupil cohort the models pproved thus far under eds growth model pilot arguably meet the ultimate goal re quirement however under some of these models pupils need onl be proficient or on track toward proficiency within limited number of years as of 20132014 would use of growth models likely reduce the number of schoolsleas identified as failing to meet ayp with the initial implementation of the provisions of nclb several thousand public schools and hundreds of leas have been identified each year as failing to meet state ayp standards31 it frequently appears to be implicitly assumed by potentially interested parties that widespr ead use of growth models of ayp wouldhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33032crs18 result in significantly smaller percentage s of schools and leas being identified as failing to meet ayp standards this view seems to be based largely on the assumption that differing starting points fo r various cohorts of pupils would involve lower starting points and initial amos fo r disadvantaged pupil groups reducing the number of schools or leas that fail to m eet ayp due to the performance of one or few of such demographic groups indeed it is easy to hypothesize that during the first few years of implementation of growth models of ayp required performance thresholds would be relatively low for disadvantaged pupil cohorts and fewer sc hools or leas would fail to meet ayp standards however if one assumes that any ayp model under nclb must meet that acts ultimate goal requirement with regular increases in amos leading toward the ultimate goal of all pupils at proficient or higher level by 20132014 any significant reduction in th number of schools or leas failing to make ayp would likely be temporary this is particularly true because we are already several years into nclbs presumed overall timeline of 20012002 the base year for ayp determinations to 20132014 of course if it is assumed that use of growth models somehow improves the productivity of schools and leas that is by improving motivation of pupils or teachers or by providing better diagnos tic data on pupil achie vement then it is possible that this would ultimately re duce the number of schoolsleas failing to meet ayp but there is currently direct proof that this would occur as noted earlier where estimates are available the growth models approved for use under eds pilot program would reduce the number of schools failing to meet ayp standards to relatively limited degree can growth models be applied at grade levels without annual assessments the value and usefulness of growth mode ls of ayp are highly dependent on regular flow of valid information on pupil achievement levels as result it is frequently assumed that growth models can be appropriately implemented only when achievement test results linked to c ontinuum of state content and performance standards are available at least annually this creates difficulties for implementing growth models across the entire k12 grade span since nclb requires the administration of state standardsbased asse ssments in each of grades 38 plus only one senior high school grade it may be possible to fully implement growth models only over grade ranges for which annual assessm ent results are available substantial difficulties might be presented by the large degree of variation in curriculum and frequently in assessments for senior high school pupils although that can present difficulties under any of the three types of ayp model
