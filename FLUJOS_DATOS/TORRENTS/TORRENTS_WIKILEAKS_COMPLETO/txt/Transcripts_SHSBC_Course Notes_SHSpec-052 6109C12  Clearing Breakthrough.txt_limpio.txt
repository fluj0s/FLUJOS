6109c12 shspec52 clearing breakthrough hubbard adds engram running to routine 3 gives some details of process sequences arcb processes 1 what have you been unable to tell an auditor 2 what has an auditor failed to do 3 what did an auditor do more details on goals running and ruds engram running is important in clearing because lrh has learned that somatic cannot be unburdened somatic is where it is at the tension and velocity that it is and it is nowhere else it is totally independent of all other incidents it discharges only as what it is and not as any lock and matter how thoroughly it has been unburdened it will come on with the same intensity when you find it where it is all the pcs hidden standards and ptps of long duration stem from the first engram you will contact after the prehav assessment generalized process has ever made those chronic somatics less when you run the engram the pcs ptp of long duration will vanish and that is the only way it will be solved the isness of the situation is in the time and place of the situation and nowhere else the engram necessary to resolve the case didnt resolve the case in 1950 because it was not on the goalterminal line of the pc it wasnt an earlier incident the engram necessary to resolve the case is on the goalterminal line of the pc so unless you found the goalterminal line of the pc the engrams arent going to reduce rapidly if youre not on the goalterminal line of the pc and hes not in valence youre in for 75 hours of reduction in running engrams in r3 the engrams run easily because theyre on the pcs goalterminal line youve got the pc in the valence that was the destructive valence of his case what has been solved is 1 how do you get pc in valence on an engram 2 how do you find an engram on the case that will run 3 what is the engram necessary to resolve the case the reason youve had trouble with engrams in the past is than they werent on the goalterminal line the pc was out of valence and the engrams were associated with other chains now this is all handled as long as the auditor has reality on what bank looks like if he has this reality hell know for instance that the pcs misemotion while running as engram stems from the engram not from what the auditor is doing and why you can get the pcs resistance to the forward motion of the action off the engram by running it backwards then the pc can confront more of it this data has nothing to do with occlusion of cases an occluded case is just one who is stuck in an occluded engram something with black field there is condition of pretended knowingness which can get in our road its super escape factor when the knowingness is too horrible and the notknowingness is too thick and the person feels too stupid about it hes likely to dream it up such that it will have nothing unknown about it you wont get any of these with the prehav technique the keynote of an engram is the fact that the pc knows nothing about it pretended knowingness will get in your road and youll buy garbage then one day youll invalidate pcs data but do run the engram dont jerk the pcs attention off the engram when hes got all the unknownnesses out of it has more somatics have him go through it few times to see if theres anything missing see if hes got sonic and all the other perceptions out of it dont try to force them to be there just note it so when youve run few more you can go back and run it perceptions are the last thing to turn on just be sure you get all the perceptions out of it eventually dont make it too real to the pc let it be comfortably real perception is something which turns off gradually somatics are right now
