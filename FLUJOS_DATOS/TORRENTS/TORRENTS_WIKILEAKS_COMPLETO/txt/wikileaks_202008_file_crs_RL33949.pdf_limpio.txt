being debated this issue is important to various stakehol ders particularly those w hose health property values and quality of life may be affected by such impacts the concerns of community members and local state and tribal agencies regarding environmental impacts have led to the delay and cancellation of some airport expansion projects to address these concerns airports ma be required to implement projects that would minimize the environmental impacts of their operations some of these projects qualify for federal funding fo r example in its fy2008 budget the faa requested 354 million to meet its environm ental stewardship goals projects funded under this category address the envi ronmental impacts of airports primarily to abate airport noise eg soundproofin g homes or purchasing noise barriers among other uses funds may be spent on projects to minimize water quality impacts eg funding projects that would control th discharge of deicing chemicals and to reduce airportcontrollable air emissions eg purchasing alternative fuel vehicles to replace the airports ground services equi pment funds also are authorized for researching new aircraft technology that

and water quality aircraft noise levels may affect property values or the quality of life of residents in nearby communities certain activities or projects to address airport environmental impacts may qualify for federal funding1 for example in its fy2008 budget the federal aviation administration faa requested 354 million to meet the agencys environmental stewardship goals2 among other uses those funds may be spent on projects to abate airport noise impacts eg soundproofing of residential homes purchases of noise barriers and monitors and relocation of pers ons or businesses to minimize water

environmental provisions in proposed legi slation to reauthorize faa programs this report does not discu ss the national or international environmental impacts of aviation in general therefore disc ussion of the aviation industrys potential contribution to global warming is not disc ussed however information about this issue is included in the for add itional information section below overview of airport environmental issues in the next 15 years air travel is projected to grow significantly4 as result airport development and expansion projects will likely become increasingly important potential challenge to the completion of these projects is community concern regarding airport nvironmental impacts airpor t operations involve range of activities that affect the environment including the operation of aircraft the operation of airpor t and passenger vehicl and airport ground service equipment gse cleaning and maintenance of airc raft gse and motor vehicles deicing and antiicing of aircraft and airfields fueling and fuel storage of aircraft and vehicles airport facility operations and maintenance and construction the environmental impacts of these activ ities may intensify if an airport is undergoing expansion in some cases befo re state or local agency will allow an airport to move forward with an expansi on project the airport authority must agree to implement certain environmental mitigation projects community concern regarding environmental impacts has cause d projects to be delayed or cancelled all airports regardless of size or cation are regulated to some degree under local state tribal or federal envir onmental requirements many of the environmental regulatory requirements applicable to noise water and air quality have been in effect

oil spill prevention planning and state and local agency directives to monitor and control air pollutionparticularly toxic air pollutants each of these issues is discussed below within the context of requirements applicable to noise water quality and air quality issues primarily the issues discussed in this report involve activities that are unique to ai rport operations eg deicing and aircraft noise environmental compliance requi rements commonly applicable to all industrial operations eg wa ste management pesticide us chemical use reporting are not discussed in this report 5 noise issues aviation noise may have negative impact on the quality of life and property values of members of surrounding commun ity direct health impacts of noise are more difficult to determine although the percentage of people affected by aircraft noise has been significantly reduced durin g the past 35 years by advancements in aircraft technology and noise abatement efforts6 aircraft noise is often the principal focus for community groups and larger non governmental organizations that oppose runway expansion despite improvements noise continues to be significant problem because the amount of air traffic is growing the number of airliners and corporate jets is increasing and airline traffic and noise is concentrated at small number of airports that are also likely to be among the largest airports7 an airport may use various approaches to address airport noise issues selected approaches and challenges to implementing them are summarized in table 1 each approach is potentially elig ible for federal funding httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33949crs4 table 1 selected approaches to addressing airport noise approach description challenges to implementation mitigation includes mechanisms for accommodatingliving with existing noise levels in certain areas adjacent to an airport such as the installation of sound proofing materials at nearby homes schools and hospitals and purchasing land buffers around the airport this approach addresses immediate needs of community affected by high levels of aircraft noise however some mitigation efforts eg soundproofing do not address issues associated with outdoor noise further the use of limited funds for shorttem benefits detracts from investments in longterm noise reduction technology land use restrictionsinvolves accommodating existing noise levels by establishing land use development restrictions based on noise exposure levels in certain areas adjacent to an airportairport authorities are often able only to recommend such restrictions not impose them on local zoning or land use planning commission federal guidelines exist but the federal government has authority to set or enforce standards local land use decisions take many factors into account including but not limited to considerations of aviation noise further land use restrictions are only as strong as the local agencys interest in enforcing them also this is not an option in areas where heavy development around the airport already exists operational includes the implementation of airportaircraft restrictions that will decrease or eliminate noise exposure such as restrictions on the use of certain runways limits on hours of airport operation implementation of certain departure and landing procedures eg continuous descent approaches cda or the use of specific flight paths to avoid populated areasmany operational noise abatement procedures may be easily implemented and require limited funding however operational restrictions may limit an airports capacity further contributing to airport congestion and travel delays and to higher airline operating costs the faas process for approving of operational procedures at 40 cfr 161 referred to as the part 161 process is complex legal challenges and judicial review of the process may significantly slow the process technological advancementsinvolves research into quieter aircraft technologyimplementation of quieter aircraft technology would minimize the need for funding mitigation measures or operational restrictions also increased fuel costs may make options that increase fuel efficiency and incidently decrease noise more attractive however incremental advancements in noise reduction are costly and have long lead times both as result of the time it takes to make improvements in aircraft noise levels and the long lifetimes of existing aircraft in the fleet source table prepared by the congressional research service crs based on review of various sources

primarily ca rried out by the national aeronautical and space administration nasa the faa focuses on assessing noise compatibility aircraft certification and regulatory issues although so development of aircraft noise modeling and assessment tools occurs within the faa 11 nas for greener skies p 15 12 deicing involves the removal of frost snow or ice from aircraft surfaces or from paved areas including runways taxiways and gate areas antiicing refers to the prevention of the accumulation of frost snow or ice on these same surfaces ultimately decisions regard ing mitigation measures an d operational changes are made by the airport authority in accordance with requirements of the state or local government land use restricti ons can be suggested by the airport authority but are implemented entirely at the discretion of local government8 the federal role is primarily to fund those efforts establish aircraft noise limits9 and fund research10 interested stakeholders ve debated for long time how funding dollars should be allocated airports are likely to pr efer funding short term operational and mitigation strategies to address immediate needs others argue that an increased proportion of federal funding should be directed toward research for example according to the nas the national aeronautical and space administration nasa has set technically feasible noise reduction goals but the level of funding for its research programs is too low to achieve the current goals on schedule or to remove noise as an impediment to the growth of aviation11 for more information on

npdes permit program basics httpcfpubepa govnpdeshomecfmprogram_id45 14 stormwater discharges are generated by runoff from land and impervious areas such as paved streets parking lots and building r ooftops during rainfall and snow events by running over contaminated surfaces stormw ater becomes polluted most stormwater discharges are considered point sources nd require coverage by an npdes permit 15 for more information see epas sto rmwater program web page httpcfp ubepagov npdeshomecfmprogram_id6 and crs report 97290 stormwater permits status of epas regulatory program by claudia copelandthe cwa prohibits any point source discrete conveyance such as drainage ditch pipe or othe r outfall from discharging pollutants into waters of the united states the primary mechanism for controlling pollutant discharges is through the administration of the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit program which is implemented in most cases by individual states13 the npdes permit program regulates discharges of stormwater14 and wastewater due to the nature of their outdoor operations and because airports are included in one of the industrial categor ies regulated under the npdes stormwater permitting program under the standa rd industrial classification code transportation by air all airports are required to have stormwater permit15 airports that discharge other wastewater such as from equipment maintenance andcleaning operations require an additional npdes wastewater permit discharges associated with stormwater often pose the greatest challenge to airport managers because airports may be spread out over wide surface area with majority of operations exposed to the elements for example the dallas forth worth international airport encompasse s 18000 square acres and has 62 stormwater outfalls controlling or monitoring every outfall is difficult the primary method for controlling stormwater discharges is the implementation of best management practi ces bmps that prevent or minimize the discharge of pollutants into water body g construction of stormwater retention pond to prevent stormwater drainage di rectly into receiving waters bmps appropriate for one airport ar not necessarily ppropriate for another factors that may affect permit requirements ie appropriate bmps include the local climate dry versus rainywet cold versus warm the type or size of adjacent wa ter bodies pollutants are diluted depending on the size of the wa ter body receiving the discharge eg creek or stream versus river or ocean the water quality of adjacent water bodies local permitting authorities consider existing pollutant levels when controlling airport discharges and airport size to comply with the clean water act most airport operators are particularly concerned about managing deicing chemicals and preventing oil spillshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33949crs7 16 the epa estimates that airports discharge approximately 21 million gallons of aircraft deicing fluids each year see epa office of water preliminary data summary airport deicing operations august 2000 availabl at http wwwepago vwaterscienceguide airportairportpdf 17 epa office

deicing and antiicing chemicals poses the greatest challenge to many airport operators th deicing and antiicing of aircraft and airfield surfaces is required by the faa to sure the safety of passengers however when performed without discharge controls in place airport deicing operations can result in environmental impacts16 discharges from deicing operations have the potential to cause fish kills algae blooms and contamination to surface or ground waters in addition to potential aquatic life and human health impacts from the toxicity of deicing and antiicing chemicals the biodegradation of propylene glycol or ethylene glycol ie the base chemical of deicing fluid in surface wate rs eg lakes rivers can greatly affect water quality including significant reduction in dissolved oxygen levels17 studies have also shown toxicological ffects of deicer solutions that cannot be attributed to either propylene glycol or ethylene glycol18 this has led to concern that these effects are attributable to unknown proprietary additives19 the environmental route and impact of these additives is not yet understood typically airlines are responsible for aircraft deicing and anti icing operations and airports are responsible for the deicing and antiicing of airfield pavement the airport is ultimately respons ible for managing the resu lting wastewater this responsibility is typically outlined in the airports stormwater permit as discussed above significant differences exist among airport npdes per mits for example local permitting authority may impose specific requirements such as restrictions as to where icing operations may occur requirement to use deicing collection units to vacuum deicing fluid prior to entering the storm water system or requirements to use monitoring equipment to ensure compliance with the permit other permits may simply allow the airport to discharge deicing fluids directly into an adjacent water body according to the epa the disparity in airport permitting requirements has led the agency to consider implementing national standards in the form of effluenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33949crs8 20 see the epas web page airport

to airport deicing would be designed to provide uniform guidance for npdes permit writers across the country thereby establishing baseline standard for all airports21 in 2004 the epa began to develop elgs for airport deicing operations initial estimates from the epa indicate that trea tment technology and pollution prevention practices could potentially reduce deicing discharges from the current level of 21 million gallons year to 4 million gallons year22 as stated previously many airports have strict permit provisions that specify the management of deicing chemicals othe rs have few controls those with few controls may be required to make capital improvements to comply with new permitting requirements at this stage co st estimates for the aviation industry as whole are not available the epa is currently collecting survey data from airports and air carriers and conducting detailed sampling programs the current work will be used to identify the best available technology that is economically achievable for treatment and discharge of spent deicing liquids th epa currently plans to publish proposed rule in december 2007 and to take final action by september 2009 fuel storage because airports need to store fuel onsite to refuel aircraft and airport ground service equipment most ai rports are required to develop spill prevention control and c ountermeasure spcc plan23 these requirements are designed to ensure that facilities that store oil have planned for and taken measures to prevent environmental damage resulting from oil spills an spcc plan is required to include operating procedures intended to prevent oil spills such as procedures to inspect tanks nd associated piping for leaks control measures installed to prevent spill from reaching navigable waters such as the construction of dike containment curb or pit around tank or tank farm and countermeasures to contain clean up and mitigate the effects of an oil spill that reaches navigable wate rs such as the presence of spill cleanup kit with sorbent booms or wipeshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33949crs9 24 required under 40 cfr 1128 25 airport mobile refuelers are vehicles that have bulk st orage container on board or towed by the vehicle designed or used solely to st ore and transport fuel for transfer into or from an aircraft ground service equipment or other oil storage container 26 final rule 71

wwwepagovemergenc iescontentspcc factsheet_mobile_refuelers_dec06htmas listed above one of the primary c ontrol measures required under the spcc requirements is the use of secondary cont ainment system for il storage containers such system must be large enough to mporarily hold the entire contents of the largest oil tank in the oil storage area in the event of breach in the system24 for example if tank farm had four 12000 gallon tanks and two 5000gallon tanks and was the storage location for 10 mobile re fueling trucks with 500gallon tanks the tank farm would be required to have secondary containment sufficient to hold the contents of the largest tank 12000 gallons when the epa proposed new spcc require ments in 2002 airport operators and the epa disagreed about the secondary containment requireme nts applicable to mobile airport refueling trucks25 in particular airport ope rators argued that it was impractical to require mobile refuelers to provide seconda ry containment equal to the size of the tank because during refueling operations they would be expected to move to various areas of the airfi eld that could not be fitted with secondary containment systems to address these concerns the epa amended the spcc rule to exempt mobile refuelers from specifically sized containment requirements26 however mobile refuelers remained subject to the general secondary containment requirements of the spcc rule eg periodic testing of the container and piping27 the epa has extended the compliance date applicable to mobile refuelers and for other new spcc requirements to oc tober 31 2009 this pending regulation may require airport operators to install necessary secondary containment mechanisms to comply with the regulation in add ition to meeting othe r spcc

tion security projects the coordinated process provides that any nvironmental review analys is opinion permit license or approval issued or made by federal agency or airport sponsor for such project must be completed within time period established by the secretary of transportation in cooperation with the agencies that participate in the process the coordinated process may be delineated in memorandum of understanding between the secretary and the heads of other federal and state agencies who participate in the process further the act authorizes the faa to define the scope and content of

assist airports in complying with environmental requirements s 1300 and h r 2881 also include provisions that would establish certain requirements to reduce noise hr 2881 incl udes two unique provisions the first 509 would require faa to the maximum extent possible implement sustainable practices in the construction and major renovati on of air traffic control f acilities in order to reduce energy use and improve environmental pe rformance at those facilities finally each proposal includes provisions seeking to m odify the air tour management program program designed to regulate comme rcial air tours over national park units primarily in an effort to mitigate noise and other adverse impacts these provisions seek to narrow the scope of this program to park service units where noise or other adverse impacts from air tours have been identified or could become more substantial issue the second 512 specifi the sense of the congress with respect to the european union eu directive ex tending the eus emission trading proposal to international civil aviation the bill specifies that by not working through the international civil aviation organizati on in consensusbased fashion the eu directive is inconsistent with the conven tion on international ci vil aviation and that it is antithetical to building internati onal cooperation to ddress gree nhouse gas emissions from aircraft research funding faa proposal section 601 would permanently authorize the airport cooperative research program acrp43 under 601 the faa proposes to increase funding from 10 llion to 15 million for fy2008fy2010 specified under 102 five million dollars per year of the acrp funds would be set aside for research activities related to the airport environment including reductions in noise and air emissions and addressing water quality issues the faa proposal would also create consortium to research aircraft technologies that would produce lower ener gy air emissions and noise the faa proposal 606 research consortium for lower energy emissions and noise technology partnership would create th consortium by requiring faa to work with the existing partnership for air tr ansportation noise and emissions reduction partner44 to develop continuous low ener gy emissions and noise cleen engine and airframe technology the proposal would establish the following performance objectives for

research consortium 602 reduction of noise emissions and energy consumption from civilian aircraft funding for the research consortium would be made available fro m the airport and airway trust fund authorizations for research and development 45 the bill directs the administrator to designate an institution as consortium for aviation ise emissions and energy technology research to c onduct research w ith nasa and other relevant industries the performance objectives the consortium is directed to accomplish are the same as those in the faa proposal unique to s 1300 is provision regarding clean coal fuel t echnology section 603 would require the departme nt of transportation to establish research grant program to develop synthetic jet fuel from clean coal however the bill does not provide definition of clean coal funds would be authorized from the airport and airway trust fund section 603 would also require the faa administrator to designate an institution as center of

would permanently authorize the acrp 907 hr 2881 includes provision 505 c leen research development and implementation partnership that is simila r to the faa proposal that would create consortium to develop continuous low energy emissions and noise cleen engine and airframe technology hr 2881 does not specify that the faa must work with partner to achieve the established performance goals however the goalshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33949crs16 are the same as those sp ecified in the faa proposal and s 1300 hr 2881 specifies that from fy2008 through fy2011 not more than 111 million may be appropriated from the airpor t and airway trust fund authorizations for this program hr 2881 also specifies certain envir onmentalrelated responsibilities of the next generation air transpor tation system joint planni ng and development office included is directive to establish specific quantitative goals for among other factors the environmental impacts of each phase of next generation air transportation system those goals are re quired to take into account noise pollution reduction concerns of affected communities to the greatest extent practicable in establishing the environmental goals 202 under title ix federal aviation re search and development hr 2881 includes the following additional environmen tally related resear ch and development requirements except where noted the bill does not specifically authorize funds for this research interagency research initiative on the impact of aviation on the climate 903 directs the faa administrator in coordination with nasa and the us global climate change science program to establish research initiative to assess the impact of aviation on climate and to evaluate approaches to mitigate that impact research program on space weather and aviation 910 would require the faa administrat or in coordination with the national science foundation nsf nasa and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa to initiate research program on the impacts of space weat her to aviation to conduct this research the administrator ma use grants or cooperative agreements further the bill would authorize 1 million to be appropriated for each of fy2008 through fy2011 aviation gas research and development program 911 would require the faa to study technologies that would allow the use of unleaded gasoline in pistonen gine aircraft currently piston engine aircraft mostly general aviation aircraft use leaded gasoline the bill would author ize 750000 to be appropriated for each of fy2008 through fy2010 research reviews and assessments 912 would require faa to contract with the national re search council nrc to assess the adequacy of faas energy and environmentrelated research programs and the impact of space weather on aviation research program on alternativ jet fuel technology for civil aircraft 914 this section is similar to the proposal in s 1300 603 that would support coal research except that the house proposal would also require res earch into the development of alternative fuels from additional sources including natural gas biomass ethanol butanol and hy drogen funds for the program would be authorized from the airport and airway trust fundhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33949crs17 46 49 usc 47128 47 among other provisions nepa requires airport operators to consider the environmental impact of

47504a2requirements to ddress noise issues in 1990 congress mandated phase out of nonstage 3 aircraft over 75000 pounds by december 31 199950 this has allowed stage 1 and stage 2 aircraft under 75000 pounds primarily corporate and privateuse aircraft to continue to operate in 2006 such aircraft represented relativ ely small number of ll operational turbojet aircraft under 75000 pounds approximately 1330 or 13 however at some airports particularly smaller commercial and general aviation airports their use makes disproportionate contribution to noise exposure contours for example the massachusetts port authority massport reported that at the lg hanscom field in bedford ma nonstage 3 aircraft accounted fo r less than 1 of the airports annual traffic in 2005 yet were responsible for 23 of the noise energy produced by civil aircraft51 also some airport operators have reported that between 50 and 80 of noise complaints lodged with the airport have been related to nonstage 3 aircraft52 as result several airports have sought to ban or restrict access to such aircraft those efforts have generally been prohibited by faa senate proposal section 711 of s 1300 would address this issue by prohibiting the operation of aircraft under 75000 pounds with certain exceptions unless it complies with stage 3 noise levels the prohibition would take effect five years after the bills enactment section 714 of the bill proposes the creati on of an exploratory program for the redevelopment of property purchased w ith noise mitigation funds or passenger facility charge funds to encourage airport compatible land uses the trial program would involve up to four ai rport operators that have submitted noise compatibility program to faa provisions in this sec tion would also amend
