extensive use of advanced materials and robust structural design have resulted in an airframe that is extremely corrosion resistant and damage tolerant and requires scheduled structural maintenance over the projected life of the aircraft the aircrafts subsystems were designed to be selfsupporting for operations in environmentally extreme conditions with minimal ground support or ground handling equipment which is especially beneficial during extended deployments to forward operating locations the super hornets dynamic integrated logistics support ils and training programs are based on the us
