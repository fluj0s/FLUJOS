comparison updated february 2 2005 mark jickling specialist in public finance government and finance division congressional research service the library of congress mutual fund reform bills sidebyside comparison summary the mutual fund was embroiled in scandal in september 2003 when new york attorney general eliot spitzer brought charges against few mutual funds brokers and hedge funds subsequently the new york investigation widened and the securities and exchange commission sec intensified its scrutiny of mutual funds number of illegal or unethical practices came under investigation the common theme is that fund managers and insiders have permitted favored customers including hedge funds to engage in highly profitable shortterm trading strategies that reduce the investment returns of millions of longterm investors number of firms have paid fines to settle civil charges the sec reported in testimony before the senate governmental affairs committee on november 3 2003 that preliminary investigations indicated that trading practices that appear to be abusive but not in all cases illegal were widespread in the industry the congressional response to the mutual fund investigations included several hearings and bills legislative proposals in the 108th congress included hr 2420 representative baker which passed the house on november 19 2003 s 1822 senator akaka introduced november 5 2003 s 1958 senators kerry and kennedy introduced november 25 2003 s 1971 senators dodd and corzine also introduced on november 25 2003 and s 2059 senators fitzgerald levin and collins introduced on february 10 2004 all of these bills would have required mutual funds to provide more information to investors about the fees they charge and about the funds financial relationships with stockbrokers and investment advisers the bills also required that funds governing boards contain majorities of independent directors with financial or family ties to fund management s 1958 proposed the creation of new mutual fund regulator to carry out registration inspections and disciplinary proceedings and to make rules promoting mutual fund ethics and independence none of these bills was enacted by the 108th congress however the sec using its existing statutory authority has issued rules that incorporate some of the provisions of the legislative proposals for instance the sec has mandated that mutual fund boards have an independent chairman and majority of independent directors other regulations are under consideration and the sec appears to have become more vigilant and aggressive in its oversight of the funds thus unless new scandals appear some may now see the need for reform legislation as less pressing this report compares the provisions of these legislative proposals it serves as an historical record of legislative activity in the 108th congress and will not be updated contents sidebyside comparison of mutual fund reform legislation in the

relationships among mutual funds brokers and investment advisers would also have to be disclosed under three of the bills brokers selling mutual funds would have had to disclose how their compensation was structured including any incentives for selling particular funds the proposals would all have required mutual funds boards of directors to contain majorities of independent directors those not

ethical and legal compliance s1958 proposed an independent regulator for mutual funds to operate under the oversight of the sec s 2059 would repeal sec rule 12b1 which permits funds to charge
