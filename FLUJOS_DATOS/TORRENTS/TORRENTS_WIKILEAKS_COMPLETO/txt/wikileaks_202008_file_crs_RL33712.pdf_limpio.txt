medicare is an entitlement program which means that it is required to pay for services provided to eligible persons so long as specific criteria are met spending under the program except for portion of administrative costs is considered mandatory spending not discretionary spending which is subject to the appropriations process medicare serves approximately one in seven americans and virtually all of the population aged 65 and over in 2006 the first year of the new drug benefit medicare spending accounted for an estimate d 57 of federal health spending and 19 of all national health expenditures program sp ending represented 29 of national spending on hospital services 21 of such spending for physicians and clinical services and 18 of total drug spending compa red to 2 in 2005 in 2017 program spending is expected to account fo r 58 of federal spe nding and 21 of all national health expenditures spending in that year is expected to account for 31 of national spending on hosp ital services 20 of such spending for physicians and clinical services and 24 of total drug spending4 the medicare program is generally viewed as achieving its goal of helping aged and disabled persons meet many of their h ealth care needs however the cost of the program and the significant yeartoyear increases in such costs are major concern for the congress and other observers the congressional budget office cbo projects that program spending will double ove r the next ten years the rapid growth rate reflects number of factors including overall increases in medical care costs which typically exceed the rate of infla tion in the economy as whole advances in health care delivery and medical technology and longer life expectancies additionalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs2

not apply in the house for the remainder of the 110 th congress 2008 report also contained finding submission of alegislative proposal will be required in february 2009httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs8 medicare history medicare was enacted in 1965 pl 8997 in response to the concern that only about half of the nations niors had health insurance and most of those only had coverage for inpatient hospital costs the new program which became effective july 1 1966 included coverage for hospital and posthospital services under part and doctors and other medical services under pa rt b as was the case for the already existing social security program part was to be financed by payroll taxes levied on current workers and their employers pe rsons had to pay into the system for 40 calendar quarters to become entitled to benefits however persons who turned 65 before 1968 were automatica lly covered while those who turned 65 between 1967 and 1974 were covered under transitiona l provisions medicare part b was voluntary beneficiaries who elected to enroll would pay monthly premium over 90 of the eligible populati on enrolled payments to health care providers under both part and part b were to be based on the most common form of payment at the time namely reasonable costs for hospital and other institutional services or reasonable charges for physicians and other medical services medicare was considered social insurance program similar to social security the 1965 law also established medicaid the federalstate health insurance program for the poor this was an expansion of pr evious welfarebased assistance programs some lowincome individuals qualified for both programs in the ensuing 40 years the medica re program has undergone considerable changes pl 92603 enacted in 1972 ex panded program cove rage to disabled individuals and to persons with endstage re nal disease esrd this law also began to place limitations on the definitions of reasonable costs and reasonable charges this was in order to gain some control over program spending which even in the initial years was in excess of the original projections during the 1980s and 1990s number of laws were enacted which included provisions designed to further stem the rapid increase in program spending and to postpone the bankruptcy of the medicare part trust fund this was typically achieved through tightening rules governing payments to providers of services and stemming the annual updates in such payments the program moved from payments based on reasonable costs and reasonable charges to payment systems under which predetermined payment amount is established for specifi ed unit of service at the same time beneficiaries were given the option to obtain covered services through private managed care arrangements typica lly health maintenance organizations most medicare payment provisions were incorporated into larger budget reconciliation bills designed to control overall federal spending this effort culminated in the enactment of the balanced budget act of 1997 bba 97 pl 10533 this law slowed the ra of growth in payments to providers and established new payment systems for certain categories of providers it also established the medicarechoice program wh ich expanded private plan options for beneficiaries and changed the way most pl ans were paid bba 97 further expanded preventive services covered by the program httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs9 subsequently congress became concerned that the bba 97 cuts in payments to providers were somewhat larger than originally anticipated therefore legislation was enacted in both 1999 balanced budget refinement act of 1999 bbra pl 106113 nd 2000 medicare medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of 2000 bipa pl 106554 that was designed to mitigate the impact of bba 97 on providers in 2003 congress enacted major medicare bill the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernizati on act of 2003 mma pl 108173 this legislation included the first major benefit expansion since 1965 and placed increasing emphasis on the private sector to deliver and manage benefits it created new voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit to be administered by private entities it also replaced the existing dicarechoice program with new medicare advantage ma program payments to these plans were increased in order to increase the availability of private plan options for beneficiaries for the first time mma introduced the concept of income testing into medicare lowincome individuals get additional assistance under th new part d drug program while high income persons pay larger part b premiums beginning in 2007 mma also modified some provider payment rules and expanded covered preven tive services finally the legislation created specific process for overall program review if general revenue spending exceeds specified threshold during the 109th congress two laws were enacted that incorporated minor modifications to medicares payment rules these were the deficit reduction act of 2005 dra pl 109171 and the tax relief and health care act of 2006 trhca pl 109432 in the 110th congress additional changes were incorporated in the medicare medicaid and schi p extension act of 2007 mmsea pl 110173 and the medicare improvements fo r patients and provi ders act of 2008 mippa pl110275 medicare parts and b original medicare approximately 80 of medicare beneficiaries receive covered services through part and part b the part and b structure which remains to this day reflects the political compromises made at the time of enactment in 1965 together they are known as original medicare however th two programs have different eligibility requirements benefit structures paymen t rules and financing mechanisms this section provides an overview of the key f eatures of the two programs medicare financing is discussed later in this report

program generally made payments on the basis of reasonable costs and r easonable charges however program expenditures quickly began to exceed expectations as result congress sought to rein in expenditures by tightening payment rules at first limitations were placed on the definitions of reasonable costs and reasonable charges subsequently the program moved toward payment systems under which predetermined payment amount is established for specified unit of service such as hospital discharge or payment classification group in 1983 the first prospective payment system pps was established for inpatient hospital services medicares largest spending category under the inpatient pps ipps the payment amounts are intended to represent the average cost for treating patient for the same condition hospitals that are able to keep costs below the fixed payment are able to keep the difference while those with costs exceeding the fixed payment lose money over time prospective payment and other predetermined approaches such as fee schedules were established for numbe r of other service categories the rules for each payment system are quite complex and differ for each system taken together they are sometimes characterized as administered pricing since the price the government sets for the period does not fluctuate by supply or demand the law generally specifies formul for calculating an annual update to the payment amount though congress frequently amends the statutory requirements the following discussion is intended as only brief overview of medicare payment systems

maintenan ce organizations hmos contracted with medicare to provide covered services the bba enacted in 1997 replaced the risk contract program with the medicarec hoice mc program the mc program established new payment formula wh ich was designed both to reduce overall spending and to reduce the existing variati on in payments to plans across the country following enactment of bba 97 managed care plans began leaving the program citing insufficient medicare payments however other factors also played role for some plans subsequent legislation addr essed some of the issues arising from passage of the bba most recently congress made substantial changes to the mc program with the passage of the mma in 2003 the act created the medicare advantage ma program to replace the mc program and introduced several pr ovisions intended to increase the availability of private plans to medicare beneficiaries it provided for immediate payment increases to plans beginning in 2004 beginning in 2006 it changed the payment structure for local plans and provided for the introduction of regional plans that operate like preferre d provider organizations popular option in the private health insurance market the legislation also provided financialhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs23 incentives for plans to participate in this new regional op tion additi onally ma enrollees have access to the part d

obtain rvices from hospitals and doctors that are in the plans network some plans offer pointofservice option under which an individual ma elect to obtain services from nonnetwork provider in such cas the individual pays more for the care if the plan does not have point of service option the individual must pay outofpocket except in emergency cases for services provided by nonnetwork providers local preferred provider organizations ppos persons who enroll in ppos are generally able to s ee any doctor or other provider that accepts medicare if enrollees use outofnetwork ie non preferred providers they will generally pay more though the amount varies by plan local ppos generally serve individual counties regional ppos rppos beginning in 2006 regional ppos are available regional ppos serve one or more of the 26 regions established by the secretary each region consists of either single state or multistate area ma regional plans cover both in and outofnetwork required rvices and

serv ices beyond required medicare benefits or some combination of these options the remaining 25 of the difference between the bid and the benchmark is retained by the federal government if plans bid is equal to or above the benchmark its payment will be the benchmark amount and each enrollee in that plan will pay an additional pre mium equal to the amount by which the bid exceeds the benchmark each year plans wishing to participate in the ma program must submit new bids the secretary has the authority to negotiate the bid amounts except for pffshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs25 plans benchmark amounts ar increased each year by the greater of either 2 or growth in overall medicare in years specified by the secretary benchmark for an area can be set at per capita spending in or iginal medicare if that amount is greater than the benchmark the area would otherwise receive beginning in 2006 the ma program began to offer ma regional plans like local plans regional plans must submit bids to the secretary that in relation to the benchmark determine the payment the plan receives for each enrollee the regional program is different from the local program in that the plan bids help determine the benchmarks for each region the regional benchmarks include two components 1 statutorily determined am ount comparable to benchmar ks described above and 2 weighted average of plan bids thus portion of the benchmark is competitively determined similar to local plans plans with bids below the benchmark will be given rebate while pl ans with bids above the benchmark will require

transfer of money into and out of fund income to the trust funds is credited to the fund in the form of interestbearing government securities expenditures for services and administrative costs are recorded agai nst the fund the securities represent obligations that the government has issued to itself as long as the trust fund has balance the treasury department is authorized to make payments for it from the us treasury part financing the primary source of funding for part is payroll taxes paid by employees and employers each pays tax of 145 on earnings the selfemployed pay 29 unlike social security there is upper limit on earnings subject to the tax other sources of income include 1 portion of federal income taxes that individuals pay on their social security benefits 2 pre miums paid by voluntary enrollees who are not automatically entitled to medicare part through their or their spouses work in covered employment 3 government credits and 4 interest on federal securities held by the trust fund income for part is credited to the hi trust fund part b financing medicare part b is financed through combination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues beneficiary premiums equal 25 of estimated program costs for the aged the disabled pay the sa premium as the aged federal general revenues account for the remaining 75 income for part b is credited to the smi trust fund the 2008 monthly part b premium is 9640 individuals receiving social security benefits have their part b premium payments automatically deducted from their social security benefit checks an individuals social s ecurity check cannot go down from one year to the next as resu lt of the annual part b premium increase except in the case of higher income individuals subject to incomerelated premiumshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs29 since the inception of medicare all part b enrollees paid the same part b premium regardless of their income level for many years congress debated whether or not it was appropriate for ta xpayers to pay through general revenue financing threequarters of part b costs for higher income persons since low income and middle income working persons might be subsidizing higher income elderly persons in response congress included provisi on in mma that required higher income enrollees to pay higher premiums be ginning in 2007 in 2008 individuals whose modified adjusted gross income agi in 2006 exceeded 82000 and couples whose modified agi exceeded 164000 are subject to higher premium amounts in 2008 they pay total premiums ranging from 317 to 617 of the value of part b when fully phasedin in 2009 higher income indi viduals will pay tota l premiums ranging from 35 to 80 of the value of part b cms estimates that 5 of enrollees w ill pay the higher premiums in 2008 for singles the higher monthly premiu m amounts are 12220 for beneficiaries with incomes in 2006 over 82000 and less than or equal to 102000 16 090 for incomes over 102000 and less than or equal to 153000 19970 for incomes greater than 153000 and less than or equal to 205000 and 23840 for incomes greater than 205000 for couples filing join t tax returns the premium amounts are 12220 for beneficiaries with incomes over 164000 and less than or equal to 204000 16090 for incomes ove r 204000 nd less than or equal to 306000 19970 for incomes greater than 306000 nd less than or equal to 410000 and 23840 for incomes greater than 410000 part c financing payments for spending under the medi care advantage program are made in appropriate parts from the hi and smi trust funds there is separate trust fund for part c part d financing medicare part d is financed through co mbination of beneficiary premiums and federal general revenues in addition certain transfers are made from the states these transfers referred to as clawback payments represent portion of the amounts states could otherwis have been expected to pay for drugs under medicaid if drug coverage for the dua l eligible population had not b een transferred to part d part d revenues are credited to separate part d account within the smi trust fund beneficiaries pay different premiums depending on the plan they have selected and whether or not they are entitled to lowincome premium subsidies on average beneficiary premiums account for 255 of expected total part d costs for basic coverage part d premium payments may be automatically deducted from social security benefit checks pa id directly to the pdp sponsor or mapd organization or made through an electronic funds transferhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs30 medicare solvency when people refer to the pending insolvency of medicare they are actually referring to the pending insolvency of the hi trust fund medicare trustees define insolvency as occurring when trust fund ssets at the beginning of the year are insufficient to pay program benefits for the forthcoming year because of the way it is financed the smi fund including the part d account does not face insolvency although its rapid growth rate is drain on federal spending further continued premium increases may place financial burden on some beneficiaries the 2008 trustees report projects that under intermed iate assumptions the hi trust fund will become insolvent in 2019 th report further states that beginning in 2004 tax income from payroll taxes and from the taxation of social security benefits began to fall below expenditures expenditures exceed total income each year beginning in 2008 except for 2009 if in come falls short of expenditures costs are met by drawing on hi fund assets thr ough transfers from the general fund of the treasury until the fund is depleted 45 trigger the rapid increases in total medicare costs has long been of concern to congress and others the trustees have emphasized the importance of examining the program as whole rather than just the hi trust fund of particular concern is the fact that over time the economy will be unable to s upport the increasing reliance on general revenues which in large measure come from taxes paid by the under65 population in response mma required the annual tr ustees report to include an expanded analysis of medicare expenditures and revenues specifically each year the trustees must determine whether general revenue fi nancing will exceed 45 of total medicare outlays within the next seven years ge neral revenue financing is defined as total medicare outlays minus dedicated financing sources ie hi payroll taxes income from taxation of social security benef its state transfers for prescription drug benefits premiums pa id under parts b and d and any gifts received by the trust funds if the trustees determine that general revenue financing will exceed 45 of total financing within seven years an finding of excess general revenue funding is made the 2006 report projected that the 45 level would first be exceeded in fy2012 the 2007 report projected that it would first be exceeded in 2013 both findings were within the requi red sevenyear test period bo th reports therefore made determination of excess general revenue funding mma requires that if an excess general revenue funding dete rmination is made for two successive years the president is required to submit legislative proposal to respond to the warning the proposal must be submitted within 15 days of submission of the next presidents budg et unless during the intervening period legislation is enacted which eliminates such excess general revenue funding since warnings were issued in 2006 and 2007 the pr oposal was due within 15 days of submission of the presidents fy2009 budget in early 2008 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs31 the president submitted the required pr oposal in february 2008 it included provisions to increase part d premiums for higher income persons incorporate valuebased purchasing and modify the medical liability system the congress was required to consider the proposal on an expe dited basis though pa ssage of legislation within specific time frame was not required on july 24 2008 the house of representatives adopted resolution which provides that the expedited parliamentary procedures contained in mma shall not pply in the house during the remainder of the 110th congress the 2008 trustees report also contained funding warning therefore the president will be required to submit legislative proposal early in 2009 additional insurance coverage medicare provides broad protection agains t the costs of many primarily acute care services however the program does not cover all services which may be used by its aged and disabled beneficiaries medicare does not cover eyeglasses hearing aids dentures or most longterm care rvices further unlike most private insurance polices it does not include an annual catastrophic cap on outofpocket spending on costsharing charges for serv ices covered under parts and b except for persons enrolled in regional ppos under mma prior to implementation of the drug benefit in 2006 the program gene rally covered only about onehalf of beneficiaries total health care expenses more recent data are not available most medicare beneficiaries have some coverage in ddition to medicare the following are the main sources of add itional coverage for medicare enrollees medicare advantage many ma plans offer services in addition to those covered under original medicare employer coverage coverage may be provided through current or former employer in recent years number of employers have cut back on the scope of retiree cove rage some have dropped such coverage entirely particularly for future retirees as noted earlier the mma attempted to stem this trend by offering subsidies to employers who offer drug coverage at least as good as that available under part d see discussion above medigap individual insurance policie s which supplement medicare are referred to as medigap policies beneficiaries with medigap insurance typically have coverage for portion of medicares deductibles and coinsurance they may also have coverage for some items and services not covered by medicare individuals generally select one of the standardized pl ans though not all plans are offered in all states medicaid certain lowincome medicare beneficiaries may also be eligible for full or partial benefits under their states medicaid program persons eligible for th full range of benefits known ashttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs32 the full dual eligibles generally have the majority of their health care expenses met through combin ation of coverage under the two programs medicare pays first with medicaid picking up most of the remaining costs certain other individuals are entitled to more limited protection under one of thr ee medicaid savings programs the qualified medicare beneficiary qmb program pays medicare part b premiums and medicare co stsharing charges for persons under 100 of poverty the specified lowincome medicare beneficiary slmb program pays part b premium charges for those between 100 and 120 of poverty while the qualified individual qi program pays such premiums for those between 120 and 135 of poverty other public sources individuals may have additional coverage through the department of vete rans affairs or tricare for military retirees eligible for medicare and enrolled in part b in the years prior to implementation of the drug benefit close to 90 of beneficiaries had some form of additional coverage s ome persons may have had more than one type of such coverage more recent information is not available medicare directions the medicare program is likely to be th subject of continuing review for number of years both congress and the medicare trustees continue to register concern about the rapid rise in medicare spending and the ability of existing funding mechanisms to support the program over the longterm only the part fund faces an actual insolvency date however few obs ervers believe that the programs total growth rate is sustainable over time th 2008 trustees report noted that total program expenditures which represente d 31 of gdp in 2006 were expected to climb to 70 by 2035 and rise to 107 by 2080 it further noted that the level of program expenditures is expected to exceed that for social security in 2028 and be 85 more than the cost of that program by 2082 combination of factors have contribut ed to the rapid increase in medicare costs these include increases in overall medical costs advances in health care delivery and medical technology increases in the percentage of the population over 65 and longer life spans the trend is expected to accelerate in 2011 when the baby boom generation persons born between 1946 and 1964 begin to turn 65 and become eligible for medicare the issues confronting the program are not new nor are the possible responses likely to get any easier solutions involve raising taxes cutting benefits raising bene ficiaries outofpocket costs or some combination of these approaches members of congress medi care trustees and many other observers continue to warn that the problems need to be addressed at the same time some members and beneficiary advocates expr ess concern about the potential impact of any solution on beneficiaries outofpocke t costs or access to needed services it seems likely that in the shortterm congress will focus its attention on specific medicare issues fo r example physician payment updates it may alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs33 consider medicare spending reductions as part of legislation such as budget reconciliation designed to reduce overall federal spending below specified levels over specific time period at the same time the administration c ongress and others may also examine broad range of policy options designed to achieve more long term reforms for number of years various options have been suggested however there is consensus on the approach that should be taken one option is placing increasing reliance on the private sector to deliver and manage benefits this is the approach first used for managed care options under part c more recently the new part d drug benefit gave increased flexibility to private entities within federallyestablished parameters individual entities design their benefit packages and determine payment amounts the intention is to encourage competition by allowi ng beneficiaries to select coverage that best meets their needs proponents claim that this will result in lower overall costs as well as enable the federal government to distance itself from the business of establishing detailed payment rules for each service category some members and other observers oppos the efforts to change the basic structure of medicare they contend that single nationwide benefit structure administered by the federal government has served bene ficiaries well and should be retained they contend that any necessary savings for part and b services can be achieved within the context of the existing program and suggest that increased ma payments have actually increased overall pr ogram costs additionally some persons also suggest that savings could be achie ved under part d if th federal government were allowed to enter into price negotiations with drug manufacturers at one time it was thought that the mma provision relating to an excess general revenue funding termination might have an impact on the medicare discussion this year for the second straig ht year the medicare trustees report had contained an excess general revenue f unding determination under which general revenues are expected to be greater than 45 of outlays within the next seven years see financing section above as result the president was required to submit legislative proposal responding to th warning the president submitted the proposal in february 2008 mma had re quired expedited c ongressional action however on july 24 2008 the house of repr esentatives adopted resolution which provides that the expedited parliamentar procedures contained in mma shall not apply in the house during the remainder of the 110th congress the 2008 trustees report also contained funding warning therefore under the mma provisions the president will be requi red to submit legislative proposal early in 2009 it should be noted that the mma provi sion defines general revenues as total outlays minus dedicated reve nues primarily payroll taxes and premiums under this calculation increases in dedi cated revenues andor reducti ons in outlays in any part of medicare will lower general revenues and can be used to meet the trigger requirements it should be noted that lowe ring part spending lowers both overall medicare spending and excess general reve nue spending ho wever if other changes were made spendi ng under parts b and d and associated general revenue financing would represent larg er proportion of total spendinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33712crs34 on the other hand legislation directed at general revenue financing under parts b and d will not address the pending insolv ency of part whic h is funded primarily by payroll taxes it is therefore expected that congress will need to examine variety of options in the coming years key
