to establish regular rhythm in your rosicrucian work thus contributing to better assimilation of what you will study similarly most rosicrucians h ave chosen thursday and more particularly thursday eveningto read thei r monographs why thursday simply because rosicrucian tradition reco rds that it was on thursday evening that the order founded by thutmose iiiand to whom the order owes its traditional originsheld its fir st meeting in the temple of karnak egypt during the reign of this pharaoh by devoting this day to their rosicrucian studies rosicrucians from all over the world commemorate this event that is of gr eat importance for our mystical order if you cannot make thursday night our period for study choose another day likewise if it is impossible f or you to study your mono graphs in the evening do so in the morning in the afternoon or at any other time when you have the required tranquility what m atters most of all i repeat is creating within yourself the habit of studying n certain day of the week furthermore whatever the day and time you choose let your family and friends know that you will not be available during this period if necessary make it clear to them that this time is devoted to private studies in this way you will avoid any interruption in your rosicrucian work do not let your monographs accumulate with the good intention of studying them later on and catching up if this hap pens you may hinder the initiatory process which provides meaning to rosicr ucianism moreover such way of proceeding will gradually weaken the attra ction which impelled you to request affiliation with our order in fact each week it will become more and more difficult for you to read and study t he rosicrucian teachings on the other hand regular and conscientious study will lead you to increas ingly greater understanding and knowledgesources f profound inner satisfaction in this way you will derive all the theoretical and practical advantages which rosi crucian philosophy can give to those who show themselves wo rthy of it moreover if you wish to review certain mono graphs 5rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 1

master 5 6rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 1 dear fratres and sorores convening new class of rosicrucian postulants is happy and important event in our tradition for it provides proof of th desire and need for spirituality which animates an evergreater number of seekers s your class master i welcome you in the name of the imperator all the g rand masters and all your fratres and sorores and on this memorable day i convey to you their greetings before approaching the first principles of our teac hings it will be useful for you to know certain facts that will allow you t understand better what you have right to expect from your affiliation we believe tha t this will give you the feeling of real satisfaction regarding the deci sion you have made in seeking admittance within amorcs portals first of all u must understand that what distinguishes rosicrucians from other people i s the attraction they feel toward the mysteries of life their thirst for know ledge incites them to explore the universe in which they live because they are c onscious of the fact that they themselves are living reflections of it they devote themselves body and soul to the study and application of our orders t eachings because experience has over time shown them that rosicrucian philoso phy makes it possible to understand better the meaning of life and therefor to master it more fully rosicrucianism the purpose of our teachings is not to upset the s ocial and family environment in which we live because ch negative perspective would be in total opposition with the law of evolut ion so dear to us although rosicrucians in the course of history have contri buted to profound changes in society they succeeded in laying the foundations f or such changes because they have understood in light of what they had learned in the order that the world could only evolve positively by adapting themselves to the loftiest ideals therefore the basic worth of rosicrucianism reside s in the positive transformation that takes place in the innermost be ing of each member and which gradually makes him or her an enlightened being who is happy to be alive in this sense the objective of amorcs teachings is t give us the intellectual and spiritual means to face the vicissitudes of our dai ly existence and to experience happiness much like the joy we feel when in the pr esence of those who are dear to us that is why the monogr aphs do not convey speculative teachings they convey in stead pragmatic knowledge based on presentation of natu ral and cosmic laws at work in and around us7rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 1 many people have poor understanding of what the w ord mysticism truly means this word is too often associated with strange unusual and even disturbing behavior whether it is used to def ine the state of mind or the mentality of someone who has concept of the mate rial values of existence for some it is even synonymous with magic howev er as we will show you in our teachings rosicrucian mysticism has not hing to do with magical practices whatever their purpose and nature may be for centuries mysticism has dealt with the spiritual dimension of humans t be more precise it is concerned with the study of natural and universal c onnections uniting each living being to the first cause of all thingswhich we may cal l god divine intelligence cosmic consciousness universal wisdom or whatever we wish from this point of view any system whose goal is t give humanity better understanding of the place we occupy in the univers is mystical amorc as traditional philosophical and initiat ic order is interested in eternal values and strives to guide its members tow ard an approach of absolute truth this being the case we must emphasize that it does not in any way constitute religious movement by making this dec laration we do not wish to say that rosicrucian teachings oppose any of the many existing religions rather the goals it pursues are completely differe nt generally speaking religion does not devote itse lf to the study of life rather it is intent upon perpetuating dogmas that were established originally by one or more individuals when these dogmas truly reflect the universal good the behaviors dictated by the religion in stion are valuable when the contrary is true they may oppose persons ph ysical and spiritual integrity moreover any religious code bears the imprint of t he era in which it was defined therefore religion cannot be eternally valuable if its teachings are not regularly readapted to the evolution operating both within ourselves and within our environment that explains why certain r eligious movements are currently experiencing profound reassessments we cannot deny that religions on the whole have t heir origin in the revelations received by an individual through harmo nizing with divine wisdom however they do not teach the method to fo llow so that their students may achieve this harmonizati on on their own in other words the mystical course whic h the messiah or the prophet of religion followed to re ach such 8rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 1 illumination is not explained to the faithful rath er they are expected to believe what they are told about the life of this messiah r prophet mysticism on the other hand seeks to promote the inner awakening of each individual and to provide the spiritual means of harmonizing directly with cosmic consciousness in other words its purp ose is to allow men and women to have personal experience of the divine w ithout having recourse to particular creed and without using any priesthood as an intermediary that is why we feel that religions have an obvious usefulne ss and yet they essentially constitute ways of belief whereas traditional or der such as amorc is path to knowledge as an introduction to the teachings that will be re vealed to you progressively we propose that you consider certain phenomena whic h may have already attracted your attention or have given rise to refl ections on your part all of these phenomena relate to laws and natural principl that will be the subject of complete explanations in the monographs you will receive many people due to their ignorance classify them in the realm of superstition or associate them with supernatural events yet people have at their dis posal every faculty required for mastering them and making them useful in everyday life it is true as the ancient saying goes that it is from ignora nce and from ignorance alone that humanity must be freed the human aura you may have noticed an illuminated streetlight on foggy night apart from the light itself you may have perceived sort of radiance around it we call this radiance an aura all living creatures have an aura however unlike the one that may be seen arou nd streetlight the aura issuing from plants animals and human beings is i nvisible to the naked eye at least under normal circumstances yet the fact that it cannot be readily seen does not mean that it does not exist to use an analogy it is impossible to perceive the magnetism emanating from magnet yet such magnetism does exist and it cannot be denied that it produces tangible effects on certain substances wi thout dwelling on the nature of the human auraa study that we will save for fut ure monographswe can say that the human aura is an electromagnetic f ield resulting from combination of three major energie sthe first being associated with our physical body the second with our vitality and the third with our soul9rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 1 just as the existence of magnetism can be proved by observing its effects it is likewise possible to test the influence that the aura exerts on its surroundings in this regard you must not think that the only wa of proving whether the aura exists involves perceiving the color of its ra diance although that would be naturally the most conclusive in this matter fo r example you may have encountered person for whom you immediately felt either an attraction or an aversion even though this person said or did thing whatsoever that could explain such an impression even if you were not objectively aware of it this kind of impression often has its origin in the psyc hic influence that the aura of others can have upon us exercise in connection with the aura we suggest that you c arry out the following exercise the next time you use public tr ansportation or when you find yourself in crowd analyze the impressio ns you experience when in contact with people do not study their faces or their demeanor because that might cause suggestions to intervene that have nothing to do with the perception of the aura instead note how your own thoughts emotions and feelings can change in regards to individuals with whom you are in contact since certain people react more to the vibrations f the aura than others do it will be interesting for you to realize the degree f your own psychic sensitivity telepathy as form of mystical practice telepathy dates ba ck to earliest antiquity it was used by the initiates and in ge neral by all members of the mystery schools not so long ago such practice w as condemned by certain religious dogmas and many superstitious people ass ociated this phenomenon with malevolent powers science also took long to recognize the authenticity of telepathy because this phenomenon was beyond the scope of their researches and confronted them with still unk nown principles for rosicrucians thought transmission is practic whose existence and effectiveness cannot be doubted when following w elldefined method it is possible to establish mental contact with other peo ple as is the case with most faculties that are said to be extraordinaryusing the true meaning of this wordtelepathy is based on the use of the unlimited powers of the human consciousness in the rosicrucian teachings we sha ll reveal the technique that you should follow when ntally communicating with other persons so that you can nd them brief and urgent messages as part of this int roductory 10rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 1 monograph we propose that you conduct the followin g exercise which illustrates the soundness of this mental technique we may use to communicate with others exercise when you find yourself in the company of about d ozen people whether at meeting family gathering or an eve ning among friends choose one of them and for few moments think intensely about that person without looking directly at him or her when doing this it is best to direct your gaze in another direction while visualizing the individual s face after concentrating for fifteen to thirty seconds stop your visualizat ion and discreetly observe the person in question you will find that right after completi ng your experiment the individual will look your way as if unconsciou sly he or she had been feeling that you were thinking of him or her vibroturgy rosicrucians have taught for centuries that all obj ects become impregnated with vibrations emanating from p ersons who come in contact with them although science still denies th is principle we know that matter preserves the memory of these vibrations we can even go further by stating that our thoughts affect the vibratory natu re of objects around us while the vibrations retained by material substances in turn affect us for instance have you ever entered house for the first time and found that though its appearance was attractive you neverthel ess felt ill at ease or have you ever felt pleasant sensation as you entered room that was nevertheless untidy and not at all beautiful human beings affec t the places in which they live conversely places exert certain influence on sufficiently sensitive persons bringing about specific reactions within t hem it is important to remember that vibroturgy has not hing to do with magical or supernatural practices as we just said it is b ased on certain laws inherent to matter and consciousness from rosicrucian point of view it results from the fact that everything in you and around you is vibra tory in this sense vibroturgic perception is an ability that consists of inwardly harmonizing ourselves with the vibratory nature of objects which act as intermediaries so that we receive impressions concerning people who have been in contact with them for sufficient length of time thus it is necessary that one have sufficiently developed psychic sensitivity in due time we will provide you with xercises to perform so that you will acquire this developmen t to 11rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 1 this end we propose that you perform the following exercise as soon as you have the opportunity exercise as soon as you can go to public library and take magazine or book that has obviously been looked through by ma ny persons if possible close your eyes and hold this magazine or book for few minutes while remaining in state of total receptivity in other words while in contact with it be open to receiving impressions emanating from people who have held it if your psychic sensitivity is sufficient you will ex perience certain sensations that depending on the situation can be expressed by the perception of face voice odor scene etc such reactions will not be due to your imagination they are due instead to the effects of vibroturgy it is possibl that you will not receive any impression rather you will have either feeling of wellb eing or discomfort we will explain why in future monographs if it is impossible for you to go to library you may perform this experiment at home us ing objects once in contact with various people family gem is good medium for vibroturgy metaphysical healing we sometimes become tired when this happens we feel ineffective and sometimes we even become irritable in such situation many people resort to some artificial means for recovering vitality this may involve medication cup of coffee or so other stimulant to the nerves such way of behaving is not effective be cause it only gives the illusion of longer being weary moreover such s timulants often produce side effects that without our being aware of it d isturb our physical and psychic equilibrium rosicrucians know of natural method for neutraliz ing the underlying cause of fatigue rather than just its effect this method is part of the numerous practices amorc teaches its members so that they ca n treat many disorders afflicting humans in fact whole degree of study is devoted to rosicrucian therapy such therapy is based on way of using th autonomic nervous systemparticularly its sympathetic divisionto pro duce stimulation of deficient or diseased organs this stimulation being eithe r positive or negative according to the disorder involved as you will lea rn this method of healing is composed of placing ones fingers on specific parts of the body and carrying out certain type of breathing exercise as practical application of the previous statements we suggest that the next time you feel tired 12rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 1 whether following strenuous physical or mental work you proceed as follows sit comfortably with your back as straight as poss ible and your feet placed flat on the ground and slightly apart from each oth er while in this position place the tips of the thumb and first two fingers f your right hand to the back of the neck to the left of the spinal column afte r placing your fingers thus inhale deeply through your nose hold your breath f or few moments and then exhale deeply through your nose without removing our fingers breathe three or four more times in this way then resume your rmal rate of breathing after few minutes you will feel much better mystical sounds the sacred texts of most religions refer to divi ne word that at the beginning of time spread througho ut the universe and eventually gave rise to all creation visible and i nvisible this word according to many religions was the word that god uttered wh the divine wished to create the world apart from what religious dogm as teach on this subject rosicrucians have known for centuries that certain sounds uttered by humans produce vibrations that affect the persons intoning them and those who hear them that is why such sounds are used for specific purposes notably in mental alchemy mystical healing and the developme nt of psychic centers called chakras in eastern traditions amorc as traditional and initiatory order posse sses store of knowledge on the origin nature and power of these mystical sounds which we call vowel sounds and that can also be given the name of mantras in later degrees we will explain in detail how to intone them so as to benefit from the positive influence they exercise on the physica l body and on the human psychic centers which are twelve in number in thi s first mandamus we cannot provide you with detailed description of ll the vowel sounds you will study any more than we can study all the different psychic centers of the body one by one however we suggest that you carry out the following experiment over the next few days exercise sit down in place where you can have perfect pea ce and quiet whether at home or outdoors hold your back as stra ight as possible and place the palms of your hands on your knees once in this posi tion close your eyes inhale deeply through your n ose then exhale slowly while intoning aloud the vowel s ound om do it on the note of your choice and be sure t hat you 13rosicrucian order amorc postulant section mandamus number 1 extend its intonation as long as possible in this way oooommmmmmmm intone this sound several times and note the impres sions it produces in you ou may note feeling of wellbeing and in some cases an agreeable sensation in the center of your head the intonation of the v owel sound om especially affects the physiological and psychic activity of t he pineal gland that is located in the precise center of the head at the level of the forehead we hope that the few exercises we have presented wi ll have stimulated your interest in the studies you are about to under take as part of your affiliation with amorc the monographs that you will receive in the coming months will provide you with detailed explanations on myst ical principles relating to these exercises which we repeat constitute an ap proach that is both specific and general regarding subjects covered in the rosic rucian teachings ou will gradually familiarize yourself with the laws g overning the physical and metaphysical aspects of existence in closing it is new world that will be opened to you world whose beauty grandeur and nobility may exceed anything you have conceived of as existing on the human plane until now with best wishes for peace profound sincerely and fraternally your class master note the symbol which appears in the lower corner of ea ch page of this monograph is very old rosicrucian symbol we find it in documents of our order some of which are several centuries old and in many cases were written by hand and in various languages this symb ol traditionally designates the section in which you find yourself as postula nt of amorc whenever you progress to another section and degree another sym bol will be revealed to you the dove as represented in this symbol has rel igious connotation it represents the inner consciousness of the person wh constantly seeks to rise to better comprehension of the divine it also sy mbolizes the purity of ones intent as for the circle it d epicts cosmic perfection which is the source of all creat ion and with which human consciousness is always in harmony 14the universe nature and humans are animated by th same cosmic flow and owe their existence to energies having common source as it is true that everything that is below is like that which is abov and that everything that is above is like that which is below from the hermetic tabletthe most beautiful and profound emotion we can expe rience is the sensa tion of the mystical it is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true science he to whom emotion is stranger who can longer wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead to know that what is impenetrable to us really exists manifesting itself as the high est wisdom and most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend onl in their primitive forms this knowledge this feeling is the center of true religiousness the cosmic experience is the strongest and noblest driving for ce behind scientific research albert einstein 15consecrated to truth and
