reserve the marine corps reserve the air national guard of the united states the air force reserve and the coast guard reserve this report however does not provide recruiting and retention data for the coast guard reserve which normally operates as part of the department of homeland security rather than the department of defense dod 2 in the case of the active component accessions are individuals who have actually begun their military service as distinguished from those who have signed contract to serve but who have not yet begun their service accession for active component personnel usually occurs when an individual is shipped to basi c training for the reserve components the term has broader meaning accession can occur shortly after an individual signs contract when he or she is shipped to basic traini ng or when servicemember transfers from an active component to reserve component recruiting and retention an overview of fy2006 and fy2007 results for active and

the vitality of todays allvolunteer military recruiting recruiting has been called the life bl ood of the military without robust ability to bring new members into the military the services would lack sufficient manpower to carry out mission essential task s in the near term and would lack sufficient pool of entrylevel personnel to develop into the midlevel and upperlevel leaders of the future to protect agains t this the active and reserve components set goals for new recruit accessions2 each fiscal year officer and enlisted goals arehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32965crs2 3 this quantity goal is normally based primarily on the difference between the congressionally authorized end strength of th component for given fiscal year and the projected number of currently serving personnel that component will retain through the end of the year officer and enlisted accession goals are set separately to simplify somewhat if component has an authorized end streng th of 200000 enlisted personnel in given year and it projects that it will retain 175000 of its current enlisted members through the year it will set goal of bringing in approximately 25000 new enlisted recruits for that year actually the goal will be slightly higher to account for those new recruits who are discharged early usually while in initial entry training the actual number of new enlisted recruits component needs however may chan ge during the year as new projections are made about the retention of currently serving enlisted personnel or if the component must increase or decrease the total size of its force 4 dod measures listed recruit quality based on two criteria graduation from high school and score on the armed forces qualification test afqt since fy1993 dods benchmarks for recruit quality stipulate that at least 90 of new recruits must be high school diploma graduates and at least 60 must score above average on the afqt 5 the dep is made up of those individuals who have signed contract to join the military at future date up to one year in advance but who have not yet shipped to basic training in fy2004 and fy2005 the army drew heavily from its dep and even then in 2005 missed the annual quantity goal 6 in fy2005 the armys recruiting mission was 80000 and 73373 new recruits were accessed for shortfall of 83 7 while the standard measure of recruiting success for the various components is the achievement of their accession goals the ability to achieve contract goals is often seen as leading indicator of recru iting strength or weakness 8 one reason for this reduction in the size of the dep was the decision to increase the size of the army in early 2004which created need to send more people to basic training in both fy2004 and fy2005 than had previously been planned 9 sectioin

data presented in table 1 below reflects that all of the active components met their enlisted accession quantity goals in fy2006 and fy2007 at the start of fy2006 there was signif icant concern that the army would not be able to meet its quantity goal due to the size of the goal 80000 individuals the small size of its delayed entry pool dep5 and the fact that the army had missed its fy2005 recruiting goal by over 6500 new recruits6 typically the army likes to have about 35 of the coming years accession goal enrolled in the dep7 but at the start of fy2006 the armys dep was onl about 12 of its fy2006 accession goal8 the army met this challenge by raising the cap on category iv soldiers from two to four percent adding over 2500 recruiters to the existing recru iting force increasing the services advertising budget raising the maximum age for enlistees from 35 to 40 and then to 429 relaxing some existing standards such as thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32965crs3 9 continued to 42 10

continued and the army ended fy2006 with only 12000 potential new recruits in the dep which was just 15 of the mission requirement for fy2007 for fy2007 the armys accession goal was again 80000 individuals for the third consecutive year while struggling in may and june the army recovered late in the year and ended fy2007 with 1005 of its accession mission by accessing 80407 new members in september the army introduced new quick ship bonus that was available to any recruit who agreed to report to basic training within 30 days of enlistment while this incen tive aided in achieving the

the army in comparison to fy2005 in fy2005 87 of army recruits were high school diploma graduates but in fy2006 only 81 were this latter figure was well below th dod benchmark of 9013 additionally the proportion of army recruits who scored above average on the afqt dropped from 67 in fy2005 to 61 in fy2006 while this pr oportion is above the dod benchmark of 60 the size of the decline is noteworthy and is the lowest level since 1985 also in fy2006 the army for the second consecutive year accepted much higher proportion of category iv recruits th at is recruits who score in the 10th

dod maximum of 414and in fy2006 the proportion remained high at 38 the data for fy2007 confirms tinuing decline in recruit qua lity for the army as measured primarily by the numbe r of high school diploma graduates being recruited for the year only 79 of ar my accessions were high school diploma graduates although the ratio who scored above average on the afqt remained stable at 61 as result fy2007 represents the fourth consecutive year of decline in one or both of the quality indicators in ddition it has been reported that the army accessed 3200 category iv recruits fo r fy2007 meeting the dod maximum of 4 percent in this category the navy air force and marine corp s all exceeded the dod quality standards in each category for fy2007 though at sligh tly lower levels compared to fy2006 for the navy and marine corps reserve components the recruiting data show that only two of the reserve components the marine corps reserve and the air force reserve met their enlisted quantity goals in fy2006 see table 3 though the army na tional guard and air national guard were very close for fy2006 the army national guard dr amatically improved its recruiting performance achieving 986 of its accessi on goal of 70000 goal significantly higher than the target of 63000 in fy2005 with total of 69042 recruits in fy2006 the army national guard ended th year with an endstrength of 346288 about 989 of its authorized endstrengt h of 350000 this reversed troubling trend that began in fy2005 similarly the army reserve reflected some improvement in its ability to meet its accession quantity goals achieving 954 of its accession goal of 36032 goal that was significantly higher than fy2005 this helped the army reserve achieve modest increase in endstrength by the end of fy2006 ending the year at 189975 but still at only 924 of their authorized level the marine corps reserve and the air force reserve continued to succeed in meeting their quantity accession goals during fy2006 achieving 1004 and 1058 of goal respectively the air national guard enhanced its recru iting performance to 974 but failed to meet its recruit quantity goal for the third consecutive year even though it continues to achieve its authorized strength the significance of the navy reserves recru it quantity shortfall should be assessed in light of current plans to reduce the size of the navy reserve15httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32965crs6 15 continued years in fy2005 the authorized endstrength was 83400 2500 less than it was in fy2004 dropped to 73100 for fy2006 and to 71300 for fy2007 the fy2008 national defense authorization act specifies an author ized endstrength for the naval reserve of 67800 for fy2007 quantity shortfalls were ex perienced by both the army national guard and the air national guard in both instances however the shortfalls were relatively small3348 for the army nati onal guard from total annual mission of 70000 and only 715 for the air national guard the army reserve having missed its quantity goal for three consecutive years fys 2004 2005 and 2006 rebounded in fy 2007 achieving 1006 of its annual requirement this enabled the army reserve to maintain its

in spite of very difficult recruiting environment this is especially true for the army since it exceeded its large mission of 80000 in both years quality concerns however persist with many analysts criticizing perceived relaxation of standards this is especially true for the army which significantly missed the hsdg goal recruiting high sc hool diploma graduates as 79 of its recruits there are number of likely causes for these recruiting difficulties one factor that can have powerful impact on military recruiting is the state of the economy military recruiting is generally easier in times of high unemployment and more difficult in times of low unemployment historical data indicate that unemployment dropped from 2003 through 2007 falling from 60 in 2003 to 46 for 2006 and 200716 institutions of higher education also compete with the military for manpower over the past 25 years the pr oportion of high sc hool graduates goinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32965crs8 17 department of education digest of education statistics 2003 table 186 18 for example in november 2002 survey 60 of the men and 54 of the women surveyed indicated that they would recommend military service to young person who came to them for advice by may 2004 those figures had dropped to 57 for men and 37 for women also in the november 2002 survey 59 of white respondents 53 of african american respondents and 51 of hispanic respondents i ndicated they would recommend military service to young person who came to them for advice by may 2004 the figures had changed to 47 for white respondents 28 of african american respondents and 56 for hispanic respondents see mothers attitudes towards enlistment produced by the department of defenses joint advertising market research and studies program may 2004 19 influencers are those adults who regularly in teract with youth such as parents coaches teachers and mentors 20 see for example washington post schools and military face off june 19 2005 a3 new york times growing problems for military recruiters parents june 3 2005 a1 usa today army and marines shift focus to wary parents april 5 2005 a1directly on to college has increased from about half to about twothirds17 this historically high proportion of college bound youth reduces the size of the pool which military recruiters have traditionally targeted oung people who have recently graduated from high school however while these factors contribute to challenging recruiting environment in general it is important to recognize that recruiting shortfalls have been most severe in the army and its reserve components the army reserve and the army national guard thus in addition to broa d social and economic forces which are likely having dampening effect on recruiting generally there are also other factors which appear to be underc utting recruiting for the army in particular one factor likely affecting recruiting for the army army reserve and army national guard is the major role they are playing in the iraq conflict survey research conducted in 2004 indicates that the certain segments of the adult population especially women and african americans have become less likely to recommend military service to young people since the war in iraq began18 as major source of recruits for the army nd its reserve components are young people without prior military service p rimarily those who have r ecently graduated from high school negative ttitudes towards military service among those adults who are youth influencers19can have powerful effect there have been reports that army recruiters are having difficulty signing up hi gh school seniors especially those below the age of 18 who require parental consent to enlist even among those old enough to enlist without parental consent oppositi on to military service by parents or other influencers may discourage them from joining20 another factor affecting recruiting fo r the army and its reserve components is the ongoing effort to increase the size of the active army in order to expand the active army has increased its goal for new recruits from 73800 in 2003 to 80000 in 2005 2006 2007 and 2008 thus providing active ar my recruiters with goal that is more difficult to reach additionally this affects army reserve componenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32965crs9 21 the obligated term of service for enliste d personnel is determined by their initial enlistment contract the normal service obligation incurred is eight years which may be served in the active component in the reserve component or some combination of both for example an individual may enlist for four years of service in the active component followed by four years of service in the reserve component see 10 usc 651 and dod instructions 130425 22 if too few people stay in the military will suffer from lack of experienced leaders decreased military efficiency and lower job satisfaction if too many people stay in promotion opportunities decrease and higher pe rcentage of people must be involuntarily separated in order to prevent the organizati on from becoming top heavy with middle and upper level leaders each of these outcomes in turn can have negative impact on recruiting by making the military less attractive career option 23 see table 5 for definitions of the various retention categories for each of the servicesrecruiting as well as the active army is now competing more vigorously with the army reserve and army national guard for some of the same potential recruits the comparatively high rates of mobiliz ation in the army reserve components in recent years may also be undercutting thei r recruiting efforts major source of recruits for both the army reserve and th army national guard is people leaving the active army these are people who want to embark on civilian career but still wish to maintain their military affiliati on and certain military benef its concerns about being promptly called back to active service via mobilization orders and deployed to iraq afghanistan or some other location may be discouraging reserve affiliation retention the term retention refers to the ra at which military personnel voluntarily choose to stay in the military after their orig inal obligated term of service has ended21 imbalances in the retention rate can cause problems within the military personnel system22 common retention concern is that too few people will stay in thereby creating shortage of experienced leaders decreasing military efficiency and lowering job satisfaction active components the retention data presented in table 5 show that the active components met or exceeded nearly all their goals for enlisted personnel in fy2006 of particular note is the strong retention performance of the army and marine corps both of which are heavily involved in combat opera tions in iraq and afghanistan both of these services exceeded thei r retention goals in fy2006 often by large margins the navy was the only service which failed to meet retention goal in fy2006 falling about 10 percentage points short of its goal for initial term sailors and less than one percentage point short of its goal for mid career sailors23 strong retention performance continued in fy2007 for the army of particular note is the armys performance in the in itial term category these soldiers about to complete their active military service which likely involved deployment to ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32965crs10 24 this shortfall could be attributed to reduc tions in air force endstrength over the past several years combat zone and faced with potential multip deployments to iraq or afghanistan if they reenlist are retaining well above the expectations of most observers however the marine corps experienced shortfall in this same category indicating potential problem if the tr end continues the navy for the second consecutive year missed its retention goal in the initial term category possibly part of the multi year plan to reduce navy endstrength uncharacteristically the air force missed its retention goals in all three categories after very successful and strong performance in fy2005 and fy2006 however the actual fy2007 shortfall represents less than 1000 airmen24 table 5 active component enlisted retention data fy2006 and fy2007 service retention categoryfy2006 goalfy2006 achievedfy2006

retention goals reserve components the department of defense tracks rese rve component retention via attrition rates attrition rates are measure of the ratio of people who leave the reserves in given year they are the inverse of reten tion rates which measure the ratio of people who stay in the service attrition goals are thus maximum rate or ceiling which the various reserve components try not to

crs report rl31682 the military draft and possible war with iraq by robert goldich for more detailed discussion of arguments for and against draftanalysis the fact that retention for the active and reserve components has remained generally strong in recent years may seem counterintuitive given the high operational tempo and large scale reserve mobilizations that have occurred since september 11 2001 and especially since the invasion and occupation of iraq however number of studies conducted in the late 1990s indicate that deployments can enhance retention perhaps by providing partic ipants with sense of accomplishment25 however some of these studies also indicate that after certain threshold level this positive effect diminishes or becomes negative additionally these studies focused on retention behavior during the 1990s when the deployments were generally shorter and less hostile than at present options for congress congress has number of options to address any shortfalls in recruiting and retention the traditional po licy levers used by c ongress and dod include increasing funding for advertising increasing the num ber of recruiters and providing larger enlistment and reenlistment bonuses some have also argued that the high operational tempo must be reduced in order to bolster current recruiting efforts and to prevent retention problems in the future to facilitate this they have advocated either increasing the size of military pecially the active component army and marine corps or reducing the us milita ry presence in iraq and other places others have advocated reinstating th draft something which would require congressional action to impleme nt opponents of the draft however argue that even if it were politically feasible conscripti on would not generate the type of highly motivated and highly trained individuals which the military has come to rely on26 those particularly concerned about rese rve component recruiting and retention often urge reduction in the number of re serve personnel deployed to places like iraq or shortening of the duration of reserve mobilizations for those who do get called up doing so however could put additi onal operational strain s on active component forces
