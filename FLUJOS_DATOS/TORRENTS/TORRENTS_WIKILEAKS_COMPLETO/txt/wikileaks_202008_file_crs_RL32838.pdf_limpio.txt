legislative actions 95th congress through 110th congress background and analysis the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr consists of 19 million acres in northeast alaska it is administered by the fish and wildlife service fws in the department of the interior doi its 15 million acre coastal plain on the north slope of the brooks range is currently view ed as one of the most likely undeveloped us onshore oil and gas prospects accord ing to the us geological survey there is small chance that taken together th fields on this federal land could hold as much economically recoverable oil as th giant field at prudhoe bay found in 1967 on the coastal plain west of anwr that stateowned portion of the coastal plain is now estimated to have held 11 billion to 13 billion barrels of oil at the time at the same time the refuge and especially the coastal plain is home to wide variety of plants and animals the pres ence of caribou polar bears grizzly bears wolves migratory birds and many other sp ecies in nearly undisturbed state has led some to call the area ameri cas serengeti the refuge and two neighboring parks in canada have been proposed for an in ternational park and several species found in the area including polar bears caribou migratory bird s and whales are protected by international treaties or agreements the analysis below covers first the ec onomic and geological factors that have triggered new interest in velopment followed by the philosophical biological and environmental quality factors that have triggered opposition to it that analysis is followed by history of cong ressional actions on this issue with focus on those in the 107th congress through the 109th congress see tables 1 and 2 for votes in the house and senate from the 96th congress through the 110th congress the conflict between high oil potential and nearly pristine nature creates dilemma should congress open the area for oil and gas development or should the areas ecosystem be given permanent prot ection from development what factors should determine whether to open the area if the area is opened how can damages be avoided minimized or mitigated to what extent should congress legislate special management of the area if it is deve loped and to what extent should federal agencies be allowed to manage the area under existing law if congress takes action the refuge remains closed to

controversy for decades from legislation in the 1970s to 1989 oil spill to more recent efforts to use anwr resources to address energy needs or to help balance the federal budget in novemb er 1957 doi announced plans to withdraw lands in northeastern alaska to create an arctic national wildlife range the first group actually to propose to congress that the area become national wildlife range in recognition of the many game species found in the area was the tanana valley alaska sportsmens ssociation in 1959 on december 6 1960 after statehood the secretary of the interior issued public land order 2214 reserving the 95 million acre area as the arctic national wildlife range the 1970s in 1971 congress enacted the alaska native cl aims settlement act ancsa pl 92203 85 stat 688 to re solve all native aboriginal land claims against the united states ancsa provided for monetary payments and also created village corporations that received the surface estate to approximately 22 million acres of lands in alaska village selection rights included the right to c hoose the surface estate surface rights as opposed to rights to exploit any energy or minerals beneath the surface in certain amount of lands within the national wildlife refugehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs6 2 additional land was added in later years bringing the current total to 193 million acres portions of the refuge added in 1980 and late r were not included in the wilderness system 3 for more on wilderness designation see crs report rl31447 wilderness overview and statistics by ross w gorte 4 this report will

to three townships along the coast of anwr ancsa also created regional corporations which could select subsurface rights to some lands and full title to others subsurface rights in national wildlife refuges were not available but inlieu selections to substitute for such lands were provided the 1980s in 1980 congress enacted the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca pl 96487 94 stat 2371 which included several sections about anwr the arctic range was renamed the arc tic national wildlife refuge and was expanded mos tly southward and westward to include an additional 92 million acres2 section 7023 of anilca designat ed much of the original range as wilderness area but did not include the coastal plain3 anilca defined the coastal plain as the lands on specified map language that was interpreted as excluding most native lands even though these lands are geographically part of the coastal plain4 section 1002 of anilca directed th at study of the coastal plain which therefore is often referred to as the 1002 area and its resources be completed within five years and nine months of enactment the resulting 1987 report was called the 1002 report or the final legislative environmental impact statement fleis section 1003 of anilca prohibited oil and gas development in the entire refuge or leasing or other developmen t leading to production of oil and gas from the range unless authorized by an act of congress5 from 1990 to 2000 in recent years there have been various attempts to authorize opening anwr to energy development in the 104th congress the fy1996 budget reconciliation bill hr 2491 53125344 would ve opened the 1002 area to energy development but the measure was vetoed as many observers had expected president clinton cited the anwr sections as one of his reasons for the veto httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs7 while bills were introduced the 105th congress did not debate the anwr issue in the 106th congress bills to designate the

were introduced to designate the 1002 area as wilderness the initial version of the senate energy bill s 14 had provision to open the refuge and chairman domenici stated that he did not plan to include one after many weeks of debate in the senate as prospects of passage seemed to be dimming senators agreed to drop the bill they had been debating and to go back to the bill passed in the democraticcontrolled senate of the 107th congress on july 31 2003 they substituted the language of that bill for that of the housepassed hr 6 there was widespread agreement that the unusual procedure was means of getting the bill to conference members including chairman domenici indicated at the time their expectation that the bill that emerged from conference would likely be markedly different from the version of hr 6 that d just been passed by the senate one of the key differences between the two bills was the presence of anwr development language in the house version and its ab sence in the senate version conference chairman domenici included the house title on anwr in his working draft but in the end the conference co mmittee deleted anw r development features in the conference

presidents proposed fy2005 budget assumed legislation w ould be passed that would open the refuge and would therefore produce revenues this proposal would have assisted efforts to assume anwr revenues

number of nearly identical bills have been introduced in the 110th congress the analysis below focuses on s 2973 which has been pl aced on the senate legislative calendar with additional information where other bills differ markedly list of bills is found belo w under selected legislation in the 110th congress environmental direction should congress open the refuge to energy leasing it could choose to leave environmental matters to administrative agencies under existing laws alternatively cong ress could impose higher standard of environmental protection because the area is in national wildlife refuge or because of the fragility of the arctic environment or it could legislate lower standard to facilitate development the degree of discretion given to the administering agency could also affect the stringency of envi ronmental protection for example congress could include provisions requiri ng use of the best availa ble technology or the best commercially available technol ogy or similar general sta ndards alternatively it could limit judicial review of environmental standards another issue would be the use of gravel and water resources essen tial for oil explora tion and development congress could also leave environmental protection largely up to the administering agency to be accomplished through regulations or through lease stipulations the former require public notice and comment while the latter do not involve public participation and may provide fewer public enforcemen t options other legislative issues include limitations on miles of roads or other surface occupancy the adequacy of existing pollution standards prevention and treatment of spills the adequacy of current environmental require ments and aircraft overflig hts among other things 108th congress the house bill did not name lead agency but since 30403a stated that the program would be administered under the mineral leasing act blm seemed likely to lead the house bill 30407a required the secretary to administer the leasing program so as to result in significant adverse effect on fish and wildlife their habitat and the environment and to require the application of the best commercially availabl technology the house bill 30403a2 also required that this program be done in manner that ensures the receipt of fair market value by the public for the mineral resources to be

and the environmental impacts of development on aspect of the debate in congress has focused on the size of footprints in th development and produc tion phases of energy leasing the term footprint does not have universa lly accepted definition and therefore the types of structures falling under footprint restriction are arguable eg the inclusion of exploratory structures roads gravel mines port facilities etc13 in addition it is unclear whether ex ploratory structures or structures on native lands would be included unde r any provision limiting footprints14 the new map accompanying s 1932 in the 109th congress included the native lands in its definition of the coastal plain leasing ar ea but how the federal leasing program would have applied to t hose lands was not clear see new maps belowhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs16 development advocates have emphasized the total acreage of surface disturbance while opponents have emphasized the dispersal of not only the structures themselves but also their impacts over mu ch of the 15 million acres of the 1002 area one single consolidated facility of 2000 acres 31 square miles limit commonly supported by development advocates woul d not permit full development of the 1002 area instead full development of the 1002 area would require that facilities even if limited to 2000 acres in total surface area be widely dispersed dispersal is necessary due to the limits of lateral or extended reach drilling the current north slope record for this technology is 4 miles if that record were matched on all sides of single pad at most about 4 of th coastal plain could be developed from that pad if the current world record 7 mile s were matched about 11 of the 1002 area could be accessed from single compact 2000acre facility in addition drilling opponents argue that energy facilities ve impacts on recreation subsistence vegetation and wildlife we ll beyond areas actually c overed by development however global climate change may complicate efforts to limit footprints in the last 25 years the duration of the ice season when the tundra is frozen sufficiently to permit travel and temperatures are low enough to permit constr uction of ice roads and ice drill pads has decreased from over 200 days per year to less than 100 days if industry is forced to return to the olde r more expensive use of gravel roads and pads 2000 acre limit on the footprint of development could constrain full development severely by making marginal fields too expensive for production alternatively if costs escalate th 2000 acre limit could be dropped to allow industry to exploit available resources more fully 108th congress the house bill 30407d9 provided for consolidation of leasing operations among other thin gs consolidation would tend to reduce environmental impacts of development section 30407d3 would have gone further to require consistent with the provisions of section 6503 which included ensuring receipt of fair market value that the secretary administer the leasing program to ensure that the maximu m amount of surface acreage covered by production and support f acilities including airstrips nd any areas covered by gravel berms or piers for the support of pipe lines does not exceed 2000 acres on the coastal plain the acreage limitation was added in floor amendment by representative wilson nm to the h ouse bill on april 10 2003 yeas 226 nays 202 roll call 134 the terms used were not defined in the b ill nor discussed in the committee report and therefore the full set of structures that might have fallen under the

distributed around the refuge in addition native lands might not have been limited by this provision see native lands below 109th congress hr 5429 7d9 provided for consolidation of leasing operations

generally the alaska natives inuit along the north slope have supported anwr development while the natives of interior alaska gwichin have opposed it though neither group is unanimous ancsa resolved aboriginal claims against the united states by among other things creating village corporations that could select surface nds and regional corporations that could select surface and subsurface ri ghts as well kaktovik i nupiat village kic selected surface lands originally approximately three townships on the coastal plain of anwr but these kic lands were administratively excluded from being considered as within the administratively defined 1002 coastal plain fourth township was added by ancila and is within the defi ned coastal plain the four townships totaling approximately 92000 acr are all within the refuge and subject to its regulations the arctic slope regional corporation asrc obtained subsurface rights beneath the kic lands pursuant to 1983 land exchange agreement in

applying to development on the federal lands depending on how legislation is framed the extent to which the native lands could be regulated to protect the environment is uncertain given the status of

report rs22326 legislative maps of anwr by m lynne corn and pamela baldwin108th congress the house bill would have repealed the anilca prohibition on oil and gas development if oil and gas development were authorized for the federal lands in the refuge it app ears that development could occur on the more than 100000 acres of native lands arguably free of any acreage limitation applying to development on the federal lands the extent to which the native lands could be regulated to protect the envir onment is uncertain given the status of allotments and some of the language in the 1983 agreement with asrc16 109th congress the bills in the 109th congress contained identical language concerning repeal to that in the house bill in the 108th congress and therefore the same apparent opening of native lands see also new maps below 110th congress s 2973 had the same language as in the house bill in the 108th congress and referre d to the same map new maps both the house and senate created new maps of the coastal plain that would be the subject of leasing17 the coastal plain was defined in 1002 of anilca as the area indicated on an august 1980 map the 1980 map is now missing an administrative articulation of the boundary was authorized by 103b of anilca and has the force of law since the 1980 map is missing evaluating whether the administrative descripti on properly excluded the native lands is impossible and as noted the fourth native township selected ter is not excluded from the coastal plain by that descrip tion the legal description required under anilca was completed in 1983 48 fed reg 16838 apr 19 1983 50 cfr part 37 app i but questions also surround this description18 the description excluded three native townships from the articulated coastal plain some bills in various congresses also have exclude d these same native lands by referring to the 1980 map and the administrative description 109th congress19 s 1932 4001a provided new map provided by the us geological survey usgs nd dated september 2005 to accompany its submission to the budget committee for reconciliation this map included all native lands in the coastal plain20 however the bill text did not refer to the native lands and the extent of federal control of native lands that was intended or accomplished by the map change is not clear for example the bill directed 5050 revenue split between the state of alaska and the federal government thereby possibly giving rise to native claims fo r compensation for revenues from their lands if this revenue provision wa s not intended to apply to native lands it was not clear whether other provisions also might not appl also some of the terms in the 1983 agreement with asrc call for an express congressional override to negate some

in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr its terms and the text of the bill did not discuss the native lands or the agreement the defense bill also used usgs map da ted september 2005 24 it is not clear whether the map is the same as the one referred to in the senate bill hr 5429 did not refer to map but inst ead defined the coastal plain as the area described in 50 cfr part 37 app i the administrative articulation of the coastal plain as discussed this re gulation currently excludes three native townships but leaves the fourth within the coastal plain and arguably the leasing provisions would have applied to it the house bill raised the possibility that the defined coastal plain could be expanded or reduced at some later time through rule making procedures 110th congress s 2973 referred to the 2005 usgs map see discussion above revenue disposition another issue is whether congress may validly provide for disposition of revenues according to formula other than the essentially 90 state 10 federal split specified in the alaska statehood act21 court in alaska v united states 35 fed cl 685 701 1996 indicat ed that the language in the statehood act means that alas ka is to be treated like other states for federal leasing conducted under the neral leasing act mla which contains 90 10 split arguably congress could establish different nonmla leasing regimen with different ratio for example the separate leasing arrangements that govern the national petroleum reserveal aska where the revenuesharing formula is 5050 but this issue was not before the court and hence remains an open issue in the past number of anwr bills ve specified the disposition of the federal portion of the revenue s among the spending purposes have been federal land acquisition energy res earch and federal assistan ce to local governments in alaska to mitigate the impact of energy development amounts would have been either permanently or annua lly appropriated in the tter case there would be little practical distinction between annually appropriating funds based on anwr revenues and annually appropr iating funds from the general treasur if there is particular purpose specified for leasing revenues the resulting revenues would be deposited in the treasury where they would be ava ilable for any general government use 108th congress several sections of the house bill related to revenues section 30409 would have provide d that 50 of adjusted re venues be paid to alaska and the balance deposited in the us treas ury as miscellaneous receipts except for the portion allocated to fund to assist alaska communities in addressing local impacts of energy development under 30412 the assistance fund was not to exceed 11 million in an unspent balance with 5 million available for annual appropriation more fundamentally under 6503a the secretary was to establish and implement leasing program under the mineral leasing act yet 30412 directed revenue sharing program different fro m that in the mla section 30403ahttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs20 established leasing program under the ml yet provided for different revenue disposition which could have raised additi onal questions of lega l validity if the alternative disposition were struck down nd the revenue provisi ons were determined to be severable it is possible that alas ka could have receive d 90 of the revenues from anwr was identical to 6503a establishing leasing program under the mla in the 107th congress in addition in the house version of hr 6 30409c would have allowed certain revenues from bids for leasing to be appropriated for energy assistance for lowincome households this provision was lacking in hr 4514 the only difference between the two bills 109th congress under 3a of hr 5429 the secretary was to establish and implement leasing program for anwr in accordance with the bill and 9 stated that notwithstanding any other provision of law revenues were to be shared 5050 between the federal government and alas ka with some special provisions on the federal share it can be argued that th leasing program is not under the mla and hence the different revenuesharing provi sions were not contrary to the alaska statehood act however if court st ruck down the revenue sharing provisi on it would then have to deter mine if that provision was severable whether congress would have enacted the rest of the stat ute without the flawed provision hr 5429 did not have severability provision that stated the intent of congress in this regard if court both struck down the revenuesharing provi sion and found it to be severable then alaska could receive 90 of anwr revenues similarly s 1932 also did not state that leasing would be under the mla and also set out many requirements th at differed from those of the mla notwithstanding any other provision of law it too directed that receipts from leasing and operations authorized under this section be divided equally between the state of alaska and the federal government because of the change in the senate definition of coastal plain and the accompanying map the bill might have included revenues from native lands in the 5050 split the defense bill division d 1 also provided for 5050 split and contained vari ous provisions for distribution of certain percentages of the federal sh are to various purposes including hurricane relief in addition 14 of division c of the defense bill contained seve rability provision that provided explicitly that if any portion of either division c or d were held to be unconstitutional the remainder of the two divisions would not be affected it is not clear to what provisions the severability language might have applied as discussed some issues regarding the revenue split might remain but those issues might rest on contractual interpretations rather than constitutional concerns however if the 5050 revenue split were struck down alaska could receive 90 of the anwr revenues and if so fewer federal f unds would be available for programs premised on the 50 federal share 110th congress s 2973 did not establish the leasing program under the mla and notwithstanding the minera l leasing act or any other provision of law it too directed 122 that receipt s from leasing and operations authorized under this subtitle be allocated 50 to th federal government of the remainder it set aside 35 million for fund for local g overnment impact aid with the balance to the state of alaska it contained severability clause regarding revenuesharinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs21 notably the bills in the 110th congress differed most widely in their allocations for revenues compared to allocations propos ed in previous congresses while most continued the tradition of allocating an even split between federal and state governments four bills hr 3089 h r 6001 hr 6165 and hr 6207 allocated 75 to the federal governme nt and 25 to the state one bill s 2758 allocated 100 to the fe deral

6009 hr 6107 hr 6165 hr 6207 and s 2758 as well as s 2973 had provisions for community impact assistance with amounts ranging from 5 million to 35 million project labor agreements plas recurring issue in federal and federally funded projects is whether project owners or contract ors should be required by agreement to use union workers plas are agreements between project owner or main contractor and the unions representing craft workers that establish the terms and conditions of work that will apply for the particular project the agreement may also specify source such as union hi ring hall to supply the craft workers typically the agreement is binding on all contractors and subcontractors working on the project and specifies wage rates and be nefits discusses pro cedures for resolving labor and jurisdictional di sputes and includes nost rike clause proponents of plas including construction and other uni ons argue that plas ensure reliable efficient labor source help keep costs down and ensure access for union members to federal and federally funded projects opponents including nonunion firms and their supporters believe that plas infl ate costs reduce competition and unfairly

to negotiate to obtain project labor agreement the secretary was to do so recognizing the governments proprietary interest in labor stability and the ability of construction labor and management to meet the pa rticular needs and conditions of projects to be developed 109th congress hr 5429 6b directed th secretary to require lessees in the 1002 area to negotiate to obtain project labor agreement recognizing the governments proprietary interest in labor stability and the ability of construction labor and management to meet the particul ar needs and conditions of projects to be developed hr

congresseshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs22 22 the energy policy and conservation act of 1975 pl 94163 the 1977 amendments to the export administration act pl 9552 and pl 95223 and the export administration act of 1979 pl 9672 which replaced the export administration act of 1969oil export restrictions export of north slope oil in general and any anwr oil in particular has been an issue beginning at least with the authorization of the transalaska pipeline taps in 1973 and continuing into the current anwr debate much of the taps route is on fe deral lands and the mla prohibits export of oil transported through pipelines gran ted rightsofway over federal lands 16 usc 185u the transalaska pipeline authorization act pl 93153 43 usc 1651 et seq specified that oil shipped through it c ould be exported only under restrictive conditions subsequent legislation strengthened the export restrictions further22 oil began to be shipped th rough the pipeline in increasing amounts as north slope oilfield devel opment grew in the 1970s and 1980s with exports effectively banned most of the north slope oil went to west coast destinations the rest was shipped to the gulf coast via the panama canal or overland across the isthmus in the early and mid 1990s the combination of california north slope and federal offshore production pl us imports produced large crude oil supplies relative to demand california prices fell causing complaints from california and north slope producers by 1995 several years of low world oil pr ices and relative calm in the mideast had reduced concern about pe troleum supplies market forces eventually created pressure to change the law in 1995 pl 10458 30 usc 185s was enacted title ii of which amended the mla to pr ovide that oil transported through taps may be exported unless the president finds after considering stated criteria that it is not in the national interest north slope exports rose to peak of 74000 barrelsday in 1999 representing 7 of north slope production north slope oil exports ceased voluntarily in may 2000 and have since b een minimal to none as alaska producers found ample demand in us markets at world prices if congress wished to limit export of any oil from the 1002 areaby applying the restriction to oil transporte d through taps the restric tion might not be effective oil shipment via tanker could become practical if current warming trends in the arctic continue and if cr ude oil prices provide suffi cient incentive recent proposed bans on export of anwr oil have not been tied to shipment through taps 108th congress the house bill 30406a8 would have required the prohibition on the export of oil produced in the 1002 area as condition of lease 109th congress hr 5429 6a8 would have prohibited the export of oil produced in the 1002 area as condition of lease s 1932 4001g contained similar provision as did hr 2863 12 however inasmuch as other north slope oil is allowed to be exported it would appear that prohibiting the export of anwr oil could be moot producers iming to tap the export market would substitute other north slope oil to meet the demand 110th congress s 2973 121 had the same terms as those in hr 5429 in the previous congress as with these earlier bills substitution of anwr oil withhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs23 oil from other fields outside of anwr coul d reduce the effect of the export ban however because the limit was not cast in rms of the transportation of oil taps vs tankers the export ban would still ve applied even with shift to tanker transport nepa compliance the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa pl 91190 42 usc 4321 requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement eis to examine the effects of major federal actions with significant effects on the environment and to provide public involvement in agency decisions the last full eis examining the effects of energy development in anwr was the final legislative environmental impact statement fleis completed in 1987 and some observers assert that new eis is needed to support development now nepa requires an eis to analyze an array of alternatives including action alternative some development supporters would like to see the process truncated in light of past analyses and to sten production development opponents and nepa supporters argue that the 19year gap and changed circumstances since the last analysis necessitates thorough update nd stress the flaws they found in the 1987 fleis 108th congress section 30403c of the house bill deemed the 1987 fleis adequate with respect to actions by the secretary to develop leasing regulations yet required the secretary to prepare an eis with respect to other actions some of which might require only usually shorter nvironmental assessment consideration of alternatives was to be limited to two choices preferred option and single leasing alternative generally an eis analyzes range of alternatives including action alternative 109th congress section 3c of the hr 5429 deemed the 1987 fleis to satisfy nepa requirements with respect to prelease activities and the development and promulgation of leasing re gulations and required the secretary to prepare an eis of all other actions authorized by the subtitle before the first lease sale consideration of alternatives was to be limited to two choices preferred leasing action and single leasing alternative compliance with the subsection was deemed to satisfy all requirements to an alyze the environmental effects of proposed leasing hr 2863 division c 3c wa s essentially identical s 1932 4001c had similar provisions but did not expressly require an eis for leasing 110th congress the terms of s 2973 112c2 were identical to those of hr 5429 in the 109th congress compatibility with refuge purposes under current law for the management of national wildlife refu ges 16 us c668dd and under 43 cfr 310153 for alaskan refuges specifically an activity may be allowed in refuge only if it is compatible with the purposes of the particular refuge and with those of the refuge system as whole 108th congress section 30403c of the house bill stated that the oil and gas leasing program and activities in the coastal plain were deemed to be compatible with the purposes for which anwr was blished and that further findings or decisions were required to implement this termination this language appearedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs24 intended to answer the compatibility question and to eliminate the usual compatibility determination processes the general statement that leasing activities are compatible arguably compassed necessary support activities such as construction and operation of port facilities staging areas personnel centers etc 109th congress section 3c of the h r 5429 3c of hr 2863 and 4001c of s 1932 also stated that the ergy leasing program and activities in the coastal plain were deemed to be compatible with the purposes for which anwr was established and that further findings or decisions were required to implement this determination 110th congress section 112e1 of s 2973 had compatibility provision identical to provisions in previous congresses judicial review leasing proponents urge that any anwr leasing program be put in place promptly and argue that ex pediting curtailing or prohibiting judicial review is desirable to achieve that goal judicial review can be expedited through procedural changes such as reducing the time limits within which suits must be filed avoiding some level of review curtailing the scope of the review or increasing the burden imposed on challengers in the past bills before congress have combined various elements 108th congress the house bill 30408 contem plated prompt action to put leasing program in place and had sections on expedited judicial review it would have required that complain ts be filed within 90 days hr 6 30408a1 and 2 appeared to contradict each other as to wher suits were to be filed and it is possible part of sentence was omitted hr 6 30408a3 would also have limited the scope of review by stating that revi ew of secretaria l decision including environmental analyses was to be limited to whether the secretary complied with the terms of that title of hr 6 and be base d on the administrative record and that the secretarys analysis of environmental effects was presumed to be correct unless shown otherwise by clear and convincing ev idence to the contrary this standard in this context arguably would make overturning decision more difficult 109th congress hr 5429 8 required that any complaints seeking judicial review be filed within 90 days section 8a2 provided th at suits were to be filed in the court of appeals in washington dc as did hr 2863 8a hr 5429 8a3 would also have limited the scope of review by stating that review of secretarial decision including environmental analyses would be limited to whether the secretary complied with the terms of the anwr subtitle that it would be based on the administrative record and that the secretarys analysis of environmental effects is presumed to be correct unle ss shown otherwise by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary this standard is unclear but in this context arguably would make overturning decision more difficult s 1932 and hr 2863 4001c and 8a respectively we re similar s 1932 omitted the presumption concerning the secretarys analysis of environmental effects 110th congress section 117 of s 2973 also required filing within 90 days in the court of appeals in washington dc and contained the same presumptionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs25 as those in hr 5429 in the 109th congress in addition 117b provided that the administrative procedure act or any ot her method of bringing suit against the federal government does not pply suits to enforce this law could only be brought pursuant to the specific provisions in 117 special areas some have supporte d setting aside certain areas in the coastal plain for protection of their ecological or cultural values this could be done by designating the areas specifically in legisla tion or by authorizing the secretary to set aside areas to be selected after enactment the fleis identified four special areas that together total more than 52000 acres the secretary could be required to restrict or prevent development in these areas or an others that may seem significant or to select among areas if an acreage limitation on such setasides is imposed 108th congress the house bill 3 0403e allowed the secretary to set aside up to 45000 acres of special areas and named one specific area in which leases if permitted would forbid surface occupancy as ntioned above the fleis identified four special areas whic h together total more than 52000 acres so the secretary would have been required to select among these areas or any others that may seem significant section 30403f also stated that the closure authority in the anwr title was to be the secretarys sole authority which might limit possible secretarial actions under the endanger ed species act pl 93205 16 usc 1531ff hr 770 and s 543 would have designated the entire 1002 area as wilderness 109th congress hr 5429 3e allowed th secretary to set aside up to 45000 acres and names one speci fic special area in wh ich leases if permitted would forbid surface occupancy because th four special areas are larger than this total the secretary would be required to select among these areas or any others that may seem significant section 3f also stated that the closure authority in the anwr title was to be the secretarys sole authority which might limit possible secretarial actions under the endangered species act hr 2863 3e was essentially identical hr 2863 had provision for special areas 110th congress the provisions of 112e and f were identical with those of hr 5429 3e and f above nondevelopment options several options ve been available to congress to either postpone or forbid velopment unless c ongress were later to change the law these options are allo wing exploration only designating the 1002 area as wilderness and taking action th legislative history of these options is described below exploration only some have argued that the 1002 area should be opened to exploration first before decision is made on whether to proceed to leasing those with this view hold that with great er certainty about the presence or absence of energy resources better decision c ould be made about whether to open the coastal plain for full leasing this idea has had relatively little support over the years for those opposed to energy development th reasons are fairly clear if exploration results in or insufficient economic di scoveries any damage from exploration would remain if there were economic di scoveries support for further developmenthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32838crs26 might be unstoppable those who suppor t development see unacceptable risks in such proposal first who would be char ged with carrying out exploration federal agency or some private entity who would pay for it and to whom would the results be available second if economic discoveries were made would that be because the best places in the eyes of whatev er observer were not examined third might any small discoveries become economic in the future fourth if discoveries did occur could industry still be foreclos ed from development or might sparse but promising data elevate bidding to unreas onable levels fifth if exploration is authorized what provisions if any should pertain to native lands in short various advocates see insufficient gain from such proposal and it has not been introduced in recent years wilderness designation energy development is not permitted in wilderness areas unless there are valid preexisting rights or unless congress specifically allows it or late r reverses the designation development of the surface and subsurface holdings of native corporati ons would be precluded inside wilderness boundaries though compensation might be owed it would also preserve existing recreational opportunities and jobs as well as the existing level of protection of subsistence resources including the porcupine caribou herd 108th congress hr 770 and s 543 would have designated the 1002 area as wilderness 109th congress hr 567 and s 261 would have designated the 1002 area as part of the nationa l wilderness system 110th congress hr 39 and s 2316 would have designated the 1002 area as part of the nationa l wilderness system presidential certification under the two senate amendments to s 517 in the 107th congress which were ultimately rejected by the senate the leasing provisions would have take n effect upon determination and certification by the president that development of the coastal plain is in the national economic and security interests of the united states this determination and certification were to be in the sole discretion of the president and would not be reviewable this option has not been raised in other bills action because current law prohibits development unless congress acts this option also prevents energy deve lopment on both federa l and native lands those supporting delay often argue that not enough is known about either the probability of discoveries or about the environmenta l impact if development is permitted others argue that oil deposits should be saved for
