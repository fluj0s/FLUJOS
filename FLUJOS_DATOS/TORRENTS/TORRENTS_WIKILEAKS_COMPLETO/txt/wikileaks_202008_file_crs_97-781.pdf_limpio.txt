5httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781legislative proposals selected considerations for their development formulating the concept of legislation introduction this report identifies variety of c onsiderations that may be useful in developing and formulating legislative proposal its chief emphasis is on issues that apply to all legislative measures it does not generally address questions that bear only on specific kind of legislati on such as reconcilia tion or appropriation bills for each issue addressed the report offers only brief sketch of the nature of the questions involved nor is it comprehe nsive list of all considerations that might be relevant in developing legislative proposals in pa rticular it does not attempt to offer guidance on the actual drafting of gislative language the office of the legislative counsel offers such guidance two types of consideration ar raised part one of th report poses some general questions that may need attention when starting to develop any new legislative idea as part of clarifying its nature and purpose questions of this kind will often assist in defining the intent approach and essential features of the proposal part two of the report looks at matters that may raise obstacles to successful consideration of legislative proposal esp ecially when attention to such questions during the process of formulation may make it possible to avoid or mitigate such obstacles the issues covered in clude considerations relative to the constitution existing law and its normal forms the budget process rules regulating the content and structure of legislation and the procedural context in whic h legislation is considered in contrast with part one many of the considerations raised by part two are technical and involve substan tial complexity often only legal or policy specialist would normally have comprehensive or tailed grasp of their implications in specific case these implications however need not always be addressed and may be impossible to address meaningfully until the outlines of specific legislative approach are settled once basic decisions of the kind suggested by part one of the report are made attention to issues raised by part two may he lp to avoid unnecessary technical difficulties and fac ilitate successful considerationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs2 as legislative idea develops to the point that the basic questions raised by part one can be answered it may be increasingly useful to consult specialists in drafting and formulating legislation such as the office of the legislative counsel these specialists can often provide assistance in identifying pertinent issues of the kinds discussed in part two nd developing appropriate legislative responses basic considerations before attempting to draft specific legislative language or addressing the more technical questions identified later in this report it will usually be important to settle on general features of the gislations intent once such questions are clarified it is possible produce concrete draft nd to identify which questions of more specialized character may be pertinent the office of the gislative counsel can assist in both of these tasks what purpose does th bill intend to achieve or promote it may not always be necessary to include an explicit statement of purpose in the text of legislative proposal nevertheless if the pr oposals developers possess clear sense of its purpose that understa nding may be useful for reducing the legislative concept to concrete terms it may be desirable to identify the purpose of proposal by the outcomes or states of affa irs that the legislation intends to bring about or at least foster sometimes thes may be defined negatively for example as states of affairs to be avoided or outcomes to be prohibited answering these questions may facilitate consideration of appropriate means to the desired ends what actions and what class of persons would the bill regulate defining the outcome sought by legislati on is seldom sufficient to determine the means by which the desired outcome can be attained it may of ten be appr opriate to identify such means as specific kinds of action to be taken by specific persons considering legislative objectives in this light may lead to such questions as to whom the legislation is intended to apply nd who would be included in the class of persons covered by the statute the class will often be defined by identifying persons who perform specified actions who fail to perform such action who are to do specified things or who are to refrain from doing specified things to this extent this question is what forms of action the legislation intends to regulate direct govern or otherwise cover it may also be necessary to consider whether the entire range of actions covered can be dealt with by the same set of rules or if not what vari ations alternatives exceptions exemptions or ot her special cases should be included in the legislation what agency or authority would implement or enforce the activities prescribed law is in general not selfenforcing if legislative proposal authorizes or mandates activ ities by the federal gove rnment it will usually be desirable for the proposal to charge some iden tified and appr opriate entity or agency with carrying out those activities similarly if proposal regulates actions by nongovernmentalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs3 1 limitations on the range of alternatives ava ilable in this connection are further discussed in the constitutional considerations section belowparties it will nor mally be useful to charge an ag ency or authority with responsibility for enforcing the performance of those actions in either case the implementing entity will normally be an agency of the federal government or an entity exercising powers delegated from it under the c onstitution congress has virtually plenary power to create abolish or alter departments and agencies to determine their structure to specify their location in the governmental bureaucracy and to establish offices of government and the qualifi cations and terms of officeholders1 how should the functioning of the implementing authority be regulated legislation may often more likely be carried into action effectively if it explicitly provides appropriate standards of performance for and criteria of decision making and action by the implementing agen cy it may also often be important to make explicit whether any specified function is discretionary or mandatory that is whether the legislation grants permission to act or requires action of certain kinds congress has broad power unde r the constitution to prescr ibe the decisional process and criteria through which an agency is to carry out its functions what means of action including the power to issue regulations should be available for implem enting and enforcing the bill the chances that statute will be ccessfully implement ed will usually be improved if it provides the implementing entities with adequate and appropriate authorities and means of action congress has broad power to determine the means of action that an agency may employ in exercising its authorities among other possibilities an agency may act by carrying out functions through its own employees contracting with private organizations for the performance of suchfunctions delegating such functions to other appropriate entities distributing benefits to eligible recipients conditioning the provision of federa l funds on appropr iate actions by recipients providing other incentives or benefits for compliance with applicablestandards making and enforcing administrative regulations or enforcing activities or prohibitions through judicial proceedings either civil or criminal means of enforcement may as appr opriate include both sanctions and incentives carried out either through admin istrative process or through the courts when appropriate legislation may assign penalties for nonperformance or violations one important question may be whether the agency should have authority to issuehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs4 2 article i section 8 clause 18 us congress the constitution of the united states of america analysis and interpretation prepared by the congressional research service johnny h killian george costello coeditors 103rd cong 1st sess sdoc 1036 washington gpo 1996 p 339 hereinafter cited as the constitution annotated 3 ibid p 1509regulations it may also be necessary to consider how much of any required regulatory scheme should be included in the statute itself additional considerations constitutional considerations department of justice attorneys routinely scrutinize reported bills for potential constitutional problems while the department of justice tends to be more sensitive than court might be particularly if it perceives legislative encroachments on executive prerogatives it would be prudent to be aware of the most common areas of potential controversy what constitutional powe r of congress does the b ill propose to carry out the constitution endows congress with wide range of specific legislative powers and empowers it to make all laws which shall be nece ssary and proper for carrying into execution these powers it also empowers congress to legislate to carry out all other powers vested by this constitution in the government of the united states or in any department or officer thereof2 both these grants of power have been interpreted broadl especially during recent times yet the statement of these provisions and of the tenth amendment3 also entails the principle that the legislative powers of congress are not unlimited but are confined to those subjects over which the constitution grants it some specified authority it may be appropriate to consider specifically what constitu tional powers of the three branches of government the legislative proposal is intended to carry out and what powers of congress it would be enacted pursuant to rule xiii clause 3d1 of the house of representatives requires that committee reports on legislation specify the constitutional power under which the legislation would be enacted brief outline of the powers of congress established by the constitution arranged by substantive category appears as an appendix to this report are the activities to be carried on under the bill consistent with constitutional restrictions on the po wers of the federal government the bill of rights amendments i through x of the constitution as well as certain other constitutional provisions prohibit or restrict congress from enactinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs5 4 bill of rights amendments ix in the constitution annotated pp 9691518 also see esp constitution article i section 9 ibid pp 344359 5 constitution article ii section 2 the constitution annotated pp 469 507520legislation of certain kinds4 these include especially those that would abridge basic civil liberties or impair rights to due process in judicial proceedings discussed further at later point of th is section they also restrict congress from legislating in areas or ways that would lie beyond the powers granted to it by the constitution or that would infringe on powers and rights retained by the states or the people legislation trespassing on any of these rest rictions would be subject to being found unconstitutional by the federal courts are arrangements for appointment and removal of officials consistent with the president s constitutional authority all principal officers of the united states for example department heads judges and ambassadors must be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the senate cong ress can vest the appointment of inferior officers in the president with the advice and consent of the senate in the president alone in department heads or in the courts5 congress cannot vest the appointment power in congress or congressional officials unle ss the appointee will be performing purely advisory investigative informative or ceremonial functions nor can congress limit the presidents appointment power by maki ng him select from short list the president must have the opportunity to re ject the proffered names and ask for more names congress may limit the presidents power to remove executive officials for cause but it may not vest the remova l authority in itself or its officers is any delegation of authority s ubjected to appropriate standards and left free from impermissible congressional review congress may delegate any authority it has under article i section 8 as long as the delegation is accompanied by some standard that constrains the discretion of the delegee congress cannot condition delegation of authority by making its exercise subject to veto or cancellation by any exercise of legislative power short of the passage of new law but congress can require that an ac tion be reported to it before it takes effect and lay the effectiveness of the action for specified period of time as further discu ssed below such requireme nts may be coupled with expedited procedures for congressional action responding to such reports in many areas congress may not delega substantive federal authority to private parties unless there is some final say by an executive branch official under some circumstances congress may delegate authority to private persons to engage in prosecutorial actions on behalf of the government or may subject an agency to binding arbitration it is not violation of the appoi ntments clause to vest state official with federal enforcement functions httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs6 6 constitution article i section 9 clause 3 the constitution annotated pp 346352 constitution amendment v ibid pp 1273 13691395are requirements that congress r eceive information consistent with executive privilege for confidential communications congress may require that agencies provide it with specified categories of information either broadly or particularly defined on periodic or specifically defined occasional basis at some poi nt however such requirements may impinge on executive privilege which may protect from disclosure some communications between the president and his closest adviso rs especially with respect to national security diplomatic or military affairs would the law constitute bill of attainder ex post facto law or uncompensated taking of property congress may not enact legislation that inflicts punishment on person without judicial trial bill of atta inder or that takes privat property for public use without just compensation nor may congress enact any law that makes criminal an act that was innocent when done or that increas the punishment for crime already committed ex post facto law6 what is congressional intent with respect to federal preemption of state and local authority federal statutes so long as they are themselves constitutional may preempt state and local laws they may do so explicitly or the courts may hold them to have done so implicitly specific language addre ssing the intended scope of presumption extent can aid interpretation statutes may also give federal agencies authority to promulgate rules that have the effect of preempting state and local laws and regulations recent supreme court cases indicate however that the congressional intent for such preemptive effect must be clear and evident on the face of the statute or from the legislative history of the enactment it cannot simply be implied are the means by which any sanctions may be imposed consistent with due process requirements provisions of laws that would impose criminal or civil sanctions for particular conduct must meet minimal sta ndards of due process fo r one thing the definition of the proscribed activity cannot be so va gue as to fail to give person notice that jeopardy will ensue also the persons potentially subject to criminal or civil sanction must be accorded procedures necessary to assure that the constitutional protections against illegal searches and seizures the right to fair trial and legal counsel etc are safeguarded some c onstitutional procedural protections are applicable to civil enforcement settings as wellhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs7 if any provisions of the b ill raise serious questions of constitutionality should it incl ude provisions on severability in some cases when the federal c ourts have held provision of law unconstitutional they have concluded that congress would not have enacted the remainder of the statute if they had know n that the invalidated provision could not be carried into effect in such cases they have determined that the separate provisions of the statute should not be tr eated as severable from one nother so that invalidation of the unconstitutional provision had the consequence of invalidating the entire statute in other cases th ey have reached the ry conclusion that congress would have intended the remai nder of statute to continue in effect even if the provision under consideration were to be held invalid as unconstitutional in such cases they have treated the different provisions of the statute as severable and continued to enforce the remainder of the statute even while invalidating the unconstitutional provision judicial decisions on severability can by these means substantially alter the effect of decisions on constitutionality to determine severability the courts place weight on provisions of the statute itself d eclaring congressional intent about whether the invalidation of one provision should place the remainder of the statute out of effect if the developers of legisla tive proposal are aware of any potential doubts about the constitutionality of any of its provisions therefore they may find it desirable to place such statement in the language of the legislation substantive considerations considerations advanced by this secti on may often be reso lved by appropriate drafting of specific legislative language on such issues the office of legislative counsel may frequently be able to offer suitable resolutions how does the bill relate to exis ting law in the same policy area provisions of legislation that conflict with existing law may if enacted have the effect of superseding and overriding that ex isting law to what extent they do so and with what effect may depend on their specific relation to that existing law for example new legislation may have such effects because it explicitly alters the previous law because it imp licitly conflicts therewith or perhaps also because it bears some even more indirect relation thereto particularly when the relation is one of conflict uncertainty bout potential effects may ofte n be reduced if the new legislation explicitly specifies how it intends to affect existing law it may make such specification by identifying the point s at which it would amend repeal or otherwise alter that existing law and the ways in which it would do so such an approach may also reduce potential subsequent difficulties of interpretation and implementation for additional information see crs report rs20614 how bills amend statutes by richard s bethhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs8 7 5 usc 704 how do the bills provisions comport with existing law that regulates the activities of government generally the provisions of bill may implicitly require activities to be carried out in fashion that may inadvertently conflict with or may be affected in unexpected ways by various provisions of existing genera l legislation among many others for example there are potentially pertinent general statutes that regulate government personnel procurement sunshine requirements fo r public participation the operation of advisory commissions and requirements and procedures for judi cial review or enforcement frequently consideration of particular importance ma be whether authority to issue regulations is granted consistently with general statutes governing regulatory processes often it may be requisite to consider how the purposes of the bill may best be achieved consistently with these mandates of general gislation sometimes on the other hand it may be ppropriate to provide for excepti ons to the generally applicable laws in all such cases it may be necessary to consider explicitly and to provide explicitly for the relation between the activities contemplated by the legislation and general law regulating such matters when should the law take effect federal laws generally take effect from the date of their enactment unless their provisions specify some other effective date sometimes it may be desirable to provide later effective date such as wh ere transition period from previous law to the new one may be needed in such cases it may also be desirabl to provide explicit transition rules to facilitate required adjustments by persons affected legislation taking effect during current fiscal year may also raise problems related to applicable spending caps as discussed furthe r by the section on budget process what provisions for judicial review and congressional oversight are appropriate the effectiveness with which legislation furthers its intended purposes may be enhanced not only by including performan ce standards and decision making criteria but by providing for suitable review nd oversight of the implementing agencys performance under those standards c ongress possesses cons titutional power to determine whether agency decisions shall be subject to judicial review and the extent and nature of that review generally in the absence of provision to the contrary the presumption is that agency action will be subject to judicial review pursuant to the administrative procedures act7httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs9 congress also possesses power s of oversight and inve stigation of government activities which are necessary to permit it to ascertain wh ether its intent is being properly carried out and to determine whet her further legislati on may be necessary however the likelihood that functions direct ed by law will be performed effectively may be increased if the legislation explicitly provides suitable mechanisms for oversight and review by appr opriate organs of congress among others these may include requirements for reporting consultation and sunsetting should the bill include author izing language or sunset provisions to limit the duration of the activities authorized some activities of government such as specific projects or actions directed toward specific situation may reach na tural termination or completion others are inherently more general and may potentially continue indefinitely legislation typically contains provisions authorizin g the appropriation of specific maximum amounts of funds for specified fiscal years or other periods especially for activities of indefinite duration whose performance re quires spending implications of such language are discussed further by the section on budget process issues legislation may also authorize program or activity itself only for specific period form of limitation known as suns et provision provisions of this kind require advocates to seek reauthorization if the activity is to continue beyond the initially authorized period the sunset provi sions build into subsequent legislative action an opportunity for review and modi fication but also an additional workload requirement for congress they may tend to prevent the indefinite perpetuation of activities that may at some point prove inadequate or inappropriate on the other hand their presence may necessitate renewe d legislative struggle simply in order to ensure that worthwhile public purpos may be pursued without interruption often it may be prudent to make sure that the legislation specifies the duration of the authorized activity in some way appropriate to the nature of that activity should the bill contain any findi ngs or statement of purpose statement of the purposes of the legisl ation or of circumstances that make it expedient may be useful for advancing sympathetic understanding of its aims and ends it may also help to clarify the pur poses and conditions of the legislation during the process of subsequent interpretation such interp retation may be required not only in the judicial process but also in the processes through which the applicable authorities implement the legi slation thus statement of purpose may help insure that the legislation will be implemented in ways that effectively reflect its intent such statement may also serve as sta ndard for subsequent review and oversight when congress evaluates the success of the policy budgetary and funding considerations considerations raised by this section ma affect most legislation that involves raising or spending public funds including those that only authorize such spending many of the issues identified by this section arise from requirements of thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs10 8 titles i through ix of the congressional budget and impoundment control act of 1974 pl 93344 88 stat 298 as amended 9 for additional information on this subject see crs report rl31399 the origination clause of the us constitution interpretation and enforcement by james v saturnocongressional budget act8 often operating as congressi onal rules others from the standing rules of the two houses the s ources of these requirements are identified throughout the section where appropriate does the bill include spending or taxes when drafting legislation it is important to ask whether it includes spending or taxes because for the most part rules of each chamber require budgetary matters to be considered separately from other legislative measures specifically house rule xxi clause 4 effectively prohibits any bill not reported by the appropriations committee except for private claims from containing appropriations house rule xxi clause 5a effectively prohibits any bill not reported by the ways and means committee from including ta x or tariff provisions although other types of federal receipts may be under the jurisdiction of other committees the senate possesses ge neral prohibition agains t appropriations in legislative measure senate rule xv howev er provides that it sh all not be in order to consider committee amendment not within the jurisdiction of the committee proposing such an amendment ce senate rule xxv establishes that appropriation of the revenue for the suppor t of the government is within the jurisdiction of the appropriations co mmittee other committee may report an amendment making appropriations for similar reasons the rule prevents any committee other than the finance committee from reporting committee amendments concerning tax or tariff provisions also article i section 7 of the constitution requires that all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives but the sena may propose or concur w ith amendments as on other bills9 does the bill include any authorizations authorizations can provide authority both for agencies to act and for appropriations to provide f unding accordingly it is important for legislation to identify the type of authority being granted if bill provides general authority for the agency to act without further elaboration or limitati on such language would also implicitly authorize an indefinite level of appropriations for the lifespan of the provision bill may also provide either general authoriza tion for appropriations tied to an agencys mission or authoriza tions only for specified purposes or items in the latter case the authorized level of appropriations may also be limited to specific dollar amount or duration finally the authorization may limit the activities of the agency or the level of appropriati ons to only what the bill explicitly provides for such an authorization may conflict w ith existing law if so it may be appropriate explicitly to repeal or amend that existing lawhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs11 10 section 401c2c house rules manual p 918 11 section 401b1 ibid p 915 12 section 401b2 ibid p 916 13 house rule x clauses 1d3does the bill provide contr act or debt authority in answer to concerns about th proliferation of backdoor funding mechanisms the congressional budget act limited the use of contract authority and debt authority as means of financing fe deral programs section 401a of the congressional budget act requires that bills which provide authority to enter into contracts under which the united states is ob ligated to make outlays and to incur indebtedness for the repaymen t of which the united states is liable be effective for any fiscal year only to the ex tent provided in appropriation acts does the bill provide entitlement authority the congressional budget act defines entitlement authority as the authority to make payments including loans and gran ts the budget authority for which is not provided in advance by appr opriations acts to any pers on or government if under the provisions of the law containing such authority the united states is obligated to make such payments to persons or governments who meet the requirements established by such law10 although legislation can alter the formulae for entitlement programs which can in turn increase the projected level of expenditures section 401b of is designed to limit such increases it also requires that increases in entitlement spending not be effective prior to the beginning of the fiscal year which begins during the calendar year in which such bill or resolution is reported11 it further provides that increases which will become effective during current fiscal year be limited to the vel allocated under secti on 302b by the committee of jurisdiction pursuant to the mo st recent budget resolution or be subject to referral to the appropr iations committee for period not to exceed 15 days12 does the bill deal with the budget process section 306 of the congressional budget act prohibits any bill or amendment from dealing with matters within the jurisdiction of the budget committee in either chamber unless it is reported by the budget committee or is an amendment to bill reported by the budget committee beside s jurisdiction over budget resolutions and reconciliation bills house rules grant the committee jurisdiction over the congressional budget process generally they also gave it jurisdiction over the establishment extension and enforcemen t of special controls over the federal budget including the budgetary treatment of offbudget federal agencies and measures providing exemption from re duction under any sequester order13 in the senate jurisdiction over gislation concerning the budget process is similarly granted to the budget committee jointly with the governmental affairs committee by standing order of august 4 1977 in addition when drafting legislation that deals with the budget process it is dvisable to consider whether the proposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs12 14 for additional information on budget points of order see crs report 97865 points of order in the congressional budget process by james v saturnolegislation would be subject to points of order established by the congressional budget act14 will the bill require cost estimate house rules and the congressional budget act require that reports for bills providing new spending authority new budget authority new credit authority or changing revenues or tax expenditures include cost estimate prepared after consultation with the director of th congressional budget office the congressional budget act also requires th director of the congressional budget office to the extent practicable to prep are similar cost estimate for each bill or resolution of public character reported by any committee does the bill establish or expand any unfunded intergovernmental mandates whose consideration might be subject to point of order if bill imposes enforceable duties on st ate local or tribal governments or increases the costs that such governments must bear in order to discharge such duties then it establishes an intergovernmental mandate if the costs of such mandates established by the bill and not to be f unded by the federal government exceed 50 million then consideration of th bill may be subject to poi nt of order mandates relating to certain subjects such as social security or protections against discrimination are exempt from these strictur this point of order also applies against conference report and similar point of order applies against an amendment or motion whose adopti on would take the total unfunded intergovernmental mandate s contained in bill over the 50 million threshold instead of resorting to these mechanisms however especially in the house if measure contains unfunded intergovernmental mandates above the prescribed level sponsors or committees of jurisdiction often seek to reformulate the terms of the legislation to eliminate the potential point of order the senate may waive these points of orde r by majority vote the house may not waive such point of order by the term s of special rule for considering the bill or such special rule would itself be subject to point of order but instead settles such point of order by vote on whether to consider the bill despite the point of order considerations related to procedure should the bill include any congressional approval or disapproval provisions if so can they m eet constitutiona l requirements some laws authorize the executive to take action of specified nature only if congress enacts further legislation approvi ng the action they may provide for congress to consider such legislation pursuant to presidential or other executive request other measures re quire the executive to notify congress of certain proposedhttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs13 actions and permit the action only if congress does not disapprove it by further legislation the legislative veto ins v chadha 1983 established that congress may provide for such subsequent appr oval or disapproval only through further lawmaking and not through simple or concurrent resolutions congressional disapproval through lawmaking will normally be effective only if each house can assemble the twothirds majority requi site to override veto but requiring subsequent congressional pproval through lawmaking ma kes any use of the powers granted by the legislation contingent on additional positive action by congress another possibility is to require the executive to notify specified congressional committees before taking specified acti on and then wait specified period before doing so thus permitting the committees the oppor tunity to initiate measures to block the proposed action to facilitate congressional action on measures providing the requisite approval or disapproval laws of this kind often provide that ch measures be considered under expedited procedures discussed at later point of this section would any provisions of the bill operate as rules of the house or senate provisions of law that operate as pr ocedures governing house or senate consideration of specified legislation are called rulemaking provisions the constitution empowers each house of congress to make its own rules statutes by contrast require the concurrence of bot h houses and unless congress overrides veto the president each house may accordingly amend or repeal its rules by its own action alone but statute normally can be amended or repealed only by further statutory enactment statutes containing rulemaking provisions therefore customarily include statement declaring that those provisions are enacted as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the respective houses and accordingly are subject to change or repeal insofar as they pertainto either house through further action by that house individually especially in the house of representativ the presence in proposed legislation of rulemaking provisions may increase th likelihood of referral to the committee on rules which has juri sdiction over house rules does the bill require establishi ng any expedited procedures or similar rulemaking provisions expedited procedures colloquially know n as fast track procedures are provisions designed to help ensure cons ideration of specified kind of measure provided for or required pursuant to genera l statute such as the trade act or the arms export control act such procedures are examples of the rulemaking provisions just discussed and are often provided for the consideration of the congressional approval or disapproval measures discusse d at an earlier point of this section httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs14 provisions frequently appearing in ex pedited procedure statutes include requirements that the measure specified be automatically introduced the committee of referral be automatically discharged after aspecified time motions to consider the measure be privileged debate of the measure be limited amendments be prohibited which facilitates concurrence with actionof the other chamber and such actions take place w ithin specified period proper crafting of such provisions can help ensure that they will achieve the desired effects and that they are consistent with and enforceable in relation to established general rules of procedure the provisi ons appropriate for each chamber may differ does the bill contain private provisions of prohibited kinds or establish commemoration rules of both chambers prohibit receiving or considering private bill to pay claims that could be settled under the tort claims act to correct military or naval record or to construct bridge house rules prohibit the introduction or consideration of any bill designating specified period of time to commemorate any person event or purpose bill contai ning provisions of either kind would be returned to the member introducing it nd if the house received any commemorative measure from the senate it would be unable to take the measure up except presumably by unanimous consent contextual considerations to what committee and subcommi ttee is the bill likely to be referred bills prospects for favorable consideration may be enhanced if referred to committee that is familiar with the issues addressed has record of active involvement with those issues and is not severely distracted by other workload also if sponsors of the bill sit on the committ ee of referral especially in leadership positions they may be well placed to take actions that may enhance the likelihood that the committee will take up the measure it is sometimes possible to draft bill to emphasize specific policy concerns that will enhance the lik elihood of referral to one rather than another committee these considerations may be relevant not only for the bills referral to committee but also for its potential referral by the committee to subcommittees they may also be pertinent not only to the referral of the bill in the initial chamber of introduction but to that of compani on legislation in the other chamber httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs15 is the bill likely to re quire multiple referral especially in the house if bill touches on the jurisdiction of more than one committee it may be referred to committees in addition to the primary committee for consideration of portions within the jurisdiction of those committees respectively house rule adopted in the 108th congress allows the speaker of the house in extraordinary circumstances to refer legislation to mo re than one committee without designating one com mittee as primary i n the senate measures are sometimes multiply referred by unanimous consent or pursuant to standing unanimous consent agreements similar divisions of res ponsibility may occur at the subcommittee level multiply referred measure must be reported by each committee involved before it can be considered on the floor although sometimes pr ovision is made for automatic discharge of remaining committees within fixed time if the one especially the lead committee reports some evidence suggests that measures referred to more than one committee are less likely to traverse the legislative process successfully because they are subject to the need for concurrence from multiple perspectives bills can sometimes be draf ted so as to reduce the likelihood of such referrals are alternative proposals on the same subject already present including companion bills in the other chamber whether other bills addressing the sa issue have been introduced in one chamber may affect the likelihood that the chamber will actively consider that issue as well as which bill it will likely take as vehicle for the purpose also if alternative proposals on the same subject ar present their substance may indicate issues that bills in that area may need to address and the range of means for doing so companion bills in the other chamber may also affect the likelihood that congress will successfully pursue the legisl ative process on the issue sometimes sponsors of bill in one chamber will give consideration to whether to arrange for simultaneous introduction of companion bill in the other how may likelihood of action on the bill be affected by the timing of its introduction introduction of measure at the begi nning of congress maximizes the time during which the committee of referral has the opportunity to take it up on the other hand measure introduced early in cong ress may escape attention because of the volume of bills being introduced at that point late in the second session of congress by contrast committees may be forced to concentrate on completing action on legislation they have already initiated too little time may remain for committee of referral to fit bill introduced at that point onto its agenda yet measures are sometimes introduced at that point not with the expectation of immediate enactment but as trial balloon or to prepare the ground for more substantial action by the subsequent congress httpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs16 considerations beyond the scope of the report there are many considerations pertinen t to the formulation and development of legislative proposals that lie beyond the scope of this report and some of them beyond the proper scope of crs engagement for example because it limits itself to the initial formulation of legislativ proposals the repor t makes attempt to address all considerations that may arise at later stage of legislative consideration these could include such matters as the contents required for committee reports on bills and the rules that govern the process of amendment by committees and on the floor this report also gives attention to considerations of political strategy and the building of support for proposal for inst ance it has not considered what features of the bill might promote its being selected as vehicle for addressing the issue in preference to other bills in either the same or the other chamber taking similar or contrasting approaches to the same subject it has not examined the possible effects of how cosponsors are to be sought nor when it might be desirable to seek assignment of special or distinctive bill number it has ignored the potential effect on the likelihood that the bill will be sche duled considered or enacted of positions taken either in the chambe r of introduction or the other house by leadership by pertinent committees or by gr oups of members involved with the issue holding particular political or ideological views similarly it has avoided addressing the potential impact of views taken by the president by the prospective implementing agency and by pertinent organized interest s or the possibility of ascertaining such views in advance finally the approach of this report has assumed that the bill under discussion is introduced with the intent of securing its enactment the considerations raised above therefore may not alwa ys be pertinent to bills introduced for other purposes such purposes might include positiontaking to respond to cerns important to constituency fostering familiarity with and intere st in policy proposal so as to promote the possibility of legislation at some later time or countering or provoking doubts about currently popularalternatives in the same issue areahttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97781crs17 appendix powers of congress section 8 of
