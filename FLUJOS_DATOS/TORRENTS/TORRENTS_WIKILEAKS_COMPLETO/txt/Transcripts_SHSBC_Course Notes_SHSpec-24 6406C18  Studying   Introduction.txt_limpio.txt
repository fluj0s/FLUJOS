6406c18 shspec24 studying introduction if you cant learn anything you cant find out how to do anything if an auditor cant learn anything he will never know how to audit this is very fundamental but all great successes are built on fundamentals better than fifty percent of scientology consists of the discipline technology and knowhow of application you could give the commands of scientology processes to another group of mental technicians and they would get results failure to duplicate failure to understand failure to apply lrh and reg dreamed up course having to do with business and commerce with scientology applied to them reg executed the course and it has been very successful it is goodwill gesture the only trouble is that everybody tried to get into the act teaching their own courses to the same end reg wasnt worried about others duplicating the course people are aware even with perfect duplicate course that they are not taking the real course in salesmanship even on the copyist this enters enough in the way of an overt or something like this so that he then goes into an obsessive alteris and then it is true that they cant duplicate it professors in universities cause the loss of technology by writing their own books on their subjects instead of teaching the real source material which they alteris there were thirteen heavierthanair methods of flight the fixedwing configuration wasnt necessarily the best though it was one of the easier ones to manufacture the fixedwing system won out the other twelve have lost even though some were more efficient than the one that was easy to do in civilizations it is customary for body of knowledge to come into existence then for some part of it to be duplicated and developed and other parts of the tech to get lost civilizations die out because they lose their technology apart from one gimmick that has nothing to back it up technology gets lost because people cant study civilizations tend to rise to peak then under stress of combat or whatever they lose their technology because one studies it for instance the technology of the british silversmiths got lost when the labor government taxed silver out of existence one problem with study is the amount of false knowledge around if person studied without any judgement of what he was studying or any evaluation of it he would study very poorly study has to do with one thing basically willingness to know in order to study one must first be willing to know without willingness to know you can get systems that add up to knowledge in scientology we have one thing that is not easy to put into texts the discipline of how you do it it is easy to transmit by example and is at least fifty percent of what we are doing this is frailty for the future success of what we are doing it is the most likely thing to get lost what needs to be learned is not the commands of processes it is how to apply them in scientology one is learning the doingness not the processes the processes wont work in the absence of the doingness trs comm cycle metering etc lrh decided to learn about study by doing course in photography he had done the course up to the third lesson already and wondered why he stopped there and why he occasionally bogged down eg in the parts about optics and chemistry he realized that he didnt know anything about photography despite having done it since age twelve he realized that he had entered the course in tolerant state of mind willing to learn few gimmicks and he realized that this attitude was incredibly arrogant he had always thought that the trouble he had had with photography was that they kept changing the methods he realized that the basics and fundamentals in the subject which he didnt know had been present in the subject since 1860 at that point knowing that there was something to learn he really started to study from three books in 3 12 years he sped up to eight books in two weeks arrogance and tolerance the attitude that i know all about it but im willing to learn few tricks prevents person from studying lrhs standards of criticism have shifted what he was willing to take pictures of changed utterly he mastered fundamentals and reached position of judgment and opinion on it previously he had had judgment only fixed ideas there is big difference between an opinion and fixed idea or prejudice one has fixed opinions when one lacks understanding of an area in the absence of knowledge judgment becomes fixed ideas lrhs former ideas on photography had not been resulting in finished picture also before this realization he was the victim of external conditions if there was sun he could not take picture after this realization knowing your tools and darkroom tech you are not monitored by conditions around you the breakthrough was there really is something there to learn this is prime condition necessary for study so the first barrier to learning is the consideration that you know all about it and you wont let your certainty that you know be affected by the fact that you are not getting result judgment depends in freedom from fixed opinions and on need to protect yourself from your lack of knowledge in some area judgment is impossible in the presence of fixed opinions to judge one must know what one knows and what one does not know judgment depends on knowledge it is not what person knows it is what he can do an auditors ability to learn then depends first on his willingness to learn i know all there is to know and i get results shows lack of judgment on ones own skill it is silly statement status has lot to do with this one considers he must appear wise or clever or whatever and pretends knowingness to give this appearance but in the presence of genuine knowledge real esteem takes the place of false selfgenerated esteem it comes down to test of what person can do there is argument with competence psychiatry serves as wonderful example of this to be good critic of some area you would have to know what could and what couldnt be done in that area person who already knows something about an area can learn more about it without feeling challenged threatened or insulted by the suggestion that he learn it unlike someone who doesnt know all about it but wants to think that he does the only place our technology might break down is from unwillingness to learn it stemming from the belief that one already knows it all this is one of those stupid fundamentals that stays in because nobody bothers to asis it there is always first lesson to teach basic entry point to learning subject on the subject of study itself this datum is fundamental where you fail in instruction you always omitted the first datum to teach
