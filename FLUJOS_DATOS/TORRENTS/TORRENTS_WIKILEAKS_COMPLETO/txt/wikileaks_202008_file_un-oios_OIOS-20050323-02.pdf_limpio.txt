and unhabitat and one is responsible for m aintaining personnel records and distributing inform ation th chief of sas reports through chief hrms to chief division of adm inistrative services unon 3 draf t of the report was shared with the chief staf f adm inistration section in january 2005 whose com ments which were received on 8 march 2005 have been reflected in the f inal report in italics unon commented that such organization and management issues should be addressed at the hrmslevel since many of the issues involve other units of hrms not just sas oios appreciates that hrms is looking at the report from hrms rather than st rictly sas perspective at the tim of the audit there was f ull tim head of hrms nd the issues raised alm ost exclusively came from work done on sas oios therefore felt it m ore appropriate to address the draft to the head of sas as agreed at the planning stage ii audit objectives 4 the overall objective of the audit was to advise directorgeneral unon on the adequacy of arrangem ents for handling staff entitlem ents this involved assessing the adm inistration of staff entitlem ents b evaluating the adequacy effectiveness and efficiency of internal controls c evaluating whether adequate guidance and procedures were in place d determ ining the reliability and integrity of the data available f rom the present system s and reviewing com pliance with regulations rules and adm inistrative instructions iii audit scope and methodology 5 the audit followed up work done in the prior audits aa2000163 unon hum an resources managem ent servi ce hrms and aa 2002011 unon staff adm inistration section and drew upon th findings of the following audits unon adm inistration of entitlem ents aa2004211 03 education grant and dependency allowance aa200421104 hom leave nd rental subsidy and aa200421105 mobility hardship and nonrem oval 6 the audit focussed on activities in 2003 up until the end of fieldwork in novem ber 2004 and involved interviewing sta ff reviewing available docum ents and using audit software to sam ple and analyse data 1 iv audit findings and recommendations progress in implementing recommendations 7 at the conclusion of this review oios was pleased to note that approxim ately 80 percent of the recom mendations raised in prior reports had been successfully implem ented however alm ost all of those recom mendations which were still in progress were the critical recom mendations raised w hilst these have been discussed in detail in the various reports issued as pa rt of this review and as such additional recom mendation is raised here oios wishes to draw m anagem ents attention to the slow progress being m ade in im plem enting critical recom mendations 8 unon commented that recommendations that were identified as critical were being presently dealt with and an interim repl on the status together with realistic timelines for implementation woul d be forwarded by 15 march 2005 oios appreciates the prom pt action taken and notes the response b failure to recover overpayments 9 as part of the aa200421105 audit m obility hardship and nonrem oval oios observed that sas unon had m ade effort to recover overpaym ents m ade to staff consequently recovery of overpaym ents totalling approxim ately us13000 was tim barred because the twoyear pe riod established by stai200011 section 31 recovery of overpaym ents m ade to sta ff members had lapsed oios did not uncover any additional exam ples in other areas of sas work and this appears to be an isolated instance as such oios is not raising any recom mendation but wishes to draw m anagem ents attention to the need to ensure that staf f are diligent in monitoring and reporting instances of possible overpaym ent unon noted the oios comment c delegation of authority 10 oios recom mended that hrms should consolidate into one docum ent its current delegated authority for unon unhabitat and unep and send this docum ent to ohrm for approval unon hum an resources managem ent service aa2000163021 this recom mendation has not been fully im plem ented and since raising the recom mendation num ber of changes have occurred including habitat becom ing full program oios maintains that it is essential f or unon to m aintain form docum entation detailing the authority it has been delegated the original recom mendation is closed and replaced with the one below recommendation to avoid am biguities and thereby im prove delivery of unon hum an resources services to unhabitat and unep chief hum an resources managem ent rvice unon should prepare in consultation with unhabitat and unep docum ent stating the nature of authority delegated to unon in hum an resources managem ent m atters by unhabitat and unep executive directors rec 01 2 11 unon commented that the issue of delegation of authority in hr matters is currently under review and will be addre ssed by hrms together with unep and unhabitat based on the parameters outlined in the 2001 oios report as contained in general assembly document a56620 unon will revert to oios once the necessary consultations have taken pla ce with senior officials of the client organizations oios supports the proposed action and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of the docum ent stating the nature of authority delegated to unon in hum an resources managem ent m atters by unhabitat and unep executive directors d organisation structure structure 12 oios was concerned whether sas had th appropriate structure and level of staffing to carry out its responsibilities and had raised two recom mendations in prior audits to encourage unon to review the structure of sas recom mendation aa20020101002 requested unon hrms to undertake review to determ ine whether sass team based approach shoul d be expanded to include recruitm ent recom mendation aa20020101003 requested unon hrms to establish sub unit within sas to com municate sas policies to staff and provide guidance to clients in order to ensure consistent interpretation and equitable application of staff regulations and rules 13 oios discussed and understands that decision has been taken not to include recruitm ent in the team based approach and recom mendation aa20020101002 has therefore been closed 14 oios was not presented with any ev idence that sas had taken any action on aa20020101003 and noted inconsistencies in practices between units in the level and nature of advice and support provided to clients for exam ple the unit dealing with unon staff m embers sends rem inders for the discontinuation of nonrem oval allowance af ter the expiry of the initial f ive years while the one dealing with unep believes it is the responsibility of the staff member to apply for an extension this lack of consistency m ay underm ine the cred ibility of sas and incr eases the risk of unon m aking contradictory rulings to the di fferent organisations it serves this recom mendation therefore rem ains open 15 unon commented that hrms believes that unit that deals with policy issues would be more appropriate at the hrms rather than the saslevel hrms will strive to apply administrative practices c onsistently and sas will ensure that its entire staff will observe identical practices oios appreciates the response and agrees with unon that central hrms leve l unit would be m ore beneficial oios will close recom mendation aa20020101003 upon notification that hrms has set up such unit b offices away from nairobi headquarters 16 during the audit of hrms in 2000 oios recom mended that hrms should liaise with unhabitat and unep and creat f ile detailing its specif ic hum an resources hr responsibilities for offi ces away from nairobi headquarters oanh aa2000163022 oios reviewed copies of letters sent to habitat and unep oanhs highlighting the different hr responsibilities 3 between unon and those offices w hereas th letters indicating the delegation of hr responsibilities are good starting point oios is of the view that m ore needs to be done accuracy there is nothing distinguishing between the different types of offices served such as unep adm inistered conventions regional offices liaison offices all of which m ay have different types and natures of delegated authority b completeness docum entation provided did not cover all unhabitat and unep offices away from nairobi headquarters such as unep liaison offices in new york beijing brasilia moscow addis ababa and substantive offices in shigajapan cam bridgeunited kingdom and sioux fallsusa c approval there is evidence that docum entation has been discussed with or approved by the executive directors of unhabitat and unep who are the custodians of delegated authority in staff adm inistration m atters d focal points the list of responsibilities did not include focal points in both hrms and unhabitat or unep offices away from nairobi headquarters the letters only identify the responsible office and not the focal point through which queries and other clarifications can be sought also focal points can be used to supply offices with uptodate inform ation on rules and regulations pertaining to hr m atters 17 the original recom mendation is closed and replaced by the following recommendation to ensure that all unhabit at and unep offices away from nairobi headquarters adm inistered by staff adm inistration section unon are clear on their and unons hum an resources roles responsibilities and authority chief hum an resources managem ent service unon shoul d in consultation with habitat and unep prepare and issue new circular which specifies the respective roles responsibilities and authority of all the parties involved in hum an resources m atters and should also outline the m echanism for handling and resolving queries rec 02 18 unon commented that hrms would in consultation with unep and habitat prepare draft circular that will outline the roles responsibilities and authorities in human resource matters for unep and unhabitat for their offices away from nairobi headquarters this circular will take into account the different structure of the offices administered by unon and the administrative support structure in place with these offices the draft circular will be ready for discussion with the administrative staff of unep out posted offices who will be present in nairobi in may 2005 and appropriate arrangements will be made to present the draft to representatives of unhabitat outposted offices oios is very encouraged by the unon response and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of the circular which specifies the respec tive roles responsibilities and authority of 4 all the parties involved in hum an resources matters and outlines the m echanism for handling and resolving queries planning and monitoring 19 in the oios audit of hrms conducte d in 2002 oios observed that hrms had not developed proactive approach f or applications requests f or entitlem ents from staff m embers aa20020101007 the ohrm monitoring mission report of 16 march 2004 also recom mended that hrms n eeded to foster m ore strategic approach sas has m ade im provem ents in this area and the above m entioned recom mendation has been closed but in tryi ng to im prove it is clear that sas needs assistance as it lacks basic m anagem ent in form ation required to perform adequate planning and m onitoring activities target dates for submission of staff entitlements oios was pleased to note that target dates for subm ission of claim s have been incorporated in all circulars on procedures issued for each entitlem ent w hilst this was an excellent initiative to give guidance to staf f its value was largely lost as data was kept recording what happened in practice this was necessary to determ ine whether any changes were required to the subm ission date or whether additional m easures were required to m ake staff aware of the need to follow the subm ission deadline it is also important to have som basis for the subm ission date and such evidence was available for review b time frames or benchmarks for the processing of staff entitlements tim fram and benchm arks for the processing of entitlem ents were issued in january 2004 and also incorporated into the service level agreem ent sla which was signed between unon and unhabitat and unep oios observed that there was m ismatch between the two docum ents in that tim frames for certain activities were not identical for instance in the sla processing of entitlem ent travel home leave and fam ily visit were scheduled to take five days whereas the sas m emorandum states it will take two weeks sim ilarly separation from service and related actions were supposed to be processed in five days as per sla whereas sas m emorandum puts it at 4 to 6 weeks there was also distinction between headquarters and an oanh c management information sas has not developed procedures to collect basic inf ormation such as the num ber of staff entitled to particular benefit in order to m onitor the workload and report accordingly for exam ple there is data on num ber of staff entitled to education grant the num ber of children involved and the schools for which the majority of the students attend such inform ation would enable the unit to estim ate the volum of activities be aware of tim fram as schools close at different tim and also m onitor staff m embers who m ay not have subm itted their claim s for followup action sim ilarly statistical information on num ber of staff entitled to other staf f entitlem ents such as home leave fam ily visit and rental subsidy was not available furtherm ore sas has not developed procedures to collect statistical data to monitor and report on the tim eliness of processing entitlem ents from when applications or requests are received in sas to paym ent of the 5 entitlem ent oios is of the view that in order f or this activity to be properly set up loggingin m echanism should be developed where hum an resources officers record date of receipt of the request and date of com pletion the previous recom mendation aa20020101009 where sas was requested to collect statistical data to m onitor the tim eliness of processing entitlem ents from when applications or requests are received in sas to paym ent of the entitlem ent will theref ore be closed and replaced by the ones below 20 unon commented that subsidies and grant s are administrative entitlements that need to be claimed by the staff memb er hrms strives to create supportive environment that facilitates the submission of requests for these entitlements this does not however exonerate the individual st aff member from taking the initiative it is important to note that circulars ar posted on the bulletin board but some staff members do not take the time to familiarize themselves with the contents of these circulars large percentage of staff adm inistered is outside of the duty station and many staff go on frequent m ission oios is therefore surprised to learn of the reliance placed on the bulletin boar d which is only accessible through unon intranet staff should be able to easily find out what their entitlem ents are have clear statem ent on how rules will be applied within the duty station in respect of an entitlem ent know what inform ation hrms xpects them to provide to receive an entitlem ent and know how long it will usua lly take for an entitlem ent to be processed and paid they should also know w hom to contact if they have query on an interpretation of rule key to this is monitoring perform ance in delivery of each entitlem ent so that hrms is able to dem onstrate that only sm all percentage of staff is experiencing dif ficulties in claim ing entitlem ents recommendations to im prove the effectiveness and efficiency of operations in unon staff adm inistration sec tion sas chief hum an resources managem ent services unon should request chief sas unon to ensure that the processing tim fram for entitlem ents issued in january 2004 and the ones contained in the service level agreem ent are harm onised to avoid any am biguities in consultation with all stakeholders rec 03 21 unon commented that hrms would review the two documents on timeframes and the service level agreement to realign the benchmarks paying special attention to offices away from nairobi comp rehensive document will be ready by 31 march 2005 oios thanks unon for the prom pt action proposed and will close the recom mendation upon receipt of the revised docum ent for processing tim efram to generate m eaningful statistical inform ation and to aid unon staff adm inistration sec tion sas in its planning activities chief hum an resources managem ent hrms unon should request chief sas unon to introduce loggingin system where hum an resources officers record the date of receipt of request and date of com pletion this m anagem ent inform ation should be sum marised and used for discussions with chief hrms and chief division of adm inistra tive services on the perform ance of sas rec 04 6 22 unon commented that an information t echnology consultant is currently on board with hrms and one of his tasks is to develop document workflow system which will be able to track when re quest was received through to its final completion oios notes the positive action ta ken and will close the recom mendation upon receipt and review of details of the docum ent workflow system to stream line the processing of unon entitlem ents chief hum an resources managem ent service unon should request chief staff adm inistration s ection unon in conjunction with the imis coordinator to develop procedures for m aintaining basic data f or all entitlem ents they adm inister such as num bers of staff entitled to education grant num ber of children involved and the type of schools they attend rec 05 23 unon commented that the number of ducation grants processed in given period could be extracted from imis it is also possible to get from imis the number of dependent children eligible for educati on grant hrms does not see the need to know what type of school children attend education grant is processed if the staff member is eligible for it within the education grant rules oios appreciates the additional inform ation on education grant clai ms and is encouraged to know that the basic inform ation unon needs for planning and m onitoring is available oios suggested that it m ight be useful to know the type of school for verifying eligibility of such things as special education needs oios will close the recom mendation upon clarification from hrms whether it intends to collect basic inform ation on each entitlem ent and what inform ation it intends to collect f imis data integrity 24 in the oios audit of hrms conduc ted in 2000 aa2000163 oios observed that num ber of data in imis had not been correctly input by the responsible personnel in hrms it was established that som inform ation had rem ained unverified and official staff m embers docum ents required for imis processing remained uncertified over extended periods of tim as consequence recom mendation aa2000163027 was m ade requesting hrms and sas in particular to develop and im plem ent strategy outlining i the m odalities resources tim etables and deliverables require d to clean up existing imis data and ii the policies and procedures needed to ensure the accuracy of such data 25 this oios review concluded that imis data was still not accurate and recom mendation aa2000163027 will rem ain open unverified staff member data the audit team noted num ber of personnel action pa form s that had data which had not been verified by sas due to the lack of the appropriate docum ents on the individual staff members files sim ilarly inform ation such as place of hom leave was lacking for som staff m embers managem ent explained that som of this inform ation is held in headquarters unhq especially for persons who were recruited through the unhq in the opinion of oios sas could simply have put note to file that the relevant docum entation was in new york and refer to contact point to obtain the inform ation if required as an 7 alternative copies of the docum entation could have been requested for completeness 1 unon commented that the activity is ongoing to clean up the imis data the systems support unit carries out data checks and advises sas as necessary sas liaises with the concerned staff membe rs to obtain the correct data and input it upon receipt difficulties arise with data from ffices away from nairobi administered by other offices such as unog or escap staff members are also not always forthcoming in supplying information the only remedy for this would be to delay entering staff members in imis until all in formation is supplied for staff members transferring from other offices the comple official status file is requested whilst appreciating the additional inf ormation oios is of the opinion that there is m ore that can be done by sas to ensure data integrit oios has suggested in the past that sas should record on file where the releva nt docum ents are if in another duty station it has also suggested that sas send copy of data entered into imis to the staff m ember requesting verification of its accuracy b staff member birth certificatepassport as was observed during the last imis data integrity audit for hrms perform ed in 2000 there were copies of birth certificates andor passports for som staff m embers and their dependents consequently the nam date of birth and nationality f ields in the pa could not be independently verified 2 unon stated that hr officers and assi stants in sas had been reminded that copies of birth certificates and passports need to be retained for the official status file as matter of course oios notes with appreciation the unon com ment c pension information one staff m embers individual file in sas had pension participation dates on file differe nt from those indicated on their pa 3 unon commented that it would be gratef ul if oios could indicate the index number of the staff member concerned upon receipt of which corrective action will be taken oios notes the com ment and will resend the inform ation v further actions required on recommendations 4 oios m onitors the im plem entation of its audit recom mendations for reporting to the secretarygeneral and to the general assem bly the responses received on the
