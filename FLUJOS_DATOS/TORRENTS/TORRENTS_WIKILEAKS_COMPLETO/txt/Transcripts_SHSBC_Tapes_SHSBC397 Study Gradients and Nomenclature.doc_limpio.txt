study gradients and nomenclature lecture given on 6 august 1964 well whats the date audience sixth of august ad 14 what audience sixth of august it is the 6th of march audience sixth of august somebody back there says its the 6th of march its the 6th of august ad 14 saint hill special briefing course and we have another lecture today on study now probably just to get off in high gear here so the taxi cabs wont run up too big bill out there this eveningjust to get off into high gear let tell you at first that of course field of study including scientology texts of earlier times includes these principles so this is very adventurous thing im doing because it can rebound on critical you see at scientology texts because they are not written this way they are written in an effort to make people understand what youre talking about but they do not go according to these principles and future scientology texts on the other hand will go according to these principles and you will see this suddenly entering and coming over the horizon however you have at this time only bulletin or two which represent this you probably have noticed of recent times that the more recent bulletins are much easier to study and that is direct result of this study of study leave it to to study study but its very interesting that your grades on examination since i have been talking to you about studying have increased from five percent in the ninetiesfive percent of the class in the ninetiesto sixty percent of the class in the nineties thats one of these astonishing leaps you see it is too astonishing towell it would be totally unlooked for now you are already being trained above the level of modern education that is to say modern education as she is taught one shouldnt be grammatical about lowgrade things you see ive been amusing myself lately by making grammar agree with the disrespectfulness with which something should be regarded thats very interestingthe mood with which you use grammar you see and you do that too you say she aint agonna come meaning of course that you had highly disrespectful attitude towards what she said about it dont you see lot of unexplored nuances in language and that sort of thing which are quite amusing but of course thats just amusing to improve the ability of student to learn by altering the character and methodology of teaching is the exact aim here now this is quite an interesting aim that is just to alter the ability of the student to study and to learn and improve it by simply altering the teaching methodology now you see now that in itself is rather adventurous because you say well i could make the subject easier to read or something like that but how about changing the subjective reaction of the student to the subject by the method of teaching which is employed so you see how far we have reached here we are now handling in this subject the subjective reaction of the student to the subject by the method we use in teaching it so if you want to see some pandeterminism at work thats it dont you see now study normally would simply be you told somebody something and he was supposed to study it you see and if he didnt like it why you reported him to the headmaster you see that was how we achieved subjective reality on the student in universities its done by mechanisms of expulsion grade system whereby if somebody doesnt make grade he is expelled this lightly goes onhes not permitted to go into the next grade you see that very commonly but this goes up to point where somebody is expelled now that was how they tried to give the student subjective reality on the subject he was studying by of course punishment how else would you expect dont you see the thing to conduct itself in the physical universe so actually beyond an effort to present the facts and say subject was there and then provide school technology which made the individual guilty if he didnt know it the whole subject of study and training had not really much advanced beyond that point that was about the high tide of study now quite accidentally someone with intuition or insightsome professor some teacher someplace in some schoolwould depart from this rationale he would depart from this method of teaching and he would try to invite the understanding and the interest and the participation of the student and such people were very rare and people really tried students really fought to get into their classes and that was about as far as it had advanced now when we recognize that education is not very successful we have made an enormous stride forward now the educational authorities who are responsible for the education of children and adults refuse to recognize this fact and so they really dont really try to improve it but when you are down against practical subject such as scientology where you have trained this auditor as best you could and then you see him sit downyou have an element there which is missing in most educational technologies they teach the engineer to build bridge but then nobody in that university is forced to sit down and watch him build bridge much less go across the bridge he has built so you see they do not in actual fact get very good look at whether their educational methods are successful or not we teach somebody ancient greek there is nothing wrong with learning ancient greek but the teacher then never really is witness of the student speaking to the ancient greeks see he doesnt pay too much attention to this so therefore in studying study i avoided all those fields where observation of the student was not easily attained the actual doingness of the student was not easily viewed that ruled out field for the study of study you see so immediately engineering technology we could learn nothing from that because of course nobody ever sits around and watches whether or not the engineer builds the bridge you see so it had to be something as intimate as scientology which is the instructor teaches the student how to audit case and then oddly enough is able at that very minute to have him turn around and audit the case see so this of course has tendency to force progress and advance upon us and we are able then to make further advance because we have an instantaneous inspection of the results of our study so perhaps one of the reasons why the civilization has not made considerable progress in this line is because very few subjects are in this category whereby the subject instructed is not instantly practiced before the professor do you see that so that therefore gives usgives us you might say the drivers seat in this subject whereof studybecause we can see instantly with comm lag at all we dont find out whether or not this fellow turned out to be great and famous barrister dont you see twenty years hence we dont find that out but we find out whether this person became an auditor before the day is out can the person use this principle well we walk right over into the auditing section and there is the same auditor that weve just had in practical and weve just taught him something in practical and there he sits you see there he sits with his bare face showing right there and when the practical supervisor also does auditing supervision he continues to work very very hard to put his practical across to point where he sees it all of sudden in session you see so we probably have closer look than anyone else now theres great zone of tolerance in most studies they expect the student to be very amateurish lets say were teaching craft like silversmithing now we dont expect he is going to heat up any silver without burning his fingers see so we get big gradient win he heated up some silver without burning his fingers see well thats all very well and thats fine but we dont expect him to make tea service that is going to please the general manager of the british silver trust in his first few weeks of silversmithing we sort of would expect that fellow to go out and hang around silversmithing and improve his design and work with master and gradually get there and when he is about fifty why turn out some cracking marvel of piece you see that the general manager of british tea services limited or something of the sort would approve of and buy and use as standard design you see theres always this comm lag but there was field not to stretch it too far there was field where instant inspection was feasible and so that field lent itself peculiarly to study on the subject of study which would be analogous to scientology and that was the field of photography now when you tell student to take picture of tree and he goes out and takes picture of tree you in very short order are going to see picture of tree and if it is upside down and if he has cut it in half and if he didnt hold his camera level and if he had camera shake all of these things are immediately and distinctly visible furthermore we have direct and exact result of combination of actions which of course is important can he put sandwich on tray well all right he can put sandwich on tray but thats not very complex action can he make sandwich and put it on tray see all right well can he make the bread you see and make the filler and make the sandwich and make the tray and put it on the tray you see how this fieldyou could suddenly start broadening see out subject well im afraid that were invery close into that kind of subject in scientology its subject of complex actions its not subject of simple actions matter how hopefully person in coaudit when he first comes inim talking about has coauditbelieves matter how touchingly he believes that all it is is he has to sit there and nod he very very soon becomes aware that he is engaged in complex action he is expected to say something and this probably strikes him with the greatest of shock when he finally realizes he is expected to say something and that it is up to him to get the person hes auditing to say something now weve got double complexity he not only himself has to say something but the person he is auditing has to have something said to him which will cause the person he is auditing to say something do you follow this through then hes got to hear this and then he has got to acknowledge it well he probably finally masters this off canned piece of paper or something of the sort and he finally masters this and he feels very triumphant only to discover that the person who sits opposite him in the coaudit as it changes around is not the same case he gets different pcs and these pcs have different cases and this is pretty grim because we knew all we had to say to somebody was well how is your motherinlaw getting along and we had good session going but this next fellow hasnt got motherinlaw so that is total stumbling block and you would be amazed how big stumbling block that might look now he has to enter the technology if hes told that he has to do something with problems he has to enter the technology of problems what the devil is problem in order to talk to somebody about problems or dream up things about problems for the fellow to talk about we have to know something about problems now hes away into the significance of the mind added to the actions which he is performing now the normal way we go about this is to get him to perform the simple actions and then add the complexities to them one after the other on the basis that the person would become confused if given too much too fast so we have new discovery which we have made long since called gradient scales which applies in the field of study and that you teach somebody on gradient well what is meant by teaching somebody on gradient well gradient of course refers to grade which is sort of an uphill looking sort of picture dont you see its little bit more so each successive step what we mean by gradient it gets steeper or it gets more complex or it takes in more the further you go well thats gradient and as long as we attack gradientas long as we attack the subject on gradient of complexity we give him this cycle we move along into more and more numerous actions but we try to teach him each action that were going to add towere going to add to this actionso were going to teach him that action so well that it doesnt worry him and then our next action that we teach himthis has its own complexity but its done in combination with this first action but if the first action is still worrying him and he hasnt got that down then our next action is going to throw him when you see somebody getting confused then he hasnt gotten down the more fundamental action he should have gotten down before he advanced into more complex action it isnt that he doesnt understand the more complex actionhes not even confronting that action hes still confronting this more basic action see he hasnt learned that basic action well now the only place you can err in this area is trying to start in too high on the gradient and you can make that mistake and you can make that mistake with the greatest of ease its the easiest mistake to make because nothing else is done in the modern university except make this mistake they dont educatethey make that mistake modern education is really the art and science of making the mistake of too steep too quick before anybody has learned anything about it for instance ive seen german taught with ferocity and velocity and the next thing you know we were learning all about schiller whoever the hell he was whats schiller where are we how come well thats just in the lesson text see thats the fourth weeks lesson text yeah wait minute what happened to the alphabet nobody can read german alphabet in thethats used only to english alphabets you cant readone of those gothic alphabets its just gobbledygook looks like bird tracks well all right youre going to teach somebody about the nuances of schiller are you when it doesnt even look like words on page hes not yet convinced there are words on the page you see he thinks the printer spilled some ink he thinks his book has been damaged nobody bothers to teach him the german alphabet where was he supposed to learn it we look in vain for where he was supposed to learn the german alphabet because its not any part of the syllabus of that course ah but its german 1 where the hell is german 0 well they must assume that that must have been in your last life so you can make with the greatest of ease the mistake of entering gradient too high multimillion pound activity was carried on in africa teaching number of tribes down there soil erosion the techniques of preserving soil and preventing erosion parliament up here was just appropriating money along with peanuts and so forth it was back in the days when we were all comrades and they were appropriating money for these groundnutspeanuts to you americanswhich never grew and nobody could do anything with them after theyd grown them because there was other things they did it with see same time they were pouring this flood of money as support program to groundnutsthey got into soil preservation and preventing soil erosion and they poured the money into this and they poured people down there and they had people in an airlift going down to central africa to solve these staggering and fantastic problems they were having in trying to teach these natives how to not erode soil and the native was taking this in just about the way oil takes in water im sure he was being polite and gentlemanly about listening but brother he was really paying attention and it took scientologist in the middle of the program to straighten it out he did it with gradients which we already knew about he just decided that the government had cut in too late the native didnt have any reason to not erode soil well there was all of africa full of soilhow come we were preserving it it seemed to be the most bountiful substance he ever had anything to do with and this dropped back to the fact that he had idea of future so this scientologist sat down patiently and ran around and wrote them up something that they used in the program and one has never heard about it since so it must have been very successful more billions are being promoted in that direction anyway just this that you had to teach the native that there was such thing as the future and that his future welfare of his children and tribe depended to large degree on his still having pastures to graze and areas to grow things in and they taught them this very carefully and considerable enthusiasm greeted soil erosion now you very often make mistake in comm course when you find new student comes into that comm course and you are teaching him this and youre teaching him that and youre teaching him this drill and youre teaching him that drill and he doesnt know how to sit in chair man now you could go more fundamentally than thisyou could go more fundamentalmaybe he didnt know why he was there maybe he came in by mistake maybe he still has some weird idea about how come hes there now youre teaching him comm course well youre not teaching comm course to anybody thats there so our basic gradient on education is to get somebody there that sounds too simple but almost every elementary teacher in the world is making that mistake today they are teaching children who arent there and youll find the most marvelous increases in iq and learning rate take place under that very very funny simplicity and most of their big educational strides made with scientology are simply based on that one little tiny factor of getting the student there well now they dont know what theyre doing some of these teachers they think theyre doing something esoteric or wonderful when they tell the student classwhen they tell the class each morning to look at the front wall look at the back wall and look at the ceiling and look at the floor maybe theyre doing it because ron said so but it seems to work and this seems to have great deal of workability and the children all appear to have an enormous increase in intelligence even though this is only used for five or ten minutes each morning well thats quite marvelous if its only used for five or ten minutes each morning because the process obviously isnt run long enough to even get into the zone of having to be flattened nothing is going to happen here to case to amount to anything what they havent noticed before is that the children werent there to be taught and of course they look more intelligent if they are there try and run an iq test on somebody who is not sitting at the desk taking one so actually this is completely aside from the ramifications of havingness and other factors that would be involved in thisthat first step is just to get somebody there thats the first step now maybe in central organization somebody up in the academy may be saying to himself well the letter registrar already got the person here getting the person here is the duty of the letter registrar the person came in to take the course didnt he well the letter registrar was supposed to have written him letters so obviously then the person is there ive already had this explained to do you see the rationale theyve got body in class theyve got body in class now why the person is actually there they dont know that well the fads hit this course yeah once in blue moon well have new fadnot once in blue moon eithereverybody will get on fad thing for while year or two ago ive forgotten exactly when it was the problem they solved by coming to saint hill was in vogue and for while why everybody was just making marvelous ta and gorgeous case gains and so forththe problem they solved by coming to saint hill what did coming to saint hill solve as problem for you see and then they would run this out and theyd square it up and its marvelous and so forth and i dont believe i ever thought about it very much but my laughter on this situation would be based on this very elementary fact that they werent really running problems process at all see they were simply making the person aware of the fact that they had arrived at saint hill so we dont do that anymore because weve got little checksheet which goes in and out and is sometimes skipped and sometimes put back in again which has to do with getting the person to go around and spot the locations of everything around here see we take care of it with little checksheet theyre supposed to get this and supposed to get that and theyre supposed to look over this and supposed to that dont you see so there is touch assist familiarity so thatthat wipes out two things the vast mystery of where they have arrived at and the fact that they have arrived so your first gradient in education is to get somebody there it doesnt much matter how you solve it i have shown you hereget the little kids in school to spot the ceiling and spot the teacher and spot the floor and so forth youve got them there now and they respond by appearing to be far more intelligent than they were before so you say well look at the tremendous iq gain this gives nobody is smart where he is not all right so therethere is the idea of education by gradient and therepeatthe mistake you can make in education by gradient is big mistake and that is failure to undercut the gradient failure to get simple enough failure to get the primary action you must get the starting action that the person can be made sure of so that he can then go on to another action and become sure of that and go on to another action that he becomes sure of you see well now if you havent ever gotten low enough or simple enough first action for the person to become sure of then the person advancing into the next zone finds that very very complex and starts to feel sort of spinny and then the instructor starts going mad trying to explain to this student what this is all aboutthis step two see well he has never gotten to step one and from there on his education is complete mishmash and if you want to unscramble anybodys difficulties with training and so forth then you will just have to find the gradient that they overlooked or skipped or missed after which they entered into confusion and this would be very easy to find on an emeter extremely easy on an emeter and that is simply the emeter would register an early moment of confusion about study or training and it would register it repeatedly that is two or three times if its never been resolved it would only go flick or something like that if it had existed and then been resolved you see there would just be the residual charge left on the time track but if its repetitively reading if it reads several times and seems to read very strongly as he discusses itgives you in other words tone arm actionwhy then you know that it has never been resolved to this day now the difficulties that men have with their minds are those which have ridden forward with them into the present those are the difficulties that have to be treated and handledthe difficulties which they have had in the past which have ridden forward to them into the present you can always get registry on difficulty somebody has had in the past simply because it is pictured on the time track as having had difficulty but if it is not riding forward with him into the present you are simply using auditing to contact it again and it will blow it wont restimulate particularly it usually just blows for instance if you have had somebody get deep very heavy surge let put it this wayif you get somebody got aget heavy surge on meter in session you can actually put them back into that moment of the session when they got the surge and you will get some ghost of that surge thats not riding forward with them in the present time you actually took them back into the past to find the surge but you can get that surge back again because what you did was get the impression it made on the session you didnt get the original readingthat blew but then the fact that it did do this in the session is still matter of record which can be picked up so therefore accordingly you could go back into the time track of an individual and you could get an emotional reaction for everything person had ever been emotional about or you could get heavy reactionsit isnt that the reactions are necessarily heavy or softbut you could get reactions about what person has been emotional about that he is still emotional about now get the slight difference here one is simply the impression on the time track of having been emotional well youll get ayoull get needle read on that and the other one is moment on the time track when he has been emotional that he is still emotional about the thing has never been cleared up in other words and the difference between those two reactions is one will fade instantly the first onehe has simply been emotional about something he is not still emotional about that thing thats long since gone you will simply get the whooh on the needlethat needles going to move just contacting the earliest point or the point when it occurred see you are going to get needle reaction but the other thing that youre going to run into if it is still current it will repeat it doesnt blow through just being contactedit now repeats and you can get more repeat well that means it has ridden forward in time and has never been resolved i just make this point to you as an auditor you are only interested in those things which the individual has never resolved youre not interested in just those things which he didnt resolve you get the shadow of difference between he didnt resolve it so what he never did find out how to get along with his commanding officer buthe never didbut its not riding forward in time with him it isnt even capable of being restimulated therefore it will read once and go bvop and it flattens see its right now its out now you could revivify him or regress him to that moment in time and start running him through incidents which are not in restimulation and oddly enough you could get some built up that would go into restimulation as an auditor you have considerable power over the mind you see you can do some interesting things with it so theres two reactions here that you are interested in theres the reaction that simply was there and isnt bothering the fellowit hasnt ridden forward in time with him but you can get him back to it and it reacts on the meter and the other action is one that has not only been active at the time but is active now without any difficulty whatsoever you dont have to go back in time to find this thing its going to react right away and the only meter difference that you will see between those two reactions is that one the one which is still with him and is riding forward in time with him and so forth that one is repetitively reading it will read and it will read again and it will read and it will read again you see when you are checking out things you have to make sure that youve got something that will repeat one of the main faults that you make in r6 is that you do not ever ask for the repeat read well i wouldnt give you two nickels and collar button anytime ever for oneread checkoutachto now do you see why is maybe you checked it earlier and it read well when you check it again you might get the earlier read you might get the moment in the session when it read before do you understand so you are only interested in read that will repeat itself reads that dont repeat themselves have either blown or they havent ridden forward in time anyhow so the devil with them if you cant get something to read twice skip it if you can make it read twice realize that its riding forward with the pc and is therefore worrying him still worrying him to this day now all of this is necessary technology as elementary as that may be thats necessary technology to an understanding of how you would locate somebodys early confusions with regard to an educational subject because of course he was confused he was confused every time he attacked new point on the gradient but he unconfused afterwards the meter will still register those moments of first confusion but they will register as only onces so theyre not important this then i have to tell you so that you can see and evaluate the observation and then you get used to this and then you get some subjective reality on it you realize what i am telling you is true yes oh he was very confused the first time he looked at the letter he didnt know what that wasthat wasyeah well you get readone shot see you get small read there on the needle the needle moved what about the confusion about the alphabet yeah the letter whoomthe needle moves and you say all right now about the letter and there is motion he isnt still confused about but lets take this bird now and we say what about the letter and it goes whoompf now its done it once what about whoompf well how abouthow aboutcan you tell something more about being disturbed about this formation of the letter whoompf now you suddenly realize this bird cant write see you justfrom your various observations of the pc youve suddenly remembered having observed this see you didnt need the observation until that moment but this guy cant write well you want to clean up his writing well lets find out what underlay that confusion now arc must have preceded all misemotion and bad reactions you dont have bad reaction unless there has been arc in the first place theres got to have been arc with something in order to make bad action occur youve heard say that often enough well all right how about thishow about this confusion do you address the confusion in itself its just sort of an outofarc subject its never the confusion that the person is supposed to be in by himself and the instructor and thats why education breaks down now lets go over that again its not the confusion that the student is trying to learn and the instructor is trying to teach him if they are having any difficulty with that at all then thats guarantee that it isnt the right confusion you can just chalk that up with great big red mark student cant learn ityou follow were talking now about heavy reaction here not just little old light brushoverthe student cant learn it and the instructor cant get it through the students head now what are we looking at we are looking at lower point on the gradient which was skipped getting back to what we were talking about in the first place heres this point on the gradient that he didnt master and then went on to the next point with that next point he had enough confusion to cause him to be overwhelmed and he never did get that point and when you look it over on the meter thats the point youre going to get youre not going to get the original pointyoure going to get the next point on the gradient so one of the sneakers that made this very difficult to solve was the fact that the thing the student is apparently having trouble with is never the thing the student is having trouble with and you can save yourself great many instructor hours if you recognize that and get good grasp on that in actual fact now this of course follows the pattern of the mind doesnt it if the pc knows what is worrying him and if he is worrying thenif hes worryingthen that isnt what hes worried about see we know that if you know all about whats wrong with you that isnt whats wrong with you brother because of course that would asis and cease to be wrong with you thats elementary see so this applied to education gives us this other weird lookthat this same set of data applies in the field of training and what the student is very confused about and unable to move forward into and what the instructor cant seem to teach this student is not then the right point of address for instruction that must then immediately just by that adjudication that must be the wrong point of address and the instructor just pulls off of that and takes better longer look at this situation see thats elementary see let give you an examplethis becomesthis is terribly elementary very very simple stuff you can very easily overlook it one very easily not credit that this has got this much jolt in it i know an instructor in slight state of shock at some of the results that hes suddenly getting applying some of this material you see on student and did you know you know that sort of thingdidnt realize it was that strong theory instructor is checking out student on bulletin and gets to paragraph three and decides the student cant pass it but the student has been having such dreadful time that the theory instructor decides that this student had better have little bit of instruction hes not going to give him pass on this but he justquite ordinaryhes just tired of having him foul up on this particular point the student there cant ever seem to get beyond this point see so he says nownownowlook looklooklooknow can you get the idea that blablablabla and he takes up you see the third paragraph and the student gets all foggy and the instructor says now just minute lets see how can i put this little simpler how can i put it little easier see the instructor actually is reaching in the right direction but hes still staying on what the student is supposed to be confused about thats the mistake hes making but how can i get this little simpler now how can i get it little lower on the gradient now this student cant get it and the instructor cant teach him now the first thing you should know at once is that were one or more steps beyond what the student was really confused about now it goes this elementary you then go back and find what word in the second paragraphwhich obviously has been handsomely passedthe student didnt understand and it may not be scientology word at all it may be some common english word just like that and all of sudden why the student says oh you see this is not prior in time just because its the earlier paragraph in the bulletin it just happens that bulletins happen to be written more or less on gradient thats why you get the apparency of the earlier moment then but theyve actually gotten to this point then and they didnt grasp the lower point of the gradient so the upper point of the gradient is just bvuuurrr and the moment they get into this upper point of the gradient its god you know and the walls are getting closer and theres little bright spots appearing in front of their eyes and they feel sort of headachy its physiological its wonder the french over thereof course in harder time during napoleonic times we could have said who cares how many frenchmen get killed do you seebut today we shouldnt have that calloused attitude and we ought to do something about the french educational system because they drive more students to suicide than you could easily count theyre specialists specialists at making students commit suicide the american university leads in as close second they just disgrace the fellow and send him down to skid row if he errs if theyve made the mistake of too fast gradient then they condemn the fellow crazy you get how severe this is this gets intohere is another salient point i should not just interject in here but i should give you full blast is study can produce physiological reaction and it can produce some pleasant ones and it can produce some confoundedly unpleasant ones you can have some of the wildest physical reactions just from the fact of study that you care to have anything to do with and this isnt just studying scientology man this is studying how to paint barnsand its not for nothing some student will be sitting there at his drawing board or something like that and hell be getting more and morehell be getting more and more and more and more spinny and he feels sort of weird and hes making himself spots in front of the eyes and hes making himself sick trying to study any further and of course if hes being pressured forward against time for final examination he cannot sit back and go for walk in the park he cant do anything like that hes got to sit there and wrap the towel around his head dont you see and swill up the coffee and of course hes just keying himself in like mad hes tearing himself to pieces and so forth its wonder well what is the trouble with him at that moment when all this happens well the trouble with him is not what he is studying its what he has failed to study just before this is always his hangup when you get physiological reaction youve got skip on the gradient that you can be absolutely certain of youve skipped the gradient you are all of sudden going into something or other and you are studying how to lay sticks of wood across path in order to subdivide the thing and measure it up to be concerted or the number of grains of potassium bichromate that youre supposed to pour in if it is british manufacturer as opposed to american manufacturer and you say whats this now it isnt just missing datum dont get that idea see it isnt missing datum its something on the subject of the mixture of chemicals orsee it can be an analogousit can be an allied subject where more fundamental datum is or exists on see the gradient was skipped on an allied subject seeor it was just the paragraph ahead of this in the text see its not always the paragraph ahead of this in the text sometimes the fellow all these years has wondered how do you really measure something when its of irregular shape you see and howhowhahow and then all of sudden hes got this thrown in his teeth you see well you measure out this concrete walk and you so forth and so forth and now the calculus which is superannuated on this subject is so on and hes trying to understand the calculushes trying to understand the calculusand trying to understand the cal theres nothing wrong with the calculus he doesnt know how to measure walkand hes been keyed in by some sentence that went right along with what he thinks hes worried about its right there next dooronly its blank and you know the whole subject goes blank the whole surrounding area goes blank its like you shoot the top off one skyscraper and the whole town disappears i mean its that peculiar phenomenon see you say well how could that whole page disappear you know or how could that whole textbook disappear if student is having very heavy going he will have words vanish off the page i just had an experience very very short time ago i was trying to look up word in the dictionary that was included on page which i was having hard time coming to grips with and you know the word had disappeared out of the column and i said come off it now it couldnt possibly be missing out of this column it must be in this dictionary andspecialized dictionary and so forth and i just sort of gritted my teeth and concentrated eyeballs on it and by george it was right there and you know it hadnt been in the column moment before in this particular instance i however know what i dont quite understand i know what i have skipped doing and ive got to go ahead and do something about it because its just getting more and more and more into my road i do not know so that i can bark them off the complementary absorbing colors by rote i cant tell you every color combination which absorbs every component of white light except one you see that sounds very complex doesnt it it is but its this kind of an action but going on and studying beyond this point which i went ahead and did because i just didnt sit down and figure out color wheel and get it all down within an inch of its lifeits lost back there see i crowded on past it now somewhere in the vicinity of that is noncomprehend i have got that bit of noncomprehend pretty well spotted but that isnt what im studying now and that isnt what im having trouble with im actually running into point where things are disappearing off page much less headaches but just going beyond this beyond thiswell theres something back in that area it is very easy and so on but nobody has made one of these wheels there isnt an illustration of one which gives it by complementary colors in this textbook and there are wheels that give you primary colors in terms of what absorbs not them from white light see what absorbs not them list of what doesnt absorb them so that would sort of have to be compiled and id have to sit down and draw this whole thing id have to memorize all of these points of the thing and then i know i would have it straight and about that time when i started to do this something would fly up and hit in the teeth like what the hell is cyan see whats this cyan what shade is cyan i always thought cyan was blue obviously it is not blue i have all my life been told by medical examiners that when you fed somebody cyanide they turn blue and see here is big bunch of confusion going on here and there is probably some foolish word like that kicking around in that area someplace so ill just have to go back and look over this area because i know when it began you see that is i know the point that occurred before it began see you can get clever enough to spot where are you at and all you have to ask yourself or all you have to ask student where werent you having trouble now where are you having trouble good its at the end of where you werent having trouble see thats very simple isnt it so the formula is that you find out where the student wasnt having trouble with the subject and that meant that he had gone that far on the gradient successfully and then find out where he began having trouble and you pick it up right at the tag end of where he wasnt having trouble and it lies in that immediate area you can actually circumscribe it within few words i mean you can do it that precisely you can pinpoint youll have the half paragraph that its in or youll havesometimes you can get it down to the half sentence that it is in and then you start plowing it out but dont expect the student to be able to tell you exactly what it is that he is having trouble with because thats why he is having trouble with it so instruction would consist of guiding student along gradient of known data it wouldnt be inventing new solutions to the students confusions you start inventing new solutions to students confusion youre just going to get in more and more trouble why because you are already giving himhe has already got something he doesnt comprehend now youre going to give him an incomprehensible that solves it good instruction is system of backtracking student will go forwardyou can almost leave that on automaticity he will go forward like shot bear zarroom hell go into subject and all of sudden youll hear theseyoull hear this loud screak and the paws are smoking you see then you hear thud you know and then you feel the atmosphere around you shake theres something happened well exactly what did happen well he went right over the top of one point on the gradient thought he understood it didnt understand it went into the next point of the gradient and ran into brick wall so the trouble with him is it wasnt the next point on the gradient the trouble with him was that last point on the gradient that he thought he understood but didnt so therefore it becomes very difficult with student sometimes to spot this because hes so positive that he understood that last point yet the evidence that he didnt is sitting in front of your eyes hes having trouble with the next point see this fellow says oh i learned how to sit in chair i learned how to sit in chair youre teaching comm course see i learned how to sit in chair i know all about that its sitting in chair and looking at somebody in front of that is absolutely impossible thats terrible i cant do it anymore you say well lets see hereheres in the absence of this technology ones reaction might have been well lets see how can i fix up drill here to get him to look at that student now you see how that would lay an egg and extend his training see now how can i figure out something whereby he can confront this bird nahnahnahnahnahthis is notyou are at the wrong point of the gradient see heres just practical application you say well now its about sitting in chair see that waswasnt that the drill you had immediately before you had the drill of confronting the pc wasnt that the drill huh wasnt that the drill well there was little thing that came in between there he suddenly remembers what was that well that was sit in the chair comfortably and of course thats impossible oh oh there was something else in this thing yeah well anybody can sit in chair actually you can force yourself to sit in chair for hours well how do you go about sitting in chair well you sit in the chair and you bring your heels together you understand and if you bring your heels together hard enough and press them in you can press the calves of your legs out against the outer sides of the chair and you can keep yourself awake and erect what the hell is all this see knowing the principle of undercut on the gradient you see you would find that out but if you didnt know the principle you would just keep knocking your brains out trying to train this person how to confront another human being and they haventthey actually wouldnt have any trouble confronting somebody else except they are trying to confront two things at once they are confronting keeping their heels together and theyre see they havent learned how to do that and now theyre trying to confront something else at the same time their attention is split an d they are starting to get very headachy and then you find out theres something wild about it they havent understood like well why do you audit in chair why how should you audit well couldnt you audit lying in bed i get very tired auditing you see all kinds of wild little things come up you dont pay very much attention to what theyve got to do you dont try to solve those things but these considerations have got to get into the fresh air now all of sudden weve got this fellowhe suddenly looks this over oh you mean you just sit in chair oh youoh wait minute that takes some doing oh what do you mean just sit in chair just sit in chair you cant just sit in chair impossible all right now just tell whats impossible about it you dont even have to be an auditor to instruct see i mean you dont have to do lot of clever auditing whats so impossible about it whats impossible about it keeping your back twoandahalf inches from the back of the chair and so forth is impossible because you have to keepwell actually you have to keep measuring if its twoandahalf inches dont you its pretty hard to believe until it has happened to you but the whole next paragraph after the sentence which contained the word one didnt understand can just disappear right out of this world it can do the wildest piece of disappearing anybody ever saw it just vanishes almost white piece of blank page and try to check the student out on this and you can check him out on the whole bulletin but by george theres paragraph there subject matter there of any kind whatsoever you run that back youll find out theres something just prior to that collision they didnt understand and if they didnt understand that with great violence then you must realize that its just before that and you start running some student back i dont know quite where youre going to wind up well i wouldnt try to wind up outside this lifetime but i dont know quite where you would wind up become interesting what would go on now theres the primary mechanism of study study is cona studyi almost used fivedollar wordi will use fivedollar wordis concatenation of certainties its string of certainties and these are string of confidences and competences there are many many ways to promote these feelings of competence and confidence and so forth but the best way to do it is just headon thing of just making surenot that the student walks slowly but to make sure that the student walks certainly dont hold somebody back because youre not sure hes walking certainly the other point is is always let student get into trouble before you help him out dont ever help out student before hes in trouble this guy is doing his comm course drills right straight through to the bitter end he does them like little wound up doll everything is beautiful and smooth and so forth well what are you trying to dofind something to train i mean what are you going to do rack this guy over until you can find somethingtill you create something that can be wrong or why would youwhy would you do anything with it see im just making the point why would you do anything with this your participation is not invited there by any difficulty you see why worry and that is one of the reasons why study uniformly spread across group is mistake see students run into trouble that the instructor doesnt detect and other students arent running into trouble and they just try to make medium average of trouble for the whole course the whole class you see well the way to do is to let student run into all the brick walls he wants to run into and the only thing youve got to be alert for is student who has run into brick wall now when he has run into the brick wall recognize that he has bit gradient bit stage or point beyond where he didnt understand something that elementary and the next must is dont ever take up with him what he doesnt understand its waste of troublewaste of time he doesnt know what he doesnt understand always cut it back what were you studying immediately ahead of this same formula i gave you before what moment there werent you in trouble oh i wasnt in trouble over this and that and so forth that was all easy all right what moment did you get into trouble on it oh well itsohohohterrible and terrible and terrible ohohohoh oh all right now youve made bracket there havent you youve got parentheses youve got the point of trouble and youve got the point of trouble and now you must recognize that in the dead center between you will find the real trouble now the clever instructor knowing this could spot it right on out actually he doesnt have to be terribly clever but its matter of all right you say you were doing fine with this bulletin right up to this and we finally spot it i would even go so far if i were having lot of trouble to slam the guy on the meter meters are made to be used and id say now youre doing all right on this first paragraph youre doing all right on the next paragraph and you say you ran into trouble here about paragraph five well let look at paragraph five yeah there is typographical error there in paragraph five thats perfectly correct there is one now lets see you had number fournumber four you didnt have any trouble with number four paragraph four here which starts soandso and soandso you say you didnt have any trouble with that i didnt have bit of trouble with that all right now lets see lets get down toward the end of paragraph fourparagraph four here now will you please listen to this sentence soandso soandso soandso clang what is the meaning of the word disability oh well christ nobody could define disability you got the idea it isnt even that any big mental quirk sits behind it vast amount of case has to be taken into it he just doesnt dig this word man why he doesnt dig it we dont even care but he doesnt now whats very interesting is this is one of the first points of research 1947 is the influence of mislearned word on life and that was the point of research id picked up some of this from commander thompson on association of words and there are numerous other things about this but i had jumped to an unreasonable assumption about this as far as i was concerned it was relatively provable or unprovable but it was relatively nowhere they talked about association they talked about this they talked about that then i assumed then it must be that word will make somebody sick well what could be wrong with word so i started tracing backwards and getting people to redefine words and that sort of thing i wont say i had any remarkable luck because there was auditing technology that went along with it but believe people were sure interested i wasnt using any method of testing at that particular moment that would have given what the result was if it was i lost lot of people i was working with i know thats direct result that is to say they walked out and went back to work and so forth and didnt turn up in my office anymore but that still didnt demonstrate very much for that period because it wasnt well followed up i didnt have somebody on telephone to call them all up and say well why didnt you come back the next week you know but those that i did contact on the thing oh i feel fine now or you know its really something else thats worrying these days its the fact that i havent got job in mexico or something you know certainly what was worrying them ceased to worry them that was about the only thing i established out of it now we find gpms and the tremendous mass and significance mixed up with those and we must assume then that all significances expressed as symbolswords that is all significances expressed as words which of course are symbol of significanceare locks on the gpms we know whats at the middle of this hurricane now now we walk back and we take look at this thing and we are going to find out that any word that you handle which is not in the gpms is in actual fact to some degree lock on the gpms and if not on actual gpms certainly on implants they got the best of all worlds covered very heavy locks capable of producing considerable amount of commotion in somebodys skull piece your skull bone could throb for quite time see so when you got awhen you get yourself awhen you get yourself good look at this you recognize then that this is symbolical effort and one of the first reactions is simply become afraid of all words then the next immediate action after that is towell to say to hell with it and become very stupidly adventurous about it then eventually fall back into something sensible like dont stand around and chant known end word at somebodys face for half an hour not that you will do much to them they might be stuck elsewhere on the track but you certainly louse yourself up so when wewhen we examine this broad subject of teaching somebody something we are examining the subject of relaying data to person which he can receive and understand in such way that he will be able to use the datathe definition i gave you the other day just stated to fit in with this exact rationale that we are discussing nowand of course all of those are being done with wordswords motions actions or examples but theres some words mixed up in this so when you get words on bulletin when you get words on an instructors comm line when your words are going over to one of your students well dont be so sensitive about the scientology vocabulary because listen you can make as much catastrophe in not naming distinctly different part as you can in naming one too complexly i ran into an example of this in this parallel course of study basic lighting and basic profile lighting and i got toward the end of the book on portrait lighting with which id had terrible trouble all the way through i was just running into trouble on this thing troubletrouble and somehow or another getting through and getting it crosswise and getting it straightened out and so forth and i found out the there was that they had called two distinctly different things with the same word basic and i was called upon i said now wait minute i said to myself before i take this exam i better review what ive got here thelets see theres three types of lighting and one of them is rembrandt and one of them is butterfly and one of them is i cant think of it now lets see lets go over this again and then i remembered that all the way through i had sort of dimly beenthis is just different patterns positions in which you put lights not to hang you up on those things fancy names arent they rembrandt and butterfly makes butterfly because when the nose comes down it leaves little shadow underneath the nose and you could imagine it to be butterfly see and when the photographic lighting makes little shadow underneath the nose why the pro calls it butterfly lighting and rembrandt is the face plane nearest the camera is less lighted than the face planes further from the camera but not line lightingbut this one is less lighted its very prettyvery pretty lighting but those arethere are not very manythere are not very many ways you can put lights together heres these two and whats the other one whats the other one i cant think of it whats the other one you know oh well ill go back and study it over again so i study it very very carefully study it all the way through study it study it look it over now ive got it all ive gone back good now theres three kinds of lighting there thererembrandt and butterfly and where did it go i look down into head have i got ole in skull these days and finally i said theres something very funny going on here because i didnt quite know anything like at that moment because i was studying study i didnt know the power that messedup definition could have you know and i went back and i looked and i looked and i looked and i looked and i looked and i finally found what it was itstheres whole school of lighting whole system of lighting known as basic lighting its just elementary lighting youve got two lights and you shine one on the front of the being and you shine the other one on the side thats all and the ways you do that and the way his head is turned or shoulders are turned while youre doing that gives you this whole school of lighting theres nothing fancy about it the other two are the fancy lightings but this one which you simplyalmost says turn light on the subject i couldnt get and that was because under butterfly lighting there is type of lighting called basic profile lighting which everybody realizes is butterfly lighting but all professional photographers call basic profile so under butterfly lighting we have kind of lighting called basic profile but over here under this other this whole class of lighting is called basic lighting and because they hadnt sufficiently had differentiation in their nomenclature they didnt have enough terms in other wordslouse up total confusion see well that was the instructors confusion that was the people who were teaching yous confusion because you obviously were going to fall into that trap they just dug pit put stake at the bottom of it and covered it up with leaves man and youve got one right now now prepare for little line charge youve got an insufficiency of nomenclature i know youd never dream you had but if you figure how many things there are in the mind that youthat you already have you realize theres not much nomenclature for it when you realize the few little things in the mind that the medicos had and the vast array of nomenclature weve got tremendous number of parts and things in the mind and not much nomenclature and actually we dont have enough nomenclature and that would be the last in the world youd think you would accuse dianetics and scientology of but its true and you will agree with in just about split instant there is thing called an arc break assessment and theres bypassed charge assessment and hardly one of you monkeys have ever been able to tell the two apart or do either one of them and ive lately watched you falling and falling in more pits and walk into more bear traps on this one subject than you can shake stick at because bypassed charge assessment is not an assessment its an auditing by list and the name of it should be auditing by bypassed charge lists or auditing by list for bypassed charge its not an assessment now youve begun to believe you see that an assessment is something that doesnt have anything to do with auditing and thats true an arc break assessment has nothing to do with auditing you simply sit there and you reel it off with your pc usually gritting his teeth to powder and you finally see your meter react and you indicate the bypassed charge and you dont answer and you dont acknowledge and you jolly well had better not if you value his sanity or yours on r6 material you just sit there man and you reel this thing off and you find the bypassed charge and you indicate it right now its usually done in the middle of an arc break if you audit person in an arc break you will put him into sad effect so of course it cant be auditing but unfortunately we have instantly immediately afterwards called thing bypassed charge assessment by which you take the same list but treat it differently and the person is not arc broke when you have done it so that is auditing and this has been source of enormous confusion to one and all apparently why because both terms have the word assessment in them so its an inadequacy of nomenclature theres missing word you follow all right so thats all the trouble you are having with regard to it there isntthe trouble isnt any worse than that see you can see that you could auditauditing by list has to do with cleaning up each question after all thats the joburg and thats these things and you just read the question until its clean read it and get it answered till its clean and you go to the next one and you read it and answer until its clean auditing by list you can take the r6 list and you can do this with it so we had the same list which gave confusion and we had the same word attached to process which gave confusion and so forth so its very very hard oddly enough now to get auditors to do this well thats funny that it gets hard to get auditors to do this therefore it must have subtractive or detractive action in excess of merely being misdefined they couldnt do it auditing supervisors were walking around in circles now look please do an arc break assessment on this pc because he is blowing and so forth come back here is the fellow busy auditing by list you know doing bypassed charge assessment you know cleaning up everything listening to the pc you know and so forth all this sort of thing you know you know read the thing down the list and when you find the charge and so forth why indicate it to the pc and thats all there is to this ohoh i see so in other words term can be confused by being used for two different distinct purposes you could enter confusion then with not enough nomenclature as matter of fact its probably in the field of the mind has been more serious than too much nomenclature because the things were named in identification with one another do you follow now youve got this type of response so of course that will very shortly as soon as i get around to pushing out bulletin that will very shortly become of course arc break assessment is done soandso and soandso and not auditing and then theres auditing by list for bypassed charge and that becomes completely different action now youll find out thats teachable so weve covered now two things here and these two things are if you take person up the gradient too steeply he will get lost at some step always because he is confused about the prior step and he will blame the step he is lost in while being stuck in actual fact in the step he really didnt get out of and thats what makes it masked area and which makes it upset and that the responsibility for the subjective reaction of the student in very large measure lies with the instructor boy that is new departure see the students attitude and so forth is really today with scientology and what i am teaching you here right in the hands of the instructor if you want to you can almost produce the mental reaction you want to at will you could blow student off course it would work both waysim not saying youd do this but this fellow is on course and you blow him off the course you just with malice aforethought say well all right were going to blow him off the course one of the ways to do it is say all right now this is two people sitting in the chair there they are actually both preclears and they are actually both at the same time auditors and there is particular difference between the word auditor and the word pc and so forth and they really dont mean anything different at all all right very good you got that straight now good you wont have him there in about 24 hours if hes green grass off the street see what i mean you could overtly produce that reaction all right now some guy is blowing and just as he leaves and you say what word was it that i didnt get there you will find out hell stop moving because youve already got part of the charge see just by indicating its wrong with the words all right hell stop exiting in other words now lets trace it back at what moment did you get confused well it was in the last halfhour good what happened in the first halfhour see oh well it was that word very good all right thank you very much oh is that what that means yes in other words theres handling of the guy stays or the guy goes theres the instructor creating that effect or result with just the method of teaching he is using pretty sneaky huh you can get further along this linetheres more to learn on this particular subject but that isbut those things stand out like beacon the earlier gradientthe earlier part of the gradientis the one hes fallen down on now we get to the other section of it isit is really always word or phrase now of course word or phrase can be inadequate ive got one going right now inobody has bothered to tell why they use yellow filter in certain combination and in all the illustrations here sits this yellow filter what is it doing there what does it have to do with something i dont know i havent been told ive not been demandedits not been demanded of why is yellow filter there but yet that is serving as just little bit break there i know there is something about this i dont know so you see the sentence could be inexplicit or it could omit the data or accidentally deprive somebody of the information typographical error will do this the word cat is missing in the sentence the dog chased all right now we say to the student now all right lets tell us what that action is well hes confused well you certainly dont have to go very far afield to find out what hes confused about so the fault actually could be with the text as well as with the student if the text is not explicit by reason of typographical error or by some other reason and so forth the information is not relayed to him in an explicit form so then he gets confused so it isnt always his fault that he is confused dont you see you can sometimes take hold of the text hes been studying and just take one glance at it and all of sudden see that two paragraphs have been omitted out of it they are the paragraphs that define somebody you see somebody made mimeograph copy and didnt copy two paragraphs you know this corny you see that all words in an auditing session are defined except auditor and pc this is liable to bring about certain amount of confusion so the upshot of the thing is that your confusion is not necessarily the fault of the text its not necessarily the fault of the student were not trying to fix blame in this particular line were just showing you that there was something not understood it might also have been the fault of his first grade teacher see she never told him what some little word like reciprocity meant or something like this and weve gotweve got ourselves then good look at this its treated on the basis of these are the factors which you must observe as an instructor now you can put those things together you can see why he didnt attain the gradient or you can ask him why he didnt you can locate the point where he didnt move from one point of the gradient to the next point you can isolate why he did this we can see that nomenclature and other things could be responsible for this lack of definition could be responsible for this we can see lack can be responsible for it as well as an existing thing can be responsible for it and we see also that the individual would not have really clue about what he was confused about or he wouldnt be confused and we see that the instructor who is doing the best job of instruction is actually never trying to solve the problem of what the student is confused about we see the good instructor would never do that why hes already one gradient late so he just gets more confused than the student because he cant understand why the student cant understand see it says cats are sometimes white yes but i dont know why they are white and so forth actually didntdidnt ben franklin say something like that im not sure whether beniuhwherewhat is thiswherewheresusasudah well you see catswell did you ever see eat did you ever have eat uhuhuhdododo youdo you know anything about cats uhletsuhlets go get dictionary and look up picture of cats its all waste of time because it happens to be in the earlier paragraph where it said feline see he doesnt know what that is see he didnt know that applied to cats but he hung up on this earlier one so the apparency of his confusion is almost never the confusion he is actually in an instructor knowing this wont have any real difficulty answering the foolish questions he is asked and so forth because he just never bothers with them he wants to know whats going over the top but somebody asks the instructor the definition of something yes yes he says caterwump is ba and thats all okay audience okay good enough thank you
