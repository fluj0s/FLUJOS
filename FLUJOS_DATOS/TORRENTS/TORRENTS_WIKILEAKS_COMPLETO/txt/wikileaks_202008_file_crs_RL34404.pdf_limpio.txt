electronic storage devices introduction developing question in the law of s earch and seizure is whether the fourth amendment of the us constitution permits warrantless searches of the content of laptop computers and other ectronic storage devices at us borders the federal courts that have addressed this issue ve universally held that the border search exception to the fourth amendment applies to these searches making warrantless searches permissible although most of th courts did not make explicit the degree of suspicion needed to initiate such search the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit is the first to rule that the fourth amendment does not require reasonable suspicion to justify warran tless search of laptops at the border the fourth amendment mandates that search or seizure conducted by government agent must be reasonable1 as general rule c ourts have construed fourth amendment reasonablene ss as requiring probable cause2 and judicially granted warrant3 nonetheless the supreme court has recognized several exceptions to this presumptive warrant requireme nt one of which is the border search exception4 border search exception the border search

search can be conducted without warrant16 however the precise level of intrusion im posed on person or his effects in order to rise to the level of the nonr outine is undefined in the case law17 typically courts have determined the requisite degree of suspicion needed to justify the search on casebycase basis18 nonetheless supreme court decision indicates that unlike search of persons body intr usiveness may not be dispos itive factor when the search of vehicle or personal effect s is nonroutine and based on suspicion whatsoever thus even very invasive r outine searches of personal property can be conducted without warra nt and be based on suspicion whatsoever19 although the holding of montoya hernandez focused on nonroutine detention of traveler at the border lower federal courts interpreting dictum in that case began distinguishing unusually intr usive searches from routine searches20 these courts thereby expanded the border search exception by concluding that customs official may conduct routine warra ntless searches of persons or effectshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34404crs4 21 see united states v ezeiru aku 936 f2d 136 3d cir 1991 berisha 925 f2d 791 see also united

whether they were routine or nonroutine furukawa supra at 12 the court need not determine whether border search of laptop is routine for purposes of the fourth amendmen t because regardless the magistrate judge continuedwithout any reason for suspicion21 the supreme court further developed this doctrine in united states v floresmontano where the disassembly and examination of an automobile gasoline tank was determined to be routine warrantless vehicle search and therefore did not require reasonable suspicion22 the court concluded that the gasoline tank search was more intrus ive than routine vehicle search because there was heightened expectation of priv acy surrounding the contents of gasoline tank even though th search involved timeconsuming disassembly of the vehicle23 floresmontano illustrates that extensive timeconsuming and potentially destructive warrantless searches of objects and effects can therefore be considered routine and can be conducted without any particularized suspicion judicial developments on laptop searches with the advent of portable computing it is now common practice for travelers to store their data on laptop computers co mpact discs and othe r electronic storage devices and to travel with them across the us border in response customs officials have been searching and seizing such vices the issue confronting federal courts is whether the border search exception app lies to electronic storage devices and if it does what degree of suspicion is n eeded to justify warrantless search the supreme court has yet to address this issue most lower federal courts however have concluded that searches of laptops computer disks and other electronic storage devices fall under th border search exception which means neither warrant nor probable cause is necessary to support the search24 nonetheless these courts have not explicitly established the degree of suspicion required to justify warrantless search of laptop at the border rather they found the particular searches before th em supported by reasonable suspicion25 even whenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34404crs5 25 continued correctly found the customs official had reasonable suspicion in this case 26 ickes 393 f3d at 507 noting that the computer search did not begin until the customs agents found marijuana paraphernalia and child pornography which raised reasonable suspicion hampe supra at 45 holding that even though the laptop search did not implicate any of the serious concerns that w ould characterize search as nonroutine the peculiar facts of the case gave rise to reasonable suspicions 27 533 f3d 1003 1008 2008 we are satisfied that reasonable suspicion is not needed for customs officials to search laptop or othe r personal electronic storage device at the border 28 393 f3d 501 4th cir 2005 29 id at 502 30 id at 503 31 id 32 idthe courts concluded that the laptop searches were routine they also found reasonable suspicion supporting the search26 the one exception to this trend is united states v arnold where the ninth circuit explicitly held that reasonable suspicion was not needed to support warrantless border search of laptops and othe r electronic storage devices27 thus the courts of appeals have not yet handed down decisions on whether reasonable suspicion is always required or whether lower degree of or suspicion is sufficient to justify warrantless sear ch because laptop border search cases are developing area of case law closer look at the facts of these cases and the approaches the courts use is warranted united states v ickes one of the first federal appellate cases to discuss the border search of laptops is united states v ickes 28 in ickes customs official w ithout warrant searched the defendants van near the canadian border after discovering during routine search videotape that focused excessively on young ballboy during tennis match29 his suspicions raised the official requested the assistance of colleague they then proceeded to conduct more thorough search in which they uncovered marijuana paraphernalia photo album c ontaining child pornography computer and several computer disks30 other customs officials proceeded to examine the contents of the computer and disks all of which contai ned additional child pornography31 the defendant later filed moti on which was denied by the trial court seeking to suppress the contents of the computer and disks on both first and fourth amendment grounds32 the fourth circuit held that the search of the defendants computer and disks did not violate either the first or four th amendment the court rejected the defendants contention that the first am endment bars the border search exception from being applied to expressive materials the

the court believes that such searches will typically occur only when customs official s reasonable suspicion35 united states v romm the ninth circuit has also addressed this issue in united states v romm 36 the defendant in the case had arrived at an airport in british columbia when canadian customs agent after discovering that he had criminal history conducted search of the defendants laptop37 during the search the canadian customs agent uncovered child pornography sites in the laptops internet history the defendant was consequently denied entry into canada and flown to seattle38 the canadian authorities informed us immigration and customs enforcement ice of the contents of the defendants laptop when the defendant arri ved in seattle ice detained the defendant and ma naged to convince him to allow ice agents to examine his laptop without warrant39 ice agents then used forensic analysis which recovered deleted child nography from the laptop the defendant later filed motion that sought to suppress the eviden ce obtained from his laptop which the trial court denied40 the ninth circuit held that the forensic analysis used by the ice agents fell under the border search exception41 the court noted that airport terminals were the functional equivale nts of border allowing customs agents to conduct routine border searches of all deplaning passengers42 the court then proceeded to classify the search of the defenda nts laptop as routine43 however the court reached this conclusion only after noting that the defenda nt had failed to brie f his argument

precedential effect44 united states v arnold in united states v arnold another ninth circuit cas the court apparently disregarding the traditional routinenonroutin distinction used in most border search cases expressly held that reasonable suspicion was not required to support warrantless laptop border search45 here the defendant was returning from the philippines when customs agent chose h im for secondary questioning after the defendant had gone throug h the customs checkpoint46 the customs agent without warrant ordered the defendant to turn on the computer so she could see if it was functioning47 while the defendants luggage wa s being inspected another customs agent searched the laptops contents and found pictures of nude adult women48 the defendant was then detained for several hours while special agents from ice conducted more extensive search of the laptop and discove red material they believed to be child pornography49 the ninth circuit first stated that warrantless searches of closed containers and their contents can be conducted at the bor der without particular ized suspicion under the fourth amendment50 nonetheless the court noted that the supreme court has recognized two situations where reasonabl suspicion is required to conduct search of property 1 when the search is destru ctive and 2 when the search is conducted in particularly offensive manner51 outside of these two situations reasonable suspicion is not required for search of property regardless of the nature of the property being searched thus the ninth circuit refused to recognize any special qualities of laptops that may distinguish them from other containers such as laptops capability to store large amounts of private data the court did not find search of laptop to be intrinsically offensive simply because laptop had large storage capacity52 instead the court treated lapt op border searches differently from any other type of border search53httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34404crs8 54 id at 1008 55 id 56 id at 1010 57 policy regarding border search of in formation july 16 2008 customs and border protection policy document available at h ttpwwwcustomsgov linkhandlercgovtravel admissibilitysearch_authoritycttsearch_authoritypdf 58 presumably an individualized suspicion st andard is synonymous with or perhaps even weaker than reasonable suspicion standardthe ninth circuit also rejected the use of intrusiveness analysis an intrusiveness analysis would require that the potential intrusiveness of each search be evaluated on casebycase basis in order to determine whether reasonable suspicion would be needed to justify the search54 the court instead adopted categorical approach to warrantless border s earches so long as the search is of physical object rather than persons body r easonable suspicion is not required if the search is not physically destructive or par ticularly offensive the ninth circuit also refused to apply least restrictive means test to evaluate the constitutionality of border agents chosen met hod of conducting the search55 thus border agent can conduct search without having to dete rmine whether less intrusive means is available the argument in favor of this categorical approach is that it is easier for border agents on the other hand the bread th of the ninth circuits border search doctrine allows border agents almost total discretion in determining both when and in what manner to conduct search so long as the border agent only searches physical object and not persons body finally the ninth circuit refused to r ecognize first amendment protection of expressive materials searched at the border similar to the reasoning in ickes the court held that doing so could protect rrorist communications create an unworkable standard for government agents nd contravene supreme court precedent56 us customs and border protection policy on border laptop searches us customs and border protection cbp the primary agency entrusted with border security has disclosed policy document which outlines the procedures to be used when conducting laptop border search the policy dated july 16 2008 states that it is meant to provide guidance for cbp officers regarding the border search of information contained in docum ents and electronic devices57 the policy paper states that cbp fficers who are conducting warrantless border search of information may w ithout any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing58 review all information transported by any individual attempting to enter reenter depart pass th rough or reside in the united states if necessary these officers also have the discre tion to detain documents nd electronic devices for reasonable period of time in order to conduct thorough border search thishttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34404crs9 59 while cbp characterizes this statement as policy statement it is conceivable that some might argue that this document is substantive rule that could only be put into effect through notice and comment rulemaking proce dures such substantive rules are reviewable under the apa for more information on the distinction between policy statements and substantive rules see jeffrey s lubbers guide to federal agency rulemaking 94 4th ed 2006information will only be returned and copies destroyed if it is determined after review of the information that ther is probable cause of wrongdoing pursuant to this policy individualized suspicion is not required if cbp officer needs to detain information that must be translated or decrypted if the information is not in foreign language and is unencry pted but otherwise technical in nature cbp officer may only detain the information for subject matter assistance if there is reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing if assistance from another agency is required cbp should receive it within 15 days of the detention of the informati on if more time is required cbp can ex tend the detention for seve nday terms if upon review of the information cbp officer determines that there is probable cause of wrongdoing the cbp officer may retain the originals and all copi of the relevant information absent probable cause the cb p officer may only retain information related to immigration matters the policy also includes special provisions applicable to certain categories of information business information for ex ample should be treated as business confidential information and cbp officers should take reasonable care to protect it from unauthorized disclosure these sp ecial provisions provide protections analogous to protections of paper docum ents for example cbp officers may also not read corres pondences c ontained in sealed letter class mail without an appropriate search warrant or consent however correspondences transmitted by private courier such as federal express or ups are not considered to be mail and may be searched without individualized spicion there is also provision which states that cbp officers should first seek advice from the us attorneys office or the associateassistant chief counsel of cbp before conducting the search of information covered by ttorneyclient privilege cbp has characterized the policy paper as an internal policy statement that creates private right to the extent that cbps characterization of this document as an internal policy statement is correct an individual who allege s violation of this policy by cbp officer would not have cause of action available under the administrative procedure act

laptops and other electroni c storage devices60 both bills would prohibit laptop searches based solely on border search authority hr 6702 the electronic device privacy act of 2008 would establish fundamental rules that would prohibit federal border officer from basing the border search or seizure of digital electronic device or electronic storage media on the power of the united states to sear ch and seize the effects of individuals seeking entry into the country instead th bill would mandate that border search of such devices could only be conducted if there is reasonable suspicion regarding the owner of the device furthermore the device could only be ized if some other constitutional authority besides the border search authority permits the seizure an officer who conducts such search would so be required to be trained to handle electronic devices in order to prevent accidental damage to the device or information the bill would require that the secretary of homeland security promulgate rules regarding these searches specifically with regards to the length of time devices can be detained by border officers the rights of owners to retrieve detained devices and maintaining the integrity of all information detained and shared with other government agencies and publish thes rules on the departments website61 similarly hr 6588 the electronic device privacy act of 2008 would prohibit federal officers from conduc ting warrantless laptop borde r searches based on the united states border search authority however the bill expressly provides that it does not limit laptop search conducted under any ot her federal authority62 conclusion it is arguable that there is higher expectation of privacy surrounding the contents of laptops than other types of phy sical property such as the interior of vehicle even when vehicle search involves an onerous and time consuming inspection of gasoline tank the expectati on of privacy surrounding the vehicle and its contents does not appear to be as high as the expectation of privacy regarding the contents of laptop whic h often contains private or otherwise privileged information on the other hand laptop search

compelling state interest in preventing the sexual abuse of children and that the distribution of child pornography is intrinsically related to that state interest 66 see ickes 393 f3d at 506bodycavity searches where the expectation of privacy is so high and the search so invasive that both clearly fall w ithin the realm of the nonroutine63 in addition to privacy interests courts have taken range of policy concerns into account when determining if reasonable spicion must justif warrantless border search for example when courts have conducted border search analyses they have frequently considered potential harms resulting from illegal materials smuggled into the united states through laptops and ectronic storage devices as stated in ramsey the border search exception is grounded in the recognized right of the sovereign to controlwho and what may enter the country64 laptops can present challenge to the nations ability to control what enters its borders because the vast and compact storage capacity of laptops can be used to smuggle illegal materials in light of this courts have he ld that routine searches of laptops at the border may be justified because of the strong government interest in preventing the dissemination of child pornography and other forms of obscene material that may be contained in laptops65 another justification may be to facilitate searches of laptops owned by suspected terrorists which may contain information related to planned terrorist attack66 on the other hand if customs offici als can conduct laptop border searches without the need for reasonable suspicion th ere is the potential fo r custom officials to conduct targeted searches based on jus tifications prohibited by the constitution for example if customs official could conduct sear ch without providing cause it may be more difficult to deter ethnic pr ofiling because the official would not need to explain why he conducted the search ch concerns suggest that resolving the issues surrounding laptop border searches will involve striking careful balance between national security nd individual civil rights the ninth circuit by equating the privacy interest implicated in personal information with that surrounding normal pe rsonal effects has adopted categorical approach to the border search doctrine the court has concluded that the search of all physical objects does not require reasonable suspicion unle ss the search is conducted in manner that is destructive or particular ly offensive so far the ninth circuit is the first circuit to have explicitly stated that such searches do not require reasonable suspicion whether other federal circuits adopt this approach or fashion other methods to ascertain whether particular border search requires reasonable suspicion is an open question
