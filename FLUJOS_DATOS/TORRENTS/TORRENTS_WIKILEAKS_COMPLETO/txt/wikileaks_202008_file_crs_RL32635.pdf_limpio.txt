accomplish this analytical mission one difference between these two bills with respect to the directorate of intelligence is that s 2845 section 143 propos that the direct orate also conduct net assessments comparison of terrorist intentions and capabilities with assessed national vulnerabilitie s and countermeasures hr 10 section 1021 does not have similar provision planning hr 10 establishes directorate of strategic planning to provide strategic guidance and plans for counterte rrorism operations conducted by the us government s 2845 sec tion 143 establishes direct orate of planning which among other functions would monitor the implementation of counterterrorism operations assigned to partments and agencies one difference between these two bills with respect to the planning is that s 2845 section 143 appears to provide more au thority to the directorate of planning with respect to assigning responsib ilities for counterterrorism operations to departments and agencies as well as monitoring the implementation of these assignments director of national c ounterterrorism center under hr 10 section 1021 the nctc director is appoi nted by and reports to the nid

integrate counterterrorism intelligence inside and out side united states develop interagency more than one department counterterrori sm plans ensure that collection of counterterrorism intelligence and c onduct of c ounterterrorism operations is informed by analysis of all source intelligence one difference appears to be that the mission under hr 10 section 1021 does not allow the nctc to assign operationa l responsibilities to ot her departments and agencies it also does not appear that s 2845 section 143 has any prohibition of intelligence relating to domestic counterte rrorism being provided to the nctcs directorate of intelligence for analysis duties and responsibilities of director under hr 10 section 1021 the duties and responsibilities of the nctc director involve serving as principal advisor to the national intelligence director on intelligence operations relating to counterterrorism providing strategic guidance and plans for civilian and military counterterrorism efforts and advisi ng the nid on budget proposals of the departments and agencies under s 2845 section 143 the nctc director serves as principal adviser to the presiden t and the national intelligence director on interagency counterterrorism planning and activities and has certain personnel authorities insofar as the incumbent would concur in or advise the president on selection of certain c

industry division 77771 overview the house and senate bills contain numerous provisions designed to enhance aviation security in both bills there are specific provisions that address the aviation securityrelated provisions of the 911 commission the house bill directly addresses the 911 commission recommendati on regarding enhancing passenger prescreening and making it g overnmentrun function that exploits the integrated and consolidated terrorist watch lists the senate bill does not address this recommendation directly but c ontains several provisions th at would allow air charter and aircraft rental companies to prescreen certain customers both the house and the senate bills contain provisions that directly address the 911 commission recommendation regarding detection of explos ives on airline passengers while the senate bill contains language addressing the 911 commission recommendation to expedite deployment of inline baggage screening systems the house bill does not while an earlier house bill hr 5121 fro m which the aviation security provisions in hr 10 were derived did contain language to increase funding for inline baggagehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs26 screening this language was not included in hr 10 both the house and the senate bills contain provisions addressing th 911 commission recommendation calling for the transportation security administration t sa to intensify its efforts to identify screen and track air cargo shipments and both bills contain provisions to study the feasibility of the 911 commission recommendation to deploy hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft the house bill specifically addresses the 911 commission recommendation regarding strategic planning for transportation security whereas the senate bill does not the h ouse and senate bills each contain numerous additional provisions for enhanc ing aviation security that were not addressed by the 911 commission the specific aviationsecur ity related provisions of both bills are discussed in furt her detail below house provisions the house bill contains numerous provisions that address all 911 commission recommendations regarding aviation security except for the recommendation for the tsa to expedite deployment of inline baggage screening systems the house bill also contains numerous miscellaneous provisions to enhance aviation security that we re not addressed by the 911 commission the house bill section 2171 would direct tsa to issue guidance for the use of biometrics in airport access control systems and to establish uniform travel credential for law enforcement officers th at incorporates biometrics the 911 commission report mentioned biometrics tec hnology in the context of secure travel documents but not specifically with respect to aviation security the house bill contains provision s ection 2172 that would require the department of homeland security dhs to prepare and update transportation security plan and specific security plans for each transportation mode including aviation the house bill specifies that th modal security plan for aviation should at minimum set riskbased priorities select the most practical and costeffective methods for protecting aviation assets assessing ro and missions to federal state regional and local authorities and aviation stakeholders establish mitigation and recovery plan in the event of terrorist attack and establish threat matrix identifying specific security layers imple mented to protect against each identified threat this directly addresses th recommendation of the 911 commission to establish riskbased priorities for protecting transportation assets and based on this prioritization select the mo st practical and cost eff ective plans and budgets for implementing means to defend transportation assets the commission further recommended that these plans should assign ppropriate roles to fe deral state and local authorities as well as to tr ansportation industry stakeholders the house bill would require the tsa to begin testing of the next generation passenger prescreening system referred to by the administration as secure flight by november 1 2004 see section 2173 th bill further requires that the system be fully deployed giving tsa direct responsibility for comparing passenger name records with lists of individuals that are to receive secondary screening or those that are to be denied boarding within 180 days after the completion of system testing the bill requires that the prescreening sy stem ultimately rely on data contained within the larger integrated and consolidated terrorist watch list this provision addresses the 911 commissi on recommendation that the tsa expeditiously assume responsibility for passenger prescreening using the larger set of watch listshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs27 maintained by the federal government the bill also requires airlines to begin providing passenger data for system implementation within 60 days of the completion of system testing implemen tation of passenger prescreening has been stymied by airlines legal concerns rega rding the provision of data which led the 911 commission to recommend that airlines be required to supply the information needed to test and impleme nt passenger prescreening the house bill also incorporates floor amendment offered by representative mica that would require prescreening of passengers on international flights to and from the united states against the consolidated and integrated terrorist watch list within 60 days after enactment administration plans are for the bureau of customs and border protection cbp to retain re sponsibility for comparing passenger names against terrorist watch lists on interna tional flights while the tsa will conduct prescreening on domestic flights at presen t passenger data on international flights to the united states is often not received by cbp until the flight has already departed the house bill contains provision that would require the tsa to carry out pilot program to evaluate the use of blas tresistant containers for carrying baggage and cargo on passenger airliners the measure would authorize 2 million to carry out the pilot program and provi des financial assistance to cover increased costs to air carriers as incentives to volunteer for the pilot program the house bill would require the tsa to submit report detailing the results of this pilot program within one year of enactment this m easure addresses the 911 commission recommendation to deploy at least one rdened cargo container on every passenger aircraft that also hauls cargo to carry an suspicious cargo but does not mandate such action beyond the pilot program ev aluation of this recommendation the house bill contains provision section 2176 that would require the tsa to develop technology to better identify track and screen air cargo the 911 commission noted that major vulnerabilities continue to exist in air cargo and recommended that the tsa intensify effort s to identify track and appropriately screen potentially dangerous cargo in both aviation and maritime transportation modes the 911 commission recommended that the tsa and the congress give priority to improving the ability of scr eening checkpoints to detect explosives on passengers the 911 commission recommended that as start each individual selected for special screening should be screened for explosives the house bill section 2174 would direct tsa to devel op and deploy technology that can detect explosives and nonmetallic weapons on ai rline passengers or in their carryon baggage an existing tsa pilot program is evaluating portals and other technology for passenger explosives detection in seve ral airports but the technologies currently being evaluated do not detect either nonmetallic weapons or biological and radiological material the house bill section 2174 also requires tsa to give congress strategic plan for deploying nd using explosives detection equipment at airport screening checkpoints section 2177 of the house bill would establish new checkpoint screening security fund that would be funded by av iation security fees at level of 30 million per year in fy2005 and fy2006 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs28 section 2173 of the house bill would require the tsa to initiate pilot program to test integrate and deploy next gene ration checkpoint screen ing technology at five or more airports the provision also w ould require that human factors studies be conducted to improve screener performance as part of this program this section addresses the 911 commissi on recommendation that the tsa and congress give priority to improving the ability to screen passengers for explosives and the recommendation that tsa conduct human factors study to understand problems in screener performance and establish pe rformance objectives for screeners and screening checkpoints the house bill also contains provisi on section 2179 that would establish civil penalty of up to 25000 for each violati on of requirements to keep the cockpit door secured during operation of passenger aircraft this provision also makes technical changes to enforcement of secu rityrelated civil offenses to place the authority for imposing fines and penalties for cockpit door violations and attempts to carry concealed dangerous weapons on board aircraft with the dhs instead of with the department of transportation dot provision in the house bill sec tion 2181 would require continued development and implementation of procedures to protect the identity of federal air marshals by november 1 2004 this pr ovision was not recommended by the 911 commission however media re ports have indicated that air marshal identity may be compromised due to checkin procedures that take place in public view as well as dress code requirements that may be counter to mainta ining covert undercover presence among airline passengers provision of the house bill section 2181 would provide for training on in flight counterterrorism proce dures and tactics to be made available to federal law enforcement officers who fly while on duty these officers are permitted to carry firearms in the aircraft cabin and could be security asset in hijacking or other security situation however these officers currently r eceive formal specialized training on inflight security and law enforcement this measure is separate from ongoing efforts to crosstrain customs and immigration officers to be federal air marshals thus providing surge capacity to deploy additional air marshals during periods of heightened thr eat against aviation assets section 2182 of the house bill would requi re tsa to implement pilot program allowing federal flight deck officer ffdo program participants deputized armed pilots to carry their firearms on their persons when transiting to and from their cockpit assignments current proce dures require armed pilots to keep their firearms secured in locked box when out side of the cockpit and prohibit carriage of the weapon in the aircraft cabin when the pilot is being transported to or from hisher flight assignment section 2183 of the house bill woul d require the tsa to expedite implementation of the registered traveler program which is currently being tested in cooperation with airlines using volunteer freque nt fliers at five major airports the program allows passengers to voluntar ily provide background information and biometric data so that their identity can be validated and vetted against terrorist watch lists program participants can then be exempted from additional screeninghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs29 requirements beyond the initial physical sc reening conducted at checkpoints it is hoped that widespread implementation of this program can assist the tsa in allocating its limited resources by focusing secondary screening efforts more specifically on passengers who are of high risk or unknown risk by more readily identifying passengers who are considered low risk to aviation security section 2814 of the house bill would require the tsa in coordination with the federal aviation administration faa to study the viability of providing wireless technologies or other methods of discrete communications between the aircraft cabin and the cockpit for use in cases of security or safety concerns in the cabin despite language in the homeland security ac t of 2002 pl 107296 that amended the aviation and transportation security act tsa pl 10771 to require that air carriers provide flight atte ndants with discreet ndsfree wireless method of communicating with the pilots such technolog ies have not yet been deployed for this purpose this provision specifically direct s the tsa to consider readily available technologies in the study and to report on their findings within 180 days of enactment provision section 2185 of the house bill would require the tsa to submit report within six months of enactment regarding the costs and benefits and its recommendations regarding the use of s econdary flight deck barriers while secondary flight deck barriers are not curre ntly required united airlines has received tsa and faa approval to begin installing s econdary barrier on some of its aircraft the purpose of such barrier is to provide cockpit security during times when the hardened cockpit door is opened such as for flight crew meal service or flight crew access to the aircraft lavatory section 2186 of the house bill would ex tend authorization for appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for avia tion security for one year expiring at the end of fy2006 under atsa authorizati on for aviation secur ityrelated activities is set to expire at the end of fy2005 finally section 2187 of the house bill w ould require the tsa to submit report to congress on airport perime ter security within 180 days of enactment the report is to examine the feasibility of access cont rol technologies and procedures including the use of biometrics or ot her identification methods be st practices for perimeter access control techniques nd an assessment of the feasibility of screening all individuals entering airport secured ar eas and strengthening background checks for secured access areas senate provisions like the house bill the senate bill considers many of the 911 commission recommendations howe ver the senate bill contains provisions addressing the 911 commissi on recommendation pertaining to the deployment of hardened cargo containers on passenger aircraft the senate bill s 2845 section 612 would authorize funding for the tsa to conduct research and development on applications of bi ometrics to aviation security the senate bill contains provisions s ections 602604 that would require the dhs to establish procedures within one year of enactment under which charter operators or companies that rent airc raft weighing more than 12500 pounds mayhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs30 provide the names of customers to the ts for comparison against comprehensive consolidated database of known or suspected terrorists and their associates after one year of experience with this system the dhs is to provide report detailing the feasibility costs and benefits of expanding this program to include customers who charter or rent aircraft weighing less than 12500 pounds these measures do not specifically address the 911 commission recommendation regarding implementation of new passenger prescreening system because that recommendation specifically targeted the prescreening of airline passengers and did not consider or recommend expanding such program to other aviation activities however the senate bill contains separate provisions section 401c and secti on 1120b that address the airline passenger prescreening recommenda tion by requiring the dhs to report on the criteria for and standards for the accuracy in adding names to the consolidated terrorist watch lists and implement pro cedures for removing names erroneously placed on lists that are used to deny passeng ers boarding or subject them to additional screening measures regarding the 911 commission recommendation to improve measures to detect explosives on passengers the senate bill sections 608 and 1034 directs dhs to improve the capability of passenger screen ing checkpoints to detect explosives requires that until all passengers can be screened for explosives any individuals selected for additional screen ing shall be screened for explosives authorizes funding for rd on technology for detecting explos ives and biological and radiological material and directs tsa to establish p ilot program to evaluate portal screening systems and similar equipment at up to 10 airports the senate bill also requires dhs to give congress status report and assessment of additional needs regarding checkpoint explosives detec tion section 617 and repor t on how it will achieve the objective of screening all passengers for ex plosives section 1034 also the senate bill section 612 authorizes an additiona l 20 million for research and development of biometric technology app lications for aviation security and authorizes 1 million to establish centers of excellence in biometrics with regard to the 911 commission recommendation to expedite inline baggage screening systems at airports recommendation on which the house bill was silent the senate bill would authorize 150 million each year in fiscal years 20052007 to fund airport security projects that have received letters of intent lois and allow loi reimbursements to span over period not to exceed 10 years lois are vehicles to commit future federal funding to airports for projects related to integrating baggage screening equipment into baggage handling systems the senate bill also contains provisions section 608 th at would require the dhs to establish

provisions title v addressing the 911 commission recommendation for the tsa to intensify efforts to identify screen and track air cargo specifically the senate bill would require the screening inspection or implementation of other means to ensu re the security of cargo transported in passenger and allcargo aircraft it would also require th dhs to develop strategichttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs31 plan for air cargo security the senate bill also mandates pilot program for evaluating cargo screening measures under these provisions the senate bill requires implementation of system for regular inspections of air cargo shipping facilities and allows the dhs to increase the number of inspectors to carry out these inspections the senate bill would requi re the creation of an i ndustrywide knownshipper database pilot program nd would require the dhs to conduct random audits and inspections of security at freight forwarder indirect air carrier facilities and ensure compliance with security standards the measure would also require the dhs to implement security program for allcargo operators covering security of the cargo operations and acceptance areas access to aircraft and security of cargo shipments under this program background checks would be required for all employees accessing the air operations area and flight crews and persons carried aboard all cargo aircraft would be screened another provision of the senate bill section 606 would authorize an additional 200 million each year in fiscal years 20052007 for improving cargo security on passenger and allcargo aircraft establish grant program for nextgeneration air cargo security technology and authoriz 100 million each year in fiscal years 2005 2007 for this purpose the senate bill s ection 607 would also require the dhs in consultation with the dot to develop and implement plan for cargo security for passenger and allcargo ope rations based on the recommendations of the cargo security working group of the aviation security advisory committee stakeholder advisory group to tsa this measure w ould also require the tsa to promulgate regulations to evaluate freight forwarders indirect air carriers and ground handling agents including background checks and terro rist watch list checks of employees of these organizations the provisions would require the tsa to evaluate the increased used of canine teams to inspect air cargo including targeted inspections of high risk items and double the amount of air cargo sc reened or inspected within 1 year of enactment as compared to levels at th end of fy2004 this section would also require the tsa in coordination with the f aa to require allcargo aircraft to use barrier such as hardened cockpit door to prevent unauthorized access to the flight deck from cargo compartment and would mandate the physical screening of all persons and their effects transported on allcargo aircraft within one year of enactment finally this section would require searches of allcargo aircraft at the beginning of each day and that allcargo aircraft be secured or sealed or access stairs removed when unattended the senate bill also contains provisions designed to enhance the identification of flight crews and passe ngers first section 601 would permit the dhs to implement program using identification verification technologies such as biometric scanners for screening passengers s econd section 601 would require the faa to develop tamperresistant pilot creden tials with photographs and other unique

section 620 and require the dhs to report on cu rrent telecommunications and information technology equipment and capabilities at tsa sites and provide an assessment of current and future telecommunications and information technology needs at these sites section 1110 comments both the house and the senate bills contain numerous provisions many of which directly address 911 commission recommendations and others which address other aviation security concerns not addressed in the 911 commission report the two bills are similar in regard to the manner in which they address some 911 commission recommendations in par ticular with regard to detecting explosives on passengers the two bills contain many similar provisions on other issues the two bills differ significantly in their emphasis for example the house provisions on passenger prescreening lay out specific provisions to address the 911httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs33 commissions concerns whereas the focus of the senate bill is to expand prescreening into other areas of avia tion like charter operations which was not considered by the 911 commission on th other hand with regard to air cargo security the provisions in senate bill are significantly more prescriptive and more focused on procedures to secure air cargo as compared to the house provision which focuses very broadly on the development of technology to meet the 911 commission recommendation of improving air cargo identification tracking and screening while the house bill contains specific provisions to address the 911 commission recommendation to establish strategic plan for aviation and transportation security the senate bill does not address this issue the senate bill also does not specifically address human factors issues at screening checkpoints an issue of concern for the 911 commission however the house bill doe s contain provision addressing this recommendation by including studies of human factors to improve screener performance in its provision for assessing next generation checkpoint screening equipment both the house and the senate bills contain numerous provisions addressing aviation security issues that were not addressed in 911 commission recommendations both bills contain provi sions to mitigate the threat of shoulder fired missiles manpads however while the house bill focuses more on international efforts to cont rol the proliferation of th weapons the senate bill focuses more on the assessment of ongoing effo rts to secure airports and evaluate the feasibility of using aircraftbased antimiss ile systems both bills discuss methods to better conceal the identity of air mars hals but the senate bill focuses more on means to enhance the presence of air marsha ls on us flights while the house bill focuses on provisions to train foreign air ma rshals for deployment on foreign airliners operating to and from the united states in sum the two bills differ significantly with regard to their aviation security provisions however these differing provisions appear to be largely complementary rather than competing or in conflict in their language other matters prepared by

chimera sy stem that would permit automated data exchange by connecting the data systems operated independently by the intelligence community and the proposed national count erterrorism center this provision would require the national intelligence director to establish an interim system within one year of enactment and fully functional system that incorporates the best available biometric identif ication and linguistic cap abilities by september 11 2007 within the national counterterrorism center the purpose of this system would be to provide intelligence officers federal law

foreign tiguous territories who were also bearing identification documents designated by dhs as 1 reliable proof of us citizenship and 2 of type that may not be issued to an unlawfully present alien within the united states hr 10 3001 another provision would limit the authority to waive identification document requirements of foreign nationals entering from foreign contiguous territories or

security hr 10 3002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs40 additionally hr 10 would require that fo r purposes of establishing his or her identity to any federal employee an alien present in the united

relate to terrorist activity it would expand the terrorrelated grounds for inadmissibility nd deportability to include additional activities such as receiving militarytype tr aining by or on behalf of terrorist organization hr 10 303435 it would also deny such aliens relief from removal to particular country on account of wellfounded fear of persecution hr 10 3031 though such aliens coul d still have their re moval withheld or deferred if they were more likely than not to face torture if removed pursuant to regulations implementing the conventi on against torture hr 10 would also establish more stringent standards for asylum applicants accused by their home countries of being involved in terrorist or guerrillarelated activ ities applicants who may not necessarily be inadmissible or deportable on terrorrelated grounds by requiring such applicants to demonstrate that their race religi on nationality membership in particular social group or political opinion was or will be central reason for their persecution if removed hr 10 3008 hr 10 would also affect the ability of certain other classes of aliens to enter or remain in the united states aliens who have committed ordered

to ensure that people are w ho they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists house provisions hr 10 30513060 the house language establishes minimum document requirements verificati on and issuance standards for acceptance by federal agency the house bill includes requirement that drivers licenses or identification cards contain specific information featur designed to prevent tampering and have common machiner eadable technology states would be required to verify with the issuing agency the issuance validity and completeness of any presented documents as well as verify an individuals legal presence in the united states in addition to have th documents accepted by federal agencies states would be required to adopt procedures and practices to ensure that they meet the requirements of this section the house bill also authorizes that grant funding be made available to the states to be eligible for these grants however the state must agree to participate in an interstate compact regarding the electronic sharing of driver license data senate provisions s 2845 section 1027 the senate language would require the secretary of transportation in consultation with the secretary of homeland security to establish minimu m documentation veri fication processing and security standards for drivers licen ses or personal iden tification cards for acceptance by federal agencies in addition the regulations are to require states to confiscate drivers license or personal identification card if any component or security feature is compromised finally the regulations are required to contain procedures designed to protect the privacy and civil rights of applicants for drivers licenses and identification cards httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs43 comments while both versions of the bill attempt to address the problem of identification fraud identified by the 9 11 commission it appears that the house of representatives has opted to legislate specific requirements leaving little room for agency discretion the senate on the othe r hand has chosen to mandate regulation but has provided federal agen cies broader discretionary authority to address the various concerns identified in the statutory language improved security for birth certificates house provisions hr 10 30613067 similar to the drivers license provisions the house bill establishes minimum document issuance and verification standards for federal recognition in add ition the house bill will also require states to establish minimum building security standards for both state and local vital records offices implement other security and pr ivacy protection measures and create common database and exchange protocol fo r electronic birth nd death registration systems the house bill also authorizes that grant funding be made available to the states senate provisions s 2845 section 1026 the senate has chosen to direct the secretary of health and human services to issue regulations establishing minimum standards for birth certificates to be accepted by federal agencies for official purposes the regulations are to include features designed to prevent tampering counterfeiting or other unauthorized duplications for fraudulent purposes in addition the regulations are required to establish requirements for both proof and verification of identity and may not require that single national design be utilized comments similar to the drivers license provisions the house has opted to legislate specific require ments leaving little room for agency discretion while the senate has manda ted regulation but has provided fe deral agencies with broader discretionary authority measures to enhance privacy and integrity of social security account numbers house provisions hr 10 30713076 the house bill essentially addresses this issue in three ways first the bill specifically prohibits the states or their political subdivisions from displaying electronically or otherwise social security number or any derivative of such number on any drivers license or motor vehicle registration or on any other document issued by states to an individual for identification second the bill requires the commissioner of social security to promulgate number of regulations with respect to the system for issuing social security numbers finally the bill contains number of provisions requiring the submission to congress of reports and recommendations senate provisions s 2845 s ection 1028 like the house bill the senate bill requires the commissioner of social security to issue regulations restricting the issuance of multiple replacement cards to minimize fraud and requiring independent verifi cation of all records provided by applicants for social security numbers other than enumeration at birth however unlike the house bill the senate requires the co mmissioner to add death fraud and work authorizationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs44 indicators to the social security number verification system and provides for the establishment of an interagency task force to further improve the security of social security cards and numbers in addition th senate bill does

are key component of the 911 co mmissions recommendations in 1996 congress require d the development of an automated entry and exit data system to track the rrival and departure of aliens but such system has yet to be fully implemented following the 911 terrorist attacks congress enacted additional measures including the usa patriot act pl 10756 and the enhanced border secur ity and visa reform act of 2002 pl 107173 to encourage the more expeditious development of an automated entry and exit data system and to further require that biometric identifiers be used in passports visas and other travel documents to imp rove their security the 911 commission report called for expeditious implementation of the usvisit program and recommended consolidating bor der screening systems including frequent traveler programs with the usvisit system at the same time 1996 congress enacted provisions for an automated entry and exit data system it also required the implementation of preinspection progra m at selected locations overseas under which immigration officers inspect aliens before their final departure to the united states and authorized assistance to air carriers at selected foreign

of failure the commission recommended th at congress set specific dates for the completion of these plans the 9 11 commissions recommendation for improving transportation security is essentially consiste nt with sections 70102 and 70103 of the maritime transportation s ecurity act of 2002 mtsa pl 105295 which was passed by congress on november 25 2002 ho wever these two sections of mtsa did

also with regard to imposing deadlines for the dhs on certain maritime security activities that were called for in mtsa the deadline imposed in hr 10 is for completing those activities while the

coordination on aviation secu rity matters was not addressed in the 911 commission recommendations the house bill contains three provisions addressing international efforts to mitigate terrorist attacks against aviation assets these provisions include measures that would urge the president to enter into international agreements permitting armed pilots on foreign flights and pursue international agreements to limit the proliferation of shoul derfired missiles that pose threat to civil aircraft the house bill also contains provision that would establish program for training foreign air marshals at us dhs facilities the senate bill contains provision not included in the house bill that would require dhs to report on procedures to mitigates risks in foreign air cargo bound for the united states house provisions the house bill contains three specific sections regarding international efforts to improve aviation security first provision of the house bill s ec 4101 encourages the president to aggressively pursue international agreements allowing armed pilots on flights to international destinations foreign laws and regulations may prevent armed pilots from carrying their weapons on flights to cer tain international stinations and this provision encourages the administration to enter international agreements that would expand the number for foreign destinations where federal flight deck officers are permitted to fly second provision of the house bill sec 4102 would allow the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement after consultation with the department of state to provide air marshal training to law enforcement personnel of foreign countries under this provision foreign fficers sent to the united states for air marshal training must be vetted against the consolidated and integrated terrorist watch lists and may be charge d reasonable fees to offset the costs of their training an emergency amendment to aviation secu rity regulations issued in december 2003 requires that foreign air carriers place armed trained government law enforcement officers on designated flights to and from the united states when directed to do so by dhs in light of this requirement th qualifications and tr aining of foreign officers assigned to such duties has raised concerns among some that poorly trained armed officer may in fact pose security risk rather than acting as deterrent against terrorist attacks finally section 4103 of the house bill c ontains language intended to mitigate the threat of terrorist attacks usin g shoulderfired missiles referred to as manportable air defense systems manpads against aviation assets corehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs62 element of this language would require the president and the administration to urgently pursue and enter into interna tional agreements to limit the availability transfer and proliferation of manpads through export c ontrols and destruction of excess obsolete and illicit st ockpiles of these weapons these provisions are in line with administration participation in ongoing international efforts to control manpads manpads controls were incorporated into the wassenaar arrangement on export controls for conven tional weapons and dua luse technologies in 2003 the united states is signatory to this arrangement also the united states has led g8 initiative to acceler ate destruction of excess and obsolete manpads strengthen controls on th transfer of manpads productions technology and develop methodology fo r assessing airport vulnerability and effective countermeasures to mitigat the threat posed by manpads the provisions in section 4103 of the house bill also require the federal aviation administration faa to establish process for expeditiously certifying the airworthiness and safety of countermanpads systems for installation on passenger aircraft that are currently being devel oped and evaluated under dhs program provision in this section also requires the dhs to report on its plans to secure airports and protect arriving and parting aircraft from manpads attacks the report is to include the status of airport vulnerability assessments intelligence data sharing efforts on manpads threats plans for responding to intelligence suggesting high threat level of manpads attack within the united states and the feasibility and effectiveness of implemen ting public education and neighborhood watch programs senate provisions the provisions of the senate bill section 616 regarding protection of aircraft fro m manpads does not specifica lly address international agreements and in this regard the senate provision on this issue differs significantly from the house bill however similar to the house bill the senate bill requires the dhs to submit report on the manpads threat detailing terrorist access to manpads efforts to protect commerc ial aircraft from manpads and an assessment of the feasability of equipp ing commercial airlin ers with counter manpads systems the senate bill contains provisions regarding international agreements permitting armed pilots or the training of foreign armed air marshals at us facilities however the senate bill does include provision not considered in the house bill that would require the dhs in consulta tion with the faa and the department of defense to report on current procedures to address explosive incendiary chemical biological or nuclear threats on allcargo aircraft inbound to the united states the report which is due within 180 days after enactment is to include an analysis of the potential for establishing secure facilities along established international air routes for diverting and securing suspect allcargo aircraft section 1108 comments both the house and the nate bill contai n limited language dealing with international cooperation and coor dination to protect aviation against terrorist threats the house bill focuses on international

congress should support pending legislati on releasing spectrum for public safety this refers to hr 1425 harman bill to provide for the expedited and increased assignment of spectrum for public safety purposes the intent of the bill is to free up spectrum designated for public safety use that is currently occupied by television broadcast stations public safety benefits from the timely availability of the promised channels would include enhanced interoperability in radio communications these channels are being held until such time as the transition to digital television dtv has reached levels of market penetration prescribed by congress in the balanced budget act of 1997 when the specified level of market pe netration has been reached broadcasters are to cease analog br oadcasting and the channels used for this purpose are to be released there is however deadline for the release and many have opined that the transition process c ould take many years to complete the current policy debate in c ongress regarding the convers ion to digital television focuses on whether to attempt an expedited transition to dtv with the release by date certain of all encumbered channels or to require the timely availability of channels designated for public safety only addressing the larger issue of complete dtv conversion with parate legislation house provisions hr 10 was amended sec 5011 to provide sense of congress that all analog broadcast cha nnels should be vacated by december 31 2006 for public safety and comme rcial uses the amendment states that this can be achieved by eliminating the exemption that requires full 85 market penetration of dtv andor signal converters one of the provisions originally established by congress as criterion for allowing delay most experts believe that it is this provision that is allowing the indefinite delay of the release of the spectrum many advocate the release of all th affected channels at once and support this approach for many reasons including notably fairness so that all tv broadcasters would be treated equally and none would be placed at disadvantage by having to pay the costs of transition in advance of competitors availability of spectrum for new commercial applications including broadband wireless availability of additional spectrum for public safety use beyond what has already b een allocated and subs tantial revenue for the us treasury from spectrum auctions critics of mandated hard deadline are concerned with the choice of date many preferring da of 2009 or later in order to allow more time for market forces to guide the transition and with the protection of consumers who rely on overtheair broadcas ts to cite two frequently mentioned considerations some advocates of swift and complete transition to dtv have argued that consumer needs c ould be met through program that would subsidize the purchase of settop boxes that would convert digital signal to analog httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs67 senate provisions the issue of freeing spectrum was incorporated in s 2845 with an amendment that in its origin language replicated s 2820 mccain this amendment became sections 1061 to 1073 of the senate bill title f regarding the release of spectrum senator mccain would have required the full release of encumbered spectrum by date certain as finally amended and agreed however only those channels required for public safety would be fr eed although the fcc would have the authority to clear other channels as needed to prevent interference this language appears in section 1063 other sections cover matte rs related to the conversion to dtv 10671070 several sections c over interoperability see interoperable communications and warning systems below section 1064 would require study and report to congress on the advisability of providing additional channels to public safety comments section 5011 of the house b ill and section 1063 of the senate bill offer two major viewpoints on how to pproach the release of spectrum for public safety the findings in section 5011 closel parallel the argument s made by senator mccain on the senate floor in favor of clearing all cha nnels as provided in s 2820 the senate voted however to adopt language that dea lt primarily with providing spectrum for public safety similar to hr 1425 the bill on which the 911 commission based its recommendation furthe rmore the senate version provides for necessary changes by amending the communications act the house bill supports what it identifies as preferred course of action but does not legislate any changes in existing statutes the purpose of s ection 1064 dealing with study regarding providing additional spectrum for public safety is not addressed in the house bill within the public safety community there is substantial concern that additional spectrum contiguous to existing assigned channels must be provided in order to support full interoperability and emerging

expediting and otherwise improving the security clearance process that is determining federalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs74 employees or applicants eligibility fo r access to classified national security information the 911 commission recognized this in presenting two of its 41 recommendations which suggest modernizin g the clearance process among other matters the commission proposed i nformation procedures should provide incentives for sharing to restore be tter balance between security and shared knowledge and the president should lead the governmentwide effort to bring the national security institutions into the in formation revolution he should coordinate the resolution of the legal policy and technical issues across agencies to create trusted inform ation network house provisions sections 50715078 of hr 10 are designed to modernize the security clearance process the provisions would standardize the process across federal agencies set uniform requirements for the clearance levels and expedite background investigations new clarified or enhanced powers to accomplish these goals include authority that would allow the establishment of governmentwide criteria and standards fo r financial disclosure administration of polygraphs and security clearance questi onnaires as well as national database regarding security clearances the house bill details other proposed change s it specifies offices which would be responsible for certain types or leve ls of clearances provides specifically for reciprocity among agencies in accepting background investigations conducted for other agencies and sets timelimit for c onducting clearance total of 60 days consisting of 40 days for the investigation and 20 for the adjudication hr 10 also calls for increased or improved use of existing tools and technology in conducting investigations provides for interim clearances in certain situations ongoing monitoring of clearance holders using new regularly recurring verification process this process could be used as basis for terminating security clearance and in periodic reinvestigations to addre ss emerging threats in addition the new regularly recurring verification could replace periodic reinvestigations if the national intelligence director nid certifies it section 5077 would change the nationa l security clearance process during presidential transitions it would require the presidentelect to submit to the nid the names of candidates for high level national security pos itions at or above the under secretary level as soon as possible af ter general election the nid would be responsible for the expeditious completi on of background investigations for such individuals before the inauguration similar process would be required for prospective transition team members needing clearance with completion required to the fullest extent practicable by the day after the general election senate provisions s 2845 sec 116 responds to the need to improve the clearance process by calling upon the presid ent in consultation with the national intelligence director to establish unifo rm standards for access to classified information ensure the consistent imple mentation of such requirements throughout the government ensure that an individual who is granted or continued eligibility for access by one agency is treated as eligible for access at the same level elsewhere in the government establish uniform standa rds for polygraph examinations financial disclosure and security clearance questi onnaires and ensure that the proposed national database meets the needs of the intelligence community the bill alsohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs75 provides for the president to select one federal agency which would be responsible for conducting all security clearances inves tigations throughout the government for employees and contractors and maintain all security clearances of such employees or contract personnel s 2845 would also amend the presid ential transition act of 1963 including provisions to recommend submission by the presidentelect to the agency with national security clearance functions of nam of candidates for high level national security positions through the level of unde rsecretary as soon as possible after the presidential election and to require the appropriate agency to carry out background investigations of these candidates for highlevel national security positions as expeditiously as possible before the date of the inauguration it would similarly facilitate this process for those prospective transition team members needing clearance with completion required to the fullest extent practicable by the day after the general election comments the house and senate bills offer similar solutions to similar problems improvements in expediting the security clearance process setting uniform standards and requiring reciproc ity are common elements both moreover call for setting governmentwide criteria and standards for financial disclosure administration of polygraphs and secur ity clearance questionnaires as well as requirements for national da tabase regarding security clearances the two versions differ however in their specificity with hr 10 being more extensive and detailed than s 2845 and their specifics the house bill for instance adds provisions designating an official in charge of pr ogram oversight and administration clearing applicants for presidential transition t eam and for highranking positions in new administration and instituting new regular ly recurring verification requirement it would also centralize background i nvestigations in single agency emergency financial preparedness prepared by william jackson specialist in financial instituti

bea specialist in american national government crs government and finance division 78672 overview for decades state and local governments have relied upon mutual aid agreements to obtain assistance from other units of government to prepare for and respond to catastrophes that overwhelm thei r resources the importance of such initiatives was emphasized in 1996 when congress enacted pl 104321 this statute signified congressi onal approval of the emerge ncy management assistancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs77 compact emac which the southern governors association initiated after hurricane andrew devastated south flor ida in 1992 mutual aid agreements including emac set forth the procedur and conditions under which emergency assistance is provided to requesting states while the mutual aid agreements have improved emergency management capabilities the 911 commission and others have expressed concern that existing mutual aid agreements do not adequately address certain emergency preparedness and response needs the 911 commission specifically found that c ongressional action was require d to resolve liability and indemnification impediments in the national capital region ncr house provisions hr 10 section 5102 would authorize local state or federal officials to negotiate mutual aid agreements for emergency assistance and to facilitate participation in training exercises consistent with state laws officials responding to an event or training in an exercise in host state would remain liable under their own state laws and would be c overed by the death benefit and workers compensation provisions of their home state litigation must be brought in the state courts of the responders or in us distri ct courts within the responders state suits against federal officials may only be considered in us district court section 5103 provides that authorized representativ may enter into litigation management agreements that would provide for fede ral cause of action for claims against emergency response providers this fede ral cause of action would apply the substantive law either of the state in whic h the acts of terrorism occurred or of the state determined by the choice of law principles agreed to in the litigation management agreement however state w would not apply if it were inconsistent with or preempted by federal law s ection 5103 of the bill also prohibits punitive damages and does not protect persons or entities that commit or support terrorism acts section 5106 requires that the secretary invent ory catalog and evaluate existing compacts senate provisions as amended on the floor of the senate s 2845 section 1042 would authorize state and local govern ment officials in the national capital region ncr and federal officials to enter into mutual aid agreements for emergency response preparing for or recove ring from an emergency or training for such activities the district of columbia would be authorized to purchase liability and indemnification insurance or self insure against cla ims responding parties are subject to liability laws of their own state and legal actions may be brought only under the laws of the responders state or federal law as appropriate the bill provides for good faith exception and requi res that workers compensation as well as death benefits be provided according to the laws of the responders states comments considerable differences exist between the mutual aid provisions in the two bills while hr 10 provides authority for mutual aid agreements across the nation and establishes national standard for claims against responders s 2845 focuses solely on the national capitol region both bills pr ovide that the laws of the responders home state are to be followe d in resolving litigation while hr 10 does not specifically address mutual aid agreements for the ncr section 5010 does indirectly address the issu it requires that dhs study the definition of national

policy crs resources science nd industry division 75853 interoperable communications interoperability also referred to as compatibility or connectivity refers to the capability for different systems to readily contact each other facilita ting interoperability has been policy concern of public safety officials for number of ears since september 11 2001 when communications failures added to the horror of the day achieving interoperability for public safety communications has beco an important na tional policy concern for congress support of communications interoperability or connectivity is also recommended by the 911 commission throug h the selective establishment and funding of signal corps units in highrisk urban areas because there are many policy considerations related to interoperable communications the issue is addressed in several places throughout both the house and senate bills the discussion here addresses those sections that deal primarily with gove rnance and the development of infrastructure for communications interoperability house bill section 5006 of hr 10 provide s sense of congress regarding the desirability of continuing programs that support inte roperable systems and radios and that standards for these should meet prevailing voluntary consensus standards section 5131 specifies ways in which inte roperability might be achieved it also would provide statutory definition of in teroperability secti on 5131 would establish new unnamed program to enhance public safety inte roperable communications at all levels of government this program would have some of the functions currently planned for office of interoperability and compatibility created october 1 2004 by the department of homeland security dhs these include coordination with other federal agencies and provision of training and technical assistance to state and local public safety agencies other program re sponsibilities reflect the bills definition of interoperability to include the establishment of comprehensive national approach to achieving public safety interoperable communications and encouragement for the development and use of open architectures the program would also accelerate the development of national voluntary consensus standards the bill further would create the statutory authority for the office of interoperability and compatibility specifying the functions of such an office functions would be limited to the management of the safecom program and of an expedite d effort to assure interoperable communications in highrisk urban areas safecom is an umbrella program for interoperability that is part of the science and technolog directorate of dhs other provisions of section 5131 would provi consulting for interoperable communications in highrisk jurisdictions and would allow for multiyear commitments for interoperability grants to receive funding states would be required to submit detailed plans to dhs senate bill sections 1065 and 1066 of s 2845 would provide statutory authority for safecom and authorize funding for program development in addition to providing for coordination of all federal programs dealing with interoperability key provision of th bill would require safecom to provide research and development for communications system architecture that would enhance the potential for c oordinated response to nati onal emergency eligibility for funding would include requirement that applicants provide assurance that anyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs79 equipment or system purchased with gran t funds would be compatible with the communications architecture that safecom is required to develop as well as any program standards in section 1043 the nate bill would require the secretary of the department of homeland security among others to encourage the establishment of effective emergency communications capabilities in highrisk urban areas comments although there are numerous differences in the key provisions regarding interoperability section 1065 of the senate bill and section 5131 of the house bill significant difference is in the placement of authority the senate bill would strengthen safecom in its role as lead program for interoperability within the federal government the house bill would circumscribe safecom limiting its functions new program would be aut horized with responsibilities that are more encompassing than those of the senate bill the 911 commission report speaks of the creation of signal corps to assure connectivity in some areas section 5131 would provide for the development of communications capability that has some characteristics of signal corps warning systems the 911 commission report di scusses the effectiveness of emergency alerts at the world trade center on september 11 2001 and recommends in its analysis that there be better coordinati on of communications between first responders and emergency 911 call centers in order to reach the civilian population this type of coordination s typically been addressed by the public safety community primarily within the context of the development of an effective allhazards warning system that is able to reach all levels of the civilian population and authorities c oncerned with any aspect of public safety house bill requirements for study about the use of telecommunications networks as part of an all hazards warning system are included in hr 10 in section 5009 the goals of the study would be to c onsider the practicality of establishing telecommunicationsbased warning system that would also provide information on safety measures that might be taken in response to the warning the legislative proposal specifies that technologies to consider would be telephone wireless communications and other existing communi cations networks section 5135 would establish pilot study to test innovative warning systems specifically one that is based on an amber alert communications network amber alerts are used to broadcast information about missing or bducted children using variety of media including the internet and the existing emergency alert system recent technological innovation provides web porta l that uses dedicated server and software to format messages fo r variety of media it also is able to target specific groups of recipients the ability to iden tify certain groups is often referred to as creating virtual community senate bill there are provisions regarding warning systems for civilians in the senate bill comments in homeland security context the ability to establish and contact virtual community can save lives if some of the new warning systems technologies in conjunction with emergenc response procedures had been available in the new york city area on the morning of september 11 large number of people in the world trade center could have know n within minutes what was going on andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32635crs80 might have received

to protect such infrastructure and 3 the readiness of the government to respond to threats against the united states the first part of this section corres ponds directly with the 911 commissions language used to introduce its fina l recommendation the commissions final recommendation stated that t he department of homeland security should regularly assess the types of threats the country faces to determine the adequacy of the governments plans and progress agains t those plans to protect americas critical infrastructure and b the readin ess of the government to respond to the threats the second part of the sena tes language roughly corresponds to the commissions language however the em phasis in the commissions language is to regularly assess the type of threats and to use this regular reassessment to determine the adequacy and progress of governments plans to protect critical infrastructure the senate language calls for something little different report on the progress of vulnerability and risk assessments and the adequacy of government plans to protect critical infrastructure vulnerability and risk assessments can be considered as input to the governments effort to plan for critical infrastructure protection but not the plan itself the nate language does not mention regular assessment of the types of th reat finally the senate nguage goes beyond the 911 commissions recommendation and require s report with deadlines house provisions the house bill does not ve similar provision its language regarding transportation secur ity plan title ii subtitle g
