housing tenants for illegal drug use legal analysis of department of housing and urban development v rucker charles v dale legislative attorney american law division summary in department of housing and urban development v rucker the supreme court unanimously approved provisions of the 1988 drug abuse act enacted by congress in response to rampant drugrelated or violent crime in public housing projects specifically the law allows for nofault evictions of public housing tenants by mandating the use of lease provisions which state that any drugrelated criminal activity on or off such premises engaged in by public housing tenant any member of the tenants household or any guest or other person under the tenants control shall be cause for termination of tenancy while public housing authorities have discretion under hud regulations to evict or not based on the totality of circumstances in any individual case agency rules also make clear that evictions are permitted even when the tenant did not know could not foresee or could not control behavior by other occupants of the unit the supreme court relied on the plain language of the provision to uphold the statute and perceived unreasonableness in this interpretation nor any constitutional problems raised as consequence there is an obvious reason why congress would have permitted local public housing authorities to conduct nofault evictions wrote the chief justice of the hud regulations since regardless of knowledge tenant who cannot control drug crime or other criminal activities by household member which threaten health or safety of other residents is threat to other residents and the project to combat the destructive impact of illegal drugs on public housing communities congress enacted the antidrug abuse act of 1988 among other things the law as amended requires local housing authorities to include lease provisions making violent or drugrelated criminal activity grounds for termination of housing benefits the relevant statutory language codified at 42 usc 1437dl6 states that public housing agency shall utilize leases which provide that drugrelated criminal activity on or off such premises engaged in by public housing tenant any member of the tenants household or any guest or other person under the tenants control shall be cause for termination ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21199crs2 1 the statute was also relied upon by president clinton when in his 1996 state of the union address he announced one strike and youre out policy to govern evictions from public housing for alleged criminal activities several months later president clinton elaborated if you break the law you longer have home in public housing one strike and youre out that should be the law everywhere in america the president directed the hud secretary to issue guidelines to public housing and law enforcement officials to spell out with unmistakable clarity how to enforce the policy remarks announcing the one strike and youre out initiative in public housing in 32 weekly comp pres doc 582 584 april 1 1996 hud initially published the guidelines for the onestrike initiative in april of 1996 pih 9616 though the initiative was presented as new policy it relied on existing legislation and regulations as president clinton noted believe it or not the federal law has actually authorized one strike eviction since

elaborating the statute make clear that the public housing agencies have discretion whether to evict and direct them to consider all the circumstances of the case further the regulations specify that the housing authorities may evict even when the tenant did not know could not foresee or could not control behavior by other occupants of the unit the controversy in department of housing and urban development v rucker2 arose when oakland housing authority sought to evict four tenants they included two whose resident grandchildren were caught smoking marijuana in housing project parking lot one whose daughte r was found with cocaine three blocks from the apartment and disabled 75yearold man whose caretaker was found with cocaine in his apartment there was claim by the housing authority that the elder tenants had in any way facilitated condoned or even had reason to know about the drug activity because the statute itself was silent on the culpability question the rucker plaintiffs argued that hud was unjustified when it adopted its formal policy in assuming that congress intended evictions for completely innocent tenants those who did not know could not foresee or could not control the drug activity for which they were to be evicted federal district court agreed enjoining the housing authority from evicting tenants for offpremises drug activity of which they had knowledge or control conclusion which was affirmed by the banc ninth circuit appeals court prior to this terms ruling in rucker the federal courts were divided on the issue two distinct approaches had emerged since the statute was enacted in 1988 presaging the supreme courts own conclusions several decisions had affirmed that the statute and related hud regulations permit nofault evictions and impose strict liability on public housing tenants thus drug use or criminal activity by household member guest or other person under the tenants control is cause per for termination of tenants lease 3 in cases where evictions were allowed the courts typically characterized the lease provisions as unambiguous contract language that must be given its plain meaning and held that neither the lease provisions nor 1437 dl6 has knowledge requirements4 contrary approach was taken by other courts like the ninth circuit in rucker holding that evictions for third party criminal activity under 1437dl6 are generally appropriatehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs21199crs3 5 see eg allegeny county housing authorit v hibbler 748 a2d 786 pa 2000housing authority must consider all mitigating factors before

1996 6 rucker v davis 237 f3d113 1116 9th cir 2001only when fault knowledge or foreseeability by the tenant is established5 nofault approach was deemed inappropriate since the statute does not clearly address the level of personal knowledge or fault that is required for eviction or even make it clear who can be evicted nor was it clear in the ninth circuits view what the statute meant by drug activity by individuals under the tenants control or in the case of multiple tenants whether it authorizes eviction of the offending party only or all persons on the lease6 unanimously the supreme court reversed the ninth circuit in rucker and sided with the judicial view that approves of nofault evictions first the justices denied that the statute was silent on culpability standard rather by not specifying personal knowledge or fault for eviction it simply required none the statute thus permits eviction regardless of the tenants knowledge or intention with respect to illegal drug use by third parties second the court interpreted the statutory phrase under the tenants control to apply only to the immediately preceding another person rather than household members or guests and only required that the tenant have admitted the other person to the apartment thus person under the tenants control simply meant person who like guest had been permitted onto the premises by the tenant the third party did not have to be subject to physical control such that the tenant could have actually prevented the other persons illegal drug use third noting that nofault evictions are common feature of landlordtenant law the court found an obvious reason for adopting that approach here that is by holding tenants strictly accountable the hud policy provides tenants strong incentive to actively prevent their relatives and guests from engaging in illegal drug activity this in turn promoted the congressional objective to provide public and other federally assisted lowincome housing that is decent safe and free from illegal drugs final important aspect of rucker was the manner by which the court rejected possible due process objections to the eviction of blameless tenants raised by the ninth circuit any claim that the hud policy operated to deny due process in particular case the justices noted could be addressed by the state court eviction proceeding not content to let the issue rest there however the opinion then proceeds to undermine the merits of the due process argument for constitutional purposes the court distinguished situations where the government as sovereign acts to criminally punish or civilly regulate the general populace from rucker where it is instead acting as landlord of property it owns invoking clause to which respondents have agreed pursuant to congressional directive and while any property interest that evicted tenants have in their leasehold may not be constitutionally terminated without proper notice and right to hearing the opinion suggests that where such deprivations of procedural rights occur they are properly matter for casebycase determination in state court and do not vitiate the substance of the underlying nofault eviction policy consequently after rucker any relief from enforcement of nofault or onestrike eviction procedures for public housing tenants may require administrativ changes in hud regulations or congressional action judicial intervention being unlikely in most cases
