march 11 2008 abstract the impact of taxes on international trade and investment has been debated for decades most recently variety of bills addressing international taxation have been introduced in the 110th congress some would cut taxes for us ﬁrms overseas while others would increase taxes on foreign investment the debate over taxes and foreign outsourcing has tended to grow more heated during times of domestic economic weakness and high unemployment questions arise over whether taxes contribute to such weakness by discouraging exports or encouraging imports or by encouraging us ﬁrms to move abroad the debate over international taxation has again become prominent as part of the wider debate over outsourcing with taxes the debate asks how the current system aﬀects outsourcing and whether policies designed to limit the phenomenon might be desirable this report applies economic analysis to both questionshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32587g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of congress g561

investment has been debated for decades most recently variety of bills addressing international taxation have been introduced in the 110th congresssome would cut taxes for us firms overseas while others would increase taxes on foreign investment the debate over taxes and foreign outsourcing has tended to grow more heated during times of domestic economic weakness and high unemployment questions arise over whether taxes contribute to such weakness by discouraging exports or encouraging imports or by encouraging us firms to move abroad the debate over international taxation has again become prominent as part of the wider debate over outsourcing with taxes the debate asks how the current system affects outsourcing and whether policies designed to limit the phenomenon might be desirable the precise meaning of the term outsourcing varies depending on the context in one usage outsourcing simply refers to the use by domestic firms of inputs produced by other firms other usages however refer exclusively to the international sector and the analysis in this report focuses on two types of such offshore outsourcing the use by domestic firms of imported foreign inputs including both the use of foreign technical services and the use of foreignmade goods and the shifting by us firms of domestic operations abroad the analysis of the first of these types of outsourcing focuses primarily on how taxes affect trade while investment is held constant the assessment of the second type looks at how taxes affect investment taxes probably have little impact on the balance of trade what might be termed net outsourcing apart from indirect effects that may re sult from their impact on investment flows in the language of the outsourcing debate taxes likely do not change the extent to which the economy as whole engages in the use of foreign rather than domestic inputs compared to the extent the economy exports in contrast taxes can affect the flow of direct investment abroad that is the establishment of overseas production facilities by us firms thus if outsourcing is taken to mean the use by us firms of foreign rather than domestic labor taxes can have an impact the current us system however produce s variety of incentives disincentives and neutrality towards overseas investment and the net impact of the system on the flow of investment is not clear similarly the likely impact of recently enacted legislation is not clear economic theory provides frameworks for evaluating the efficiency effect of taxes on international trade and investment and their subsequent impact on economic welfare according to theory taxes best promote economic efficiencyand thus best promote economic welfare when they do not distort the level or composition of trade or alter the allocation of investment between foreign and domestic uses in short taxes best promote economic efficiency and aggregate economic welfare when they do not distort the level of outsourcing in the sense it is used in this report with respect to employment outsourcing may cause sectorspecific and near term job losses but likely does not have substantial longrun impact on overall employment this report will be updated only when major legislative developments occur httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32587g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141

general the debate concerns the impact various federal policies are thought to have on outsourcing including the policy that is the focus of this report taxes but outsourcing is not formallydefined term of economic theory and has specific meaning in economics and its usage in the popular debate varies thus the first step in applying economic analysis to the outsourcing debate is to clarify the terms meaningto define it using terms that do have precise meaning in economic theory 2 in one common usage outsourcing simply means the use by firm of inputs produced outside the firm either by foreigners or unrelated domestic firmsthe important fact is simply that someone else performs the function here firms manager might speak of outsourcing task meaning that another firm does that particular job similarly outsourcing sometimes refers to the use by government agencies of services provided by the private sectorfor example legislation has recently been introduced in congress that would outsource certain debtcollection functions of the internal revenue service the focus of this report however is the international economy its analysis is confined to what might be termed offshore outsourcing but here too the terms usage varies for example one focus of the recent public debate has been the use by us firms of skilled foreign t echnological workers who reside and work abroad but who provide services to customers in the united states prominent example of this usage is in the 2004 economic report of the president which cited the increased use of offshore outsourcing in which company relocates laborintensive service industry functions to another country 3 the report along with subsequent statement by the presidents chief economic advisor that such outsourcing is just new way of doing international trade sparked heated debate in congress and elsewhere 4 in economic terms this particular usage of outsourcing refers to international trade specifically the importation of services second use of outsourcing has also referred to international trade but to flows of goods rather than services this use may have been more frequent in past years than in the current debate for example 1983 fortune magazine article that was among the first sources to use the term described an increasing tendency for us automakers to buy more and more parts abroad and further stated that to large extent the products to be outsourced are lowtechnology items such as window cranks seat fabrics and plastic knobs5 another use of the term in the current debate refers to foreign investment rather than trade here the term refers to us firm that shifts its domestic production of an item to foreign location or 1 this report was originally written by david l brumbaugh specialist in public

in the united states one example of this type of outsourcing that has recently been prominently featured by the media is the closing of chicago plant by radio flyer incmaker of popular childrens wagonand the moving of production to china6 in usage that directly applies to taxes presidential candidate john kerry called for the closing of loopholes in international tax law that encourage outsourcing the question of whether the us tax system does in fact encourage this type of outsourcing is one focus of this report and is addressed below in economic terms the three popular usages of outsourcing that are mentioned here can be described respectively as the import of services from abroad the import of goods from abroad and the use of domestic capital in foreign locations given this economic view of outsourcing the analysis in the following sections of the report looks at the impact of taxes on two key economic variables trade and investment the basic analysis of taxes and trade is the same whether the trade is in services or goods thus it is important to look at the first two examples of outsourcing together combining our assessment of the direct us of foreign labor with that of the importation of goods the analysis continues by assessing the impact of taxes on foreign investment the third type of outsourcing the results of the following analysis are summari zed briefly in advance first according to economic theory tax policy does not alter the countrys balance of trade as long as it does not also produce change in foreign investment flows in terms of the outsourcing debate taxes do not affect the net amount of the first type of outsourcing identified above the use of foreign labor services or inputs made by foreign firms taxes can however alter both the composition and level of trade and reduce economic efficiency and economic welfare if they distort either how much country trades or what it trades second tax policy can affect the extent to which firms invest abroad in terms of outsourcing it can affect the extent to which firms use overseas production facilities to produce inputs for their domestic operations current us tax law poses mix of incentives and disincentives towards overseas investment its net result is uncertain however in manner similar to trade economic theory suggests that taxes best promote world economic efficiency when they are neutral towards investment location in divergence from trade theory investment theory suggests taxes can promote national economic welfare though not world welfare if they pose sma ll impediment to overseas investment an underlying concern of the outsourcing debate is employment the debate is sometimes conducted in terms of the export of jobs yet the economic analysis just summarized does not mention employment effects of outsourcing in part this is because the focus of this report is on how taxes affect outsourcing not how outsourcing in turn affects variables such as employment 7 the last section of the report does howev er briefly turn to employment questions and summarizes how economic theory applies to outsourcing and employment economic theory indicates that outsourcing does not play an important role in determining the aggregate level of employment in the economy although it can affect the division of income in broad terms between labor on the one hand and owners of investment capital on the other 6 charles murdock your jobs leading us export chicago tribune aug 22 2004 p 1 7 these more general assessments of outsourcing are analyzed in crs report

services the 2004 economic report of the president used the example of us firm that might use callcenter in india to answer customer servicerelated questions for goods an example might be us firm that uses foreignmade components as part of an overall product made in the united states importantly in this usage of the term outsourcing we rule out items produced by the us firms own foreign facilities in economic terms we are thus assessing the impact of taxes on trade while at least initially holding investment flows constant in this setting economic theory indicates that taxes have little impact on the countrys balance of tradethe excess of imports over exports as applied to the outsourcing debate theory thus indicates that taxes have little impact on the extent to which the economy as whole engages in this type of outsourcing at least as compared to the countrys level of exports in the context of the outsourcing debate we might term countrys trade balance its net outsourcing this result is an important one and since it may counter the readers intuition it is worth examining more closely first economics points out that countrys trade deficit is the excess of what country uses over what it produces and just as an individual who spends more than he earns must necessarily borrow to finance the difference country that uses more than it produces and that runs trade deficit must borrow from other countries to finance the deficit in terms of the international economy the borrowing consists of imports or inflows of investment capital from abroad it follows from this fact of economic life that countrys trade balance mirrors its balance on capital account countries normally both import and export investment capital but if country runs trade deficit it must likewise import more capital than it exports with the difference making the trade deficit possible the trade deficit or surplus thus moves in parallel with the balance on the capital account and net imports can increase only if net capital inflows also increase identically net exports can only increase if net capital outflows increase in effect if an economy does not increase its own production it can increase its use of goods and services only if it borrows to do so the mechanism by which this identity is enforced in the current international economy is exchange rate adjustments if there is change in capital flows and some factor such as taxes changes so as to increase imports or exports exchange rates will eventually adjust so as to offset any impact the factor might otherwise have on the trade balance an example using outsourcing is useful here we use the case of hypothetical domestic industry well call it industry whose firms typically em ploy staffs of technical support personnel who are on call to answer customer questions suppose the home country implements tax policy that inadvertently encourages firms to shift from using domestic service employees to using foreign ones for example the home country might implement more stringent depreciation rules for certain type of equipment the homecountry technical services personnel use since foreign operations of foreign firms are generally beyond the us tax jurisdiction imported services would not be directly affected by such change for illustrations purposes we shall say that the new depreciation rules increase the cost of using domestic personnel to such an extent that industry finds it advantageous to begin importing the services it previously obtained domestically industry in other words increases its outsourcing which may initially be reflected in an increase in the home countrys trade deficit its net outsourcing httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32587g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141 g561g17g143g143g156g145g152g155g142g561g17g158g157g156g152g158g155g140g146g151g144g561 g561 g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156g146g152g151g138g149g561g20g142g156g142g138g155g140g145g561g21g142g155g159g146g140g142g561 g346g561but this is where exchange rate adjustments oc cur neutralizing any changes in the balance of trade in order to pay the foreign service providers the firms in the home countrys industry must increase their purchases of foreign currency the increase in demand for foreign currency in turn will normally drive up the price of the foreign currency which in turn makes all the home countrys imports more expensive while at the same time making the home countrys exports cheaper for foreign buyers in the aggregate the home countrys exports increase while its imports recede from their initial expansion and when the adjustment is complete the initial increase in the trade deficit is completely offset by increases in aggregate exports and reductions in aggregate imports induced by the exchange rate movements because the exchange rate adjustments apply to all the home countrys traded goods and services not just to industry as imports and because we assumed that only one homecountry industry was subject to increased taxes only part of industry as initial increase in outsourcing would likely be offset by exchange rate movements before the adjustments run their course part of industry as initial increase in outsourcing is in other words likely to remain but the crucial point is this if there is an increase in outsourcing in one sector it will be offset by reduced outsourcing reduced imports of other products and increased exports in other sectors while taxes do not alter the trade balance they can affect other aspects of trade including its composition its level and what economists call the terms of trade first composition even from the simple example here it is clear that tax that causes uneven changes in price across industries can alter what is tradedthe exact mix of goods and services that country imports and exports in our example we assumed that because of tax change particular industry in the home country increased its service imports but other homecountry imports fell and exports increased because of exchange rate adjustments in general terms the composition of trade depends on the particular pattern of relative costs within the domestic economy when tax burdens within the economy are uneven they distort relative costs and change what is traded taxes can likewise alter the overall level of trade even where the balance of trade does not change to illustrate in our example the increase in imports triggered by the tax change was partly offset by exchange rate adjustments but because part of the adjustment necessary to maintain the trade balance was absorbed by increased exports the overall level of imports remained higher than before again in general terms the changed tax policy did encourage higher reliance on imports by industry but to pay for the imports again assuming capital flows or added borrowing the home country also increased its exports the overall level of trade increased the terms of trade is an economic term denoting the price of homecountry exports compared to the price of its own imports it measures the amount of exports country must provide foreigners in order to obtain given amount of foreign products taxes can alter the terms of trade by reducing the price foreigners pay for exports or by increasing the price of imports prominent example in current tax policy is the impact of the us extraterritorial tax exclusion eti tax benefit for exports that is at the hear t of an ongoing controversy between the united states and the european union the eti benefit is designed to boost us exports by cutting taxes on export income in order to sell more exports however us producers necessarily pass on part of their own tax savings to foreign consumers in the form of reduced prices thus registering what economists term worsening of the terms of trade the terms of trade effect of our earlier outsourcing examples are ambiguous nd would depend on market conditions we have thus far looked at type of outsourcing where the us firm that imports its inputs does not itself produce the imported items in an overseas production facility our specific examples httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32587g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141 g561g17g143g143g156g145g152g155g142g561g17g158g157g156g152g158g155g140g146g151g144g561 g561

applies to trade in goods in terms of economic variables we have also assumed there is outflow of capital that accompanies the outsourcing we have focused exclusively on trade rather than investment but as described at the reports outset part of the outsourcing debate has concerned overseas production by us firms and so the next sectio n shifts the focus from trade to capital flows g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141g561g17g159g142g155g156g142g138g156g561g18g155g152g141g158g140g157g146g152g151g561g139g162g561g23g495g21g495g561g5g152g150g153g138g151g146g142g156g561 we have seen that economic theory indicates that if taxes do not alter capital flows they have impact on the balance of trade although they may affect the level and composition of trade absent changes in foreign investment in other words taxes do not affect what might be called net outsourcing theory also indicates however that taxes can affect investment they can alter the relative attractiveness of foreign and domestic locations for multinationals leading them to change their allocation of capital between the domestic and foreign economies thus if we define second type of outsourcing as the use of overseas rather than domestic production facilities taxes can have an impact an example of this second type of outsourcing might consist of us owned factory in foreign country that produces tangible goods shipped back to the united states taxes enter the investment equation as follows ac cording to economic theory firms allocate their investment resources between foreign and domestic locations by comparing the rate of return investment produces in either location in general they invest in each location up to the point where the rate of return on an additional increment of investment is the same at home and abroad since firms are concerned with their aftertax profits they equate the return of foreign and domestic investment after taxes rather than before them the basic impact of taxes results other factors remaining constant taxes will induce firms to shift more investment than they otherwise would from the domestic economy to foreign locations if the tax burden on foreign investment is lower than that on domestic investment taxes will shift investment from foreign locations to the domestic economy if taxes are relatively lower on domestic investment and taxes will have impact on will be neutral towards the location of investment if their burden is the same in each location we can make this general result more concrete by constructing another example here we shall say that domestic manufacturing industry industry b uses particular partsay door handleas component of its final product we will also say that the homecountry government again introduces more stringent depreciation rules in this case for the equipment used to manufacture the door handle thus effectively increasing the cost of the part for industry b we return below to some possible trade effects of the tax policy change but here focus on the investment impact since the new depreciation rule s do not apply to investment abroad the policy change will have the effect of increasing the tax burden on domestic investment compared to investment abroad rather than importing the door handle in this case we will say that industry b establishes its own foreign operations conducted by foreign subsidiary corporations unaffected by the tax change here then the outsourcing consists of production overseas by us firms using investment funds flowing from the domestic economy to foreign locations before looking at how specific features of the existing us tax system affect investment we return briefly to trade as noted in the first section taxes do not affect the trade balance unless they alter capital flows and our analysis there held capital flows constant in the present section however we have seen how taxes can in fact alter capital flows since the trade balance moves httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl32587g22g138g161g142g156g561g138g151g141 g561g17g143g143g156g145g152g155g142g561g17g158g157g156g152g158g155g140g146g151g144g561 g561

temporarily alter the balance of trade indirectly through their impact on capital flows the direction of the impact is perhaps counter to intuition an increase in capital outflows reduces the trade deficit since capital outflows are in effect exports in terms of the out sourcing debate in other words an increase of our second type of outsourcingthe type that c onsists of overseas investmentactually reduces the net amount of the first type of outsourcingthe type consisting of imports as before this result occurs because of exchange rate adjustments when us firms increase their overseas investments they supply additional dollars as they increase their purchases of foreign assets the price of the dollar accordingly declines us exports become less expensive for foreigners and us imports become more expensive imports shrink exports increase and the trade deficitnet outsourcing through tradediminishes while this is an attentiongetting result because of its irony outsourcing through inve stment reducing outsourcing through trade it should not be emphasized because it is temporary the increased flow of capital abroad lasts only until us firms achieve their new desired level of capital stock abroad 8 more persistent impact of tax policy on the trade balance may occur if tax policy affects the federal budget deficit and thus alters federal borrowing requirementsa development that would likely change net capital flows for example repeal of the eti export tax subsidy would in isolation increase federal tax receipts and thus reduce the budget deficit the resulting decline in federal borrowing requirements would again in isolation reduce capital inflows which would reduce the trade deficit the importance one attaches to this effect depends on whether one assumes that given change in tax policy is matched by another change that offsets its revenue effectfor example whether repeal of provision such as eti is matched by revenuelosing changes occurring elsewhere we do not offer conclusion on this subject here further it can be argued that federal budget deficits must ultimately be offset by surplus at some point in the future so this effect too may be temporary g22g145g142g561g11g150g153g138g140g157g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g5g158g155g155g142g151g157g561g21g162g156g157g142g150g561g138g151g141g561g20g142g140g142g151g157g561 g14g142g144g146g156g149g138g157g146g152g151g561 in the preceding section we saw how taxes can have an impact on the overall level and composition of trade though not the trade balance they can also alter the type of outsourcing that consists of overseas production by us firms we do not provide detailed assessment here of the impact of the current tax system on the level and composition of trade again the system does not have direct impact on the balance of trade we can note however that the existing system may well reduce the level of trade by virtue of its use of classical system for taxing corporate income under such as system income from corpor ate investment is taxed twice once at the corporate level and once when it is received by stockholders as capital gains or dividends in contrast the principal types of noncorporate investment owneroccupied housing and non corporate business are taxed only once if at all given that goods and services in the tradables sector consist more frequently of corporate rather than noncorporate products the double 8 we should also note that in the long run there may be slight permanent increase in the demand for domestic currency as firms increase their repatriations of foreign earnings this would drive up the exchange rate reducing exports increasing imports and increasing net outsourcing

nontradables thus reducing the level of trade other features of the federal tax system in isolation likely increase the level of trade from what would otherwise occur specifically the internal revenue code contains two separate export tax benefits the extraterritorial income exclusion eti and the socalled inventory source rule which permits firms in effect to exempt part of their export income from taxes by characterizing part of export income as having foreign source for purposes of the foreign tax credit rules as described below the eti provision is the focus of legislation being actively considered in the current congress while both provisions induce u s firms to increase their exports exchange rate adjustments in manner similar to the adjustments described above increase imports and do not completely offset the expansion of exports the provisions thus increase the overall level of trade we do not assess whether the two export benefits have an impact large enough to offset the possible tradereducing impact of the corporate income tax and the trade reducing impact that occurs where tariffs are imposed we look at the impact of the existing us syst em on investment flows in more detail again the key factor for taxes impact on investment is how the tax burden on foreign investment compares with that on domestic projects other crs products provide more detailed descriptions of the us international tax system and how it affects the relative tax burden on foreign and domestic investment 9 here however we note only its essential features in general the us system produces single overall impact on investment fl ows that is readily discernable different parts of the system viewed in isolation produce differ ent results the socalled deferral principle for example permits an indefinite postponement of us tax for overseas operations conducted through foreign subsidiary corporations rather than branches of us parent firms deferral poses tax incentive for investment in countries with low tax rates resulting in more us investment in those locations than would otherwise occur the us tax system also permits its investors to claim foreign tax credit for foreign taxes they pay feature that reduces doubletaxation of overseas income in some cases the foreign tax credit can result in even tax treatment of foreign and domestic investment producing tax neutrality the foreign tax credit however is limited to us tax on foreign and not domestic income feature that poses disincentive for investment in countries with high tax rates resulting in less us investment in those locations than would otherwise occur

for variety of reasons congressional interest in tax provisions related to the types of outsourcing outlined in this report was particularly high in 2004 and resulted in legislation much broader in scope than that included in tipra in 2004 both the house and senate passed major tax bills with variety of provisions that were relevant to offshore outsourcing in part the bills hr 4520 and s 1637addressed trade controversy between the united states and the european union by repealing the extraterritorial income eti tax benefit the united states provides to its exporters beyond this however the bills each contained variety of provisions with the potential to affect the relative tax treatment of domestic and overseas investment and that therefore might affect the volume of outsourcing through foreign investment in october both chambers approved conference committee version of the legislation that became pl 108 357 the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca as with the overall impact of the current tax system the likely combined impact of the acts various provisions is uncertain however the impact several of the measures most prominent features are likely to have in

9 tax deduction from income from domestic and not foreign production activities the deduction applies to corporations and noncorporate businesses alike to illustrate its effect for firm in the top corporate tax bracket of 35 the deduction has an effect similar to reduction in the tax rate to 3185 ie 35 x 100 9 because the deduction is restricted to domestic investment the deduction in isolation poses an incentive for firms to invest in the united stat rather than abroad in this respect the deductions impact on investment is similar to the extraterritorial income eti tax benefit for exporting that was repealed by the ajca in order to solve trade dispute with the european union export tax benefits necessarily favor domestic over foreign investment since export productionby definitionrequires domestic rather than foreign production the domestic production deduction in fact was partly intended to compensate for the economic impact of etis repeal in contrast to the repealed eti benefit however the incentive is not confined to investment in the export sector

rules relating to the foreign tax credit the general thrust of the provisions is to relax foreign tax credit rules principally in areas related to the credits limitation by far the most important of the changes is change in the rules for allocating interest expense between foreign and domestic sourcesan allocation firms must make in calculating their foreign tax credit limitation while the act reduces taxes only for firms with foreign tax credits and will thus be confined to firms with foreign investment the reduction nonetheless 10 note that the analysis does not consider the indirect

the provision will thus probably reduce the tax burden on domestic investment relative to foreign investment and will reduce net outsourcing through foreign investment the remaining foreign tax credit

us firms to defer us tax on foreign income the general thrust of the provisions is to expand the scope of deferral in most cases by restricting the applicability of subpart fs denial of deferral the impact of these provisions in isolation will likely be to reduce the relative tax burden on foreign investment thus likely increasing the flow of foreign investment abroad

tempor ary tax cut for earnings that repatriate from foreign subsidiaries as described above the deferral of us tax lasts only as long as foreign earnings are reinvested abroad us taxes ultimately apply when the earnings are repatriated to the united states as dividends the act provides temporary reduction in the us tax that applies upon repatriation the provision will have the effect of reducing the tax rate to 525 the normally applicable corporate rate is 35 the temporary period is one year while an intuitive analysis of the provision might conclude that it would persuade firms to repatriate additional funds and would thus increase domestic investment economic theory suggests there is reason to be skeptical of intuition in this case theory indicates that firms investment decisions are dependent on the likely return to prospective investment rather than cash flow and the provision will not alter the return on domestic investment even if it were to increase repatriations thus the proposal may not alter net outsourcing through investment further it might be argued that the provision will actually increase overseas investment if firms believe that the temporary measure will ultimately be made permanent g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g18g142g155g156g153g142g140g157g146g159g142g156g561 economic theory has developed frameworks for evaluating tax policy towards both international trade and international investment in terms of economic efficiency and economic welfare these frameworks can be applied to tax policy towards both types of outsourcing

they also alter capital flows thus for example economic theory holds that tax policies designed to curtail imports eg tariffs or encourage exports eg export subsidies do not change the trade balance although they can alter the level and composition of trade for example 11 for an explanation see crs report rl32429 foreign investment and tax incentives analysis of current law and legislative

because of exchange rate adjustments declines in imports are accompanied by reduced exports so that the trade balance is not altered similarly export subsidies cannot increase an economys trade surplus but do expand the overall level of trade thus economic theory in dicates that taxes are powerless to alter the net level of outsourcing that occurs through importing this is not necessarily bad result economic theory points out that imports are not inherently bad and exports are not inherently good and so policies that restrict imports or promote exports may miss the point international trade is indeed trade in the most literal sensethe exchange of some items for others to enhance mutu wellbeing exports are thus not key to the economys wellbeing but rather the goods that are given to foreigners in exchange for the imported foreign goods the economy uses classic economic theory says that such exchange occurs and makes an economy better off because it enables economies to specialize in the production of goods they produce most efficiently for example an economy might be able to produce wheat more efficiently than watches if its consumers nonetheless desire certain amount of watches it might behoove the country to shift resources out of watch production into wheat and trade wheat for watches made by foreign country that produces watches more efficiently than wheat12 the important point its that it is not the exports that make the economy better off but the ability to specialize by trading exports for imports from the point of view of the economys efficien cy and thus general economic welfare there is an optimal level of international specialization there is in other words level of trade imports plus exports at which an economy is specializing enough in what it does efficiently to improve its welfare but not specializing so much that it exports goods it produces inefficiently and imports items that it could produce domestically at little resource cost it is here that economic theory provides an insight about the results of taxes impact on trade to the extent that taxes distort trade by either changing the mix of what an economy trades or the level at which it trades taxes are believed to impair economic efficiency and reduce the overall economic welfare of the economys participants the application of this principle to tax policies designed to alter tradepolicies designed to shrink imports or expand exportsis straightfo rward as previously noted economists believe that neither tariffs nor export subsidies alter the balance of trade but rather can change the composition andor level of trade with tariffs shrinking trade and export subsidies expanding it to the extent any of these tax policies shift the economy away from its optimal level of trade they make the economys participants as whole worse off in terms of economic welfare 13 such arguments however focus on the economy as whole and are sometimes difficult to see when only particular sector of the economy is the focus the idea that tariff probably makes the economy as whole worse off would likely be hard to explain to an employee who has just been laid off because his firm has started relying on imported inputs the employment effects of 12 note that the country may be better off in making this trade even if it produces both watches and wheat more efficiently than the foreign country in an absolute sense the key is for both countries to produce one good more efficiently than the other good and for the margin of this efficiency to differ 13 for detailed economic

does not deny that increases in imports or reductions in exports can cause economic dislocation in particular sectors of the economy but because of the efficiency gains an economy realizes from trade the welfare gain to the economy as whole are held to outweigh the m of sectorspecific losses in principle the winners from countrys international trade can compensate those made worse off by providing transition relief or other transfers to those made worse off by trade such relief could in principle be provided through the tax code although mechanisms such as unemployment insurance or subsidized jobtraining might be more effective the message of economic theory on the basic relation of taxes and trade however is clear tax policies that distort trade make the economy worse off in terms of the outsourcing debate economic theory asserts that tax policies designed to curtail the type of outsourcing that occurs through trade probably make an economy as whole worse off g22g138g161g561g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g138g151g141g561g8g152g155g142g146g144g151g561g11g151g159g142g156g157g150g142g151g157g561 economic theory also provides framework for interpreting taxes impact on foreign investment from the perspective of economic efficiency and economic welfare here the results are slightly more ambiguous than those for trade because the framework distinguishes between policies that promote world economic welfare and those that promote national economic welfare but that are not optimal for world welfare we first ignore taxes and note that central tenet of economics holds that as capital investment in an economy increases the product added by each additional increment of capital declinesin terms of economic theory there is declining marginal product of capital given this physical property of capital firms will generally allocate investment between foreign and domestic locations until the return on an additional unit of overseas investment the marginal product of capital employed abroad is equal to that of an additional domestic investmentan outcome seen above in the discussion of how taxes affect invest ment decisions here we also note that where capital is allocated so that the marginal product of foreign and domestic capital is equal every unit of capital is necessarily being used in its most productive location given the declining marginal product of capital in both locations if an increment of capital were shifted away from this point the shifted capital would necessarily earn lower return in its new location than its old one at this point therefore the firms entire capital stock is employed in its most productive location more generally again ignoring taxes when firms equate the marginal product of domestic and foreign capital the world economys capital resources are employed in their most productive location and world economic welfare is maximized but taxes can change things profit maximizing firms focus on the after tax return to capital and invest so that the aftertax return to additional investment is the same in each location if taxes on investment are the same in every location this point will be different from the allocation of investment without taxes but if taxes are different at home and abroad the allocation of investment will be distorted capital will therefore not be employed in its most productive location and world economic welfare is not maximized 14 in short theory indicates that tax policy best promotes world economic welfare when it ap plies at the same rate at home and abroad and 14 put another way governments use tax revenue to finance services that in principle enhance economic welfare thus the social benefit from capital investment consists of an investments pretax return the investments aftertax return plus the tax revenue it generates thus economic welfare is maximized where the pretax rather than aftertax return of marginal investment is equal

parlance such tax policy possesses capital export neutralityit is neutral towards the export of capital tax policy that maximizes world economic welfare is not necessarily that which maximizes nations own welfare when an increment of capital is employed in the domestic economy it is the home country that collects and uses the tax revenue produced by the investment thus the home countrys residents benefit from the investments entire pretax return not just the aftertax return in contrast when capital is employed abroad foreign governments normally are normally entitled to taxes on the investment they host and the home country benefits only from the aftertax return to the investment accordingly the home countrys economic welfare is maximized when firms equate the pretax return of marginal domestic investment with the aftertax return of foreign investment this outcome suggests that the home country but not the world economy is better off when it allows only deduction for foreign taxes rather than credit allowing only deduction for foreign taxes would result in higher taxes on foreign investment than domestic investment 15 importantly however the benefit from such policy may be offset if foreign countries retaliate third type of tax policy termed capital import neutrality is sometimes promoted by business leaders and others it recommends policy that enables us firms to compete in foreign markets on an even footing with firms from foreign countrie s this policy would consist of an exemption for foreign investment from homecountry taxes but is not neutral in its effect on investment and does not promote economic efficiency as described above the us tax system in some cases poses incentives towards overseas investment and in other cases is either neutral or poses disincentive the average impact of the system is however uncertain and so whether th system as whole comes closest to capital export neutrality national neutrality or competitive neutrality is likewise uncertain likewise whether the legislation congress is considering in 2004 would nudge the system in the direction of particular standard is uncertain the impact of certain features of the system considered in isolation is however more clear for example the foreign tax credit generally promotes capital export neutrality because it alleviates double taxation while the credits limitation is likely necessary to protect the us tax base 16 it permits the overall tax rate on investment in hightax countries to exceed the us tax rate thus permitting tax disincentive towards foreign investme nt to exist in sense then the limitation is consistent with national neutrality although as general matter permitting firms only to deduct rather than credit foreign taxes would closely approach national neutrality the deferral principle is consistent with capital import neutrality since it can reduce the tax burden on foreign investment to level lower than the domestic tax rate in contrast the current taxation that applies 15 trade theory suggests that tax revenue considerations aside capital exporting country could benefit at the expense of the world economy by taxing foreign investment more h eavily than domestic investment the situation exists where the capitalexporting country faces high foreign demand for its investment funds in manner analogous to that of monopolist who restricts output the exporting country can extract economic rents by taxing investment outflows relatively heavily 16 without the limitation foreign governments could in principle deprive the united states of tax revenue by raising their tax rates on us firms whose investment they host to extremely high rates without the limitation the foreign governments would not need to fear that the high tax rates would drive off desirable investment because the firms could simply credit the high foreign taxes against the firms us tax on us source income

promote economic efficiency and economic welfare when they neither encourage nor discourage outsourcing whether that outsourcing consists of imports of goods or services or exports of capital investment but much of the debate over outsourcing has concerned its perceived impact of jobs with some participants expressing fears that outsourced jobs destroy domestic jobs and reduce domestic employment 17 the absence of employment from prominent role in the preceding discussion indirectly suggests what economic theory indicates about outsourcing and employment outsourcing has profound effect on longterm aggregate employment in the domestic economy although it can trigger shortterm sectorspecific job losses nonetheless given the prominence of employment considerations in the outsourcing debate we provide brief summary of economic theory in this area first mainstream contemporary economic theory holds that economies generally tend toward full employment or are moving in that direction the labor market is thought to ordinarily be at equilibrium where the supply of labor is equal to demand monetary policy set by the federal reserve is generally set so as to keep the economy at full employment and to avoid shocks to the system that might temporarily jar the economy from equilibrium this is not to say there is never unemploymentin fact unemployment is always present due in part to transitions within the economy some of which may result from outsourcing this persistent minimum level of unemployment is termed the natural rate of unemployment by economists and is viewed as an unavoidable consequence of maintaining an efficient flexible and adaptable economy nonetheless given appropriate monetary policy an economy is thought to generally absorb displaced workers and tend towards full employment against this backdrop we return to the foregoing analysis of trade which indicated that absent changes in capital flows the balance of trade cannot change economists believe that an exogenous increase in imports ie outsourcing will ultimately be matched by an increase in exports and mitigation of the initial increase in imports here the mix of what the economy produces has indeed been changed and an increase in unemployment in the importcompeting sector may occur nonetheless with the economy tending towards full employment new jobs will be created in other sectors of the economy that will in time offset those lost in the sector where outsourcing occurred in short when we view outsourcing as trade phenomenon its employment effects will be confined to the nearterm the employment analysis of outsourcing that occurs through investmentthat is where capital outflows occuris somewhat different as with tr ade there may be nearterm and sector specific unemployment as result for example factory that shuts down in particular us city and that moves to foreign location can certainly cause increased unemployment in the original us location 18 again however the economy as whole is seen as tending towards full employment and the absorption of dislocated labor there may also however be shift in the shares of 17 for more information see crs

outcome is based on the basic economic precept that labors earnings depend on its productivity which in turn depends on the amount of capital it has to work with the larger the economys stock of capital for given supply of labor the higher will be labor productivity and the higher will be labor earnings it follows then that when capital shifts abroad domestic labor earnings fall from the level they otherwise would attain as noted in the discussion above on efficiency in principle those that gain from outsourcing can in principle compensate those that lose and because of the efficiency gains embedded in outsourcing still be better off than before in principle the economic harm to workers from outsourcing can be mitigated by appropriate redistributive and retraining policies theory maintains however that these policies are most efficiently effected as general transitional relief than as policies designed to limit outsourcing

inputs rather than domestic goods and services and whether taxes encourage us firms to establish operations abroad rather than in the united states in the current debate the phenomena are frequently referred to as offshore or foreign outsourcing in economic terms the debate concerns the impact of taxes on two aspects of the international economy trade and foreign investment economic theory maintains that taxes can alter the composition and level of trade but do not alter the balance of trade the excess of imports over exports in contrast taxes can alter the extent to which firms invest abroad rather than in the united states the current us tax system produces patchwork of effects on investment so that its net impact whether it encourages or discourages overseas investment is uncertain economic theory also provides frameworks for evaluating the impact of tax policy on trade and investment from the perspective of economic efficiency and economic welfare theory suggests in general that tax policy best promotes efficiency and national economic welfare when it neither encourages nor discourages imports or exports in terms of the outsourcing debate theory holds that taxes best promote economic welfare when they do not distort the level or composition of outsourcing with outsourcing that occurs throug h investment theory similarly indicates taxes best promote world economic efficiency and economic welfare when they do not distort investment flows policy that poses small impediment to overseas investment may in contrast best promote national welfare although such policy may make foreign economic actors worse off and may be offset by retaliation g3g158g157g145g152g155g561g5g152g151g157g138g140g157g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 donald j
