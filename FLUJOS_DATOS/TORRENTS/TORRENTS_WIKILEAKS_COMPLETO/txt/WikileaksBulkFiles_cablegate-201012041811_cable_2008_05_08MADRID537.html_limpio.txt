00000537 0012 of 002 classified by cda hugo llorens for reasons 14 b and d 1 u two months after suffering second straight defeat at the hands of president jose luis rodriguez zapatero opposition partido popular pp leader mariano rajoy finds himself in the midst of crisis that threatens the future of his party leadership in the days following the march 9 general election rajoy announced that he would remain the pp leaderreminding spanish citizens that jose maria aznar lost two elections to felipe gonzalez before finally winning in 1996and received the public support of nearly every senior party official rajoy then took steps to soften the partys tone and remake it in his own image in an attempt to dilute the influence of aznar to that end he eased out congressional spokesman eduardo zaplana and secretary general angel acebes and announced he would be taking the party in new direction 2 u the cracks in pp unity began to show on april 7 when madrid regional president us governor equivalent esperanza aguirre refused to rule out challenge to rajoy at the upcoming party conference in june the potential for challenge to rajoys leadership was major news story in spain for the next several days with some in the pp even discussing the feasibility of conducting usstyle primary system to choose the partys next leader rajoy and his supporters tried to douse any speculation of leadership change but the crisis has not gone away more wood was added to the fire on may 12 when the popular pp leader in the basque country maria san gil announced that she would not serve again on the committee drafting the partys political program because she longer had confidence in rajoy or his team immediately after this announcement senior party officials including aguirre acebes madrid councilwoman and wife of president aznar ana botella and former aznar interior minister jaime mayor oreja expressed their support for san gils decision and called on rajoy to reflect on the current turmoil within his party for the first time since the march 9 elections we are now hearing serious speculation that rajoy may not be able to hold on to power 3 c during the week of may 5 in the middle of the controversy over the future of rajoys leadership but before the uproar caused by the san gil announcement the charge daffaires held separate meetings with gustavo aristegui pp congressional spokesman for foreign affairs and jorge moragas pp director of international relations and key rajoy advisor aristegui was very critical of rajoys actions in the wake of the electoral loss saying that he seemed to be blaming everyone but himself for the results he said rajoys actions to force out zaplana and acebes and bring in new team were akin to the captain of ship not only abandoning ship but leaving his crew in the sinking vessel aristegui said that rajoys lack of loyalty to those who had been with him all along was not sitting well with other pp leaders he opined that rajoy needed to open up the june party conference and allow all interested officials to present their candidacy for pp leadership he said that if rajoy was able to defeat challengers in fair and open process his leadership would longer be questioned aristegui said that rajoy may be able to maintain control beyond the june convention but opposition to his leadership would grow if the pp does poorly in the next rounds of spanish regional elections in the basque country currently scheduled for april 2009 and galicia june 2009 it should be noted that aristegui perhaps feels personally betrayed since rajoy has clearly demoted him in the partys foreign policy circles 4 c as expected moragas was more upbeat in his comments to the charge and while acknowledging that there were currently concerns about rajoys leadership predicted that the party would eventually fall back in line he said that in the coming weeks rajoy would attempt to remain above the fray and look towards the next four years in opposition by issuing position papers on topics such as the economy security and regional issues he said that president zapatero and his socialist government were in for very rocky way ahead with the economy continuing to tank and key issues in catalonia and the basque country coming to head he said it is more vital than ever for the party to remain united and seize the moment when zapatero stumbles moragas said that he and rajoy developed close working relationship during the campaign and that he is now one of rajoys closest advisors he added however that he was not rajoy guy but rather loyal party member who responded when asked to serve comment madrid 00000537 0022 of 002 5 c rajoy does not posses great charisma and many were surprised when former president aznar handpicked him as his successor in 2003 many more were surprised when rajoy did not bow out five years later after second straight electoral loss we believe rajoy owes his longevity as much as anything to the lack of credible successor within his own party wouldbe challengers such as esperanza aguirre madrid mayor alberto ruizgallardon or valencia regional president francisco camps all have their own drawbacks and none enjoys the national stature of rajoy and both ruizgallardon and camps appear to still be backing rajoy however groundswell of opposition may be building maria san gils public criticism of rajoys leadership was certainly noteworthy but maybe more so is the number of senior pp leaders coming out of the woodwork to express solidarity with her and to call on rajoy to seriously respond to the current unease among the party faithful rajoy may hold onto power for the time being due to the lack of viable alternative but we agree that further losses in spains regional elections over the next two years will make it difficult for him to remain the pps national candidate in 2012 pp leaders have traditionally been members of congress due to the visibility afforded and the need for the opposition leader to be able to confront the sitting president directly in weekly debates but some credible voices are mentioning the name of former imf director and past spanish vice president rodrigo rato now in the private sector as possible candidate to lead the party into the future llorens
