3ga goals finding part ii lecture given on 11 october 1962 this is lecture two saint hill special briefing course 11 oct continuing on the subject of goals finding if youve got down the fundamental that it takes an auditor and it takes meter then you see on goals finding theres substitute for being there as the auditor and being accurate on the meter therefore goals finding will never become the subject of sloppy auditing or sloppy metering now listing requires more auditor presence thanthat is the listing sessionsthan prepchecking an auditor will be able to get things done in prepcheck sessionsince october 1913 has anything been suppressed you see an auditor can sit there and bat this stuff off and get result on his pc which will be very interesting result hes sitting there practically without meter he simply stops asking the question you see when the pc doesnt want to give him any more answers and so forth because he isnt being pressed why the pe has tendency to be rather accommodating and it all goes off rather smoothly without too many arc breaks but the moment that you start listing you see well just skip goals finding its absolutely impossible to find goal without decent auditor and decent presence and good metering i mean thats foregone conclusion it mainly requires auditor presence and auditor permissiveness now the rule is very simple one for you to lay down on anybody somehow or another he has to continue his presence while never asking for more items than the pc has and never preventing the pc from giving him items now thats the happy balance which this listing auditor maintains now if you also have circumstance whereby the listing auditor is asking question and not getting an answer youll get jamup on the lines so this is interesting isnt it theres nice little compromise involved there the person doesnt have any items for the line and the auditor has asked the auditing question and therefore must get an answer to it well now this isgets interesting because youll find out that this little factor all by itself will stack up caseunanswered auditing questions so youve got an auditor who has to be smooth enough to say well just give an old one offhand well just give any one so the question will be answered pc will deal him the same item that hes dealt before or something like that and youve got the auditing question answered but that must be done sufficiently smoothly so the pc is not arc broke or being dragged at dont you see then youve answered the auditing question and youve got the item and thats all very slippery now what in essence here is the thing that would happen what is the thing that would go wrong in listing sessionis that the pc gets into suppress or protest either one of which turns on sen in other words you ask the pc for more items than the pc has you see its the pc has you know auditors dont sometimes get that point that the pc has them or he hasnt got them see the weird part of it is see the pc isnt dreaming these things up now this offhanded well give one more you know an old one or something to keep the record straight is asking the pc simply to give you one already dealt which the pc can always do but the pcs got them there and if you realize that the gpm is stacked up like poker chips you know hes either got that many or he hasnt see he isnt inventing them thinking them up creating them or something like that that is just the items hes got see thats thethat is pretty hard to realize the other auditing point that auditorspoor auditors even have bunch of trouble with and any auditor will have trouble with some time or another quite frequently is the pc has said something was wrong and it sounds horrible to the auditor and the auditor believes it is now wrong well the pc has said it and its been acknowledged so its actually longer wrong but the auditor feels very downcast because the pc has said this was the condition and then the auditor adjudicates that the pc couldnt possibly get well because the condition you see was so bad you got that the pc said well 1 thought what monster you are well the auditor says my god i cant audit this pc because the pc thinks im monster if the pc had thought that the auditor was monster and hadnt told the auditor yeah auditingpretty impossible but the fact that the statement has been made is the alleviation of the condition now when pcwhen pc isthats thei just added that in as the other point they have trouble with and once in while you yourself will say ohhh god you know look at what ive been looking at here but youre looking at past history if the pc has said it and its been acknowledged its always past history now thats with these items when the pc says them theyre past history see and they deal off just bang bang one right after the other bang bang bang bang bang and they deal off bang bang bang bang bang now if you demand that the pc give you more items than he has got then the pc will have to protest what you are saying hell have to protest the demand dont you see so thats protest which adds sen sensation is added thendizziness misemotion so forth and if the pc is prevented from giving items he hasits the way this finally works outthen the pc will have to suppress those additional items which gives you sensation now the symptom of wrong goal is it starts out with pain and winds up with sen sometimes it just starts out with sen and winds up with sen but sometimes early on in the run youll have pain on wrong goal which then develops into sen regardless of how smooth the auditing is or anything else thats symptom of wrong goal now you can make right goal of course sound like wrong goal in listing sessionlook like wrong goal you seeby making the pc suppress and protest pc says well i just havent got any more items thatyou know that make mistake you know make mistake being catfish i just havent got any more you know you say well come on now come on now this line is way behind we only have few strikes on this line im sure you can think up some indeed he could but were dealing with just so many chips in the bank you see were dealing with just so many things these are quantitative items see he has so many thousand of this and so many hundred of that and so many dozen of something else well sometimes the stacks are wrong dont you see and you come around and ask for something he made mistake about and he hasnt got any mistake items right at that moment at all he isnt even in that side of the deck huhuh he cant do thing about it he says well i just dont1 just dont have any you say oh come on now come on now pc says but i dont have any more oh come on im sure you can give couple of more im sure you can give another ten or twelve this lines way behind but i havent got them but i havent got them but 1 havent got them you seebecause that protest protest protest protestsen sen sen sen sen see all right now lets take the reverse side of it you say to the pc well this line is already overlisted weve got too many on this line and the pc says and theres aa game warden and catfish and theres fish hooks and theres theres streams and ponds and theres and you say well theres too many on this you know i mean you know theres alreadygot full card here its already full you know and uhcant we get off onto some other side of this and the pc has to go mvvrrtsen well now with sen goes climbing tone arm tone arm is direct indicator of sensation its mass but then of course sensation is symptomatic of builtup mass the more he chokes down and the more he protests the more mass is going to get stacked up so of course youve got the symptom of the climbing tone arm pc tone arm at 50 pc lots of senyou can say this sort of thing has happened that the auditor has demanded more items than the pc has and the auditor has prevented the pc from giving items that pc has thats your first adjudication so to that degree youre going to have trouble with listing sessions but in view of the fact that it does not greatly depend upon meteringin other words accuracy of metering is of account at all in the actual listing except to watch the tone arm the only thing the meter is used for is to tiger drill in but again if he isnt tiger drillingif he cant tiger drill you can always have him give rapid prepcheck and as you saw last night that can be done with casualty at allmaybe not perfectlycan be done with casualty at all just on straight prepcheck so your listing auditor doesnt even know how to tiger drilldoesnt even have to know how to tiger drill do you see that he could just give prepcheck round and do it once per session see be interesting you see what im driving at here so thats the main trouble there your main trouble is the lack of auditor presencethe auditors getting in the road of the session see its just the auditor wont permissively sit there and be an auditor the auditor must be getting in the road of the session the only thing youve got to do to remedy that is get the auditor out of the road of the session either by making the auditor inspect the cycle of auditing or something like this dont you see thats easy to remedy you can handle that and now the goals finding the goals finding herethats something else thats the combination of the observer and the meter and the goals finder has got to be hotter than hot on meter and got to be accurate and not blurred up and his auditing has got to be very smooth otherwise hell cause sufficient suppresses to cause the items or dynamics or persons hes trying to find hell cause those things just to vanish they just go they show up on the list but theres so much suppress on the session you cant get anything to fire you see this so if his auditing is rough hes not going to get any of these things in other words theyre suppressed before they occur sometimes meters just stop slamming and you work and you sweat and you slave and you eventually get the meter slamming again you see and its always on the fact that its suppress protest careful of all these confounded things careful of by the way peculiarly enough seems to be the brute that turns off slams that seems to be far more pertinent on slam turnoff than any other button of course the others turn off slams too but that ones peculiarly odd have you noticed that while running careful of youll very often get slams that you didnt suspect were there so therefore the pc is too carefulhe will turn off his slam now the best way to get slams back on is with goals prepcheck using the eighteen buttons which of course includes the counterbutton nowyou just take the item and you just you know give it goals prepcheck you know the item is candy bar you know and so you just say on the item candy bar you see has anything been suppressed or any way you want to run it but you just run it that way and you go on down through the end you normally will get the slam back on without any extraordinary actionparticularly if youre running it against the meter quite properly the best way 1 know to turn on goals and for you to turn on goals or items or dynamics that have turned off is just that round and round and round prepcheck actually running it on the meter on the average pc shouldnt take more than an hour to go all the way through but you get something thats really stacked up you get one button per session you know i mean vuuuh it could be almost variable in time but in ordinary course of auditing and so on its about an hour hour and ten minutes hour and fifteen minutes to go all the way through that now the auditorthe auditor has got to be sharp hes got to bei gave you the characteristics most desirable in auditing in another lecture but that auditor has got to be sharp auditor that auditor has got to be good observer hes got to be good meter operator and hes got to have good auditing presence and his auditings got to be very smooth given those things why man can he find goals take those things away and the goals just wont occur at all now oddly enough the thing thats going to cause you the most trouble in any area youre operating in will be the lucky flukeof course causes you trouble occasionally you do something thats little bit off line youre being very clever and you get goal or you get an item or you oh youve had it you know it wont happen again in another thousand years but you keep on trying it you know and its just fluke similarly somebody is going to sit down in an auditing chair someday ashes just doing prepcheck see something like thatand all of sudden the pc lays his goal on the line you know and says thats my goal or hes going overhes listing the goals list and hes watching the meter and all of sudden one of those goals goes clank brrrr see and he says it again and he says it again and he says it again and it checks right out right away right away see ruins him the rest of his natural career hell be sitting there listing the first 850 goals watching for that thing to go brrrr see i think theres only one goal here for long while that the first time it was read it rocket read three times in row there was suppress on it there was nothing on it it was just clean as wolfs tooth and there it was sitting right out in the open trouble is i dont think itd ever been on the pcs list before see the second they put it on the list it read perfectly of course it checked out beautifully and that was it and there wasnt any trouble with it and so on the auditor that found it has been ruined slightly i mean that auditor is liable to behell just think back to that think back to the good old days when he found that goal you know next goal he finds you know hell be sweating sweat running down and making hisdropping onto the dial of the emeter you know and pencils wearing out and pcs wearing out and everything and actually the reason hes having such hard time is of course that he thinks goal should do that and of course hes passed over the pcs goal and the pcsthis pc had quarter of rocket read and three suppresses that was the extent this goal showed up see somatics went with it to indicate it either you know this should happen to him you get how this is see but he just doesnt think you should have to work that hard for goal well an auditor has got to be variable and he realizes that his luck is variable pc to pc and sometimes he gets up on the right side of the bed and he reaches over and by golly his shoes are right there you know and the laces are untied and he slides into them and theres nothing in them thats the day see thats the day next morning he gets up reaches to the same locationno shoes reaches under the bedno shoes looks all over the houseno shoes sees his dog worrying something in the back yard well thats the way it goes theres terrific variability in this situation therefore pc to pc an auditor has to learn to be variable in his attention to the situation just because he found the goal on the pc in this peculiar way and this peculiar fashion is reason hes going to find the goal on the next pc in exactly that way and that fashion in other words hes got to be variable oddly enough the variability of it is best covered by very close adherence to the textbook solution for the first time in the history of any race on any planet our textbook solution is the best one thats the first time this has ever happened textbook solution they had song in the marine corps about mcbill mcgin who died with grin because he had used the textbook solution you know theyre usually quite fatal in more subjects than one 1 imagine in physics or chemistry laboratory or in the universities and so forth the textbook solutionsi dont think youd ever graduate if you used the textbook solution on the experiments you just never would thats all 1 used to look around occasionally in physics laboratory or measuring laboratory and id find these students passing you know and everything panning out exactly you know and in the chemistry lab the precipitate always turned out to be pure potassium skoofba you know i didnt realize theyd just gone over to the supply cabinet and got some potassium skoofba you know its marvelous marvelous and the acceleration tests all work out on the physics bench providing you put the answer down first and then work back to your experimental data the textbook solution is never very fortunate which is liable to give many an auditor an idea that he ought to put big curve into finding goals see well now you take model session frankly the more you vary model session the more trouble youre going to get into because the first thing you do is throw out the predictability factor see the pc considers you unpredictable and the more unpredictable unpredicted things you do why the less predictable the pc thinks you are so therefore becomes less and less certain of you as an auditor and therefore you as the auditor deteriorate as the pcs observer you see by being unpredictable you destroy the reality of the auditor as an observer you see that it might be very clever and it might be very necessary but remember that reality as the observer from the viewpoint of the pc is very often more valuable to maintain than to solve that particular little problem with that particular little piece of wit see what i mean you say well obviously i ought to throw the random rudiment in on this pc after every other rudiment see 1 do rudiment then ill throw in the random rudiment and it might be very necessary and it might be all right eventually with the pc if you did it every time but sooner or later youre going to conceive that it isnt necessary every rudiment to also throw in the random rudimentyoure going to leave it out here and therethen the pc doesnt know whats coming up next and therefore doesnt consider that you are predictable so therefore hes not so certain that he is being observed now the more you use standard model session and use it every time why there you are now last night you saw throw an unpredictability well this is only justified by the degree that the pc has had wrastling match with this particular one and its source of innumerable arc breaks on the part of the pc see all right so we will take this rudiment up nevertheless it destroyed to some slight degree the predictability of the auditorthe pcs prediction of the auditor see you understand 1 could get away with it that once see and that was fine but lets say next time 1 take up the present time problem rudiment and straighten it out the same way and then i run perfect model session for the next two sessions and then suddenly take up the since the last time i audited you rudiment and not clean this up but extend it into full mid ruds we would start getting an unreality on the part of the pc on the auditor dont you see well to that degree you can get away with variability and variation now in view of the fact that you arent going to always find detested persons and dynamics and items on this pc this does not become part of the picture of predictability so you could do this different ways as long as it was in model session the pc would be perfectly happy about it youre only going to find the detested person once you understand and after that youre not going to find the detested person but if you find this detested person and then you find the dynamic and then you find the item all more or less in the same way youll find out the item becomes much more easy to find because you see the pcs now got predictable pattern see hes more certain of what youre doing so therefore hes quieted down you understand that now hell becomehell think his certainty has been thrown out if you dont find the goal the same way you understand that maybe you could swing in on the same system what goal does this represent to you and you might find more certainty in getting it if you could figure out how to get the goal with the same system by which you got the item by the same system by which you got the dynamic by the same system in which you got the detested person see youve set up pattern of response here well the only virtue of the pattern of responsewell it has two virtues 1 its easier to teach because its pattern but that is not its main virtue it is actuallymakes the pc more certain that he has an observer the observer always does the same thing so therefore theres more of an observer there see the pcs certainty that somebody is there is compounded by the fact that he can predict the actions of this person now im tell you how to make yourself very unpopular with pc every time you check the pcs goal do it differently and do it in such way that the pc cannot predict what youre going to do make it so that the pc cant predict when you are going to say the goal if you are going to say the goal and then do it different number of times and all of sudden the goal wont read for you this is not test which 1 advise you to make on somebodys goal but you perhaps have reality on it right this minute which is why im saying it if you said now i am going to test the goal to catch catfishto catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish and you always tested it that way itd probably be all rightprobably be all right but its corny already because youve said the goal before youve said the goal and therefore the pc suppresses the first saying of the goal which registers then on the second saying of the goal which is really the first saying of the goal you understand you get the unpredictability of this action so its much better to say now im going to say this goal oh pc knows what goal youre talking about and if you dont think the pc will know what goal youre talking about you just say well whats your thoughts on this goal to catch catfish see the pc says soandso and soandso and soandso soandso and so andso and you say all right now im going to test this goalto catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish thank you very much however if you did that too unpredictably itd startle the pc enough so that by the time youve said the second one hed squashed it now have you1 see that you have had little experience in this supposing you had always said it this way now im going to test this goal to catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish and thats the way youve been saying the goal to the pc youve said the goal to the pc this way three four times at different times and now if you do this one now im going to say this goal to catch catfishto catch catfish to catch catfish to catch catfish you know youre not going to get any reads its just splattered all over the landscape see so you see that if unpredictability can smash goal out of read although thats fairly delicate thing you see that unpredictability can smash session out of read just drawing wider bow and of course listing session can be scrushed out of existence the same way do you see that its the predictability predictability factor sometimes your cleverness defeats itself because you become unpredictable what are you going to do lets say one day you get in the random rudiments right in the middle of trying to clean up in this session have you told any halftruth untruth done something only to impr well i think ill get in the middle rudiments heoh youd possibly get away with it probably nothing much happen to you if you did it how many sessions do you think you have to audit that rudiment perfectly before the pc stops being the gopher effect you know sitting up on top of his hole you know looking around looking around youre coming to the first rud whats he going to do whats he going to do whats he going to do whats he going to do whats he going to do oh hes going to read it straight see some part of his mind is doing this see youre unpredictable to that degree well goalsgoals finding can get very very complicated you could be so complicated and so nagging and so upsetting and so suppressive and get asuch protesty pc in goals finding that eventually you just never would find anything at all just never find thing lf something is wrong with the cycle of an auditing question yeah something will happen to finding detested persons and dynamicsthings will happen to these things thats why one looks with horror upon the untrained auditor or the lowerlevel trained auditor finding goals because you know that his technology is just not up to it hes liable to find all kinds of wrong things in the first place he doesnt know what goal read looks like in the second place hes insufficiently smooth to even read one off he can take any goal under the sun moon or stars make mistake on it and make it read he can take goal thats very unpopular with the pc lets say hes one of these auditorsa sort of an amateur booktype auditorwho is over on the overwhelm side of the picture see hes got basic philosophy that it must be true if the pc doesnt like it thats his basic test see if the pc protests thats it and then lets say he gets on some kind of of sexual goal of some kind or another that in this society somebodyd be very ashamed of dont you see and then reads this with gleam in his eye he makes suggest on it then tiger drills it wrongly gets the pc to protest it asserts then that it is the pcs goal as the pc is saying that it is not builds up nice ridge and you know that goal will read for years of course itll only read with tick but itll read until somebody pulls both sides of that thing off and pulls it apart well that frightens you when you come down to look at it so were not really though talking about that crudity of operation were talking about just the smoothness of finding goal so theres substitute for good auditing and finding goal theres just substitute for it luck we cant count onabout the only thing that would cause person who couldnt audit well to once in blue moon find right goal itd be his undoing too the steps by which goal is found today are very elementary theyre very simple and they all follow the same pattern we just ask the person who or what has the pc detested make it who or what because the pc is on ais on things type dynamic here detested person though we still call it will sometimes go by the boards dont you see they might not have any people they detest they only detest things you see and on that pc youre liable to miss most gorgeously if you say what person have you detested you understand that on large percentage of cases youre just going to get away with who have you detested see but theres that other case that comes along and you get thing now you could make the mistake of thinking this was so marvelous having gotten this itemthat youll list goals against it or something like that well that hasnt proven out as good action or productive action over period of time even though it gives you something that looks like an item if you get thing you know burnedout radiator you say boy that sure looks like an item you know naw its not an item now your next action is always represent now your action then is starts out with who or what have you detested you see get your list consider committing overts against _______items on the list and when you get that item its always followed with represent dont try to use other things ive gotten an awful lot of data on this and ive come cropper every time ive tried to use some other form of action the pcs substitutes is what we want and we say what does burned out radiator represent to you so thats always your next action to get the next list see and now weve got our next list and we consider committing overts against it and we get that one off that list and its next step is always represents dont you see and we can actually go along this line until we run out of dwindling rock slams we could actually continue this until we run out of dwindling rock slams which is quite interesting why it works that we only get couple of dwindling rock slams out of this im not quite sure there are probably more dwindling rock slams available in some cases but this works out just fine the way it is laid out now your dwindlingfirst dwindling slam is by the way not on the detestedperson pointperson or item see that doesntwhen you list those you get dwindling slam you understand theres dwindling slam there at all and there may not be dwindling slam from that itethat detested person or item when found that might not be dwindling slam in fact itd kind of surprise at times if you did get dwindling slam because mayman that ones far out see thats the far out bet but if you got dwindling slam nobodys going to argue with it but if you didnt get dwindling slam nobodys going to argue with it you see what stage of this operation im talking about you say who or what have you detested and they say sam jones yes sir and you and you say you how you want that written down well you you you know bill smith you well you write it down as bill smith not you and he gets down to the end of the list and says myself well you take these pronouns and you want to know how the pc wants them written down you dont challenge them oh he says myself george smith you write down george smith and also write down myself because by the time youre sorting this thing out youre going to get in trouble with pronouns consget theget the auditor sitting there see the auditor says consider committing overts against you so this gives you the myself do you get the tangle that comes out of this thing consider committing overts against you and you just never come off of it so you consider committing overts consider committing overts against consider committing overts against you go on down the list and by the process of elimination wind up with something that slams now how big does rock slam have to be im going to im going to im going to put this in immortal fire engraved and blazing upon the mountainside for the centuries and millennia to come because im tired of answering the question it gets asked to almost on an average of twice weekthree times week this same question how big is rock slam its the same thing as how long is piece of string how big is rock slam how high is the tide you know popular song now i can tell you that little dirty needle on the detested person in spite of anything you have been told by anybody else is not enough to indicate the right one and if you have bought the little dirty needle youre probably in trouble now the possibility is that you can get the thing down to little dirty needle and by doing rapid tiger drill on the item see whether or not the dirty needle expands to slam but nobody has done this and that is not what is indicated and its waste of time as far as im concerned do i make my point we dont want little dirty needle we dont want little dirty needle you understand we dont want one it means an incomplete list you hear its an incomplete list and if nothing is left at the end of the trail its an incomplete list and if nothing slammed nicely as you went by it was an incomplete list and if you didnt get anything its an incomplete list and if your assessment didnt wind up with proper dynamic or item it was an incomplete list do youdo i make this point see and if the pc is arc broke or calm or something its an incomplete list and the pc didnt cognite and say i knew itd be burnedout radiator yeah burnedout radiators yeah i never thought of that before its very interesting thing i had burnedout radiator on ford one time aw burnedout radiators pretty horrible even if this pc is the sphinx typenever says anything never cogniteswhen you get that item when you get that dynamic when you get that detested person dat pc gonna cognite you hear dat pc gonna cognite hes gonna cognite with cogs flying you come on down the line and you say consider committing overts against game warden consider committing overts against cats consider committing overts consider committing overts against consider committing overts against the pc sits there and you finally say game wardens pc saysyou say the itemthe detested person 1 got here was game wardens just make up your mind it doesnt have anything to do with the pc man you got that i mean thats the simplest test 1 know of the rightness of all of this if the pc is interested in it itll rock slam if the pc isnt interested in it it wont rock slam if it doesnt rock slam it isnt it now how wide is rock slam and how high is the sky well rock slam isnt dirty needle it isnt little bzzt bzzt bzzt bzzt thats never enough when you go down that list the first time youll see about three items on it go blam blam blam and you say hey what do you know ho ho and when the second time you go down you will see those rock slams centralize ononto only one item theyre differentiated now and youve got it on one item and you go by that thing and it goes blam and you say see and you go on down to the end of the list you go over the list again it goes blam you go over the list again and it goes blam same item go over the list again it goes blam in the event you arc break the pc and upset it why of course it wont go blam anymore well i catch these things very easily as brawith the brassring tactic if i go over it enough to have only one item going blam with rock slam and dats da brass ring and i put it right in the pcs nose right there and 1 say thats it and lead him right on down the track you got it and you do it by elimination by the time you go over that list the second time you ought to have that thing man you ought to have rope dropped right around its neck and if you havent got it you havent got it and you can unsaddle the horse you can polish up the harness you can fix up the brightwork the brass you can groom his coat you can wash out ofhis mouth you can brush his teeth and it still wont be the item you understand and right away as you go down the line youd id go down the thing the second time i find theres only one thing slamming on the thing id grab it right there and 1 say this burnedout radiator now that seems to be it and the pc says haha i knew that was it hahaha burnedout radiators yeah god i hate them thats all been the cause of an awful lot of difficulty with never really looked at it before but burnedout radiators oh hehheh im not at all surprised you know hahaha im not at all surprised burnedout radiators hahahaha 1 wonder why thats why im always having trouble drinking rusty water pcs interest follows the rock slam see so its inevitable that you youre going to getyou get both you got the item but this pc that just wooden indians on you to the bitter end you got nothing you can go on and on and on and on and on now how many lists of detested persons and things can you do before you finally get the item you do the exact number necessary to find the detested person or thing you got that thats how many lists you do thats very simple answer to very burning question you do it till you get it now do you put on it the second time you do it the things which it already aint you leave those off you drop them in the spittoon or the cuspidor and let them splash gloomily because if they werent on it the first timeif they werent it the first time theyre not going to be it the second time of course theres also substitute for having the pc in session or for auditing or for watching the meter theres substitute for those things but the odd part of it is the pc can be halfway arc broke and you can still get this thing its almost impossible to keep him from being interested in it its almost impossible to keep him from slamming on it later on when youve bled everything down and so forth you come back to this burnedout radiatorit may not slam you may have to prepcheck the thing like mad and even then it doesnt slam it just dirty needles its now past history do you understand its past history who cares whos interested in it theres slam on it pa longer interested in it pa longer interested in it dont slam got that now we go through the same old routine from there on only we want to know what represents burnedout radiator to the pc or what burnedout radiator representsi just dont seem to care whichand were going to get list of that and were going to get lists of that and were going to list that and that should or should not produce dwindling slam we dont much care whether it does or not if it does why youre in something weird might have occurred you might have hit the dynamic you might have hit something or other but such luck wont happen to you youre going to find the dynamic now now what part of existence does burnedout radiator represent is the best one to find dynamic with thats good one to find dynamic with what part of existencewhat larger part of existence does burned out radiator represent well big burnedout radiators is liable to get now pr give you rule dont put burnedout radiator on list from which burnedout radiator dontif youre making list from burnedout radiators dont put burnedout radiator on that list you hear now dont put it on that list i dont care if the pc gives it to you thank him effusively and just leave it off the list because its going to slam again and thats going to give you item knuckleheads several of you have done this you know and you wind up with the first dynamic as the detested person and the first dynamic as the dynamic and the first dynamic you see as the item and you where have you progressed to you have progressed to the detested person or thing now you list goals against it you havent got the dynamic you havent got the item so of course youre never going to get the goal you got it so thats rule see never put what youre deriving from on the list you are deriving from it see if itsa burnedout radiator is the detested thing well then dont put burnedout radiator down as what burnedout radiator represents you hear dont do it just omit it now your dynamic list is assessed out with consider committing overts against consider the same rules apply go downthe second time you go down through the thing the thing ought to be slamming if it isnt slamming junk the whole thing throw it away get the pc insession do something but get the item on the list you see its again the incomplete list is your main difficulty all right and when you finally got that one sorted out why the same rule of cognition applies only much more so now the pc says hohoho hohoho sepulchers hohoho ho damp sepulchers you know i was always frightened of them when i waschildren hoho yeah with black interiors yes i was always frightened of them you dont suppose that has something to do with the fact that i dont like to look in my hat see things slamming pcs interest there everything is fine pat him on the back and hurry on man now youre going to list that thing now by this time you ought to be producing dwindling slams see from the dynamic to the item for sure should produce dwindling slam im sure of my ground there i know darn well that one will if its the right dynamic when you procede from it to the item itll produce dwindling slam and dwindling slam starts wide and winds up and gets narrower and narrower and every time they put one on the list you have narrower slam and lot of people think if it turns on on the fourth one and the eighth one and the twelfth one and its still slamming when they wound up thats dwindling slam thats wrong itemwrong everything is wrong see dwindling slam starts wide and goes narrower for each item and you say the next item and you got narrower slam you say the next itemif the pc gives you the next itemits when the pc says it by the way and the next item and its narrower and the next item its narrower and finally its little dirty needle and finally you bleed it down and thats it and thats all thats complete list and by god your item is always on that listalways now its consider committing overts and thats done by what represents you know what does black sepulcher represent to you see and here we go and its done down to whatever the item is consider committing overts against this next list that you derived from thatbang one of thems live the second time through the rock slam has settled down there it is bang and there youve the thing and youve got coffin nail and you say there we go man we got coffin nail and thats it and it slammed and its the only thing on the list that slammed well it doesnt matter if that slam is an inch widequite ordinarily is only an inch wideinch and quarter wide inch and half wide two inches wide three inches wide four inches wide or dial wide or quarter of dial wide or third of dial wide but its slam doesnt matter how big it is and now you take that thing and that is the item and the pc says oh my god coffin nails you know ive always associated it with cigarettes and by the way all i remember is in 45 when i first heard them called that is all of sudden they give terrible cough cough as matter of fact and so forth cough andand coughcough andand so forth and the coffin nails cigarettes and so on and uhso on ive thought about these coffins in china that they were taking tops off the coffins and so forth and i thought thats pretty good idea and so forth they ought to leave the nails out because what if you got buried in this thing and you couldnt get out of this thing and so forth and do you know that that very closely associates to the whole subject of necromancy do you know that necromancys very very interesting subject have you ever been interested in necromancy i myself have been very interested in necromancy from time to time as matter of fact my father one time or anoth the last time when 1 was audited at the hasi i had an awful lot of things that had to do with necromancy i remember now and they now all fade together and so forth and thats just fine you get the idea see the closer you get into that item the more the pc is interested man and hethen he says well us coffin nails are very often so forth hell start to get oppterm trouble you know hes against coffin nails he is coffin nails some of them are coffin nails thats allslam like mad against coffin nails but they think of themselves as coffin nails dont you see and some of them those damn coffin nails over there and they never even come close to those coffin nails you get the idea sometimes theyre never close with the item all right thats it now you list goal onewhat goal would be an overt against and thats dwindling slam all the way down to dirty needle and so forth and there it is and very often youre lucky and the goal is on it but the actual fact is the goal is most likely to be in the first few goals on list six so you do list one you do list six fix up list six you havent got the goal dandy lets then write up list two list three list four list five lets get some more goals written on these other lists and then lets crossindex it and so forth and the pc very often if youre lucky will start putting his goal down on every one of those lists thats it he says well i hate to but you know im reallyact like im trying to sell you this goal but in the actual fact it does belong on that list you know and so on and he puts it on down and you check it out and thats it now thats if youre lucky if youre lucky if you have altitude if you are considered by the pc to be good observer if you have altitude with the pc if you are the auditor if you are in control of the session if you can run meter if you are running very smooth model session if you do this thing very flawlesslyif if if if if if ifand if that morning you got up and found your shoes in the exact right place and the laces were untied and so forth why and there was nothing in themyou got the pcs goal got that thats how you do it thats dynamic assessment now undoubtedly this can be groomed up undoubtedly there are various things we will learn undoubtedly this pattern can be expected at one time or another to change but there are substitute patterns by which to do this already in existence which are not as good as the original pattern now if 1 cant find any of these items why i would write up list what do you wish wasnt part of existence and then getting the pc oiled up ask him what isnt part of existence go on down the line and treat that as an item well you should test out such thing and try to list what represents what you found as what wasnt part of existence try to treat it as something else if you get dwindling slam as you list what represents it why dandy marvelous youre going to wind up with more pertinent item dont you see now theres even another dodge which 1 have worked on recently which is quite interesting and is apparently quite good its not the one ive been telling you about about the tiger drill button would your goal something or other its possibly not as fruitful as the other onealthough that has found goals see would your goal frarumph item see would your goal suppress item would your goal not suppress item would your goal 9 and couple that youve thrown in see whatever those buttons are the item see now thatd give us list of goals that would do that see itll rock slam by the way when you find itgive us list of goals that will do thatand youre liable to find the pcs goal the more pc rock slams the harder and more frequent the rock slams the harder the rock slam is to turn off the harder it is going to be to find the goal that has been turning out to be true if the pc is rock slammer from away back that darn goal has got to be exactly on the button its being avoided by the pc and its rather rough to get there so anyhow as far as rock slams go there is thetheres the criteria it doesnt necessarily hold true that you wont be lucky and the pc wont be lucky and wont get it on the list earlier because you very often may but nevertheless that sort of holds true now the other thing isthe one ive been working on iswho or what would oppose item just do list of who or what would oppose item go over the list youre is going to get one that slams and that is the opposition terminal to the item and ask the pc what goals that opposition terminal has because that opposition terminal is the pcs terminal sneaky and it apparently at first glance has as much validity as the item interesting huh its who or what would oppose item thats how you list it and then you assess it by would it commit overts against_________item and its going to slamone of them is going to slam follows the same ruleand you wind up with an additional item and you can ask who or whatwhat would be its goals or what goal and then also what goal would make it become what it is in other words theres new way of stripping goals out im still working on that end of the line thats the latest work ive done on it and it seems to be very very productive okay it doesnt change anything else youre doing its just an additional step that if youre having rough time why try that one and thats marvelous okay all right i brought you up to date on this subject and theres substitute for two thingsno substitute for two things theres substitute for finding goals and theres substitute for your being good auditor thank you very much
