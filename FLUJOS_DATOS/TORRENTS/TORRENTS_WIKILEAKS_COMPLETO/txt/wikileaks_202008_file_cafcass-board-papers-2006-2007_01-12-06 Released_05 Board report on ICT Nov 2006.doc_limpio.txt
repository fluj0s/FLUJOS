children and family court advisory and support service paper for the board meeting on 01 december 2006 ict programme board update aim and purpose 1 to update the board on progress in replacing the ict infrastructure and the associated programme of activity to modernise the use of it and replace it hardware 2 action for the board 21 this report is for information 3 recommendations 31 to note and endorse the work undertaken on implementing key elements of the modernisation agenda as they relate to improved deployment and use of it 4 key issues for the board to consider 41 we have previously reported to the board on the outdated and failing it infrastructure largely due to insufficient bandwidth of the network the implications for the business were significant and included slow running and poor performance inability to use laptops or other devices without substantial impact on system performance and an inability to roll out our case recording system now called case management system cms or any other additional software applications 42 following fundamental review of the network by our interim head of it jason camp the decision was made to procure new modern network capable of meeting existing requirements supporting cms and all existing software applications and capable of expansion without substantial additional costs in the future if cafcass requirements changed we also identified significant savings in annual revenue costs of running the modernised network 43 on her appointment in january 2006 our head of business development shirley hamilton completed the final specification for the new network and in march 2006 we signed 2year extension of contract with our it supplier unisys they procured the new network on our behalf and contracted with the new network provider cable and wireless to provide the new network the contract for the network runs for 3 years and will be novated to new service provider if unisys is not awarded our provider contract when this comes up for re procurement in april 2008 44 as part of bid to dfes for oneoff funding we sought capital to fund the necessary changes to our it provision and in particular the replacement of most of our computers which in april 2006 were 5 years old this is considered to be the end of their useful life and most organisations would have planned cyclical programme of replacement before they reach that age 45 we were successful in our bid and were allocated 19 million for the system upgrade and it kit replacement and 0215 million to convert all our home workers to broadband thus generating substantial revenue savings 46 118 million of the allocation is earmarked for replacement and deployment of desktop devices for office based staff mobile devices for family court advisers and mobile staff scanners for each office and some provision for digital pens 47 the remainder of the allocation is to provide improvements in our telephony start with document management destruction of defunct kit the network upgrade complete revamp and redesign of the intranet and internet and some additional software 48 an ict programme board was established to oversee the programme which is being run on prince 2 methodology 49 each element of the programme has been established as project with lamorna wooderson as executive lead on the whole programme but other senior managers taking that role for individual projects the programme board meets monthly 410 as reported to the audit committee this month the programme was subject to an ogc gateway 0 review the programme was awarded amber status and will be subject to further 3day review in january 2007 5 progress to date 1 the whole network has been rolled out with all sites now converted this has led to immediate improvements in service in offices which had low bandwidth lines and suffered from slow running frozen screens long log in times etc 2 the case management system which needed the new network to support it has been rolling out with now 5 regions south west west midlands eastern east midlands and london fully rolled out and smattering of individual teams around the country 3 the cms rollout is on target to complete full roll out by 31 march 2007 with north west region being the last to go 4 policy authoring system pas and policy deployment system pds have been purchased and we have brought in specialist to develop this for our use the pds is being piloted and work continues with the pas system to pilot by the end of the year if successful both systems will be rolled out nationally and will be the way that all significant documents are developed stored and deployed within cafcass similar development for case documentation is being scoped and will be developed as part of the cms system 5 two pilots on mobile working are looking at the use of tablets and digital pens for usability and usefulness for fcas the start of both pilots was delayed for range of technical reasons however the tablet pilot is showing some early indications that direct work with children can be enhanced by effective use of the tools this pilot will be extended further to look at the feasibility of sharing devices within team when evaluated we will need to consider whether tablet is the best device other options such as the digital pens or simpler pads may be as effective 56 probably the most significant development for flexible and mobile working is the citrix gateway this will allow users to join into the cafcass network securely from any broadband line where the pc or device is of reasonable specification this will include from homes internet cafes hotels courts etc board members will be able to access our systems from their own facilities if they so wish this will include the intranet and the library facility as well as email various levels of access can be applied we are rolling out this solution to home workers as part of the broadband conversion and we will be putting it on the new laptops being rolled out to senior managers this month by the end of the financial year this solution should be available for all staff that wish to avail themselves and should allow fcas in particular to use their own machines to do reports in safe and secure way 57 we have commissioned report from specialist and now gone out to tender on the upgrade of our telephony the plan is to use the capability of our existing high specification systems and our new network to converge data and voice networks to bring range of advantages including substantial revenue reductions as many calls will be at nil cost 58 for at least the last 2 years we have consistently stressed the need for all staff to be sufficiently it literate to undertake their own work despite this we have substantial number of practitioners who have limited or nonexistent it skills we are therefore having final push and rolling out basic and more advanced training on team byteam basis the training will be delivered in local teams by trainers and using our own manuals regional follow up and mentoring will be provided 59 following the basic it training we will commence training all practitioners in the use of the cms system so that they can input case information direct going forward we will be putting templates on the cms and fcas will need to access and store all case related papers there 510 we are reprocuring the contract for the further development of cms and have had good response to our advert we will be completing the letting of the contract on 22 january 2007 and the new contract will start in april 2007 511 we have revised and issued an updated security policy this will require further revisions as we go forward with the deployment of more mobile working 512 we have commissioned work on completely revamping and redesigning our internet and intranet for completion by the end of march our new head of communications is leading on this and when completed we will take in house for his team to manage all future postings and updating individual teams such as hr will be able to produce their own content to agreed templates the internet site will be more interactive and will include recruitment micro site thus saving substantial revenue costs on advertising 513 the final piece of work to report on here is the reprocurement of our it provider contract we have commissioned work from consultant to scope and advise on the process and work with us to identify what changes we want to make and identify if we wish to bring any services in house eg the web site as detailed above we obtain our payroll and financial services from uisl who are part of unisys our main it supplier we will be letting 2 separate contracts and companies will bid for one or both 6 financial implications 61 there are substantial financial implications i have identified the capital allocation and the programme is also being resourced from the it revenue budget in addition there is separate budget for the cms rollout and developments to that system 62 the programme is currently projecting full spend on allocated budgets 63 for next year the budget implications will be managed within existing revenue allocations and this will affect the extent to which some developments such as cms can be taken forward 64 many of the projects such as the web site document management and telephony will generate significant revenue savings 7 staffing implications 71 there are considerable implications for staff both in relation to changes in working practice and using new technology 72 all these changes will be undertaken in line with the relevant cafcass policies and in full discussion with our union partners 8 risks 81 there are several risks associated with this programme we have already identified risk associated with unisys and this has been added to our risk register 82 further risks are associated with the tight timescale to complete the programme and the capacity and capability of staff in cafcass and unisys to deliver on time and to budget there are also risks associated with the largescale configuration roll out and management of up to 1200 mobile devices 83 we also face the risk of staff and union resistance to the changes especially at time when we have not completed our pay and reward strategy or this years pay uplift 84 all risks identified as the programme is implemented will be included in the regional and the national risk registers and all appropriate mitigating action taken 9 diversity 91 issues relating to range of diversity considerations including access to it and possibilities of more home working for disabled workers will be enhanced by this programme 92 our intranet will also be significantly improved to provide better access for all our users especially children and those from minority groups we will ensure that diversity issues are fully addressed as we implement the programme lamorna wooderson corporate director november 2006 pic
