congress enacted the federal farm loan act in 1916 credit was frequently unavailable or unaffordable in rural areas many lenders avoided such loans due to the inherent risks of agriculture statutory authorit is in the farm credit act of 1971 as amended 12 usc 2001 et seq the most comprehensive recent changes were enacted in the agricultural credit act of 1987 the fcs is authorized by statute to lend to farmers ranchers and harvesters of aquatic products loans may also be made to finance the processing and marketing activities of these borrowers for home ownership in rural areas certain farm or ranchrelated businesses and agricultural aquatic and public utility cooperatives the fcs is not lender of last resort1 fcs is commercial forprofit lender borrowers must meet creditworthiness requirements similar to those of commercial lender fcs has young beginning and small ybs farmer lending programs but does not have particular targets or numerical mandates for such loans the fcs holds about 31 of the farm sectors total debt second to the 40 share of commercial banks and has the largest share of farm real estate loans 38 as of september 2006 fcs had 115 billion in loans outstanding of which about 47 was in longterm agricultural real estate loans 24 in short and intermediateterm agricu ltural loans 15 in loans to agribusinesses 5 in energy loans 3 in rural home loans and 6 in communications export financing leases and water and waste disposal loans

cooperative designed to provide credit nationwide it is limited to serving agriculture and related businesses and homeowners in rural areas each gse is given certain benefits such as implicit federal guarantees or tax exemptions presumably to overcome barriers faced by purely private markets2 fcs is the only direct lender among the gses other gses such as fannie mae are secondary markets fcs is not government agency and its debt instruments and loans are not explicitly guaranteed by the us government 3 1 the usda farm service agency fsa is lender of last resort for borrowers who are unable to get loan from another lender for more information about other farm lenders and current issues see crs report rs21977 agricultural credit farm bill issues by jim monke 2 there are five gses federal

see crs report rl30533 the quasi government hybrid organizations with both government and private sector legal characteristics by kevin r kosar 3 because of the significant role of gses in the us economy most investors feel the federal government will not allow gse to fail thus an implicit albeit not statutory guarantee exists

municipal and local taxation on the profits earned by the real estate side of fcs 12 usc 2098 income earned by the non real estate side of fcs is subject to taxation the exemption originated in the 1916 act commercial bankers estimate that the annual value of these tax benefits amounted to at least 425 million in 20044 for investors who buy fcs bonds on wall street the interest earned is exempt from state municipal and local taxes this makes fcs bonds more attractive to the investing public and helps assure plentiful supply of funds for loans commercial bankers say that the tax benefits let fcs offer lower interest rates to bo rrowers and thus give fcs an operating advantage since they compete in the same retail lending market g3g561g5g152g152g153g142g155g138g157g146g159g142g561g4g158g156g146g151g142g156g156g561g17g155g144g138g151g146g163g138g157g146g152g151g561 fcs associations are owned by the borrowers who pur chase stock required as part of their loan the smaller of 1000 or 2 of the loan amount fcs stockholders elect the boards of directors for banks and associations each has one vote regardless of the loan size most directors are members but federal law requires at least one from outside if an association is profitable the directors may choose to retain the profits to increase lending capital or distribute some of the net income through dividends or patronage refunds which are proportional to the size of loan patronage refunds effectively reduce the cost of borrowing some associations tend to regularly pay patronage while others prefer to retain their earnings or charge lower interest rates

required to buy stock the lesser of 1000 or 2 of the loan amount and become cooperative members fcs also retains profits that are not returned as patronage to borrowers with the exception of seed money that was repaid by the 1950s and temporary us treasury line of credit in the 1980s6 fcs operates without any direct federal money fcs banks and associations do not take deposits like commercial banks nor do they receive federal appropriations to fund their loan program g22g162g153g142g156g561g152g143g561g14g152g138g151g156g561g138g151g141g561g4g152g155g155g152g160g142g155g156g561 the fcs provides three types of loans 1 operating loans for the shortterm financing of consumables such as feed seed fertilizer or fuel 2 installment loans for intermediateterm financing of durables such as equipment or breeding livestock and 3 real estate loans for longterm financing up to 40 years of land buildings and homes the fcs has statutory mandate to serve agriculture and certain agribusinesses and rural homeowners borrowers must meet certain eligibility requirements in addition to general creditworthiness eligible borrowers and their scope of their financing can be grouped into four categories fulltime farmers for individuals with over 50 of their assets and income from agriculture fcs can lend for all agricultural family and nonagricultural needs including vehicles education home improvements and vacation expenses parttime farmers for individuals who own farmland or produce agricultural products but earn less than 50 of their income from agriculture fcs can lend for all agricultural and family needs however nonagricultural lending is limited farmingrelated businesses 7 fcs can lend to businesses that process or market farm ranch or aquatic products if more than 50 of the business is owned by farmers who provide at least some of the throughput fcs also can lend to businesses that provide services to farmers and ranchers but not aquatic producers such as crop spraying and cotton ginning the extent of financing is based on the amount of the businesss farmrelated income rural homeowners fcs can lend for the purchase construction improvement or refinancing of singlefamily dwellings in rural areas with populations of 2500 or less 6 the financial assistance corporation fac borrowed 126 b illion from treasury following the farm financial crisis of the 1980s

banks and associations has been declining for decades through mergers and reorganizations this consolidation accelerated however in 1999 when the farm credit administration fca the systems regulator approved the parent aca structure and the internal revenue service declared flca subsidiaries taxexempt in the mid1940s there were over 2000 lending associations nearly 900 in 1983 fewer than 400 by 1987 200 in 1998 and only 95 in 2006 the system operated with 12 districts into the 1980s 8 districts in 1998 and 5 regional banks districts since 2004 twenty years ago the typical fcs association covered several counties and specialized in either land or farm production loans today the typical fcs association covers much larger region delivers wide range of farm and rural credit programs and services and has an extensive loan portfolio fcs benefits when consolidation crea tes more diversified portfolios customers may benefit if greater institutional efficiency is passed along through lower interest rates however consolidation may weaken the original cooperative concept of local borrower control and close many local offices at which farmers had established relationships

it first must obtain approval from the other territorys association for example associations within us agbanks region the southern plains and west can compete for loans but associations in the agfirst region the east and southeast cannot charter territories help ensure that borrowers are serv ed locally and maintain local control of the association charter territories and any changes must be approved by fca in 2001 fca proposed allowing national charters so that associations would not be restricted by geographical boundaries the fca board later dropped the idea after opponents raised concerns that national charters would weaken fcss mission by pitting associations against each other for prime loans and reducing commitments to local areas

farmer mac httpwwwfarmermaccom was established in the agricultural credit act of 1987 to serve as secondary market for agricultural loanspurchasing and pooling qualified loans then selling them as securities to investors farmer mac increases the capacity for agricultural lenders to make more loans for example if lender makes 30year loan and sells it to farmer mac the proceeds can be used to make another loan this is similar to the much larger secondary market for housing loans such as fannie mae although farmer mac is part of fcs and regulated by fca it has liability for the debt of any other fcs institution and the other fcs institutions have liability for farmer mac debt it is considered separate gse farmer mac is organized as an investorowned corporation not memberowned cooperative v oting stock may be owned by commercial banks insurance companies other financial organizations and fcs institutions nonvoting stock may be owned by any investor the board of directors has 15 mbers five elected from the fcs five elected from commercial banks and five appointed from the public at large farmer mac operates two programs farmer mac i loans not guaranteed by usda and farmer mac ii usdaguaranteed loans majority of farmer mac i volume comes from the sale of longterm standby purchase agreements ltspc farmer mac promises to purchase specific agricultural mortgages thus guaranteeing the loans against default risk while the participating lender retains interest rate risk under farmer mac ii the company purchases the portion of individual loans that are guaranteed by usda on these purchases farmer mac accepts the interest rate risk but carries default risk farmer mac continues to hold most of the loans it purchases potentially more profitable activity for the company but also more risky 8 fca board members are nancy c pellett chairman since may 22 2004 appointed in 2002 for term that ends in may 2008 dallas tonsager appointed in 2004 for term that ends in
