divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34024veterans and homelessness summary the current conflicts in iraq and afgh anistan have brought renewed attention to the needs of veterans including the n eeds of homeless vetera ns the department of veterans affairs va estimates that it has served approx imately 400 returning veterans in its homeless pr ograms and has identified ove r 1500 more as being at risk of homelessness both male and female veterans are overrepresented in the homeless population and as the number of veterans increases due to the current wars there is concern that the number of homeless veterans could ri commensurately congress has created numerous progra ms that serve homeless veterans specifically almost all of which ar funded through the veterans health administration these programs provide h ealth care and rehabilitation services for homeless veterans the health care for homeless veterans and domiciliary care for homeless veterans programs employ ment assistance homeless veterans reintegration program and compensated work therapy program transitional housing grant and per diem and loan guarantee programs as well as other supportive services through an arrangemen t with the department of housing and urban development hud approximately 1000 veterans currently use dedicated section 8 vouchers for perman ent housing with supportive services provided through the va these are referred to as hud vash vouchers in fy2007 it is estimated that approximately 282 million was used to fund programs targeted to homeless veterans several issues regarding veterans nd homelessness have become prominent in part because of the current conflicts one issue is the need for permanent supportive housing for lowincome and homel ess veterans with the exception of hudvash vouchers there is source of permanent housing specifically for veterans in fy2007 the veterans benefits health care and information technology act pl 109461 authoriz ed funding for additional hudvash vouchers although these vouchers were not initially funded the fy2008 consolidated appropriations act pl 110161 included 75 million for section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans in ddition proposed legislation in the 110th congress would both fund additional vouche rs and provide resources for the acquisition reha bilitation and construction of pe rmanent supportive housing for very lowincome veterans and their families second emerging issue is the concern that veterans returning from iraq and afghanistan who are at risk of homelessness may not receive the services they need efforts are being made to coordinate services between the va and department of defense to ensure that those leaving military service transition to va programs another emerging issue is the needs of female veterans whose numbers are increasing women veterans face challenges that could contribute to their risks of homelessness they are more likely to have experienced sexual abuse than women in the general population and are more likely th an male veterans to be single parents few homeless programs for veterans have the facilities to provide separate accommodations for women and women with

brought renewed attention to the needs of veterans including the needs of homeless veterans homeless veterans initially came to the countrys attention in the 1970s and 1980s when homelessness generally was becoming more prevalent and noticeab phenomenon the first section of this report defines the term hom eless veteran di scusses attempts to count homeless veterans and presents the results of studies regarding the characteristics of homeless veterans at the same time that the number of hom eless persons began to grow it became clear through various analys of homeless individuals that homeless veterans are overrepresented in the homeless population the second section of this report summarizes the available research regarding the overrepresentation of both male and female veterans who are present in great er percentages in the homeless population than their percentages in the general popula tion this section also reviews research regarding possible explanations for wh homeless veterans are overrepresented in response to the issue of homel essness among vete rans the federal government has created numerous programs to fund services and transitional housing specifically for homeless veterans the thir d section of this re port discusses eight of these programs the majority of progra ms are funded through the department of veterans affairs va within the va the veterans health administration vha which is responsible for the health care of veterans operates all but one of the programs for homeless veterans the ve terans benefits administration vba which is responsible for compensation pe nsions educational assistance home loan guarantees and insurance operates the othe r in addition the department of labor operates one program for homeless ve terans in fy2007 approximately 282 million funded the majority of programs targeted to homeless veterans several issues regarding homelessness am ong veterans have become prominent since the beginning of the conflicts in ir aq and afghanistan the fourth section of this report discusses three of these emerging issues the first is the need for permanent s upportive housing for homeless and lowincome veterans second issue is ensuring that an adequate transition process exists for returning veterans to assist them with issues that might put them at risk of homelessness third is the concern that adequate services might not ex ist to serve the needs of women veterans this report will be updated wh new statistical informa tion becomes available and to reflect programmatic

male veterans surveyed 32 reported being homeless for 13 or more months versus 17 of nonveteran homeless menoverview of veterans and homelessness homelessness has always existed in the united states but only in recent decades has the issue come to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s the number of homeless persons increased as did their visibility experts cite various causes for the increase in homelessness these include the demolition of single room occupancy dwellings in socalled skid rows where transient single men lived the decreased availability of affordable housing generally the reduced need for seasonal unskilled labor the reduced likelihood that re latives will accommoda homeless family members the decreased value of public be nefits and changed admissions standards at mental hospitals1 the increased visibility of homeless persons was due in part to the decriminalization of actions such as public drunkenness loitering and vagrancy2 homelessness occurs among families with children and single individuals in rural communities as well as large urban cities and for varying periods of time depending on circumstances periods of hom elessness may vary from days to years researchers have created three categorie s of homelessness based on the amount of time that individuals are homeless3 first the transitionally homeless are those who have one short stay in hom eless shelter before returnin g to permanent housing in the second category those who are episodi cally homeless frequen tly move in and out of homelessness but do not remain homeless for long periods of time third the chronically homeless are those who are homeless continuously for period of one year or have at least four episodes of homelessness in three years chronically homeless individuals often suffer from mental illness andor substance abuse disorders although veterans experience ll types of homelessness they are thought to be chronically homeless in higher numbers than nonveterans4

overrepresentation of male veterans two national studies one published in 1994 using data from the 1987 urban institute survey as well as data from surveys in angeles baltimore and chicago and the other published in 2001 using data from the 1996 nshapc found that male veterans were overrepresented in the homeless population in addition researchers in both studies deter mined that the likelihood of homelessness depended on the ages of veterans32 during both periods of time the odds of veteran being homeless was highest for veterans who had enlisted after the military transitioned to an allvolunteer force avf in 1973 these veterans were age 2034 at the time of the first study and ag 3544 at the time of the second study in the first study researchers found that 41 of adult homeless men were veterans compared to just under 34 of adult males in th general population overall male veterans were 14 times as likely to be homeless as nonveterans33 notably though those veterans who served after the vietnam war were four times more likely to be homeless than nonveterans in the same age group34 vietnam era veterans who are often thought to be the most overrepresented group of homeless veterans were barely more likely to be homeless than nonveterans 101 times see table 1 for breakdown of the likelihood of homelessness based on age in the second study researchers found th at nearly 33 of adult homeless men were veterans compared to 28 of males in the gene ral population once again the likelihood of homelessness differed among ag groups overall male veterans were 125 times more likely to be homeless than nonveterans35 however the same post vietnam birth cohort as that in the 1994 st udy was most at risk of homelessness those veterans in the cohort were over three times as likely to be homeless as nonveterans in the same c ohort younger veterans those age 2034 in 1996 were two times as likely to be homeless as nonve terans and vietna m era veterans were approximately

popula tion36 although the likelihood of homelessness was different for each of the two surveyed populations the study estimated that female veterans were be tween two and four times as likely to be

their numbers in the general population factors present both pr ior to military service and those that developed during or after serv ice have been found to be associated with veterans homelessness most of the evidence about factors associated with homelessness among veterans comes from the national vietna m veterans readjustment study nvvrs conducted from 1984 to 198838 researchers for the nvvrs surveyed 1600 vietnam theater veterans those serving in vietnam cambodia or laos and 730 vietnam era veterans who did not serve in the theater to determine their mental health status and their ability to readjust to civilian life the nvvrs did not specifically analyze homelessness howe ver later study published in 1994 used data from the nvvrs to examine homelessness specifically39 findings from both studies are discussed below factors present during and after military service although researchers have not found that military service alone is associated with homelessness40 it may be associated with other factors that contribute to homelessness the nvvrs found an indir ect connection between the stress that occurs as result of deployment and expos ure to combat or warzone stress and homelessness vietnam theater and era ve terans who experienced warzone stress were found to have difficulty readjusting to civilian life resulting in higher levels of problems that included social isolati on violen t behavior and for white male veterans homelessness41 the 1994 study of vietnam era vetera ns hereafter referred to as the rosenheckfontana study evaluated 18 vari ables that could be associated with homelessness the study categorized each variable in one of four groups according to when they occurred in the vetera ns life pre military military the

three factors exposure to combat participation in atrocities and nonmilitary trauma the readjustment period consisted of two variables accessibility to someone with whom to discuss personal matters

associated with homelessness although their effects varied the two military factors combat exposure and participation in atrocities did not have direct relationship to homelessness however those two factors did contribute to 1 low vels of social support upon returning home 2 psychiat ric disorders not includ ing post traumatic stress disorder ptsd 3 substance abuse di sorders and 4 being unmarried including separation and divorce each of these four postmilitary variables in turn contributed directly to homelessness43 in fact social isolation measured by low levels of support in the first year after discharge from military service together with the status of being unmarried had the str ongest association with homelessness of the 18 factors examined in the study44 posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd researchers have not found direct relationship between ptsd and hom elessness the rosenheckfontana study found unique association between comb atrelated ptsd and homelessness45 unrelated research has determined that homeless combat veterans were more likely to be diagnosed with ptsd than combat veterans who were not homeless46 however the nvvrs found that ptsd was sign ificantly related to other psychiatric disorders substance abuse problems in interpersonal relationships and unemployment47 these conditions can lead to readjustment difficulties and are considered risk factors for homelessness48 httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34024crs13 49 model of homelessness among male ve terans of the vietnam war generation p 426 50 ibid 51 richard tessler robert rosenheck and

february 23 1994 53 homeless veterans of the allvolunteer fo rce social selection perspective p 510factors that predate military service according to research factors that predate military service also play role in homelessness among veterans the rosenheckfontana study found that three vari ables present in the lives of veterans before they joined the military had significant direct relationship to homelessness these were exposure to physical or sexual abuse prior to age 18 exposure to other traumatic experiences such as experiencing serious accident or natural disaster or seeing someone killed and pl acement in foster care prior to age 1649 t h researchers also found that history of conduct disorder had substantial indirect effect on homelessness50 conduct disorder includes behaviors such as being suspended or expelled from school involve ment with law enforcement or having poor academic performance another premilita ry variable that might contribute to homelessness among veterans is lack of family support prior to enlistment51 the conditions present in the lives of veterans prior to military service and the growth of homelessness among veterans have been tied to the institution of the all volunteer force avf in 1973 as disc ussed earlier in this report the overrepresentation of veterans in the homel ess population is most prevalent in the birth cohort that joined the military after the vietnam war it is possible that higher rates of homelessness among these veterans are due to lowered recruitment standards during periods where military service was not held in high regard52 individuals who joined the military during the time after the implementation of theavf might have been more likely to have characteristics that are risk factors for homelessness
