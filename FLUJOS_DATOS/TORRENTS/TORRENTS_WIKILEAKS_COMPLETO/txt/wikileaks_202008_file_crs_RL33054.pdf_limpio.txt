linda levine domestic social policy division january 17 2008 abstract this report analyzes the labor market experiences of those older workers who have involuntarily lost longheld jobs for reasons unrelated to their own performance eg veteran factory workers at plants closed because of import competition experienced information technology workers whose jobs have been outsourced to workers in other countries and midlevel managers in positions eliminated through corporate restructuring it examines current policies targeted at the reemployment of older displaced workers which if successful might lengthen their stay in the workforcehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33054g5g20g21g561g20g142g153g152g155g157g561g143g152g155g561g5g152g151g144g155g142g156g156 prepared for members and committees of

demographic changes could substantially affect the us labor market namely the aging of the population and the slowdown in popul ation growth the possibility of their raising the dependency ratio the number of older and younger persons compared to the size of the workingage population has caused concern about the nations ability to maintain the current standard of living one way to lessen the ratios expected increase is for people to spend more years in the labor force ie to delay the age at which retirement typically occurs older workers who involuntarily lose longhel d jobs through fault of their own could experience great difficulty delaying retirement older displaced workers usually have labor market outcomes that compare unfavorably with older nondisplaced workers such as longlasting lower employment rates older workers often are more adversely affected by displacement than younger workers as well for example older wo rkers disproportionately end displacement by exiting the labor force than by finding new jobs the lower employment rate of older displaced workers appears related to their restricted job opportunities the limited access of older jobseekers could be due to age discrimination and to lawful considerations of employers eg compensation packages with health insurance for their part the likelihood that older displaced workers will earn considerably less upon reemployment dampens their motivation to find new jobs both the dislocated worker program of the workforce investment act and trade adjustment assistance taa are designed to actively help eligible displaced workers regardless of age find new jobs eg by providing training in addi tion demonstration program alternative trade adjustment assistance taa for taaeligible older workers offers wage supplement to those who become quickly reemployed in fulltime jobs that pay less than their lost jobs wage supplement sometimes is referred to as wage insurance retraining and wage insurance operate on the supply side the only federal program that addresses older workers reemployment difficulties from the demand side is the senior community service employment program title v of the older americans act it creates parttime public service jobs for older persons with low incomes and poor job prospects to the extent that it is more demandside than supplyside obstacles that prevent substantial numbers of older displaced workers from obtai ning new jobs raising the social security eligibility age may not succeed at delaying retirements among members of this group not only might older displaced workers be unable to ameliorate potential shortages by extending their working lives but they also might live in reduced circumstances and qualify for meanstested government benefits as result of their unplanned retirements further older workers voluntarily retiring from longheld jobs who want to extend their stay in the labor force by taking noncareer bridge jobs could be thwarted from doing so by these same demandside obstacles

states is projected to experience two major demographic changes that could substantially affect labor markets in forthcoming decades the demographic changes are the aging of the us population and the slowdown in us population growth1 both are expected to raise the total dependency ratio the number of younger and older persons relative to the economically productive population the oldage dependency ratio the number of older persons per 100 individuals in the workingage population will account for most of the increase although the greatest growth in the oldage dependency ratio is projected during the 20112029 period when members of the babyboom generation reach 65 years old the ratio likely will continue climbing thereafter 2 because the rise in the dependency ratio reflects an increase in generally active life expectancy it represents an unmitigated gain in welfare but to some economists and policymakers high dependency ratio raises concerns about how small workforce will provide for relatively large number of dependents without decline in the us standard of living 3 at least two means have been suggested to preven t this scenario from coming to fruition one is that productivity continue increasing at the high average rate attained over the 19602000 period this outcome is possible given the inverse relationship between labor force and productivity growth some suggest however that the educationa l attainment of recent immigrants and their offspring might temper future increases in labor quality which helped spur productivity growth in the past another possibility is that the labor force will not be as small as anticipated in the future because older members of the population will extend their working lives to reflect the increase in life expectancy 4 healthy older individuals face number of impediments to spending more years in the labor force however5 late career employees who involuntarily lose longheld jobs through fault of their own could also be among those who have the most difficulty delaying retirement the ability of older displaced persons to continue working has implications for society beyond mitigating labor shortages if these workers exhaust any unemployment benefits for which they might be eligible they presumably will draw down assets including retirement nest eggs as result they might remain in the labor force to restore depleted savings and to reach planned retirement asset values however those unable to find new jobs could become eligible for means tested government assistance eg food stamps and supplemental security income even older displaced workers who become reemployedbut in jobs with wages substantially below those on 1 for more information see crs report rl32701 the changing demographic pr ofile of

g25g152g155g148g142g155g156g561 there is single definition of displaced worker s or of older workers definitions differ by the variables available in surveys and by statute shortly after the issue of worker dislocation emerged the us bureau of labor statistics bls developed the displaced worker supplement dws to the current population survey cps which queries different groups of households over time every two years since the mid1980s the dws has been administered with the january or february cps to determine the number characteristics and labor market outcomes of adults who reported that they had lost or left jobs as result of plantcompany shutdown or move insufficient work or positionshift abolished in its definition of displaced workers bls includes only workers who had worked for their employers for at least three years before being discharged as they are expected to have greater difficulty becoming reemployed than more recent hires when utilizing the dws or other databases analysts sometimes do not apply tenure screen similarly some researchers may define older workers as having attained given age minimum eg at least 55 years old while others also set an upper limit eg below age 65 to avoid the complexities introduced by eligibility for public and private retirement benefits begun in 1992 the longitudinal health retirement study hrs survey focuses specifically on older individuals ie over age 50 analysts are able to utilize the hrs to examine displacement among older workers because it asks individuals whether their jobs ended as result of business closings and permanent layoffs ie for reasons other than poor performance 6 g22g145g142g561g11g151g140g146g141g142g151g140g142g561g152g143g561g6g146g156g153g149g138g140g142g150g142g151g157g561 almost 900000 workers aged 55 and older who had at least three years of tenure were displaced during the 20032005 period according to the most recent dws data older persons comprised more than one in five longtenured workers displaced between january 2003 and december 2005 6 possible responses in the hrs to how job ended are business closed laid off or let go quit retired temporary layoff and wanted better job although the permanently laid off individuals often counted as displaced in analyses that utilize the hrs include some persons who may have been let go for cause their inclusion does not appear to affect studies results

more years of tenure who lost longheld jobs ie the displacement rate was 47 the relationship between the displacement rate of older workers compared to younger workers has fluctuated over time according to the dws data but some empirical analyses estimate that the relative rate of displacement among older workers variously defined increased from the 1980s to the 1990s7 heightened risk of job loss among older workers may be related to the increase in displacement over time caused by positionshift abolishment this reason for involuntary job loss is thought to reflect corporate restructuring which seemingly has taken heavier toll on experienced aged 40 to 64 white collar workers such as managers in the more recent period 8 other analyses have not uncovered an increase in the risk of displacement among older workers but because job tenure not age drives displacement trends declining job tenure suggests older workers could be more vulnerable in the future 9

workers from displacement according to the measures analyz ed below those older persons whose jobs are terminated through fault of their own often have subsequent labor market outcomes that also compare unfavorably with nondisplaced older workers explanations for these patterns are presented below as well

number of older than younger displaced workers experience long spells of unemployment before becoming reemployed among those with new jobs in january 2006 22 of longtenured displaced workers at least 55 year s old had been unemployed for half year or longer in contrast with 15 of displaced workers aged 25 through 5410 older displaced workers spend the most time unemployed at 85 weeks without work as of january 2006 this was more than two weeks beyond the median period among reemployed 25 to 54yearolds who had been displaced between 2003 and 2005 reflecting this disparity slightly larger share of reemployed older job losers when compared to primeage job losers had exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits 47 and 43 respectively two explanations offered for older workers typically longer duration of unemployment are greater preference for leisure and more nonlabor income the results of one analysis suggest that this is not the case instead the author estimates that the longer unemployment spells and larger earnings losses of older displaced workers are due more to their inferior job prospects11 7 see for example daniel rodriguez and madeline zavodny are displaced workers

than onehalf of longtenured displaced workers at least 55 years old were reemployed in january 2006 compared to about threefourths of 25 to 54yearolds see column 4 of table 1 the groups low reemployment rate was heavily influenced by its oldest members only one fourth of displaced workers at least 65 years old who were dismissed between 2003 and 2005 were again working in january 2006 further according to an analysis of 19921996 hrs data older displaced workers subsequently have lower employment rates than comparable group of older nondisplaced workers due in part to the shortlived nature of postdisplacement jobs the disparity in employment rates was estimated to be particularly true of persons in their 60s the impact of displacement on employment status was found to be longlasting as well for example only 60 of men and 55 of women who lost their jobs at 55 years of age we re employed two years later in contrast with 80 employment rates for nondisplaced workers the same age there was little narrowing of the employment gap even four years after termination when the rate among older displaced workers was about 20 less than the rate among their nondisplaced

compared to younger newhires and older workers generally the authors concluded that the current structure of the labor market does not appear well suited for later retirement ie longer working livesgiven the restri cted employment opportunities facing older workerswho switch jobs eg displaced workers or opportunities that would face nonswitching older workers were they to change jobs eg those who want to continue working but in noncareer bridge jobs after retiring from their longtime employers 15 the presence of health benefits in firms compensation package also could deter employers from hiring older workers because of their typically aboveaverage health care costs it sometimes has been argued that if firms are able to make older workers absorb their higher costs by paying them lower wages the benefit would not be barr ier to reemployment based upon an analysis of 19842000 dws data however reemployed workers age 55 and older failed to experience greater tradeoffs of wages for health benefits than other displaced workers16 accordingly another study estimated that employers with health benefit plans have significantly fewer newly hired 55 64 year olds on their payrolls17 us labor markets have demonstrated an enormous capacity for change over the years even if firms alter their compensation structures and mix in response to the increase in the number of older workers the legal restrictions on mandatory retirement the increase in social security retirement age and the declining importance of defined benefit pension plans the re is likely to remain sizable number of

than they had on the fulltime jobs they lost 21 based upon january 2006 data from the dws larger share of longtenured older workers compared to 2554 year olds displaced from fulltime positions were paid lower wages in their new fulltime jobs 57 and 48 respectively there is very strong relationship between the change in earnings and tenure on the lost job the average earnings loss is dramatically larger when the worker had accumulated substantial tenure on the lost job this is consistent with the destruction of job specific human capital when longterm job ends the estimates with respect to age which show weak relationship with the earnings change taken together with the estimates with respect to tenure generally confirm the standard finding that older job losers who are more likely to have lost hightenure job suffer larger wage declines than do younger workers 22 in addition relatively more workers at least 55 years old who lost longheld fulltime jobs between 2003 and 2005 were employed parttime in january 200623 not only would fewer hours of work be expected to yield smaller paychecks but also the wage rate of parttime jobs generally is lower than that of fulltime jobs when parttime

degree of earnings loss they incur study that utilized hrs data on workers between 45 and 75 years old who changed employers in the 19862004 period estimated that wages of reemployed retirees and displaced workers fell much more than the wages of older workers who quit or left their jobs for other reasons eg relocation poor health and disability and family or child care responsibilities26 in the case of older displaced workers specifically pay cuts averaged 12 older males who held the job they lost for 10 or more years were estimated to experience an especially large drop in average earnings upon reemployment 20 the substantial wage losses of older workers who were laid off from longheld jobs could be partly related to the large proportion that found new jobs in different industry groups 60 where their skills might not be as highly prized in addition it was determined that two in five older men disp laced from jobs in which they had worked for more than 10 years longer had pension coverage upon reemployment overlaid on their sharply lower earnings and pension coverage is marked decrease in additions to the value of pension benefits according to an analysis of 19921998 hrs data that examined individuals aged 5075 the gain in pension wealth from delaying retirement is significantly reduced for older displaced males 27 for older women the decrease is not statistically significant the lower earnings estimated to be 41 for men and 38 for women in combination with this reduced pension gain were found to significantly dampen the motivation to find another job after displacement changes in wages and pension accumulations however were estimated to explain very little of the substantially higher rate of retirement among older displaced workers compared to older nondisplaced workers while some older displaced workers may be unwilling to accept new jobs that pay considerably less than their former jobs many more may retire because they are unable to obtain new jobs the studys results suggest that compared to changes in wages and pensionrelated financial considerations other obstacles to reemployment may better explain the high retirement rates of older displaced workers eg employer reluctance to train older individuals and age discrimination g18g152g149g146g140g162g561g20g142g156g153g152g151g156g142g156g561 the dislocated worker program under

not reserve portion of its funding for older displaced workers similarly taa does not distinguish between older and other displaced workers but as an entitlement program any taaeligible older worker would be assured of receiving services if they chose to the taa program also provides reemployment assistance beyond that offered under wias dislocated worker program eg relocation allowances in effect wia and taa attempt to keep older displaced workers in the labor force by addressing some of the reemployment barriers and financial disincentives discussed above in light of employer reluctance to train older workers either because of the short time period in which to recoup their investment or because of stereotyping the programs draw upon public funds to do so to the extent that employers high demand for uptodate computer skills limits older workers access to jobs the provision of such training through wia and taa could expand older workers job opportunities training may thus serve pur pose beyond the human capital investment motive of raising workers skill levels to increase postdisplacement wages however taxpayer subsidized training does not come with the guarantee of job at its end fairly few evaluations have been conducted of tr aining programs for displaced workers of the displaced worker programs that have been examined some provided more job search assistance than retraining solely provided reemployment bonuses or had methodological shortcomings eg insufficient followup periods and failure to differentiate types of training 29

th at is regularly occurring byproduct of labor market adaptation to economic change eg diss emination of technological and other innovations in the workplace heightened international competition in provision of goods and services by contrast unemployment insurance ui only compensates displaced workers during the period of job search it neither motivates them to find new jobs nor insulates them from the extended effect of displacement on employment and wages recognizing that the nations ui system provides only shortterm compensation and that retraining may not be the optimal solution for all displaced workers 30 some analysts have recommended that experienced workers who lose jobs for reasons unrelated to their performance receive supplement if the earnings on their postdisplacement jobs

within 26 weeks of job loss take fulltime position with wages below those of their former jobs32 the new job must pay less than 50000 as well the supplement is 50 of the difference between the wages on the old and new jobs up to maximum of 10000 over the twoyear period of receipt33 according to its proponents wage insurance might enhance the reemployment prospects of displaced workers by prompting them to consider even those positions that pay substantially less than the jobs they lost during their initial period of employment these workers also might have the opportunity to receive onthejob training that makes them more productive and qualifies them for pay increases which narrow the gap between their preand postdisplacement wages by the end of their eligibility for wage supplements if the supplement is available for limited time from the date of job loss the payment also could encourage speedier reemployment because its value effectively declines the longer unemployment continues thus in addition to enabling displaced workers to remain in the labor force wage insurance program might reduce ui costs based upon the extremely limited evidence available thus far the actual benefits of wage insurance program appear to be extremely modest the canadian earnings supplement project was conducted from july 1995 to october 1998 to estimate whether the availability of pay supplement promoted and sped reemployment of displaced workers eligible for unemployment benefits 34 the twoyear supplement was designed to replace 75 of the earnings loss of displaced worker up to 250 per week who found new lower paying fulltime 30 hours week job within 26week period displaced workers were randomly assigned to group that was offered the supplement and to group that was not the low takeup rate about 20 of supplement group members received payments largely reflects an inability to quickly find new fulltime jobs the availability of supplement was not found to affect the timing or intensity of job search among supplement versus control group members the only statistically significant impact on job search was to prompt few displaced workers to consider broader range of jobs absent speedier reemployment of supplement over control group members then the program did not lower unemployment insurance costs although the program was estimated to produce small statistically significant difference in the fulltime reemployment rate of supplement compared to control group members the difference occurred toward the end of the period during which jobseekers were eligible for the supplement this difference in fulltime reemployment rates44 percentage points at its widestwas f ound to gradually diminish by one year after the workers had been assigned to the supplement and control groups their fulltime reemployment rates essentially were and remained the same the programs most noticeable effect was on the compensation of the few supplement recipients the supplement which averaged 8705 over 64 weeks represented large portion of the incomes of these individuals 31 required minimum of petitioning workers must be at least 50 years old ie

displaced workers age 55 and above who were included in the canadian earnings supplement project35 the researchers estimated that age was one of the primary determinants of reemployment during jobseekers eligibility for the supplement each additional year of age lowered by about one percent the likelihood of finding fulltime position workers with long tenure at their employers who tend to be at the older end of the age spectrum also were found to have reduced probability of reemployment during the eligibility period fulltime reemployment rates did not differ significantly between supplement and control group members age 55 and older as to the us experience with the taa program it thus far appears hampered by implementation problems that may have dampened worker access to wage supplements the demonstration went into effect in august 2003 but majority of states reported various difficulties eg creating payment systems separate from their existing ui checkissuing systems and tardy guidance from the us department of labor as result only 19 states had the wage insurance program up and running in 2003 36 it should be kept in mind that wage insurance and training operate on the supply side they do not address the demandside barriers to reemployment discussed above the only federal program that focuses on the seemingly limited job opportunities of older unemployed workers is the senior community service employment program scsep title v of the older americans act it creates parttime public service jobs for persons aged 55 and older who have low incomes and poor employment prospects in fy2006 scsep f unded slightly more than 60000 jobs and served about 92300 individuals37 the cost per job slot was about 7153 with participants paid at least the highest of the federal state or local minimum wage or the prevailing wage paid by the employer for comparable public service occupations38 to the extent that demandside rather than supplyside obstacles prevent substantial numbers of older displaced workers from obtai ning new jobs then raising the eligibility age of social security may not succeed at delaying retirements among members of this group not only might older displaced workers be unable to ameliorate potential shortages by extending their working lives but they also might live in reduced circumstances and qualify for meanstested government benefits as result of their unplanned retirements further older workers voluntarily retiring from longheld jobs who want to extend their stay in the labor force by taking noncareer bridge jobs could be thwarted from doing so by these same demandside obstacles 35 howard s bloom saul schwartz susanna luigurr and sukwon lee testing reemployment incentive for displaced workers the earnings supplement
