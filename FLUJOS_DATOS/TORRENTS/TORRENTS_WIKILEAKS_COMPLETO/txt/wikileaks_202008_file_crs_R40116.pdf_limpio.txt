gina became law pl 110233 gina prohibits discrimination on the basis of genetic information in employment and health insurance and is often described as the first civil rights legislation of the 21st century the complexity of the us health care system and the continually evolving field of genomics are both reflected in the crafting of gina the department of health and human services recently released request for information rfi to assist in formulating its proposed regulations for gina this is good indicator of the level of complexity that will be involved with the implementation of gina 1 some of the issues that the new law may raise are discussed in detail in this report g21g140g152g153g142g561g152g143g561g157g145g142g561g14g138g160g561 broadly any genetic nondiscrimination legislation had to address through its determined scope two key distinctions with significant policy implications the first distinction is that of manifested or existing disease or conditions versus presymptomatic disease or conditions that are not clinically evident the second distinction is that of genetic information that is predictive of or indicates predisposition to future disease or condition versus other types of genetic information including diagnostic information that identifies and confirms disease or condition specifically lawmakers had to decide whether to include protections for individuals with manifested genetic conditions within the scope of the law and also had to decide whether to define genetic information to include genetic information beyond predictive genetic information as passed gina does not protect against discrimination based on manifested genetic diseases or conditions but does provide protection against discrimination based on genetic information beyond predictive genetic information including diagnostic genetic testing pharmacogenetic testing carrier testing and tumor profiling 2 thus gina is not limited to protecting only presymptomatic individuals from discrimination based on their future risk of disease as predicted by their genotype the policy implications of the scope of the law thus delineated are discussed in detail below and specific examples are provided g15g138g151g146g143g142g156g157g142g141g561g9g142g151g142g157g146g140g561g6g146g156g142g138g156g142g561 many individuals may believe that gina affords protection against discrimination in health insurance and employment on the basis of manifested genetic disease or disorder for example cystic fibrosis in addition to protecting against discrimination based on genetic information 1 see irs dol hhs joint request for comments reg12382908 on implementation of genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 gina pl 110233 ccessed at

of using specific drug to treat given condition in specific individual and the appropriate dosing regimen of drug for an individual pharmacogenetic test may be defined as genetic test intended to identify individual variations in dna sequence related to drug absorption and disposition pharmacokinetics or drug action pharmacodynamics including polymorphic variation in the genes that encode the functions of transporters receptors metabolizing enzymes and other proteinsa carrier can be defined as an individual who possesses one copy of mutant allele that causes disease only when two copies are present although carriers are not affected by the disease two carriers can produce child who has the disease carrier testing identifies these individuals httpwwwgenome govtumor profiling may be

genetic disorder or disease from genetic discrimination in health insu rance or employment based on their manifested disease or medical information about their manifested disease title i of gina specifically clarifies that nothing in the act prohibits health insurer or an employer from increasing health insurance premiums establishing preexisting exclusion or establishing rules of eligibility for individual enrollment based on the manifestation of disease or disorder of an individual who is enrolled in the plan in addition title ii section 210 of gina states that an employer will not be in violation of the act based on the use acquisition or disclosure of medical information that is not genetic information about manifested disease disorder or pathological condition of an employ ee or member including manifested disease disorder or pathological condition that has or may have genetic basis taken together these provisions clarify that the protections set forth by gina do not apply to manifested disease or medical information that is not genetic information about manifested disease 3 although advocates supported drafting gina to provide protection against discrimination based on manifested genetic disease many also argued that gina should not include protections for such discrimination opponents argued that to in clude such protections would not be in keeping with the spirit of the law which in significant part is to protect individuals from discrimination in health insurance and employment based on the possibility of future disease as predicted by their genotypes with respect to health insurance ma ndate prohibiting insurers from rating policies based on manifested genetic disease would have been fundamentally disruptive to system predicated upon just such an approach in addition commentators believed that it would be unfair to protect individuals with genetic diseases and disorders and not those with diseases or disorders with known genetic basis with respect to em ployment many believed that existing law such as the americans with disabilities act ada would provide adequate protection against employment discrimination based on manifested disease genetic or otherwise for these reasons gina was crafted so as not to extend protection against discrimination based on any manifested disease g18g155g142g141g146g140g157g146g159g142g561g138g151g141g561g17g157g145g142g155g561g9g142g151g142g157g146g140g561g11g151g143g152g155g150g138g157g146g152g151g561 during the lengthy debate about genetic nondiscrimination legislation many argued that it is the predictive and probabilistic potential of genetic information that justifies special regulation of this informations use and collection and that any law should be limited to predictive genetic information specifically proponents maintained that discrimination against healthy individual on the basis of the possibility of illness in the future as uncovered through genetic test was unjust however ginas definition of genetic information includes genetic information beyond predictive genetic information including much diagnostic genetic test information advocates supported this broader definition arguing that genetic information that does not predict susceptibility to disease such as carrier status or pharmacogenetic testing should also be protected 3 protection against discrimination based on manifested diseases may be provided by other laws for example the americans with disabilities act ada the ada 42 usc sec 12101 et seq prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities for discussion of the ada see crs report 98921 the americans with disabilities act ada statutory language and recent issues by nancy lee

and the definition of genetic information in turn rests on the definition of genetic test both titles of gina define genetic test as an analysis of human dna rna chromosomes proteins or metabolites that detects genotypes mutations or chromosomal changes title i excepts from its definition of genetic test an analysis of human proteins or metabolites that detects genotypes mutations or chromosomal changes that is directly related to manifested disease disorder or pathological condition that could reasonably be detected by hea lth care professional with appropriate training and expertise in the field of medicine involved 4 biochemical genetic tests provide examples of this type of test where protein or metabolite is analyzed detecting genotype mutation or chromosomal change which may be related to manifested disease or disorder in addition title i excepts analyses of proteins and metabolites that do not detect genotypes mutations or chromosomal changes such as cholesterol test and does not apply to analyses of nonhuman dna rna chromosomes proteins or metabolites for example hiv testing however this definition does not except any analyses of human dna rna and chromosomes that detect mutations genotypes or chromosomal changes therefore such analyses that produce information that is diagnostic predictive or not clearly either in any given situation such as pharmacogenetic testing some tumor profiling or carrier testing are all protected under gina for example diagnostic genetic test results for canavans disease would be protected genetic information under gina as would susceptibility genetic testing results for mutations in the brca1 or brca2 genes which could be used to assess future risk of breast or ovarian cancer this broad definition as noted previously also includes pharmacogenetic test results carrier testing results and some tumor profiling g11g156g156g158g142g156g561g20g138g146g156g142g141g561g139g162g561g157g145g142g561g21g140g152g153g142g561g152g143g561g9g11g16g3g561 there are several considerations that the scope of gina as discussed in the previous two sections raises first the second exception to the definition of genetic test in title i raises questions about why analyses of proteins and metabolites that detect genotypes mutations and chromosomal changes and are directly related to manifested disease should be treated differently than similar analyses of rna dna or chromosomes this may create situation where individuals with manifested disease may face different protections against discrimination based on the type of analysis they undergo to determine therapy even though both types of analyses technically uncover information about their genotype mutations or chromosomal changes tumor profiling provides an example of this issue while tumor profiling based on an analysis of dna rna or chromosomes to determine therapy or risk of re currence is to be protected information under gina similar information based on the analysis of protein would not be protected 2007 study describes the discovery of protein s100a2 that is predictive of poor survival in pancreatic cancer and may help select patients who could benefit from surgery 5 results from this type of tumor profiling which may in some cases detect changes at the genetic level would not be covered under gina both employers and insurers might be interested in such information 4 pl 110233 section 101d7bii 5 ohuchida k et overexpression of

protecting the results of some newborn screening tests and not others specifically the results of newborn screening tests that are biochemical genetic tests ie they analyze protein or metabolites detect mutations genotypes or chromosomal changes and are directly related to manifested disease may be excepted from protection under gina while more classical genetic tests for example for cystic fibrosis would not be excepted this difference in protection would be based on the target of analysis of the test ie protein in the case of biochemical genetic newborn screening tests or nucleic acid in the case of the classical genetic test rather than on what the test uncovers genetic changes in both cases second the definition of the term manifested will affect the scope of the law as implemented the term is used to create two exceptions in title i and one in title ii with respect to the exception to the definition of genetic test in title i the broader the term is the more analyses will be excepted from protection under gina the earlier the stage of disease defined as manifested the broader the exception will be with respect to the exception allowing insurers to make insurance and employment decisions based on manifested disease again the broader the definition the fewer individuals will potentially be protected under gina finally there is the issue of protecting genetic information about manifested disease while at the same time not protecting manifested disease status current health status or medical information about manifested disease specifically in the case of diagnostic genetic testing it is difficult to envision how an employer or insurer would use that genetic information as basis for discrimination and how an indivi dual could prove it because it would occur in the context of manifested disease at the very least this may create confusion for the individual in the situation who may feel protected by virtue of the fact that the disease was diagnosed using genetic test falling under the scope of the definition of the term in gina it is conceivable that health insurers may underwrite hereditary cancers differently than other cancers if the hereditary cancers were known to have certain properties eg be more aggressive that might increase costs in this case diagnostic genetic test result in addition to medical information about manifested disease may result in higher premium for example than might simply medical information about manifested disease g21g142g149g142g140g157g142g141g561g7g161g138g150g153g149g142g156g561 the reach and scope of the definitions of genetic test and therefore of genetic information may be more clearly explained through the use of exam ples it has been reported that in 2005 player for the chicago bulls franchise experienced cardiac symptoms that may have predisposed him to sudden death during strenuous physical exertion the team reportedly wanted this player to undergo genetic testing to help determine whether or not he could play safely 6 in such case positive genetic test result in the presence of certain cardiac symptoms would be considered diagnostic ie it would diagnose manifested disease7 it is instructive to consider whether gina as passed would have protected player in such case gina would have prohibited an employer from requesting or requiring that an employee undergo genetic testing title ii section 202b states it shall be an unlawful employment practice for 6 httpwwwnytimescom20051003sports basketball04currywirehtml_r1 7 httpwwwnytimescom20051006sportsbas

with respect to an employee8 however gina likely would not have protected an employee from adverse employment action based on any medical information that is not genetic information that was available to the employer at the time for these reasons it would appear that even with ginas protections in place an employer may have taken adverse employment action against an employee although an employer likely could not have required an empl oyee to take genetic test this example also illustrates the lack of dangerousness exception in gina the ada in contrast contains such an exception which has been found to include dangerousness to self9 the ada may provide further protection in this case but that analysis is beyond the scope of this paper in another fictitious example consider an individual who has manifested disease and undergoes genetic testing to determine either how effective certain drugs or different doses of the same drug might be in treating her illness in this case it would appear that an employer or health insurer could to the extent permitted under other law discriminate based on the current health status of the individual ie his manife sted disease the same employer or insurer could not use genetic tumor profiling or pharmacogenetic test results used to guide therapy or drug dosing as basis for discrimination for example if the results of onco typedx testing determine that an individuals breast cancer is likely to respond well to chemotherapy this would potentially increase costs to both an employer and health insurer however under gina this information may not be factored into either employment or health insurance decisions although the individuals manifested brea st cancer may be considered
