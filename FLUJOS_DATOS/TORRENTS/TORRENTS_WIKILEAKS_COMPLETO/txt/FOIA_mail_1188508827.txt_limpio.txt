from wangclimatecestmalbanyedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re fwd review of ee paper on alleged wang fraud date thu 30 aug 2007 172027 0400 cc thomasrkarlnoaagov weichyung wang wangclimatecestmalbanyedu phil i think you need to respond by providing ee with simple answer of false to keenans writeup based on the communication with but mention of sunya confidentiality issue it has to come directly from sunya that will force ee to contact either directly or sunya if the former i can refer to sunya also and let the university to handle it my reading is that since the ipcc policy report is coming out soon in october keenan is in panic and wants to tint the nature paper as much and as soon as possible so he can not wait for sunya to conduct inquery not investigation which he knows he is not getting what he wants going to news medium will not do his trick because he can not really explain it so in way keenan traps himself now betting on that the station history was not available and that the stations have moved lot he does not know that at all we are facing tricky person and group and the only way to do it is to follow the procedure to drive them crazy ee is not going to publish it without giving the chance to respond and that is when sunya comes in and that is what keenan does not want to see as well he wants to create smocky screen before the truth comes out we are not going to let keenan doing things his way so be easy and respond directly what you learn from and any other scienctific issues you can identify and perhaps even ask ee to contact meor sunya for verification i know you are under tremendous pressure but keenan is in panic and what he has done is going back to burn him badly we should be thinking after the whole odeal is over to take legal or other actions against keenan this is time i regre not been rich person otherwise i can throw million dollar lawsuit against him let know what you want to do i have also asked sunyas opinion about what you should do within the sunya framework but be careful that you do not know much about sunya action wcw original message from phil jones pjonesueaacuk date thursday august 30 2007 1016 am subject re fwd review of ee paper on alleged wang fraud weichyung been thinking couple of thoughts 1 libel is quite easy to prove in the uk as youre not public figure perhaps when youre back you ought to consider taking some legal advice from suny assuming the paper is published that is 2 more important i think i should send short email to the editor peiser and inform him that keenan has broken his agreement with suny over this issue if i dont they could say i had the chance and didnt can you check with suny whether the folks there think i should i just dont want to do anything that later could be construed as the wrong thing now i could also point out some factual errors cheers phil at 1006 30082007 wangclimatecestmalbanyedu wrote the confidentiality means that keenan needs to keep the inquery confidential during the process of sunya inquery wcw original message from phil jones pjonesueaacuk date thursday august 30 2007 403 am subject re fwd review of ee paper on alleged wang fraud weichyung and tom thanks for the quick response i wont do anything then until the suny process has run its course can you clarify what you mean by violated confidentiality i presume you mean that keenan agreed to do nothing on the issue until the suny process has run its course i presume this will conclude sometime this autumn keep informed of when the final decision might be as after this we ought to do something about the paper in energy and environment i checked with their guest editor and got this amazing reply see below so if we didnt already think this was the worst journal in the world now we know for certain it is and have clear information from them to prove it when i mean doing something i dont mean sending anything to ee as that will be useless the real climate blog site is possibility but there are other avenues i will make few notes and send them to you to forward to suny only after doing this can i get onto something else im away tomorrow back in on monday cheers phil from peiser benny bjpeiserljmuacuk to phil jones pjonesueaacuk xoriginalarrivaltime 29 aug 2007 1653260748 utc filetime1e7969c001c7ea5d xueaspamscore 00 xueaspamlevel

the paper i hope this clarifies your query with best regards benny ________________________________ from phil jones mailtopjonesueaacuk sent wed 8292007 1651 to peiser benny subject re review of ee paper on alleged wang fraud benny energy and environment is presumably peerreview journal your email wasnt clear as to whether you want to review the paper if you want to will you take any notice of what i might say such as reject the paper or has the contribution already been reviewed phil at 2317 29082007 wangclimatecestmalbanyedu wrote hi from beijing thanks for the information and i have forwarded the file to the vp research and she wrote back to that keenan has violetted the confidentiality as i have told her in the very beginning in any case i am letting the university to handle this send whatever you have and i will forward to sunya keenan does not follow on any rules at all reasoning with him is useless but this will come back to badly hurt him before i left for beijing i wrote my offical responses see attached please keep it to yourself there is doubt that zeng had access and examined the station history to pick up the 42 pair stations also remember that the statements made in both papers address changes in all the relevant parameters location instrumentation observation time etc without specifically focus on relocation sunya is going through very careful procedure as i request them to do because keenan will jump on any slip in procedure the fraud charge which will not stand any chance is just his strategy of getting attention on the station relocation effect so better to start thinking along that line i am here attending the meeting of the 3rd alexander von humboldt international conference on the east asian monsoon past present and future in beijing i am going to take some time off travelling in southern china after the meeting when my wife join this weekend there is good chance that i might not have email access have good day wcw
