appropriations see related legislation page 46 however the repor t does not follow specific funding issues related to mandatory lhhsed pr ograms such as medicare or social security nor will it follow the authorizin g legislation necessary prior to fundinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31003crs3 some of the presidents initiatives for glossary of budget terms please see appendix terminology page 50 for discussion of the lhhsed bill jurisdiction please see appendix b scope of the lhhsed bill page 51 the lhhsed bill typically is one of the more controversial of the 13 regular appropriations bills not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues such as restrictions on the use of federa l funds for abortion and stem cell research this bill provides most of th discretionary funds for th ree federal departments and several related agencies including the social security administration ssa of the 13 annual appropriations bills the lhhse d bill is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domes tic federal programs the fense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs for fy2001 the lhhsed bill accounted for 1094 billion 172 and the defense bill accounted for 2875 billion 453 of the estimate d 6349 billion total for all federal discretionary

advance appropriations as well as ma ndatory appropriations in the lhhsed bill because appropriations may cons ist of mixtures of budget authority enacted in various years at least two summary measures are used program level appr opriations and current year appropriations program level appropriations reflect the total discretionary appropriations in given bill regardless of the year in which they will be spent and therefore include advance funding for futu re years unless otherwise specified appropriations leve ls in this report refer to program level amounts current year appropriations represent discretionary appropriations in given bill for the current year plus discretionary appropr iations for the current year that were enacted in prior years current year discretionary appr opriations are similar to the amount counted for the 302b allocations ceilings discussed later page 14 an advance appropriation is funding that will become availabl in fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriations act is acted for example funds included in the fy2001 act that cannot be spent until fy2002 at the earliest scorekeeping adjustments are made to account for special f unding situations the congressional budget office cbo monitors these adjustments all of these amounts are shown in table 2 along with current year funding fo r mandatory programs

250 above the fy2001 maximum of 3750 the 16 billion increase in appropria tions originally was thought to be sufficient to pay for the increased ma ximum awards see hrept 107229 p 7 and srept 10784 p 313 pell gr ant appropriations are available for 2 full fiscalhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31003crs35 years but generally go to fund awards for the school year that begins near the end of the initial fiscal year for example th fy2002 appropriations w ill be available from october 1 2001 through september 30 2003 but for the most part these funds will be used to meet the estimated prog ram costs for the academic year 20022003 in an october 30 2001 letter from omb th administration indicated that the level of pell grant funding proposed for fy2002 might be sufficient only to continue the previous maximum award level of 3750 the reason given was that new projections of program costs for fy2001 for academic year 20012002 were exceeding previous estimates thereby cr eating the potential for an fy2001 funding shortfall if such shor tfall actually occurs part of the fy2002 appropriations would then be used to cover the fy2001 shortfall consequently any funds so used would be unavailable for fy2002 expenditures since the conference agreement specifies the 4000 maximum and according to current omb estimates provides insufficient funds to pay full program costs ed has two alternative courses of action 1 request an fy2002 supplemental appropriation to fund the full 4000 maximum or 2 pay the 4000 maximum by borrowing when necessary from the subsequent fy2003 appropriation to cover any fy2002 shortfall that might occur idea part b grants to states the idea is the major federal program providing assistance to states and school districts to help them fulfill their constitutional obligation to provide free appropriate public ducation to children with disabilities in 1975 the congress aut horized state payments up to maximum amount of 40 of the national averag perpupil expenditure appe times the number of children with disabilities ages 3 and above that each state serves the rationale for this formula was the assumption that the education of children with disabilities cost twice the national appe 100 more than the average child and the maximum federal share of the extr cost would be 40 appropriations have never been sufficient to reach the 40 level some view this deficiency as promise made that has not yet been kept achi eving the 40 funding level for fy2002 for part b grants would take an estimated 182 billion whereas the fy2002 appropriation is 75 billion th equivalent of 165 of the current appe times the number of children served an add itional appropriation of 107 billion would be necessary to provide the 40 authorized maximum for fy2002 in addition funding requirements for maximum grants are likely to grow in the future as increases are anticipated for both the appe and the number of children with disabilities served the latter may increase in part as result of medical advances that have resulted in more medically fragile child ren surviving to school age and requiring relatively more expensive services to attend school nd benefit from public education for additional informati on see crs report 97433 individuals with disabilities education act full funding of state formula forward funding and advance appropriations many of the larger ed programs have either aut horization or appropr iations provisions that allow funding flexibility for school program years that di ffer from the federal fiscal year for example some of the elementary and s econdary education formula grant programs receive funding through appr opriations that become available for obligation to the states on july 1 of the same year as the appropriations and rema in available through the end of the following fiscal year that is fy2001 appropriations for some programs became available for obligation to the states on july 1 20 01 and willhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31003crs36 remain available for 15month period until september 30 2002 this budgetary procedure is popularly known as for ward or multiyear funding and is accomplished through funding provisions in the lhhsed appropriations bill forward funding in the case of elementary nd secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time fo r school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year for pell grants however aggregate program costs for individual students pplying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support pell grants dur ing the following academic year that is the fy2001 appropriations support the 2001 2002 academic year unlike forward funded programs however the funds remain available for obligation for 2 full fiscal years thus if cost estimates turn out to be too low funds may be borrowed from the following years appropriations or conve rsely if the estimates are too high the surplus may be obligated during the following year an advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for wh ich the appropriation was enacted in the case of fy2001 appropriations funds norma lly would have become available october 1 2000 under regular funding provisi ons but would not become available until july 1 2001 under the forward funding provisions discusse d above however if the july 1 2001 forward funding date we re to be postponed for obligation by 3 months until october 1 2001 th appropriation would be cl assified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in the next fiscal year fy2002 for example the fy2001 appropria tion was 86 billion for title i part grants to leas for the education of th disadvantaged this amount included not only forward funding of 18 billion availa ble july 1 2001 but also an advance appropriation of 68 billion available october 1 2001 what is the impact of these changes in funding provisions at the program or service level relatively little is changed by the 3month delay in the availability of funds since most expenditures for standa rd school year occur after october 1 at the appropriations level however significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year and is therefore fully included in the current 302b allocation for discretionary ppropriations under federal budget scorekeeping rules an adva nce appropriation is not counted in the 302b allocation until the following year in essence 3month change from forward funding to an advance appropr iation for part or all of the annual appropriations for given program allows onetime shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discre tionary appropriations for additional information on budget enforcement procedures see crs report
