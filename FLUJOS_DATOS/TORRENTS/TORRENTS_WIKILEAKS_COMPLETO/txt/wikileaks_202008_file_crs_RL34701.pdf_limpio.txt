the former yugoslav republic of macedonia fyrom2 the allies issued invitations to join the alliance to albani and croatia greece bl ocked an invitation to macedonia because of dispute over m acedonias name the invitations initiate the third round of enlargement in the postcold war era in 1997 nato invited poland the czech republic and hungary to join the alliance they were admitted in 1999 in 2002 the allies invited bulgaria romania lithuania latvia estonia slovenia and slovakia to join the allian ce they were admitted in 2004 these last two rounds of enlargement were strateg ic in the sense that the new members territory lay in regions that russia once deemed critical to its own national interest and in the sense that the region had been intensely involved in conflict for much of modern european history in addition veral of these countries are sizeable with considerable armed forces and significant resources albania and croatia are sm all countries with corre spondingly small militaries croatia was part of the former yugoslavia communist state that kept the soviet union at arms length and had reasonably fri endly relations with the west albania also once communist state during the cold war was for many years the most isolated country in europe with the colla pse of yugoslavia and the end of the cold war the countries put themselves on th path to democracy and made commitments to join western institutions the two countri have aspirations to join the european union as well as nato albania and croatia in the sense of their military importance and their general resources w ould not represent strategic presence in the alliance although their consistent contributions to nato operations have been lauded however due to the continuing instability in the region further stirred by serbias and russias sharply negative r eaction to kosovos independence the two countries are potential factor for st abilization in southeastern europe today natos purpose extends

developed collective security mission ch as its stabilization and peacekeeping operation in kosovo several allied govern ments believe that the overa ll pace of nato enlargement is too compressed and wish to consider first how to resolve complex range of issues these governments tend to argue that other issues the calming of nationalist emotions in serbia an overall improvement in natorussian relations and coming to grips with the wideranging problems in energy security must first be resolved before considerin g new countries for membership3 process the washington treaty of 1949 natos founding instrument does not describe detailed qualifications for membersh ip it does require that member states be democracies and follow the rule of law it also requires that they take steps to strengthen their militaries and refrain from the use of force in settling disputes outside the treaty framework article x of the treaty leaves the door open to any states able to meet the general qualifications for membership including contribution to the security of member st ates the process by which governments interested in membership may join has been refined since the end of the cold war in 1994 nato established the partnership for peace pfp program in which non member states might train with nato forces participate in peacekeeping or other allied activities and ek avenues to draw closer to the alliance some countries such as austria participate in the pfp program but are not necessarily interested in membership in 1995 nato published study on nato enlargement 4 the report remains the most detailed public roadmap for governments wishing to enter nato it describes the need for candidate states to develop democratic st ructures and market economy respect human rights and the ri ghts of ethnic minorities and build military capable of contributing to coll ective defense in the 1995 study nato included other requirements principally the need to settle all disputes such as border demarcations with neighboring countries the balk an conflicts of the 1990s gave this requirement special sign ificance with the collaps of the soviet union nato has also become collective security as well as collective defense organization prospective members must develop military forces trained for peacekeeping and statebuilding as well as for collective

for prospective members this process called the membership action plan map lays out in considerable detail specific steps that government must follow to become member such steps might include laws designating its parliament as having civilian oversight of the military or the downsiz ing and professionaliz ation of large military or the settlement of border dispute with neighbor each countrys map is classified as is its evaluation by the allies during the 20032004 round of enlargement the map was made available to the united states senate for review some allies have criticized the map proce ss they contend that it is primarily creation of the united states and that the ultimate decision on whether map requirements are met is made principally in washington they say for example that the full range of qualifications outlined in the map in the 2003 round of enlargement was not adequately ssessed for several states that became members of the alliance they contend therefore that designation of candidate states as prospective members is above all political process and that actual accomplishment of requirements is secondary to the will of the alliances leader us officials dispute this characterization5 for candidate state to have been invited to join the alliance at bucharest consensus among the 26 member govern ments was necessary to approve an invitation each candidate wa s considered separately on or more votes against state would have blocked that states prog ress to the next stage in the process of becoming member it was greeces opposition to macedonia that resulted in skopjes failure to obtain an invitati on in march 2008 greek prime minister karamanlis said solution invitation6 there were other issues under discussion as well according to some officials in allied states albania and macedonia continue to have problems of governance and issues detrimental to internal political comity at the same time the two governments have evidently made considerable progress in military refo rm and their popula tions overwhelmingly support nato membership croatia has settled political environment somewhat narrow majority of its popul ation supports

defense reforms and ability to contribute to allied missions and albanias role in its region however natos decision on albanias candidacy was in the end political judgment of nato member states on whether albanias membership would contribute to their security domestic reforms m s t observers believe that the main challenges to albanias candidacy are questions about the pace of its political

although albanias record has gradually improved us and eu leaders have often called on albanias leaders to show greater civility in their political struggles and to work together to prepare the country for euroatlantic integration14 aside from the issue of political civility albania has significant legal and institutional shortcomings two key issues cited by us nato and albanian leaders themselves are electoral reform and judicial reform15 the albanian parliament is drafting new legislation on these issues but progress has been slow moreover observers note that passing laws is one thing implementing them effectively is another other albanian reform efforts have focused on fighting organized crime and corruption perhaps among the most serious challenges the country faces some of

nato candidacy croatia has been conducting membership negotiations with the european union since october 2005 in its november 2007 progress report on croatia s candidacy the european commission found

support for nato membership public support has been identified as perhaps the biggest weakne ss of croatias membership candidacy public opinion polls from early 2008 show ed support for nato membership barely exceeding 50 of the population despite ac tive efforts of the croatian government to boost public awareness of the benefits of nato member ship after an attack by serbian mob on the croatian embassy in belgrade following kosovos declaration of independence from serbia in february 2008 this figure increased to over 60 those opposing nato membership believe that it would engage croatia in international conflicts against its will and that nato will demand bases in croatia through continuing public relations effort s the croatian gove rnment has tried to allay these fears and

informally agreed that the methodologies and assumptions used to estima costs and cost sharing arrangements in prior rounds of enlargement were still va lid and that the addition of new members in

map thenpresident putin reacted harshly to natos pledge of eventual membership for georgia and ukraine on april 16 2008 he directed his government to establish broad range of cooperative ties with abkhazia and south ossetia both georgia and nato protested these russi an moves as undermining georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity ge orgian foreign minister davit bakradze warned that russia would do everything over the subsequent months to destabilize georgia in the expectation that the foreign ministers would then balk at map for georgia65 tensions increased between russia and georgia in the months following the bucharest summit when some unmanned aerial vehicles used by georgia for reconnaissance were shot down over abkhazia russia boosted the number of peacekeepers in abkhazia to 3000 and on several occasions south ossetian and georgian forces exchanged gunfire that resulted in casualties after such exchanges intensified in early august 2008 georgia reported that it was forced to move its troops into south ossetia to quell the gunfire whether by design or in response russian military forces swept into south ssetia and abkhazia nd then into large swaths of surrounding georgian territory soon after ceasefire was mediated by the eu on august 1415 russia recognized th independence of abkhazia and south ossetia russia also announced that it was suspending

republic as lying within its sphere of influence in which western countries and institutions should play little role nato as military alliance is viewed with particular suspicion on february 14 2008 in response to question about po ssible ukrainian membership in nato thenpresident putin warned that russia might be forced to take military countermeasures including aiming missiles ag ainst ukraine if kiev hosted foreign bases or joined the us missile defense project67 according to russian press accounts putin reportedly told president bush and nato leaders at the nato russia summit that ukraine was not real state given its regional heterogeneity and that ukraine would cease to exist if it joined nato on april 8 russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said russia woul d do all that it could do to prevent nato membership for ukraine on april 11 ch ief of the russian ge neral staff general yuriy baluyevsky warned that russia would take military and other measures if ukraine joined nato68 in addition to changes in its military postu re russia could react in several other ways to the prospect of nato membership for ukraine judging by moscows past conduct in the region particular ly its conflict with georgia it could try to stir up regional conflicts between eastern and west ern ukraine russia could encourage pro russian groups to intensify antinato campaig ns and stir up conflict by pushing for use of russian as an official language in eastern and southern ukraine russia could even encourage those favoring more aut onomy for these regions or even their separation from ukraine partic ularly in the case of the cr imean peninsula it should be noted however that such tactics have not always worked as moscow expected indeed they have sometimes produced backlash among the large majority of ukrainians who favor the countrys s overeignty and terr itorial integrity russia could also exploit close economic ties between the two countries as it did in january 2006 russia could cut off natu ral gas supplies to ukraine or sharply increase the price it charges russia coul d also cut off or hinder other trade with ukraine or make life difficult for the many ukranian labor migrants in russia russia has used similar tactics in disputes with moldova and georgia both of which have sought closer ties with the eu or nato or both in any case russian ability and desire to punish

states poland and other countries in central eur ope many observers believe that this outcome may be less likely due to the particular sensitivity of ukraine to russians many of whom believe the c ountry should be closely tied to russia as much of it has been from the 17th century until 1991 in addition many observers note that russias foreign policy has been more assertive in recent years as high revenues from energy exports have improved its in ternal and external finances moreover the russian government has used antinato and anti us rhetoric to shore up its domestic support in his september 10 2008 testimony on the accession of albania and croatia before the senate foreign relations committee secretary fried stated that nato has unfinished business in ge orgia and ukraine neither nation is ready for nato membership now the question is whethe r these countries should have the same prospects to meet natos terms for member ship as other european nations this is why the united states supports approvi ng both countries entry into natos membership action plan69 in his statement secretary fried also noted that we seek good relations with russia we take into account russias security concerns but we also take account of the concerns and aspirations of people who live in the countries around russia free people have the right to choose their own path70 other countries in addition to georgia and ukraine othe r countries that currently participate in the partnership for peace program could seek full membership in nato in the future in the western balkan

energy cutoffs before movi ng closer to states such as georgia and ukraine that are vulnerable to moscows energy politics76 russias august 2008 invasion of georgian territory and subs equent recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia have heightened calls among alliance members to slow nato enlargement in favor of focusing on improving nato russia relations proponents of this view tend to argue that while desirable nato enlargement should not come at the cost of jeopardizing russian coope ration with alliance member s on priority issues such as the iranian nuclear program and trade and energy issues critics and administration officials respond that the allia nce must continue to seek constructive relations with russia but that russia s hould not be granted what would amount to facto

policies the august 2008 conflict between russia nd georgia has also led to renewed discussion within nato over the alliances collective defense clause enshrined in article 5 of the north atlantic treaty article 5 considered by most to be the defining feature of the alliance obligates allies to defend against an armed attack on nato soil observers disagree as to wh ether russia would have invaded georgian territory had georgia been nato member and as to how nato would have responded in the case of such an event however the c onflict has provoked more serious consideration both of the possibility of armed conflict between nato and russia and of natos willingness to respond in the event of similar attack on nato ally the baltic states and poland have voiced particular concern regarding the credibility of article 5 as guarantor of collective defense debate over article 5 stands to intensify as nato considers fu rther enlargement within areas considered by russia as falling within its traditional sphere of influence and as russia seeks to exert influence in these areas conclusion most allies seem to believe that although albanias and croatias militaries and resources are modest both c ountries road to membership in the alliance could lead to greater stability in southeastern europe especially given the independence of kosovo and the enduring hostility to nato of important political f actions in serbia additionally the united states and several other leading governments in the alliance expect new member states to develop niche capabilities to contribute to nato operations around the world more broadly us officials continue to view nato as the primary institutional mechanism to ensure transatlantic security they argue that although natos primary purpose is th defense of its members the alliance has become force for peace throughout europe80 nato is facing current and future challenges that may shape any following rounds of enlargement an ongoing st rategic concern of the alliance is the stabilization of afghanistan which has become the alliances most important mission in addition nato faces other issu such as global terrorism cyber attacks and strategically two of the most important energy security and relations with russia gazprom russias national energy company has been making strong efforts to control parts of europes il and natural gas distribution network even without such control much of europe and the caucasus depend upon russia for portions of their energy supply gazprom s repeated supply disruptions to customer countries underscore stark reality russia can cut off vital lifeline if it so desires countermeasures new pipelines skirting russia and drawing supplies from range of sources and conservation will require years
