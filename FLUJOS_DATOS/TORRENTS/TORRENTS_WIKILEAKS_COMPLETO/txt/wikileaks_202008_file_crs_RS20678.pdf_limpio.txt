74 more sweeping in its criminal provisions and more modest in its grant provisions has also been proposed in both alternatives the newly establishe d federal offenses ta ke two forms and are based on congress legisla tive authority under the commerce clause the legislative sections of the thirteenth fourteenth nd fifteenth amendment one species outlaws hate crimes committed on the ba sis of race color relig ion national origin gender sexual orientation or disa bility under various commerce clause circumstances and appears consistent with the s upreme courts pronouncements in lopez and morrison the other forbids hate crimes committed on the ba sis of race color religion or national origin although its claim to congressiona l authority seems strongest when based on the thirteenth amendment and proscribin g violence committed on the basis of race its hold appears otherwise more tenuous this report is an abridged version of crs report rl30681 hate crimes summary of selected

update introduction s 625 the local law enforcement enhancement act of 2001 introduced by senator kennedy on march 27 2001 has 50 cos ponsors its companion in the house hr 1343 the local law enforcement hate crimes prevention act of 2001 introduced by representative conyers has over 180 cosponsor s they are virtually identical to thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20678crs2 kennedy hate crime amendm ent amend 3473 to the nati onal defense authorization act for fiscal year 2001 hr 4205 which passed the nate during the 106th congress but was dropped from the bill prior to final enactment representative jacksonlee has offered an alternative proposal hr 74 th hate crimes preventi on act of 2001 which closely resembles her offering in the 106th congress hr 77 second alternative from the 106th congress senator hatch s s 1406 has as yet not been proposed in this congress overview of proposals new crimes s625hr1343 creates two federa l crimes both outlaw willfully causing physical injuries using fire fir earms or bombs or attempting to do so motivated by certain victim characteristics whether real or perceived offenders are subject to imprisonment for not more than 10 years or for any term of years or life if the crime involves attempted murd er kidnapping attempted kidna pping rape or attempted rape the two offenses differ in that the first applies to crimes motivated by the victims race color religion or nationa l origin and contains other explicit federal jurisdictional element the second applies to crimes motivated by the victims gender sexual orientation disability race co lor religion or national orig in and contains series of alternative jurisdictional elements of commerce clause stripe federal prosecution of either offense would require cer tification of senior department of justice official that state or local offici als are unable or unwilling to pros ecute favor federal prosecution or have prosecuted to result that leaves fede ral interest in eradicating biasmotivated violence unvindicated hr 74 would estab lish the same two offenses but has certification requirement hate statistics the companion bills and hr 74 add gender to the list of predicate characteristics for hate crime statistical collection purposes section 280003a of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 assistance to local law enforcement unlike hr 74 the companion bills each call for the justice department to assist state and tribal law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute violent felonious hate crimes motivated by animosity towards those of the victims race color religion nationa l origin gender sexual orientati on disability or other characteristic found in the states or tribes hate crime law they insist that priority be given to cases in fiscally strapped rural ju risdictions and to cases involving multistate offenders grants each of the proposals features gr ant program to help the states combat hate crimes committed by juveniles authorizing such appr opriations as are necessary s 625 hr 1343 calls for an additional extraordin ary grant program available to the states and tribes to address investigative and prosecutorial n eeds that cannot otherwise be met the bills authorize appropriations of 5 million for each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003 but individual grant may not exceed 100000 per year sentencing guidelines each proposal instructs the sentencing co mmission to study and make any appropriate adjustments in th federal sentencing guidelines concerning adult recruitment of juveniles to commit hate crimes consistent with the other federal sentencing guidelines and be ing sure to avoid duplicationhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20678crs3 legislative powers of congress commerce clause congress enjoys only those legislative powers that flow from the constitution usconst amends ix x the commerce clause section 5 of the fourteenth amendment and section 2 of the thirteenth amendment and fifteenth amendment are the grants of power most often mentioned when discussing congress authority to proscribe hate cr imes and to enact other forms of civil rights legislation under the commerce clause congress is empowered to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states and with the indian tribes usconst arti 8 cl3 the supreme court in lopez and morrison identified the three ways in which congress may exercise its prerogatives under the cl ause first congress may regulate the use of the channels of inters tate commerce second congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce or persons or things in interstate commerce even though the th reat may come only fro m intrastate activities finally congress commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having substantial relation to interstate commerce ie those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce this last category the affects intersta commerce category can sometimes be the most difficult to define for it may embrace what appears to be purely intrastate activity morrison cited with approval the signposts of this aspect of the commerce power that lopez sought in vain when examining the gunfree schools act 18 usc 922q1a first the statute had not hing to do with commerce or any sort of economic enterprise however broadly one might define those terms second the statute contained express jurisdictiona l element which might limit its reach to discrete set of firear m possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce third neither the statute nor its legislative history contains express congressiona l findings regarding the eff ects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in school zone finally the link betw een gun possession in school zone and commerce interest urged by the g overnment the cost of violent crime and damage to national productivity caused by vi olent crime was too ttenuated without more to support claim to commerce clause authority in this last regard morrison observed we accordingly reject the argument that congress may regulate nonecono mic violent criminal conduct based solely on that conducts aggregate effect on interstate commerce the constitution requires distinction between what is tr uly national and what is truly local the regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities channels or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the states the hate crime proposals present two some what different claims to commerce clause power first they create federa l crime for which an aspect of interstate commerce is an element ie in the case of hr 74 either that in connection with the offense the defendant or the victim travels in interstate commerce or foreign commerce uses facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce or engages in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce or b the offense is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce and in the case of s 625hr 1343 either that 1 the offense occurs during the course of or as result of the travel of the defendant or the victim either across state line or nationa l border or b using channel facilityhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20678crs4 or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce or 2 the defendant uses channel facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce in the commission of the offense or 3 in connection with the offens the defendant employ s firearm explosive or incendiary device or other weapon that has traveled in in terstate or foreign commerce or 4 the offense either interferes with commercial or other economic activity in which the victim is engaged at the time of th conduct or b otherw ise affects interstate or foreign commerce then they create second federal crime whose claim to commerce clause nexus must be more inferential tied to the finding s and the general nature and consequences of hate crimes morrison suggests that the findings and general nature of the offenses involved are likely to be insufficient to support an ssertion that the commerce clause empowers congress to enact the provisions morrison rejected virtually the same argument with respect to statute creating civil remedy for the victims of gendermotivated violence its success here would seem to depend on c onvincing the court that racemotivated or colormotivated or religionmotivated or national originmotivated violence are somehow more commercially influential than gendermotivated violence brighter seem the prospects for judicial conclusion that the offenses that come with commerceexplicit elements come within congress commerce clause powers they have the distinct advantage of precluding convi ction unless the prosecution can convince the courts of the statutory nexus between the defendants conduc t and the commerce impacting element of the offense moreover several of the elements involve preventing the channels of commerce from becoming the avenues of destructive misconduct or protecting the flow of commerce from destructive ingredients the mark of circumstances that indisputably fall with in congress authority under the commerce clause section 5 of the fourteenth amendment where the proposals seem beyond congress reach under the commerce clause they may be within the scope of other legislative powers such as the legislative clauses of the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendments morrison addresses the breadth of congress legislative power under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment the amendment guar antees certain civil rights often by forbidding state or federal interference under section 5 the congress is vested with power to enforce by appropriate legislation the amendments provisions morrison pointed out that united states v harris held that section 5 did not vest congress with the power to enact statute directed exclusively against the action of private persons without referen ce to the laws of the state or their administration by her officers and in civil rights cases we held that the public accommodation provisions of the civil rights act of 1875 which applie d to purely private conduct were beyond the scope of the 5 enforcement power the fo rce of the doctrine of stare decisis behind these decisions stems not only from the leng th of time they have been on the books but also from the insight attributable to the members of the court at that time who obviously had intimate knowledg and familiarity with the events surrounding the adoption of the fourteenth amendment the statute in morrison created cause of action against private individuals who perpetrated gendermotivated violence enacted in the face of evidence that the states oftenhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20678crs5 failed to adequately i nvestigate and prosecute such crime s the authority under section 5 however extends only to state action including the enactment of remedy corrective in its character adapted to counteract and re dress the operation of such prohibited state laws or proceedings of state officers the morrison statute rested on the wrong side of the divide for its remedy fell not upon wa yward state officials but upon private individuals the hate crime pr oposals seem perilously comparab at best they address private misconduct not the ficiencies of state action section 2 of the thirteen amendment the companion bills and hr 74 each stake claim to the legislative authority in secti on 2 of the thirteen amendment within their findings the civil rights cases considered so instructive with respect to congressional powers under the fourteenth amendment also afforded the court its first opportunity to construe section 2 of the thirteenth ame ndment unlike the fourteenth it speaks not of state action but declares neither sl avery nor involuntary servitude except as punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states or any place subject to their jurisdiction usconst amend x iii 1 it finishes with the stipulation that congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legi slation usconst amend x iii 2 the civil rights cases observed that section 2 clothe s congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the united states this power it concluded however reached those fundamental rights which appertain to the essence of citizensh ip and but not the social rights access lodging transportation and entertainment that congress had by statute endeavored to protect from racial discrimination the court said little of section 2 for nearly century thereafter until jones v alfred h mayer co which found that congress might ban r acial discrimination from real estate transactions under the section almost in passing jones dismissed without repudiating the social rights distinction whatever the present validity of the position taken by the majority on that issuea question rendered largely academic by title ii of the civil rights act of 1964 78 stat 243 see heart of atlanta motel v united states 379 us 241 katzenbach v mcclung 379 us 294 confirming the titles validity as an exercise of commerce clause powerwe note that the entire court agreed upon at least one proposition the thirteen amendment authoriz congress not only to outlaw all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but also to eradicate the last ve stiges and incidents of society half slave and half free by securi ng to all citizens of every race and color the same right to make and enforce contracts to sue be parties give evidence and to inherit purchase lease sell and convey property as is enjoyed by white citizens three years later in griffin the court confirmed that 42 usc 19853relating to conspiracies in deprivation of the rights of citizenship was within the scope of section 2 authority griffin opined that not only may congress impose such liability but the varieties of private conduct that it may make criminally punishable or civilly remediable extend far beyond the actual imposition of sl avery or involuntary servitude by the thirteenth amendment we commit ourselves as nation to the proposition that the former slaves and their des cendants should be forever free to keep that promise congress has the power under the thirteenth amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and incidents of slavery and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation we can only c onclude that congress as wholly within itshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrs20678crs6 powers under 2 of the thirteen amendment in creating statutory cause of action for negro citizens who have been the victims of conspiratorial racially discriminatory private action aimed at depriving them of the basis rights that the law secures to all free men 403 us at 105 section 2 envisions legislation for the bene fit of those who bore the burdens slavery and their descendants race color but does it contemplate wider range of beneficiaries eg religion national origin the hate crime proposals would have encloaked groups subject to classification by r ace color religion or national origin in construing the civil rights statutes enacted contemporaneously with the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth amendment the supreme court he ld that arabs and jews would have been considered distinct races at the time th statutes were passed and the amendments drafted debated and ratified whether this would be considered sufficient to embrace all religious discrimination is nother question would roman ca tholics or methodists for example have been considered distinct races even in the nineteenth century of course even this expansion of benefici aries does not ensure that the court would consider violence badge or incident of sl avery although commen ting on its irrelevancy in light of congress use of commerce clause even jones did not go so far as to reject the fundamental versus the social rights distinction of the civil rights cases perhaps more to the point the anxiety of morrison and lopez lest an overly generous commerce clause construction swallow all state criminal jurisdiction over violence might argue against the prospect of the court embraci ng violence as badge or in cident of slavery for purposes of congress legislative au thority under section 2 of the thirteenth amendment
