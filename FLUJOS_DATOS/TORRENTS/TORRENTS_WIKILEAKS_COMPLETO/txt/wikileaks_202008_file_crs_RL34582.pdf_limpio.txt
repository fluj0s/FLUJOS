bretton woods international monetary system in 1973 the real exchange rate of the dollar has been largely determined by the market the supply and demand for dollars in global fo reign exchange markets dollars are demanded by foreigners to buy dollar denominated goods and assets assets include bank accounts stocks bonds and real property dollars are supplied to the foreign exchange markets by americans in exchange for foreign currencies to buy foreign currency denominated goods and assets in most circumstances however there is strong expectation that asset market transactions will tend to be dominant and ultimately dictate the exchange rates actual direction of movement this dominance is the result of asset market transactions occurring on scale and at speed that greatly exceeds what occurs with goods market transactions variety of factors can influence the si ze and direction of crossborder asset flows of principal importance are the rate of return on the asset investor expectations about currencys future path the size of the asset market the need for currency diversification in i nvestors portfolios changes in the official holdings of foreign exchange reserves by central banks and the need for investment safe havens the weakening dollar has several effect s on the us economy these include increased net exports decreased purchasin g power rising commodity prices upward pressure on interest rates an elevated risk of dollar crisis reduction of external debt and possible undermining of th dollars reserve currency status given the importance of international asset markets in determining the dollars exchange rate policies aime d at influencing the demand and supply of dollar assets such as foreign exchange intervention m onetary policy and fiscal policy could potentially have the quickest and most substantial impact on the dollar nevertheless as long as the market driven exchange rate adjustment remains orderly most economists would

not been uniform against individual currencies however for ex ample it fell 45 against the euro 24 against the yen and 16 against the yuan these differing amounts of depreciation are partly reflection

countrys net exports of goods and services the capital account is tally of international pur chases and sales of assets and the capital account ba lance measures the country s net foreign investment if the capital account is in surplus foreigne rs are investing more in the united states then americans are investing abroad leading to net inflow of capital because every purchase of foreign g ood or asset requires the payment of domestic good or asset net flows in the current account and the capital account will be equal and offsetting therefore curre nt account deficit must be matched by an equal capital account surplus and cu rrent account surplus by capital account deficit the exchange rate adjusts to make this so since the mid1990s the united states s had growing trade deficit in goods transactions generating net increase in th supply of dollars on the foreign exchange markets thereby exerting downward pressure on the dollars exchange rate at the same time the united states has had an equalsized surplus in asset transactions generating net increase in the demand for dollars on the foreign exchange market thereby exerting upward pressure on the dollars exchange rate

perspective september 2005 pp 100104in most circumstances however there is strong expectation that asset market transactions will tend to be dominant and ultimately dictate the exchange rates actual direction of movement this dominance is the result of gross asset market transactions occurring on scale and at speed that greatly exceeds what occurs with goods market transactions electronic ex change makes most sset transfers nearly instantaneous and in most years us in ternational asset tran sactions were two to three times as large as what would be needed to simply finance that years trade deficit in 2007 the us capital account r ecords 12 trillion in purchases of foreign assets by us residents capital outflow and 19 trillion in purchases of us assets by foreign residents capital inflow so while the united states could have financed the 750 billion trade deficit in goods and services for 2007 simply by 750 billion sale of assets to foreigners us and foreign investors engaged in much larger volume of pure asset trading3 determinants of the size and direction of crossborder asset flows rate of return the demand for assets eg bank accounts stocks bonds and real property by foreigners will be strongly influenced by the expected rate of return on those assets when inflation rates are similar the level of nominal interest rates can be used as fairly reliable first approximation of the rate of return on assets that can be earned in particular country therefore differen ces in the level of interest rates between economies are likely to stimulate international capital flows as investors seek the highest rate of return fo r any given level of risk rates of return will be in fluenced by the general performance of the economy as gauged by its ability to sustain high ra of economic growth and low rate of inflation the fed s conduct of monetary policy will increase or decrease interest rates as it works to stabilize the economy whether countrys business cycle is synchronous or asynchronous with that of other economies will in fluence the relative level of interest rates between it and other economies in general these relatively shortterm interest rate fluctuations will tend to either attract or deter crossborder capital flows particularly in very liquid assets the rate of return advantage in the u s economy may be greater than the spread between market interest rates would sugg est however study by the imf that focused on both return to debt and equity capital for only publicly traded companies in the large industrial economies and th developing economies for the decade 1994 2003 found the rate of return in the us to have been about 86 as compared to g 7 average of about 24 and an emerging market average of about minus 474httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs4 nevertheless at this time slower us economic gr owth relative to other advanced economies and the feds lowering interest rates more aggressively than other central banks have probably significan tly narrowed the rate of return advantage of many dollar assets relative to what can be earned at similar risk in other advanced economies investor expectations about the future path of the dollar whether the exchange rate is expected to rise or fall in the future can figure prominently in the investors calculation of what she will actually earn from an investment denominated in nother currency even high nominal return would not be attractive if one expects the denominating currency to depreciate at similar or greater rate and erase all economic gain on the other hand if the exchange rate is expected to appreciate the realized gain would be greater than what the nominal interest rate alone would indicate and the sset looks more attractive if for example the dollar depreciated 4 to 5 annually for the next several years then the 3 to 5 average nominal interest rates currently attached to low risk us securities would at best offer the foreign investor an expected return of appr oximately zero nevertheless it is not apparent that i nvestors have been signifi cantly deterred by the dollars ongoing depreciation need for diversification of the investors portfolio the size of the stock of assets in pa rticular currency in investor portfolios can cause change in investor preferences and shifting of asset flows away from or toward assets in particular currency prudent investme nt practice counsels that the investors portfolio of asset holdings have not only an appropriate degree of diversification across asset types but also dive rsification across the currencies in which the assets are denominated moving from relatively undi versified investment portfolio to more diversified one spread s risk including exchange rate risk across wider spectrum of assets and reduces ove r exposure to any one asset therefore even if dollar assets offer high return if the accumulation has been large at some point foreign investors considering both ri sk and reward will decide that their portfolios share of dollar denominated ssets is large enough to improve the diversity of their portfolios investors will slow or halt their purchase of dollar assets how much pure diversification from dollar assets has occurred is difficult to determine nevertheless with over 8 trillion in dollar assets of all forms now in foreign investor portfolios th at continues to grow divers ification is likely to be significant factor governing the be havior of intern ational investors the size and liquidity of the asset market large asset markets such as those in the united states offer great variety of assets and high degree of liquidity this gives us asset markets the highly attractive attribute of being able to handle large inflow s and outflows of funds with only small impact on the price of the asse t recent imf estimates give sense of the relative size of the asset markets in the advanced economies those data show for example that in 2006 the us bond ma rket had total value of over 27 trillion with government bonds accounting for about 6 trillion of that while the euro area and japan had bond markets with total value of about 19 trillion and 9 trillion respectively in addition the us stock market has an estimated capitalized value ofhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs5 5 imf global financial stability report april 2008 6 bis working papers 218 october 2006nearly 17 trillion while the euro area and japans equity mark ets were estimated to have capitalized values of about 8 trillion and 5 trillion respectively5 good example of high liquidity is pr ovided by the market for us treasury securities which has been pa rticularly attractive to fore ign investors in recent years one indicator of how easily market can absorb large tr ansactions without changing the assets price is daily turnover the sum of total purchases and sales imf data show that in 2006 the us government securities markets d daily turnover of nearly 500 billi on by this criterion japan is distant second with 150 billion turnover in government secur ities per day additional evidence of the high liquidity of us government securities market is its small bidask spreads6 in recent years high liquidity has been an attractive feature for foreign central banks who have greatly increased their holdi ngs of foreign exchange reserves the same is true for petroleu m exporting countries who have needed to store tens of billions of dollars and also to have r eady access to those funds with minimal market disruption the precise magnitude of the attractive effect of market size on inflows of foreign capital is hard to determine but the persistence of large capital inflows to the united states despite already large foreign holdings of dollar asse ts offering modest interest differentials and the disproportionate share of essentially norisk and high liquidity us treasury securities in foreign holdings suggest the magnitude of flows attributable to the liquidity advantage of us asset markets is probably substantial nevertheless recent financial market turmoil in the united states has probably diminished hopefully temporarily some of the attractiven ess of the united states large and liquid asset markets seeking safe havens some investors may be willing to give up significan t amount of return if an economy offers them particularly low ri sk repository for their funds the united states with long history of stable g overnment steady economic growth and large and efficient financial markets can be exp ected to draw foreign capital for this reason the size of this effect is not easy to dete rmine but the disproportionate share of us treasury securities which are essentially without default risk in foreign holdings suggests that the magnitude of safehaven motivated flows is probably substantial exerting steady upward dema nd pressure on the dollar official holdings governments through their central banks also buy and sell international assets but most often for reasons apart from expected rate of return these socalled official purchases serve two objectives one th accumulation of reserve of foreign exchange denominated in readily exchangeab currencies such as the dollar provides safeguard against currency crises arising out of often volatile private capital flows this is most often device used by deve loping economies that periodically need tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs6 7 imf currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves march 31 2008 8 us department of the

increments of only 1 billion to 10 billion it is estimated that 3040 of the worldwide incr ease in foreign exchange reserves since 2000 are of dollar denominated assets 12 see crs report rs21951 the changing causes of the us trade deficit by marc labonte and gail makinenfinance short run balance of payments deficits and cannot fully depend on international capital markets for such finance in the wake of the asian financial crisis of 19971998 many emerging economies around the globe have over the last few years built up large stocks of foreign exchange reserves in large part denominated in dollars two official purchases are used to counter the impact of capital flows that would otherwise lead to unwanted changes in the countries exchange rates this is common practice for many east asian econo mies who buy and sell foreign assets to influence their exchange rates relative to the dollar and other major currencies to maintain the price attractiveness of their exports to the united states from 2002 to 2 007 the imf re ports that official holdings of foreign exchange reserves worldwide increased from bout 2 trillion to nearly 64 trillion the dollars status as the dominant international reserve currency has resulted in large portion of the accumulation being held in do llar denominated assets of the 4 trillion of official holdings whos currency composition in known nearly 26 trillion is in dollar assets7 in addition the us treasury reports that through 2007 13 trillion or 26 of the 5 trillion outstanding market able treasury securities were being held as foreign official reserves8 these large accumulations of dollar denominated assets in foreign official holdings have made foreign central banks im portant participants in us financial markets as well as in the wider us economy9 in recent years china has been high profile accumulator of interna tional assets to stabilize the exchange rate of the yuan relative to the dollar in 2007 china held foreign exchange reserves valued at more than 15 trillion10 an increase of nearly 12 trillion since 200211 foreign central banks still have strong incentives to continue accumula ting dollar assets12 how these determinants have interacted to affect the dollar the strength of net capital inflows the differen ce between inflows and outflows from the rest of the world is good indicator of the general path of the dollar for example during the period from 1996 to 2002 net capital inflows grew from about 150 billion to 570 billion and the dollar rose for the period from 2002 to 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs7 13 crs report rl32652 the 2004 corporate tax and fsceti bill the american jobs creation act of 2004 by david l brumbaugh growth in net capital inflow s flattened and the dollar depreciated in 2005 and 2006 net capital inflows regained strengt h reaching over 833 billion and the dollar appreciated moderately in 2007 net in flows fell to 657 billion and the dollar depreciated this overall pa ttern of net capital inflows is the consequence of the disparate paths of private capital flows and official capital flows since 2002 the net inflow of private fo reign capital to the united states has generally weakened see table 1 that net inflow fell from 460 billion in 2002 to 186 billion in 2004 in 2005 net private inflows rose to 498 billion but this strengthening was largely the onetime consequence of us companies moving reinvested earnings to the united states from abroad reducing capital outflows to take advantage of the significant tax incentives provided by the american jobs creation act of 200413 since 2005 net private capital inflows once again weakened falling to 268 billion in 2007 table 1 net capital inflows to the united states in billions of us dollars 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 total net inflows 416 570 546 585 777 833 657 net private inflows 393 460 295 186 498 356 268net official inflows 23 111 251 399 279 448 390 source crs report rl33274 and us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis the weakening of private capital inflow s since 2002 is in part the result of foreign investors reducing risk by diversifying their dollar saturated portfolios toward assets in other currencies particularly euro assets however since mid2006 slowing economic growth financial market turmoil the decrease of interest rates by the fed and the depreciating dollar itself have fu rther reduced the incentive to hold dollar assets this change in sentiment by foreign investors does not mean that they have actively dumped dollar assets rather it seems that foreig n investors have not added dollar assets as fast as they have added assets denominated in other currencies which exerts downward pressure on the dollar moving counter to the weakening of ne t private inflows however was large increase in the demand for dollar assets by fo reign central banks net official inflows increased from 23 billion in 2001 to 448 billion in 2006 this rapid buildup of official foreign exchange rese rves was largely the result of the central banks in china and several other asian econo mies aggressively accumulating dollar assets to stabilize their currencies exchange rates relative to the falling dollar in 2007 however net official inflows decreased to 390 billi on increased demand for dollar assets

transactions reflecting exports and imports of goods and services investment income earnings and payments and unilateral transferseffects of the weakening dollar smaller trade deficit the us trade deficit as tallied in the current account balance 14 increased steadily from 1992 to 2006 in 2007 however the trade imbalance decreased to 7386 billion from 8115 billion in 2006 this decrease was reflection of continued strong growth of exports sales up 182 billion or 126 over their level in 2006 and the continuing deceleration of import purchases advancing 1327 billion or 60 over their level in 2006 as per centage of gdp the 2007 trade deficit stood at 53 down from record size of 61 in 2006 source imf world economic outlook data base april 2008 edition in 2007 goods exports grew 123 continui ng pattern of rapid growth that began in 2004 in contrast goods impor ts grew only 55 in 2007 continuing pattern of deceleration fro m 17 annual pace in 2004 in 2007 net exports for the first time since 1995 made positive contri bution to the growth of real gdp accounting for about 27 of the 22 increas in real gdp r eal exports had been rising strongly since 2004 so the critical change in 2007 was substantial slowing of the growth of real imports this disparate performance of exports and imports reflects in part the emerging impact on trade flows of the 26 real depreciation of the dollar since 2002 that depreciation has improved the price competitiveness of us exports in foreign markets and deteriorated the price competitiv eness of foreign goods in us markets also contributing to this phenomenon was fa ster economic growth in japan and the euro area figure 2 current account deficit as of gdphttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs9 15 this was particularly true with respect to china and other asian trading partners whose currencies were effectively pegged to the dollar for much of this periodnevertheless 2007 imports were bout 24 trillion which was 700 billion more than 2007 exports of about 17 trillion therefore the growth of exports will have to substantially exceed that of imports for several years to erase the deficit in goods and services trade such reducti on might require furthe r depreciation of the dollar the last time substantial dollar depreciation and trade deficit adjustment happened was 19851991 at that time the trade deficit star ted to narrow within two years of the initial deprecia tion and fell from 35 of gdp to near balance by 1991 in the current episode the process has been much slower despite very large depreciation of the dollar several factors account for this slow response first the rapid shift in trade in recent years toward lowcost emerging economies has tended to erode us price competiveness and offset in part the competiveness improving effect of the depreciating dollar15 second up to 2006 the us economy was growing faster than other advanced economies tending to boost u s imports third oil prices have risen to historic highs increasing the trade defic its of oilimporting countries such as the united states fourth the size liquidity and stability of us asset markets made them particularly attractive destinati on for private investors and for official purchases by foreign central banks as the effect of these factors diminish economic theory suggests that the current account deficit may in bela ted response to the dollar depr eciation of the last several years begin to narrow significantly us purchasing power decreases the rising price of foreign goods caused by weakening of the dollar reduces the purchasing power of us consumers and businesses who purchase imports since early 2002 through 2007 the price index for imports increased about 32 as compared with an increase in the price index for overall gdp of about 16 that 32 rise in the average price of imports reflects both the effect of dollar depreciation and increases in the foreign currency pr ice of imports the price of imported commodities in particular have risen sharply in recent years but because most commodities are priced in dollars rising commodity prices are not the direct result of falling dollar however it is likely that dollar depreciation has had an indirect elevating effect on commodity prices see below for further discussion of the dollar commodity price linkage an appreciatin g currency serves to insulate the economy from such price increases while deprecia ting currency will tend to exacerbate their effect the magnitude of the effect of the weakening dollar on overall purchasing power is however muted by two factors first ri in the price of exports tends to enhance purchasing power and offset the purchasing power effect of increased import prices for this reason economists use the change in the ratio of export prices to import prices or what is called the terms of trade to calculate the change in us international purchasing power from the time the dollar began to depreciate in february of 2002httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs10 16 assuming their currency is not pegged to the dollarthrough april of 2008 us export prices rose but not by as much as import prices causing the us terms of trade to fall by about 9 see figure 3 second the impact of fall in the terms of trade on total purchasing power will be proportional to the relative importance of imports in gdp given that imports in recent years have accounted for about 16 of us gdp the 26 real depreciation of the dollar since 2002 s reduced overall us purchasing power by about 14 or by about 200 billion if the dollar continues to depreci ate further erosion of purchasing power will occur but this will likely be partially mitigated by imports becoming smaller share of us gdp source us department of commerce bureau of economic analysis commodity prices in dollars increase the fall of the dollar since early 2002 has coincided with large increases in co mmodity prices the price of gold has increased from about 300 per ounce to near 1000 per ounce the price of oil has increased from about 20 per barrel to near 140 dollars per barrel and the index of nonfuel commodity prices has risen bout 125 because most commodities in international markets are priced in dollars their prices to the us buyer are not directly affected by moveme nts of the exchange rate however the dollar does have an indir ect impact on commodity prices this indirect effect likely works through seve ral channels first dollar depreciation makes commodities usually priced in dollars less expensive16 in nondollar countries encouraging their demand to increase second falling dollar reduces the foreign currency yield on dollar denominated financial assets making commodities more attractive investment alternative to foreign investors third weakening dollar could induce stimulative monetary policy in othe r countries particularly those that peg their currencies to the dollar stimulative monetary policy tends to decrease interest rates which may stimulate foreign demand including that for commodities figure 3 us terms of trade 19852007 index 2000100httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs11 17 international monetary fund world economic outlook april 2008 pp 4850 18 most countries are not able to borrow in th eir own currency so fall of their exchange rate will tend to increase their net external debt this was problem that plagued the economies caught in the asian financial crisis in 1997 when their crashing currencies continueda recent imf analysis estimates that if the dollar had remained at its peak of early 2002 by the end of 2007 the price of gold would have been 250 per ounce lower the price of barrel of crude il would have been 25 barrel lower and nonfuel commodity prices w ould have been 12 lower17 other factors have also contributed to the rapid climb of commodity prices large increases in world industrial produc tion particularly in emerging asian economies have likely been factor pulling up commodity prices also falling interest rates in the united states have reduced the incentive for current extraction over future extraction and generally lowe red the cost of holding inventories dampening the supply response to higher commodity prices us interest rates could increase the major force behind the dollars fall since 2002 has been weakening of th demand for dollar denominated assets by private investors significant slowing of this capital inflow other things constant reduces the supply of loanable funds availa ble to the economy and tends to increase the price of those funds that is increase in terest rates re duced demand for dollar assets was likely contributor to the rise of us interest rates from 2004 through 2006 if the foreign demand for dollar assets continues to weaken as the us economy moves beyond the current economic slowdown and begins to grow at more typical pace revived demand for loanable funds is lik ely to lead to an increase in most us interest rates at that time the dual effects of decreasing inflow of capital falling dollar and rising interest rates could work to ch ange the composition of the economys output stimulating net exports and reducing domestic spending by dampening interest sensitive activities like business i nvestment and housing risi ng interest rates are the normal equilibrating mechanism that brings domestic investment in line with the smaller flow of saving availa ble to finance it in turn lower rate of investment slows the growth of the economys stock of productive capital and in theory leads to slower rate of growth of the economys productive capacity if there is an increase in the domestic saving rate to replace some portion of the diminished inflow of saving from abroad it is likely to moderate the rise in interest rates and lead to shift of the domestic spending reduction from investment to consumption net external debt is reduced depreciating dollar tends to improve the us net debt position this improvement is caused by fa vorable valuation effects on us foreign assets these occur because us foreign liab ilities are largely denominated in dollars but us foreign assets are largely denominated in foreign currencies therefore real depreciatio n of the dollar increases the value of us external assets and largely does not increase the value of us external liabilities this

imf global financial stability report world economic and financial surveys washington ap ril 2008 pp 7476 21 us department of the treasury foreign portfolio holdings of us securities washington april 2008 p 13exchange rate induced valuation effects are substantial because they apply to the entire stock of us foreign assets valu ed at about 14 trillion in 2006 the large scale of us foreign assets means that valuation changes can offset sizable portion of the current account deficit s annual addition to the existin g stock of external debt for example in 2006 the current account deficit made 81l4 billion contribution to us external debt but the total valu of net external debt in 2006 increased only about 300 billion due to an offset of over 500 billion over 60 nearly half of this offset was attributable to positive valuation effects on us foreign assets caused by the dollars depreciation that year19 the dollars reserve currency status threatened central bank holdings of reserve currency ssets have risen sharply in recent years these official holdings have nearly quadrupled si nce 1997 increasing from about 17 trillion to about 64 trillion by the end of 2007 nearly 5 trillion of this total is held by developing countries these large accumulati ons of reserves have been concentrated among countries with large global current acc ount surpluses china in particular through 2007 has official reserves that exceed 17 trillion in addition the oil exporting countries have increased their official reserves by about 700 billion20 the dollars status as the dominant international currency has meant that large share of this accumulation of foreign exchange is held as some form of dollar asset of the 4 trillion reserves of which the currency composition is known about 65 are in dollar assets euro deno minated assets have the sec ond largest share at about 25 the us treasury reports that through 2007 over 50 of the more than 4 trillion outstanding marketable treasury securities were being held in foreign official reserves21 for the united states there are significant benefits to issuing the worlds primary reserve currency central banks demand for the reserve currency tends not to be as volatile as that of private investors this stabilizes the demand for dollars and reduces the foreign exchange risk faced by us co mpanies in their international transactions exchange rate risk is also reduced becau the united states borrows in its own currency so that the appreciation of fo reign currencies against the dollar cannot increase debt service cost or raise default risk another major benefit of being the primary international reserve currency is that it enables the united states to borrow abroad at lower cost then it otherwise could this cost advantage occurs because there will be willingn ess of foreign central banks to pay liquidity premium to hold dollar assetshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs13 22 for further discussion of th is issue see crs report rl34083 the dollars future as the worlds reserve currency the challenge of the euro by craig k elwell also the dollars status as the world s reserve currency raises the likelihood of foreigners using us asset markets th is added foreign involvement increases the breadth and depth of these markets which th tends to attract even more investors which then continually magnifies the benefits of issuing the reserve currency however the prospect of substantial further depreciation of the dollar could erode the dollars ability to provide the important reserve currency function of being steady store of value foreign central banks may see the erosion of this function as growing disincentive for using dollars as thei r principal reserve currency in contrast the appreciation of the euro exchange rate and the substantial increase in the liquidity of the euro caused by the improvement in the breath and depth of euro area financial markets since 1999 raises the attractivene ss of the euro as reserve currency yet so far there appears to be only m odest diversification from dollar assets by foreign central banks the dollar share of official reserves reached peak value of about 72 in 2001 by 2003 that share fell to about 66 and has remained near this level through 2007 since its creation in 1999 the euros share of global official reserves rose from about 18 to 25 in 2003 but has remained near this level through 2007 however most of this dec line reflects passive valuation changes from the dollars depreciation rather than an active diversification away from dollar assets by foreign central banks despite the problem posed by the dolla rs ongoing depreciation the currency retains significant advantages the most important advantage is the size quality and stability of dollar asset markets particularly the shortterm government securities market where central banks tend to be most active the low risk and high liquidity of these financial markets make the dollar an excellent medium of exchange for foreign central banks further advantage is the power of inc umbency conferred by the important networkexternalities that accrue to the currency that is currently dominant together these factors will likely inhibit large or abrupt change in the dollars reserve currency status neverthe less further dollar depreciation could lead to more active movement away fro m dollar assets by central banks22 risk of dollar crisis while asset market trade offers opportunities to raise overall economic efficiency nd improve the economic welfare of borrower and lender alike trade in assets is prone to occasional mistakes the disorderly resolution of which can lead to crisis and collapse th negative repercussions of such collapse could extend beyond the asset ma rket to the wider economy the essential weakness of sset markets is that assets are claim on stream of earnings over time and the future is always uncertain this can mean that relatively small changes in investors beliefs about th at future could have large effects on the value of the asset historically this has tended to make these markets much more volatile than goods markets where value is generally far less contingent on the uncertainties of the future add to this the often observed tendency for herdlike behavior among investors particularly those focuse d on the short run and the volatility in asset markets can grow larger then add in leveraged purchases the inherent weakness of modern fractionalreserve banking exchange rate risk andhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs14 the usual problems of distan ce ie different language law and business practices and the potential for volatility and crisis becomes even larger there is precise demarcation of when falling dollar moves from being an orderly decline to being crisis but th depreciation would be significantly more rapid then the orderly fall that has already occurred the troubling characteristic of dollar crisis would be that this adjustment moves from orderly to disorderly due to precipitous decline in the willingness of investors to hold dollar assets causing sharp decrease in the price of those assets and an equally sharp increase in the interest rates attached to those assets the spike in interest rates would be large and abrupt shock to the us economy that would slow domestic spending more quickly than the falling dollar can stimulate net exports this negative impulse could cause overall economic activity to slow perh aps to the point of recession critical factor governing whether dollar depreciation is an orderly or disorderly adjustment is investor expectations bout future dollar depreciation rational expectations will have stabilizing effect on the size of international capital flows the rational forwardlooking investor w ill have some notion of what is the equilibrium exchange rate and whether the currency is currently overvalued or undervalued the investors exchange rate expectations will tend to be stabilizing if an increase in the exchange rate causes investors to reduce their expectation of the currencys future rate of change and increase their expectations of future depreciation of the currency such invest ors would tend to sell when the currency was high and buy when the currency was low which helps stabilizes the currencys fluctuation also such investors would onl hold assets that have expected yields high enough to compensate for the exp ected depreciation and also preserve competitive rate of return therefore if inve stors have realistic expectation that the dollar will depreciate 5 in the period ahead they would likely only be willing to hold dollar assets with yields above 5 in contrast sharp plunge of the dolla r is likely to occur if most investors do not form rational expectations about likely future depreciation of the dollar once investors come to realize that the dollar is falling at faster rate than they had expected there could be sudden attempt by large numbers of investors to sell their dollar assets but with many sellers and few buyers the exchange rate would fall precipitously along with the price of dollar assets before stabilizing some economists argue that foreign investors do not appear to have built rational expectation of future dollar depreciation into the nominal yields they are accepting to hold dollar assets the average nominal rate of return on lowrisk treasury securities is about 42 and the dollar has recently been falling on average at about 10 annual rate so that the ex post rate of return for foreigners has been negative if there is substantial probability that the dollar will continue to depreciate at nontrivial rate then th ere is risk of crisis if many holders of dollar ssets realize their expectations for dollar depreciation had been too low and try to move quickly out of dollar assets the ensuing stampede could potentially cause dollar crisis to sh ed dollar assets one needs to find buyer but in crisis environment this occurs only through tremendous bidding down of the price of the less desirable dollar assets this leads not only to sharply fallinghttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs15 23 for more discussion of this issue see crs report rl34311 dollar crisis prospect and implications by craig k elwellexchange rate but also to sharply rising interest rates in us financial markets lower asset prices translate into higher effective interest rates thus in dollar crisis two sharp negative impulses would be transmitted one sharply falling dollar would likely mean sharply rising euro and yen and lead to severe decreases in the export sales for these economies there would be positive impulses associated with falling dollar for the united states increased export sales in the united states and stimulus to interest sensitive sectors abroad in the dollar crash scenario however the negative impulses have more immediate effect and would not sufficiently offset soon nough to prevent recession in the united states europe and japan two sharply ri sing interest rates in the united states would dampen spending in interest sensitive sectors as well as reveal any lurking weaknesses in fi nancial markets the dollar of course has been depr eciating since 2002 and foreign investors have continued to hold dolla r assets for which the attached interest rate seems insufficient to compensate for that deprecia tion there has been dollar crisis this is perhaps explained in part by the large accumulation of dollar reserves by foreign central banks if foreign central banks have longer investment horizons then private investors they will tend to stabilize the mand for dollar assets in addition the sheer scale of earnings of oilexporting c ountries seeking place for liquid storage of wealth made it likely that large portion of those funds would flow to the united states 23 policies that could potentially influence the dollar policies to influence th demand for us assets given the importance of international asset markets in determining the dollars exchange rate policies aime d at influencing the demand and supply of dollar assets would potentially have the quickest and most substantial impact on the dollar foreign exchange market intervention this policy involves the federal reserve buying or selling foreign exchange in an attempt to influence the exchange rate this intervention will most often be sterilized intervention that alters the currency composition of the feds balance sh eet but does not change the size of the monetary base neutralizing any associ ated impact on the money supply to strengthen the dollar the fed could attemp t to boost the demand for dollars by selling some portion of its foreign exchange reserves in exchange for dollars sterilization in this case would require the fed to also purchase like value of domestic securities to offset the negative effect on the monetary base of its selling of foreign exchange reserves the problem with intervention is that the scale of the feds foreign exchange holdings is small relative to the size of global foreign exchange markets which have daily turnover of more than 3 trillion facing markets of this scale currency intervention by the fed would lik ely be insufficient to counter strong market trend away from dollar assets httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs16 24 if the european central bank were to also wer interest rates it would be possible for the dollar to strengthen despite low us intere st rates however the ecb initiated new tightening cycle on july 3 2008 so lowering interest rates soon does not seem likely coordinated intervention by the fed and other central banks would have greater chance of success because it can incr ease the scale of the intervention since 1985 there have been five coordinated in terventions the plaz accord of 1985 to weaken the dollar the louvre accord of 1987 to stop the dollars fall joint actions with japan in 1995 and 1998 to stabilize the yendollar exchange rate and g7 action in 2000 to support the newly introduced euro all but the louvre accord do correspond with turning points for the targeted currencies however these interventions were most often accompanied by change in monetary policy that was consistent with moving the currencies in the desired direction many economists argue that coordinated intervention in these circumstances played the useful role of signaling device helping overcome private investors uncertainty about the future direction of monetary policy and the direction the central banks want the currency to move but absent an accompanying change in monetary policy it is unlikely that even coordinated intervention would be successful at altering the exchange rates path if it were being strongly propelled by private capital flows monetary policy principal instrument for macroeconomic policy is the feds use of monetary policy monetary policy is the decision by policymakers to influence economic conditions by tightening or loosening credit conditions monetary tightening will tend to increase interest rates while monetary loosening will tend to decrease interest rates changing the level of interest rates also influences the dollars exchange rate contractionary monetary policy would tend to strengthen the dollar because higher interest rates by making dollar assets more attractive to foreign investors other things equal boosts the demand for the dollar in th foreign exchange market in contrast an expansionary monetary policy would tend to weaken the dollar because lower interest rates reduce the attractiveness of dollar assets in either case however it would be unprecedented for the fed to use m onetary policy to exclusively target the exchange rate but it could be the sideeff ect of policies aimed at slowing the economy to control inflation or stimulatin g the economy to forestall recession it is likely that the feds recent policy turn toward economic stimulus and lower interest rates has cont ributed to the depreciation while not an explicit target of this monetary policy the depreciation of the dollar does contribute to the feds stabilization goal by providing significant and timely boost to the economy by increasing net exports24 fiscal policy government choices about spending and taxing can also influence the exchange rate budget deficits tend to have stimulative effect on the economy however because the governme nt must borrow funds to finance budget deficit that policy also tends to increase interest rates this upward pressure on interest rates would be unlikely to occu r when the economy has significant economic slack such as in recession when the dema nd for funds is generally weak relative to the supply of funds other things equal higher interest rates will tend to increase the foreign demand for dollar denominated assets putting upward pressure on the exchange ratehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs17 25 other things would not be equal if there were sharp tightening of monetary policy or major changes in the economywide rates of saving and investment in the united states and abroad that would redirect capita l flows toward the united statesas the us economy gathers more momentum the interest rate elevating effects of budget deficits will be more evident over the nearterm foreign investors are likely to be attracted by these higher interest rates and increase their purchases of dollar assets tending to put upward pressu re on the dollar persistent large budget deficits however would likely degrade the longterm performance of the us economy by crowding out productive inves tment and slowing the pace of economic growth this deterioration would likely also reduce the longterm demand for dollar assets and exert downward pr essure on the dollar policies to influence th demand for us exports policies focused on increasing the foreig n demand for us goods and services would also tend to strengthen the dollar lower foreign trade barriers the continued existence of various trade barriers in many countries may keep the demand for us exports weaker than it otherwise would be if lowering those barriers significantly boosts the demand for us goods and services it would also exert some upward pressure on the dollar exchange rate it is difficult to judge how strong this upward pressure would be moreover this is not likely to be readily implementable policy tool and probably has little nearterm significance for the dollars exchange rate support for developmen t of new products if the us has goods and services that are strongly in demand in the rest of the world there will be some upward pressure on the exchange rate economic theory suggests that the governments role in this process is to support those aspects of research and development that are likely to be underinvest ed in by the private market this type of policy would most likely have longrun imp lications and not have much effect on the nearterm value of the dollar will the dollar continue to depreciate forecasting the path of the exchange rate is highly problematic as the weight of economic fundamentals on the dollar can be easily countered in the shortrun by sudden shifts in investor ntiment that are imperfectly understood however there are three reasons to think that investor s around the globe may actively reduce their exposure to dollar assets and thereby ex ert substantial downw ard pressure on the dollar25 first yields on high quality foreign bonds are higher than yields on similar us securities making investments in those currencies more attractive than dollar investments if us gdp growth is percei ved to be slower than in other advanced economies for the next few years the yiel d disadvantage of dollar assets could be prolonged second keeping the rapidly risi ng external debt to gdp ratio which is now at historical high of about 21 in realistic bounds will require large reduction of the us trade deficit eras ing the trade deficit is likely to require substantial real depreciation of the dollar therefore prudent investor is likely tohttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs18 26 how much further real depreciation of the dollar might be needed to reduce the current account balance to sustainable level the imf estimates that sustainable current account deficit is probably at least in the area of 3 of gdp also most economic studies indicate that narrowing of the ratio of the current account deficit to gdp by 1 percentage point would require real deprecia tion of 10 to 20 therefor given us current account deficit that is now 5 of gdp further real depreciation of at least 20 could be needed to reach sustainable current account balance if the adjustment is orderly and the dollar falls about 10 annually and allowing for lags in the response of trade flows this process take would likely take approximately two to three years see imf world economic outlook washington april 2008 pp 1822 and maurice obsfeld and kenneth rogoff global current account imbalances and the exchange rate adjustment brookings papers on economic activity 1 may 2005 pp 67123 include this trend of decline into the calculation of the expected return in their own currency of holding dollar denominated asse ts this expected depreciation makes the relative return on dollar assets even lower than the nominal interest differential further reducing the attractiveness of dollar denominated assets26 third for the next few years the us trade deficit although it might be falling w ill continue to add large volume of dollar assets to the portfolios of foreign investors this accumulation generates an increasing need for portfolio diversification into assets in other currencies the accumulation of reserves by foreign central banks is likely to be relatively stable and continue to exert some upward pressure on the dollar also the sizable liquidity advantages of us asset markets will likely continue to attract large inflow of earnings from the oilexporting countries adding more upward pressure on the dollar does the united states have dollar policy since the 1973 demise of the bretton woods fixed rate inte rnational monetary system the basic us dollar policy has been to let market forces determine the dollars value the change to floatin g currency freed the central bank from having to use monetary policy to maintain the fixed exchange rate eliminating the possibility of conflict between domestic stabilization goals and exchange rate targets that was recurring problem under the bretton woods system the macroeconomic tools of monetary and fiscal policy have the potential to strongly influence the value of the dollar ex change rate in practice however these strong policy instruments only rarely take the dollar as their primary concern the goals of strong and stable economic growth high employ ment and low inflation are usually the principal targets of macroeconomic policy the dollar will likely be influenced by such policy actions and its movement might well support achieving broader macroeconomic goals but particular level for the exchange rate is unlikely to be an explicit policy goal and most economists agree that it would be misguided to describe such indirect exchange rate effects as evidence of an explicit strong or weak dollar policy if faced with dollar crisis stabilizing the exchange rate may call for raising interest rates but that would intensify the pressures faced by domestic interesthttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl34582crs19 27 see for example imf how can existin g global current account imbalances be reduced world economic outlook washington septem ber 2005 pp 110116

however may call for lowering interest rates at the risk of intensifying the dollars depreciation global imbalances the dollar and economic policy the dollars exchange rate is only symptom of more fundamental economic forces particularly those that influence the demand for and supply of assets on the international financial markets currently an examination of those forces highlights large and potentially destabilizing imbalan ce in the global economy in the united states persistent large trade deficits and the accumulation of foreign debt and in the rest of the world large trade surpluses weak domestic demand and the accumulation of dollar denominated assets most economists would argue that this is condition that carries more than negligible risk of generating financial instability and global recession commonly asked policy question is how to facilitate an orderly correction of these imbalances that assures more stable exchange rates and leaves all the involved economies on sounder macroec onomic footing mainstream economic thinking27 suggests that this adjustment can be achieved by coordinated international policy response some salient elemen ts of which are likely to be raising the us national saving rate and reducing its trade deficit to sustainable size generating faster economic growth in japan and europe propelled primarily by domestic spending rather than net exports fostering recovery of domestic investment and reducing the outflow of domestic saving in asia excl uding japan and china and the oil exporting economies and having china and other surplus economies that fix their exchange rates to the dollar allow their currencies to appreciate and channel more of their savings into domestic spending over the long run three fundamental f actors will likely continue to support the international demand for the dollar first the basic economic performance of the us economy as measured by gdp growth pr oductivity advance and pace of innovation has for
