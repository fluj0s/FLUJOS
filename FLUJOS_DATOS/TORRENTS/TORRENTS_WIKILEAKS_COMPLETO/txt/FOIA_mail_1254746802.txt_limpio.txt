from michael mann mannmeteopsuedu to phil jones pjonesueaacuk subject re thanks and one question date mon 5 oct 2009 084642 0400 cc gavin schmidt gschmidtgissnasagov thanks phil i wondered where this completely false claim was coming with are these people really so clueless that they dont even understand that i have nothing to do with this whatsoever pretty much tells you everything you need to do i never acknowledge emails from people i dont know about topics that are in any way sensitive this is perfect example of something that goes right to the trash bin mike on oct 5 2009 at 555 am phil jones wrote gavin mike thanks for this i assume you are both aware of this prat neil craig see below keith wont be responding checking facts doesnt seem important these days as ca threads arent publications this is difficult for non scientists i am going further over one email i got at the weekend see also below typical of sonia although she now seems to only be an emeritus reader cheers

to 4kbriffaueaacuk mimeversion 10 contenttype multipartalternative boundary1254564004 xmailer 90 for windows sub 5045 professor briffa i have written couple of blogs on the current report by steve mcintyre that the data used by mann to prove the hockey stick was fabricated this the following days 5httpaplacetostandblogspotcom200910globalwarmingprovendeliberatefraudhtml as result i have received this email from somebody i am not aquainted with throwing the entire blame on you this seems improbable to possibly an alarmist damage limitation exercise if you wish to comment i would be happy for you to do so please note steve mcintyres post concerns work by climate scientist keith briffa and not michael mann you will probably wish to correct your post cheers avisame i have posted this as an update with my reply my understanding is that while briffa did the tree ring measurement mann in his paper chose to choose 12 atypical tree rings out of at least 34 to fabricate the global warming trend my assumption is that mann is responsible for fabrications in his own paper that this is damage limitation exercise i am open to correction on this indeed have emailed mr briffa to see neil craig you may be interested in my political blog 6httpaplacetostandblogspotcom we received this through our enquiries desk i assume that you are aware of this person including those copied on the message if we are to respond it would be to indicate that there are multiple sources of supporting evidence and that we continue to place our confidence in the international scientific assessment process this confidence has proven to be well placed roger _____________________________________________________________________ from sonja boehmerchristiansen 7sonjabchullacuk date 2 october 2009

re please take note of potetially serious allegations of scientific fraud by cru and met office dear stephanie i expect that great deal of ukcip work is based on the data provided by cru as does the work of the ipcc and of course uk climate policy some of this very fundamentally would now seem to be open to scientific challenge and may even face future legal enquiries it may be in the interest of ukcip to inform itself in good time and become little more uncertain about its policy advice perhaps you can comment on the following and pass the allegations made on to the relevant people it is beyond my expertise to assess the claims made but they would fit into my perception of the whole manmade global warming cum energy policy debate i know several of the people involved personally and have reason to doubt their sincerity and honour as scientists though i am also aware of their highly critical of ipcc science policy positions i could also let you have statements by steve mcintyre and ross mckitrick ross mckitrick currently teaches at westminister business school and who is fully informed about the relevant issues he recently addressed meeting of about 50 people in london best
