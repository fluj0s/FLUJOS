internal control systems interviews with staff analysis of applicable data and review of the available documents and other relevant records iv audit findings and recommendations review of implementing partners 10 for the four partners reviewed reasonable assurance could be taken that unhcr funds were properly accounted for and disbursed in accordance with the subproject agreements with the exception of minaloc oios ass essed that internal controls of most partners were generally in place and operating effe ctively 11 audit certificates covering the 2003 subp rojects were available for implementing partners with unqualified audit opinions expressed except for minaloc which had disclaimer of opinion due to various shortcomings including the lack of supporting documentation and various accounting discrepancies for 2004 audit certificates were available for any of the implementing partners eig ht months after the project liquidation date 12 given that most of the partners were inter national ngos with budgets over us 300000 the representation should arrange an exter nal audit of these partners locally according to iomfom 612003 dated 8 december 2003 an audit certificate per subproject or group of subprojects with the same internationa l ngo operating in the same country with projects totalling us 300000 or more is required and should be submitted by an independent auditing firm contracted by unhcr with in six months of the final date for liquidation of commitments the audit costs shou ld be borne by unhcr and budgeted under the direct implementation of unhcr 3 13 the representation stated that some of the implemen ting partners had submitted its audit certificates and these had been forwarded to the desk the representation also indicated that it would contract an independent aud it firm for the 2005 subprojects oios appreciates this and agrees that the audit certifi cates submitted by these partners can provide some assurance with regard to the financial activit ies nonetheless we would reiterate that audit certificates are required for all 2004 subpr ojects with all implementing partners national and international that fall under the re quirements of iomfom 612003 recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in rwanda should contract an independent auditing firm to undertake an external audit of those international ngos with budgets over us 300000 pe r year and those national implementing partners that require udit certificates in accordance with iomfom 612003 dated 8 december 2003 rec 01 gtz 14 during 2003 and 2004 most of the vehicles repaired by gtz in unhcrs workshop belonged to third parties despite previous oios recommendation to discontinue the practice in addition in 2004 oios found that abo ut 90 per cent of the repairsmaintenance made for two implementing partners were for vehicle s not under right of use agreements under cost recovery system gtz billed ngos and ch annelled back the money to unhcr after the deduction of management fee of 6 percen t this practice originated several years back and continued up until april 2005 oios was c oncerned that gtz had been using unhcr genuine spare parts procured internationally at duty free prices to repair vehicles not belonging to unhcr and subsequently substituting t hose parts with locally procured ones at lower quality and higher price that included va t this practice was only discontinued in april 2005 15 the representation explained that although the 200 2 audit report had been shared with gtz gtz had continued to provide maintenance service to third party vehicles with mere bilateral arrangement that excluded unhcr whi ch was totally unacceptable the representation further acknowledged the fact that t he use by gtz of genuine dutyfree spare parts for maintenance of third party vehicles and r eplacing them by low quality spare parts was inappropriate hence discontinued since april 2 005 16 oios noted that the discontinuation of ser vices to third party vehicles resulted in sharp drop in the number of vehicles maintained at the workshop about 50 percent consequently the workshop became largely underuti lized according to gtz the workshops current structure and staffing level cou ld easily cope with twice the existing fleet level over 200 vehicles and trucks 17 the representation recognized the need to reduce th number of technical staff due to discontinuation of maintenance service to third par ties and informed oios that it has been agreed with gtz to assess the actual staffing needs with view to reducing the number of staff as of december 2005 4 18 oios noted that the unhcr fleet of 106 veh icles included over 20 trucks some of which had been manufactured as far back as 1981 wh ich resulted in frequent repairs and high maintenance costs for example according to gtz r ecords of maintenance and repairs for 2004 about 10 trucks incurred repair costs varying from us 12000 up to us 30000 with total of over us 200000 which could have been saved oios recommended that the representation seek cost saving measures such as r eduction of workshop staff and the closure of other possible idle workshops at field locations 19 according to the representation the costs seemed xaggerated because some of the vehicles mentioned were part of 16 vehicles on whic h us 124000 was spent as they needed to be redeployed to lumumbashi drc the represen tation also explained that the disposal of old trucks was not practical since the operation did not decline and on the other had they had not planned for the replacement of vehicles t he representation would undertake cost effectiveness assessment for the reductionreplacem ent of the existing fleet the representation further indicated that gtz had reass ured unhcr of their presence in rwanda until end of 2006 20 in reply to oios draft audit report which recomme nded that staffing levels at the gtz vehicle workshop be reduced to level commensu rate with the reduced fleet of vehicles the representation subsequently confirmed that as f january 2006 gtz staffing was reduced by 37 per cent and that their byumba office was so closed oios is pleased to note the action taken to downsize gtz b minaloc 21 minaloc had formal accounting system in place and most of the expenditure could not been traced to any expenditure records the final financial reports submitted to unhcr spmrs could not be reconciled as there was neither any evidence of calculations or analysis made nor any reference to the relevant supporting documents which mainly consisted of photocopies our own recalculations showed that the expenditures reported in the 2003 and 2004 final spmrs were overstated by so us 67000 oios recommended that this amount be reimbursed and that an adequat accounting system be put in place 22 the representation explained that despite official written correspondence and verbal communications on several occasions in 2004 positi ve action was not taken to implement recommendations minaloc had cited high staff turno ver and restructuring as the reasons for nonimplementation the representation planned an extensive training in financial and programme management for minaloc staff and that pr ogress would be closely monitored to ensure full compliance regarding the recovery of us 67000 minaloc informed the representation that some us 19000 out of this amo unt was government funds and that the balance though not reported to unhcr in 2003 was subsequently used to fund 2005 activities 23 oios takes note of the explanations but w ishes to point out that the issue was not of the then available bank balances but rather that f unjustifiedunsupported expenditure totalling some us 67000 regardless of what was actually available in the bank accounts at the end of the subprojects in 2003 and 2004 th unjustified amount should be recovered in addition to other unspent balances furthermore oios did not see any evidence in the 5 files or in the records that prior years project f unds were subsequently used in 2005 especially given the lack of reliable accounting system if these funds were to be used in 2005 the representation should have been so inform ed with the amount carried forward subtracted from the first 2005 instalment this d not been the case 24 in reply to oios draft audit report which recomme nded that unsubstantiated expenditure totalling some us 67000 be recovered from minaloc the representation indicated that this amount has now been recovered t hrough deductions from the 2005 last instalment oios takes note of this but wish to point out that such deduction can only be effective if the partner has incurred and paid for expenditure totalling us 67000 using its own funds if the final spmrs submitted by the part ner accounts for only the actual instalments received then recovery would have b een made oios requests that the representation provide copies of both the payment v oucher and the 2005 final spmrs submitted by minaloc recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in rwanda should provide ios with copies of the documentation evidencing proper recov ery of us 67000 from minaloc representing overstated expendi tures reported in the 2003 and 2004 final spmrs rec 02 25 minaloc did not comply with the cutoff da tes for the expenditure and payments made during the subproject liquidation period for prior year expenditure were reported as current year project expenditure minaloc explaine d that it was not aware of this requirement in addition oios noted that the docu mentation supporting the expenditure was often inadequate and sometimes lacking original d ocuments were often not available and where photocopies were kept these were found by th representation not to be in conformity with the originals that they were supposed to relat to moreover minaloc did not use payment vouchers hence expenditure authorisationa pproval could not be evidenced 26 the representation indicated that it would emphasiz on the rationale of using liquidation periods during the scheduled training s essions for minaloc staff regarding the absence of original supporting documents minal oc explained that these could have been misplaced the representation also stated tha t it would persist in its efforts to locate the original documents and ensure that they are ke pt up to standard b other programme issues 27 oios assessed that project financial monit oring was generally satisfactory there was need however to strengthen project financial mo nitoring and to ensure the timely refund of unspent balances from the governmental partner 28 oios noted that none of the implementing partners had obtained any exemption from the value added tax vat of 18 per cent on the pro curement of fuel for 2003 and 2004 oios calculated that implementing partners spent ov er us 300000 on fuel of which us 48000 was for vat given that the rwanda revenue uthority rra did not impose any particular fuel quotalimits on unhcr this vat amo unt could have been saved if unhcr 6 had directly procured the fuel for onward distribut ion by gtz to partners in response to the draft report the representation stated that initial contacts with rra for vat exemption was not fruitful however they will continue efforts t implement oios recommendation recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in rwanda should in futur directly procure fuel to cover both its needs and the needs of implementing partners thus saving vat of some us 50000 over twoyear period rec 03 c supply management procurement 29 minaloc did not observe the requirement of competition for its procurement of cooking stoves totalling some us 86000 being governmental agency minaloc was required to tender through the national tender boar d ntb however minaloc sought waiver for competitive bidding on the grounds that the procurement was being made on an emergency basis there was evidence on file that the procurement was of emergency nature overall oios assessed that the procurement process lacked transparency with minaloc having its three office staff making the s election 30 minaloc also issued an itb for the provisi on of 2800 mt of peat worth over us 200000 to be used as an alternative natural sourc of energy following the governments new policy on reduced felling of trees for firewood ios found that though approved by the national tender board the tender and the selection of the supplier was actually again made by only three minaloc staff again the procurement process was not transparent and given that minaloc was not prequalified for procurement on behalf of unhcr procurement should have been limited to more than us 20000 per year the representation indicated that minaloc acknowledged the noncompliance with g overnment rules on procurement it also stated that it would provide training to minal oc staff on procurement procedures and undertook to conduct close monitoring to ascertain that they fully comply with the regulation 31 the representation informed oios of tremen dous pressure by minaloc and the government of rwanda to honour commitment minaloc had made to the supplier to procure some us 200000 worth of peat the repres entation clarified that it had not agreed to such an arrangement with minaloc except for s mall procurement of firewood of some us 40000 the relevant subproject agreement and budget only made provision for the procurement of firewood and therefore unhcr was t liable for minalocs commitment to the supplier moreover following mission of unhcr consultant the representation was advised against the use of peat citing health r easons as well as the cost inefficiencies of the procurement the representation informed oios of its difficult position especially in 2005 with an increased political pressure from the government compounded by the ban to harvest firewood in rwanda given these new develo pments oios was of the opinion that the representation should reassess the cost effici ency for the procurement of wood compared to the peat and the health hazards that the use of peat may carry concerted approach with guidance from unhcr headquarters woul d be needed 7 b asset management 32 oios assessed that this area required atte ntion assettrak was not uptodate and significant work would be required to reflect the c orrect value of assets oios found that over 25 vehicles and various other items could not be traced to assettrak while at the same time many former implementing partners were still l isted as custodians of assets in assettrak there was record of any physical inventory carri ed out in the period 20032004 for those assets listed in assettrak the custodians were not identified making it difficult to trace the physical existence of the items this hampered the representations ability to identify asset losses if any and investigate them 33 the representation indicated that it is recruiting data entry clerk whose duties would include inter alia conducting comprehensive physical identification and recording of unhcr assets the representation further stated tha t with the support of the desk someone would come on mission to train the representations staff on the use of assettrak 34 oios found that unhcr assets in the custod of discontinued partner were handed over to another partner without any involvement of unhcr hence there was evidence that the assets were fully accounted for especiall given that the assettrak system was not up to date oios recommended that the representation take appropriate action to ensure that the handover of assets between the implementing partner s concerned was fully accounted for the representation stated that it would look into the i ssue of handover of assets and funds between the two partners and that it would take ap propriate measures to comply with oios comments and recommendations 35 while local asset management board lamb had been established in 2003 there was evidence on file that any lamb meetings had taken place oios noted that the 2005 lamb established in august 2005 was still dealing w ith issues dating back one to two years for example vehicle accident case dating back to january 2004 had yet to be finalised while theft of nonfood items dating back to octo ber 2004 was only finalised during the lamb meeting in september 2005 also there were n umber of cases at implementing partners which required action by the lamb for ex ample at least 12 motorcycles were beyond repair and had been grounded at an implemen ting partners compound for over year the representation stated that in 2005 lamb meeti ngs are being convened regularly with minutes kept on file and that long time groun ded vehicles are being disposed of d security and safety 36 the representation was assessed as moss co mpliant however many staff were still to complete the mandatory cd rom training on securi ty in the field the representation informed oios that subsequent to the audit all st aff completed the mandatory training administration 37 in the areas of administration and finance the unhcr representation in rwanda generally complied with unhcrs regulations rules policies and procedures and controls were operating effectively during the period under review there was however need to strengthen certain areas 8 salary advances 38 while heads of offices in the field have t he delegated authority to approve salary advances for local staff salary advances to intern ational staff should be dealt with through unhcr headquarters oios noted number of instance s where salary advances were made to international staff which were either approved by the beneficiary himself or by other staff with such delegated authority the rules for the approval of advances of salaries and allowances for international staff at field duty st ations iom12088 and staff administration management manual samm chapter 3 section 310 1 refer had been disregarded these rules indicate the specific circumstances und er which hrs may authorize salary advances for international staff and such advances should be processed by unhcr payroll the representation assured oios that international staff would longer be granted salary advances locally 39 in april 2002 staff member index 667 675 obtained rental advance of us 19200 which was to be reimbursed in 12 monthly in stalments of us 1600 each thus the advance should have been fully reimbursed by april 2003 recoveries were however made in an inconsistent manner there were several month s with deductions or only partial deductions in addition the representation made n deductions after the 8 th instalment in may 2003 thus leaving balance of us 8000 since then oios recommended that this amount be recovered at once through payroll according to the representation some us 1500 out of us 8000 related to medevac travel advance which would be cleared through suspense account regarding the balance of some us 6500 the representation stated that the personnel administration section of dhrm had been contacted and requested the concerned staff member to confirm way of reimbu rsement 40 in its subsequent reply to the draft audit report the representation explained that the actual outstanding balance totalling us 7418 act ion has been takenup by dhrm for recovery in three instalments starting in january 2 006 and that notional voucher has been issued to clear the amount in the records of the re presentation b value added tax vat 41 oios found that the representation had not claimed vat totalling some us 98000 since september 2004 including vat on purchases by field offices estimated at some us 4000 according to the representation this was t he result of an oversight mainly due to staff movement the representation explained that actions have now been taken and that the rwanda revenue authority rra has agreed to reimbu rse the outstanding vat owed to unhcr starting october 2005 the representation s ubsequently indicated that rra has started the reimbursement recommendation head2right the unhcr representation in rwanda should ensure th at vat totalling some us 98000 for purchases made since september 1994 is recovered from the rwanda revenue authorit rec 04 9 c cost sharing arrangement with fao 42 under memorandum of understanding the r epresentation shared offices with fao with common costs shared in the ratio of 7030 hcr would pay the full costs of the common costs electricity water security guards etc and bill fao 30 per cent of those costs oios found however that such billings had been made since march 2004 although the representation had made monthly paymen ts for those common costs with faos share totalling some us 12000 the representation stated that fao has agreed to reimburse unhcr not later than october 2005 the r epresentation subsequently indicated that the amount owed by fao has now been fully reco vered v acknowledgement 43 i wish to express my appreciation for the assistance and cooperation extended to the auditors by the staff of unhcr and its implementing partners in rwanda
