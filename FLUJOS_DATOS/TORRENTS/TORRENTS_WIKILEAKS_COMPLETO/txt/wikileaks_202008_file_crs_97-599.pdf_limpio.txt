reform summary the ongoing debate over changes to existing patent law has continued in th 106 congress much of the expressed interest arises from the perception that patentth ownership is an incentive to innovation innovation the process that ultimatel provides new and improved products manufacturing processes and services is the basis for technological progress this technological advancement is key element of economic growth the patent system was created in the united states constitution article i section 8 clause 8 states that the congre ss shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors an d inventors the exclusive right to their r espective writings and discoveries the award of patent permits the creator of an idea to exclude others from use of tha t concept without compensation the patent process also places the informatio n associated with an invention in the public domain by requiring publication of th application upon award patents are intended to provide an incentive to encourage the investmen t necessary to develop an idea and bring it to the marketplace embodied in product or proces s however not everyone agrees that the patent system is particularl effective means to stimulate innovation while patents allow the inventor to obtain larger portion of the returns on resource expenditures they do not permit him t capture all the benefits patents can be circumvented and infringement cannot always be proven it appears that the efficacy of patents is perceived differently amon g individual industrial sectors the proposed changes that might significantly alter the relationship betwee n innovation and patents involve the requirement for mandatory publication of patent applications 18 months after filing innovation typically is knowledgedriven it also produces knowledge how information is treated in the patent process is therefore of major consequence advocates of early publication claim that it offers way t accelerate information dissemination provide background on current technology avoid costly duplication of effort and highlight areas of scientific and technological interest opponents contend that such requirements will allow competitors t interfere with the award process to the detriment of inventors particularly smal l companies as the debate continues it might be helpful to explore the balanc between protection of th inventor and disclosure of information if innovation is the ultimate objective this report provides background information on the relationships betwee n patents and innovation that may be useful during consideration of this issue in th 106 congress the paper will be updated as warranted by legislative activity

patent law are being conside red by the 106 congress thisth would build upon previous legislative efforts aimed at providing additional autonomy to the patent and trademark office and altering requirements for publication f information contai ned in patent application much of this interest is founded upon the perception that patent ownership is an incentive to innovation the basis for th technolo gical advancement that leads to economic growth it is through th commercialization and use of new products and processes that productivity gains are made and the scope and qualit of goods and services are expanded to assist in the debate over patent reform this paper explores several of the significant issues particularly the role of patents in stimulating invention and the relationship between patents innovation and economic growth the patent system was created by article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution to encourage new discoveries and their reduction to practice commonly known as innovation patent ownership is intended to stimulate the investmen t necessary to develop an idea and bring it to the marketplace embodied in product or process the award of patent provides the recipient with limitedtim monopoly over the application of his discovery in exchange for the publi c dissemi nation of the information associated with the patent application this i s intende d to permit the inventor to receive return on the expenditure of resource s leading to the discovery the requirement for publication of the patent is expected to stimulate additional innovation and other creative means to meet similar an d expanded demands in the marketplace legislation considered in the 105 congress contained provisions that woul dth alter the information

early publication f material contained in patents it is anticipated that the debate will continue on thi s and similar bills incorporating changes that could have significant impacts on th relationsh

of patents the role of invent ion and innovation in technological progress has given rise to various governmental efforts to encourage these endeavors the first such federa l initiative was the creation of the us p atent system article i section 8 clause 8 of the us constitution states that the congress shall ve power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors an d inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries th award of patent permits the creator of an idea to exclude others temporarily from use of that co ncept without compensation it also places the information associated with an invention within the public domain innovation typically is knowledgedriven based on the application f knowledge whether it is scientific technical experiential or intuitive innovatio n also produces new knowledge one characteristic of knowledge that underlies th patent system is that it is public good good that is not consumed when it i s used as john shoven of stanford university points out the use of an idea r discovery by one person does not in most cases reduce the availability of tha t informatio n to others therefore the marginal social cost of the widesprea d12 applicatio n of that information is near zero because the stock of knowledge is t depleted ordinarily society maxim izes its welfare through not charging for the use of free good however innovation typically is costly and resource intensive 13 patents permit novel conc epts or discoveries to become property when reduced to practice and

technology or technique thus requiring the expenditure of substantial amount of additional resourc to bring most products or processes to the marketplace the grant of patent provides the inventor with means to capture the returns to his invention through exclusive r ights on its practice for 20 years from date of filing that is intended to encourage those investments necessary to furthe r develop an idea and generate marketable technology issuance of patent provides the inventor with limitedtime monopoly that is influenced by other mitigating factors particularly the requirements for information disclosure the length of the patent and the scope of rights conferred the process of obtaining patent places the cept on which it is based in the public domain in return for monopoly right to the application of the knowledge generated th inventor must publish the ideas covered in the patent as disclosure system th patent can and often does stimulate other firms or individuals to invent around existing patents to provide for paralle l technical developments or meet similar market needs the patent system thus has dual policy goals providing incentives fo r inventor s to invent and encouraging inventors to disclose technical information16 disclosure requirements are factors in achieving balance between current and future innovation through the patent proces s as are limitations

to stimulate innovation it has been argued that patents do not work in reality as well as in theory because the do not confer perfect appropriability in other words they allow the inventor to obtain larger portion of the returns on his investment but do not permit him to capture all the benefits patents can be circumvented an d infringement cannot always be proven thus patents are not the only way r necessarily the most efficient means for the inv entor to protect the benefits generated by his efforts study by yale universitys richard levin and his colleague s concluded that lead t ime learning curve advantages eg familiarity with the science and technology under sideration and salesservice activities were typically more important in exploiting appropriability than were patents that was true for bot h products and processes however patents were found to be better at protecting the former than the latter the novel ideas associated with product often can b determined through reverse engineering taking the item apart to assess how it was made that information then could be used by competitors if not covered by patent because it is more difficult to identify the procedures related to process othe r means of appropriation are seen as preferable to paten ts with the attendant disclosure requirements 19 the utility of patents to companies varies among indus trial sectors

law were debated during the 105 congress andth the issues addressed may provide guidance for current discussions in the 106th congres s hr 400 the 21st century patent system improvement reform act passed the house on april 23 1997 this bill would have among other things made the patent and trademark office now located in the department f commerce government corporation required disclosure of information contained in patents 18 months after filing except in the case of small businesses universities and individual inventorshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97599crs8 for additional information on related legislation see c ongressional research service patent28 reform overview and comparison of s 507 and hr 400 by dorothy schrader cr s report 97591 august 4 1998allowed for prior use of patented innovations without infringement in certain cases and permited third party participation in patent reexamination proceedings s 507 the omnibus patent act of 1997 as reported to the nate was similar except that any inventor who did not choose to obtain foreign patent could at the time of filing request delay in pu blication until the patent issued thereby circumventing the 18 month disclosure requirement this bill also permitted greater participation b third parties in patent reexamination but did not include expanded grounds fo r reexamination28 in the current congress hr 1907 the american inve ntors protection act was passed by the house on august 4 1999 the provisions of this bill sponsors argue reflect an attempt to address unresolved issues from the previous discussion ove r patent reform hr 1907 would among other things establish the patent and trademark office as an independent agency within the department of commerce mandate d isclosure of information contained in patents 18 months after filing in the united states if the inventor also files for patents abroad guarantee 17 years of patent protection to diligent applicants permit limited prior use of certain patented innovations business methods without infringement and accord third party participation in patent reexamination proceedings unde r specific conditions given what is und erstood about the role of patents in innovation the following discussion explores the possible results of suggested changes on the process f technological advancement proponents of these legislative initiatives view th proposed alterations as means to make t he patent system more effective providing the patent and trademark office with additional authority to determine interna l operating procedures and administration under th policy direction of the department of commerce would make available the resources to improve the examination process and reduce patent pendency the time it takes to consider and issue patent thereby affording an expanded time frame for enforcement of claims against infringement however the change that may significantly alter the relationship between innovation and patents because of its implications for appropriability and informatio n dissemination is the requirement for mandatory early publication of paten thttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97599crs9 under existing law patent applications are published when the patent is awarded to th e29 inventor prior art indicates that the concept claimed in patent application is already known an d30 usually has been published and therefore cannot be considered novel michael kkirk prepared testimony before the ho use committee on science subcommittee31 on energy and environment may 2 1996 9applications 18 months after filing if the inventor also patents abroad advocates29 of early publication claim that this offers way to facilitate increased creativity and competition by providing backgr ound on current technology avoiding duplication of effort and highlighting areas of scientific and technological interest to rival firms another perce ived advantage is that such change would place us practice in line with foreign patent office procedures that require publication of patents in th languag of the country within an 18month time frame thus when america n compan ies file for protection abroad the relevant information quickly become s available to foreign competitors in th eir native language but it is not accessible in the united states or in english domestic firms remain at distinct disadvantage particularly small companies that do not have the resources to cull through thes applications early publication has been advocated as means to negate the effects f submarine patents under previous us patent law when the term of the patent was determined from the date of grant certain inventors used dilatory tactics to delay issuance of their own paten t for up to 40 years during that time other companies or individuals developed products and processes based on the first firms concepts when the submarine patent surfaced the original filer could require expensiv licensing arrangements or sue for infringement the revised system of patent terms from date of filing coupled with the proposed requirements f or information disclosure within 18 months are seen by some as way to cou nteract such maneuvers place the information in pub lic view and permit patents to be used for the purposes for which they were intended publication requirements also are viewed by proponents as mechanism t improve the process of patent aw ards it has been argued that early dissemination of information facilitates the submission of prior art at the front end of patent evaluation efforts according to michael kirk executive d irector of the american intellectual30 property association such action will assist the patent office in its role of granting patents by making the process easier and more accurate potential conflicts can be recognized earlier in the examination activity in addition small entity inventors will be able to receive more complete and accurate patentability assessments and have much better opportunity to avoid potential infringement issues since potentiall adverse patent rights can be more readily identified and monitored31 opponents of early publication provis ions typically are small business owners or individual inventors they contend that release of information contained in n application prior to the patent award will allow competitors to interfere with th award pro cess articulating what many in the community believe terry bibbens of the us small business adm inistration stated in testimony that large companieshttpwikileaksorgwikicrs97599crs10 terry

hire lawyers to peruse applications will use dilatory tactics to oppose the awarding of patents to small companies and wil l interfere with the system by excessive and unsubstantiated claims of prior art studies have shown that small high technology companies tend to be particularly innovative advocates for these businesses maintain that patent protection i s therefore of major importance limited resources in smal ler firms might make patents more effective because other means of appropriability may be unavailable brand33 name loyalty consumer feedback and learning curve ad vantages are often beyond the reach of small companies in addition because such businesses have few sources of internal funding patents take on added significance when they can be used s collateral to obtain bank or venture capital financing it is also argued that attempts to align us patent disclosure with foreig n practices will p lace small firms at distinct disadvantage study commissioned by the small business administration found that while large companies file international patents on about onehalf of their inventions small firms file more than twothirds of their patents exclusively in the united states thus significant number of small34 business patents currently are not subject to foreign publication requirements an d therefore are not covered by information disclosure stipulations but would

issues if foreign patent applications are made issues for consideration competitive success often is based on how quickly firm can bri ng an innovation to the marketplace patents can play role in the competitiveness of individua l companies by stimulating the expenditure of resources necessary to develop an idea into commercial product or process the extent to which patents facilitat innovation may be contingent on their ability to encourage this increased investment in researc h and development as discussed above the effectiveness of patent s depends primarily on the extent of appropriability conferred and on the additiona l costs associated with imitation of the invention much of the controversy surrounding proposed changes in current us patent law is related to early

particularly in areas where the technologies ar rapidly advancing one of the characteristics of scientific research is that knowledge developed in one discipline often serves as the foundation for
