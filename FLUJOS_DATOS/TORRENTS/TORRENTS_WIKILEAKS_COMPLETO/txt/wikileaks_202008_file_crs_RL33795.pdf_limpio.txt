and wild birds summary avian influenza is viral disease that primarily infects birds both domestic and wild certain strains of bird flu break the avian barrier and have been known to infect other animals and humans avia n flu viruses are common among wild bird populations which act as reservoir for the di sease while rarely fatal in wild birds avian flu is highly contagious and often fatal in domestic poultry prompting strict biosecurity measures on farms internati onal trade restrictions imposed by countries to counter avian flu can ve large economic effects the h5n1 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai has spread throughout asia since 2003 infecting mostly poultry some wild birds and limited number of humans through close domestic pou ltrytohuman contact the virus has spread beyond asia reaching europe in 2005 and the middle east and africa in 2006 over 250 million poultry have died or b een destroyed internationally human mortality among the more than 275 people infected exceeds 55 fears that the virus could mutate to allow efficient humantohuman transmission and cause human pandemic have prompt ed massive political and public health response since wild birds can carry the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus federal state and other agencies have increased surveillance of wild and migratory birds surveillance is particularly high in alaska where as ian and american flyways overlap migrating birds from asia could carry the virus to alaska and infect birds from the americas on shared nesting grounds the newly inf ected birds could carry the virus down north american flyways alternatively imports into central and south america could introduce the virus to the wester n hemisphere and subs equent wild bird migration could bring the virus north into the united states the united states also has blocked imports of pou ltry and poultry products from h5n1infected countries the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain s not yet been detected in the united states but surveillance has detected different low pathogenicity strains in wild bird populations including low pathogenicity h5n1 the low pathogenicity strain does not pose the same threat as highly pathogenic h5n1 even if highly pathogenic h5n1 is found in the americas it does not signal the onset of global human pandemic the virus apparen tly has not yet mutated to allow efficient humanto human transmission and scientists disa gree whether or when this may happen controlling avian flu in poultry and to the extent possible in wild birds is seen as the best way to prevent human pa ndemic from developing by reducing the number of animal hosts in which the viru s may evolve indemnity payments to compensate farmers for birds destroyed in er adication efforts are seen as an important element of increasing success to control the disease congressional agriculture committees have held hearings on avian influenza preparedness and appr opriators have increased funding for surveillance and other preparedness activities for poultry and wild birds this report will be updated periodicallyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33795contents w h t i s v i n i n f l u n z 1 s t t u s f v i n i n f l u n z

influenza in poultry and wild birds what is avian influenza avian influenza ai viruses exist th roughout the world in many different strains avian flu is an influenza viru s that infects both wild and domestic birds and certain strains have been known to inf ect both animals and humans this report discusses avian flu broadly as it affects agriculture and wild birds especially with reference to highly pathogenic h5n1 avian flu avian flu assumes two forms in birds low pathogenicity lpai form that causes mild illness and highly pathogenic hpai form that is extremely contagious causes severe illness and frequently has high rates of mortality pathogenicity is determined using two methods genetic sequencing and inoculating healthy chicks and monitoring their mortality mortality under highly pathogenic avian flu ranges from 30100 and is usually less than 20 for low pathogenicity both forms are possible in many strains designated by the letters h and n the strain designations refer to surface proteins on the virus called hemagglutinin h and neuraminidase n each ai virus has one hemagglutinin nd one neuraminidase protein sixteen h subtypes and nine n subtypes have been identified and are designated by numbers they can occur in any combination resulting in 144 possible strains for example h1n1 h7n2 etc most strains are low pathogenicity but some strains particularly h5 and h7 can mutate from lpai into hpai during th course of an outbr eak globally during the past 20 years h5 or h7 lpai viruses have mutated into hpai on five occasions thus low pathogenicity outbreaks in dom estic poultry are treated aggressively low pathogenicity outbreaks in poultry are not uncommon since lpai is entrenched in wild birds the most recent cases in us poultry occurred in 2004 with low pathogenicity strains of h7n2 in delaware maryland and new jersey and low pathogenicity h2n2 in pennsylvania separately an h5n2 strain was found in texas in 2004 and was classifi ed genetically as highly pathogenic although it did not manifest as such in terms of mortality other recent cases include low pathogenicity outbreaks of h7n2 in the northeast in 2003 and in the midatlantic in 2002 only three highly pathogenic outbreaks have occurred in the united states in the past century 1924 1983 and 2004httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33795crs2 1 see us dept of agriculture usda at httpwwwusdagovbirdflu

fall of 2006 but the possibility may return later in 2007 since highly pathogenic h5n1 continues to circulate in asia since april 2006 over 107000 samples have been collected from wild birds2 about 19 of those samples are from alas ka with the remainder spread throughout the lower 48 states while instance of highly pathogenic h5n1 has been found to date in north america the tests have detected other low pathogenicity strains of avian influenza3 for example in august 2006 two wild mute swans in michigan were confirmed positive for low pathogenicity strain of h5n1 the swans showed signs of sickness this lpai strain does not threaten poultry or humans like highly pathogenic h5n1 is not in commerc ial flocks and was already known to exist in north america preliminary testing of birds can show positive results for h5n1 for three different reasons first if bird is infected with two different strains of avian influenza one with h5 and another with n1 the test may be positive birds initially testing positive for the presence of both proteins require further testing to determine if the h5n1 viral type itself is presen t second some forms of h5n1 are low pathogenicity and are already somewhat common in north american wild bird populations the low pathogenicity h5 n1 strain some times called north american h5n1 is not human health pr oblem like the highly pathogenic asian strain of h5n1 hunters who might eat infected birds and hunting dogs that might retrieve them are at known risk fro m low pathogenicity h5n1 all the h5n1 virus found to date in the united states and canada has been lpai the third possibility an h5n1 that is also highly pathogenic the strain of concern in the worldwide outbreak has not yet been reported in the americas status in the r est of the

recognized outbreak of the h5n1 strain in wild birds occurred among waterfowl at the qinghai lake nature reserve in westcentral china in 2005 in 2005 the virus spread westward toward eastern europe being confir med in six new countries in 2006 it spread to dozens of new countries in europe the middle east and africa the virus has appeared in 56 countries on every continent of th eastern hemisphere except australia5 the h5n1 outbreak in poultry and birds has grown in scale causing massive international government responses and economic food and trade impacts due to the animal disease and public health c oncerns the food and agriculture organization fao estimates that over 250 million poultry have died or been culled internationally some count ries were reluctant to ac knowledge the disease for fear of economic consequences in other countries the lack of compensation for farmers whose flocks are destroyed has been disincentive to report outbreaks early transmission transmission in wild birds wild birds are the primary natural reservoir for influenza viruses transmission of the disease among wild birds is through fecal material and appears most commonly among waterfowl ducks geese and their relatives shorebirds plovers sandpipers and their relatives gu lls and terns in wild populations avian flu is not typically fatal or even appa rent however an outbreak of the h5n1 strain is known to have appeared in qi nghai province in china in may 2005 most of the wild species at greatest risk are highly migratory eg ranging from siberia to southern asia or norway to central africa many nest in dense aggregations during the breeding season eg many species of rns and gulls or winter in dense flocks eg many species of gulls geese and duc ks or form huge flocks for migration or at migratory stopover sites eg many species of plovers sandpipers and their relatives crowded conditions such as these tend to facilitate transmission of diseasehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33795crs5 6 for biosecurity recommendations see the us da biosecurity for the birds website at httpwwwaphisusdagovvsbirdbiosecurityhpaihtmlwhile avian influenza is rarely fatal in wild birds some scientists fear that an outbreak of hpai could be pa rticularly harmful to popula tions of birds already under threat from habitat loss or excessive harvests transmission in poultry domesticated poultry flocks can be infected by contact with wild birds and their excretions avian flu is highly contagi ous in poultry and more so in crowded conditions the virus is spread by contact with infected feces nasal or eye excretions the incubation period for avian flu may last as long as 10 days and the virus may be shed from live poultry for up to 21 days confined poultry sheds used in commercial production preven t contact with wild birds and thus reduce source of infection but may magnif the economic impact if the virus is introduced people clothing vehicles and supplies can carry the virus between farms thus strict biosecurity measures are adopted by near ly all us commerc ial poultry farms not only to prevent the spread of avian flu but also to shield the flocks from other infections6 avian flu viruses have been common in live bird markets also known as wet markets these markets sell less than 1 of us poultry but outbreaks concern commercial growers who practice tighter biosecurity than backyard growers or live bird markets usda has focused on thes markets because insufficient biosecurity allowed birds and equipment to intermingle at the market and return to farms examples of states with live bird markets include new york new jersey and texas in asia larger network of live bird markets and backyard farms has made eradication difficult transportation of roosters for cock fighting which is illegal in the united states except in louisiana and new mexico and so other parts of the world is also suspected route of disease transmission transmission across in ternational borders pathogens may spread across intern ational borders in several ways naturally eg wild bird migration wind accidentally eg in legal or smuggl ed shipments of animals or products that happen to be infected and intentionally eg legally for controlled use in science or illegally for crime or terrorism the ability of h5n1 to spread naturally via migratory birds has been discussed above and such migration ca nnot be stopped at intern ational political borders surveillance programs are designed to detect the pathogen once it crosses border and enable more rapid res ponse than without surveillancehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl33795crs6 7 for more background on select agents see crs report rl32521 agroterrorism threats and preparedness by jim monke 8 m

increased smuggling interdiction efforts highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are considered select agent under bioterrorism rules 9 cfr 1213 and are subject to restrictions for their po ssession use and transportation7 the usda animal and plant health inspection service aphis determines the scope of import restrictions regarding live animals and animal products and issues import and other health regulations aphis employs smuggling interdiction units and staff at preinspection stations internationally to enforce import restrictions moreover the domestic border inspectors of department of homeland security dhs customs and border protection check passengers cargo and conveyances vehicles ships and planes at ports of entry for prohibited items dhs inspectors include cadre of agricultural specialists many of whom were formerly employed by aphis prior to the transfer of agricultural border inspectors to dhs in 2003 despite the attention given to migratory bird surveillance in north america some believe that poultry imports into central and south america are more likely pathway for the virus to enter the western hemisphere8 if the virus spreads from poultry to wild birds subsequent wild bi rd migration could bring the virus north into the united states official s may have time to redeploy wild bird surveillance to focus on this possible pathway human infection9 certain avian flu strains including h5n1 can infect humans through close poultrytohuman contact usually through contact with fecal matter or other live bird excretions in backyard settings or home slaughtering human infection has not appeared to result from contact with wild birds while the species barrier is significant effects have been severe when infection occurs h5n1 infection in humans may pr oduce rapid deterioration leading to viral pneumonia and organ failure fatality rates are high over 55 of the more than 275 people infected with highly pathogenic h5n1 mostly in asia have died10 officials worry that the virus could mutate or combine with human flu viruses to allow efficient humantohuman transmission whic h could lead to human flu pandemic if highly pathogenic h5n1 is found in the americas it does not signal the onset of global human pandemic the virus has not yet mutated to allow humanto human transmission and scientists disa gree on the likelihood of this

safety epidemiological evidence exists indicating that people have been infected with any avian flu viru s including h5n1 from properly cooked poultry or eggs the virus is killed at conventional cooking mperatures 160 f making properly cooked poultry safe however highly pa thogenic viruses such as h5n1 can spread to nearly all parts of an infected bird survive in raw poultry and be spread if contaminated poultry is marketed and prepared11 thus the centers for disease control and preven tion cdc and the usda food safety and inspection service recommend standard food safety practices such as those for preventing infection from salmonella and coli12 the vast majority of poultry and poultr products in the united states are produced in largescale commercial poultry farms under strict veterinary control infected poultry are very unlikely to ente r the food chain as nearly all commercial growers participate in avian flu testing pr ograms when avian flu viruses are found any infected flocks are destroyed not sl aughtered for food to preserve food safety and prevent the virus from spreading beyond the infected area poultry products from backyard flocks and live bird markets do not receive the same level of inspection as commercial production but typically are cons umed onfarm or in limited distribution circles rather than entering the traditiona l farmtofork food chain backyard poultry and poultry bought at live bird markets are not primary source of food in the united states less than 1 of poultry control in the united states avian flu in poultry is controlled through

evolve the world organization for animal health oie14 revised its reporting standards for avian flu in 2006 previously only highly pathogenic avian flu was reportable disease but the new rules incl ude low pathogenicity strains of h5 and h7 avian influenza making low pat hogenicity h5 and h7 reportable diseases requires exporting countries to upgrade thei r surveillance and eradication protocols to demonstrate freedom from the disease usda accomplished this upgrade with new regulations issued in september 2006 see below preventing infection biosecurity practices are the most important means of preventing outbreaks in poultry these practices include preventing contact between wild birds and poultry and limiting nonessential human access to farm buildings for example delivery trucks and personnel are cleaned and disinfect ed before entering biosecure area or moving between farms or barns in other parts of the world small farms or backyard flocks without biosecurity practices have posed greater problems for control such animal husbandry practices are slow to change surveillance and detection also form an important component of prevention as discussed earlier in this report federal and state agencies have increased surveillance of wild birds for h5n1 in 2006 aphis issued new regulations for the control of low pathogenicity h5 and h7 avian influenza in poultry and new indemnity program 71 fed reg 56302 sept 26 2006 these regulations 9 cfr 56 146 and 147 are voluntary as pa rt of the national poultry improvement plan15 but have strong incentives for participation

control method vaccination poses problems for intern ational trade as many countries will not import poultry products from other count ries that use vacci nation since animals could test positive for antibodies either due to vaccination or due to actual infection distinguishing the difference can be problematic moreover if vaccination is not administered and monitored correctly it can allow the virus to become entrenched and continue to sp read or mutate16 in the united states vaccination is most likely to be used for breeding poultry egg layers and other higher value bird s vaccination in ring surrounding an eradication zone is another possible vaccination strategy in september 2006 usdas national veterinary stockpile had 110 m illion doses of avian influenza vaccine available for poultry within this total 75 million doses were for h5 viruses such as h5n2 and h5n9 and these vaccines have been shown to be effective against the asian h5n1 strain about 35 million doses are for h7 viruses usda has plans to acquire access to up to 500 million doses through agreements with vaccine manufacturers eradicating outbreaks because the virus is highly contagious and easily spread in poultry the most common method of control in an outbreak is to establish quarantines of birds contaminated products conveyances etc restrict movement and cull the infected flocks and certain flocks in close proximity to the infected flock also called stamping out or depopulating followi ng depopulation buildings and equipment are rigorously disinfected be fore new birds are allowed process that takes at least several weeks the virus is killed by co mmon disinfectants or heat about 160 f carcass disposal options usually incl ude composting burial incineration or rendering affected flocks that

compensation for farmers compensation indemnity programs are desired to encourage farmers to report out breaks and cooperate w ith control programs when culling is needed states generally manage indemnification programs for low pathogenicity outbreaks some industry ssociations such as those on the delmarva peninsula delaware maryland and vi rginia have compensation funds for highly pathogenic outbreaks usda has longstanding regulation allowing 100 indemnification for highly pathogenic outbreaks of avian flu 9 cfr 532 in 2006 usda began new indemnity plan for low pathogenicity avian flu18 this program 9 cfr 536 will pay up to 100 indemnity for the market value destruction and disposal of poultry destro yed in an outbreak and for the cleaning and disinfection of premis conveyances and materials to qualify for 100 compensation both the state and the commercia l grower must participate in federal and state surveillance plans otherwise the compensation rate is only 25 an exception allows small growers to r eceive 100 compensation regardless of participation in the surveillance plan thus given expected participation rates among commercial growers and states nearly ll producers
