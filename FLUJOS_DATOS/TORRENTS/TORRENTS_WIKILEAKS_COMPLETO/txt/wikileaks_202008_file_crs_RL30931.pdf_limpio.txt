httpwwwstategovwwwglobalarmsbureau_acwmeat98wmeat98htmlmilitary spending by foreign nations data from selected public sources more or less reliable estimates of military spending by foreign nations are availab from number of sources this crs report collates data on foreign military budgets from two of the most commonly cited and readily available publications1 world military expenditures and arms transfers published approximately annually by the us department of state bureau of arms control formally the us arms control and disarmament agency acda and 2 the military balance published in octo ber of each year by the londonbased international institute for strategic studies iiss 1 although the department of state and iiss endeavor to provide consistent and accurate information crossnational comparison of military spending are inherently imperf ect all of the available sets of data suffer from more or less serious shortcomings these data sets are used by experts principally for discussion purposes world military expenditures and arms transfers wmeat the bureau of arms controls world military expenditures and arms transfers wmeat pronounced wemeet report provides the most consistent set of data and also provides figures for ten year period2 for nato members the bureau of arms control bac measures military expenditures according to common definition that includes military retired pay and militarytype expenditures of defense ministries for other countries wmeat generally reports expenditures of the ministry of defense the most recent 1998 report converts most countries expenditures into dollars using 1997 exchange rates the wmeat ranks the 167 countries based on 7 absolute variables and 10 ratios based on these variables these variables are military expenditures armed forces arms exports arms imports gross natio nal product central government expenditures and population some countries are ranked based on estimateshttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl30931crs2 3 see iiss the military balance 20002001 p 10 4for discussion of estimates of chinas actual and future projected military expenditures see crs report rl30757 chinas emergence as major economic power implications for us interests by dick nanto and radha sinhahence some countries are ranked without having military expenditures listed in the chart major shortcoming of the wmeat report in the past has been is its lack of timeliness second problem is the use of exchange rates of single base year most recently 1997 because the wmeat reports spending over time it is necessary to use single base year otherwise the estimates would measure trends in the value of the dollar rather than trends in military programs but this comes at cost because the value of the dollar has fallen substantially against many currencies since the mid 1980s therefore the estimates of foreign military spending in dollars in earlier years may be understated compared to spending at thencurrent exchange rates the military balance in the military balance military expenditure is defined3 according to the nato standard definition as the cash outlays of central or federal government to meet costs of national armed forces the term armed forces includes strategic land naval air command administration and suppo rt forces it also includes paramilitary forces such as the gendarmerie customs service and border guard if these operate under military authority during war iiss produces uptodate estimates for all nations in october each year and its information is the most current iiss uses data from national governments nato the united nations the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and the international monetary fund however consistent and accurate defense spending for most countries is not available even from these sources most countries do not publish their defense spending figures or do not report them accurately to these organizations therefore iiss estimates some countries defense expenditures from several sources for most countries iiss converts budget data into dollars using current exchange rates in us dollars for countries where basic economic data is hard to obtain such as former command economies like china4 russia or countries in conflict iiss uses purchasing power parity ppp estimates for its conversions ppps measure the relative purchasing power of difference currencies over equivalent goods and services this method may better account for the substantial differences in relative prices for defense goods the following table provides data for all nationss with military budgets over 50 million according to iiss figures the data is rankordered according to the state
