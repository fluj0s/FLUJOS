updated december 15 2006 lindajo schierow specialist in environmental policy resources science and industry divisionhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31530chemical facility security summary facilities handling large amounts of pot entially hazardous chemicals ie chemical facilities might be of interest to terrorists either as targets for direct attacks meant to release chemicals into the commun ity or as source of chemicals for use elsewhere because few terrorist attack s have been attempted against chemical facilities in the united states the risk of death and injury in the near future is estimated to be low relative to the likelihood of accidents at such facilities or attacks on other targets using conven tional weapons for any individual facility the risk is very small but the risks may be increas ing with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment available evidence indicates that many chemical facilities may lack adequate safeguards after 911 congress enacted legislati on that requires the department of homeland security dhs to analyze vulnerabilities and suggest security enhancements for critical infrastructure the public health security and bioterrorism preparedne ss and response act of 2002 pl 107188 and the maritime transportation secu rity act mtsa pl 107295 require vulnerability assessments and emergency response plans for some chemical facilities that supply drinking water or are located in ports as well as security plans for chemical facilities in ports many other chemical facilities including wastewater treatment facilities remain unregulated congress could choose to rely on exis ting efforts in the public and private sectors to improve chemical site security over time alternatively congress could direct dhs to oversee security enhancement at potentially dangerous facilities or congress might enact legislation to reduce risks either by hardening defenses against terrorists for example by increasing security patrols or by requiring industries to consider use of safer chemicals procedures or processes restricting terrorists access to information might be leastcost approach to reducing risks but it would also limit public access to inform ation about potential risks and reduce accountability of facility owners for more on this topic see crs report rl33043 legislative approaches to chemical facility security by dana shea the 109th congress enacted chemical security legislation as section 550 of the dhs appropriations legisla tion pl 109295 the law provides authority to dhs for three years to regulate highrisk chemical facilities other than drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities and facilities in ports the enacted provisions also are found in hr 6348 these provisions combine certain elements of hr 5695 as reported by the house homeland security committee and s2145 as reported by the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs for example the enacted law directs dhs to establish riskbased security performance standards for facilities and requires facility owners or operators to prepare vulnerability assessments and facility security plans the new law also authorizes dhs to inspect facilities and to close down any that are re peatedly noncompliant however the law did not address the most controversial issues whether state laws are preempted and whether facilities should be re quired to consider use of inherently safer technologyhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31530contents introduction 1 risks of terrorism at chemical facilities 2 n t u r f h z r d s 2

raphael perlchemical facility security introduction the potential harm to public health and the environment from large release of hazardous chemicals has long concerned the us congress the sudden accidental release in december 1984 of methyl isocyanate in an industrial incident at the union carbide plant in bhopal india and the attendant loss of thous ands of lives and widespread injuries spurred legislative proposals to reduce the risk of chemical accidents in the united states for example federal environmental laws were enacted in 1986 and 1990 to m itigate and reduce the risk of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals from manufacturing fac ilities processing plants and storage tanks these laws are di scussed below the hazar dous materials transportation act of 1975 was passed to protect the pub lic and environment in the event of an accident during transportation of chemicals other federal laws coordinate preparedness planning and response to significant chemical spills eg the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act the threat of terrorism manifested on september 11 2001 prompted renewed congressional attention to the potential risks to public health and the environment posed by facilities handling large quantitie s of hazardous chemicals congress addressed chemical facility security when it enacted legislation establishing the department of home land security dhs pl 107296 the law requires analysis of vulnerabilities and suggestions for security enhancements for critical infrastructure the public health security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of 2002 pl 107188 and the maritime transporta tion security act mtsa pl 107295 require vulnerability ssessments security plans and incident response plans for some chemical facilitie s which supply drinking water or are located in ports many other chemical facilities remain unregulated with respect to terrorism1 thus the 109th congress continued to

chemical facilities might be classified roughly into two categories direct attacks on facilities or chemicals on site or efforts to use business contacts facilities and materials eg letterhead telephones computers etc to gain access to potentially harmful materials in either case terrorists may be employees sabot eurs or outsiders acting alone or in collaboration with others in the case of direct attack trad itional or nontraditional weapons may be employed including ex plosives incendiary devices firearms airplanes or computer programs in obtaining chemicals rrorists intent may be to use them as weapons or to make weapons including explosives incendi aries poisons and caustics access to chemicals might be gained by physically tering facility and stealing supplies or by using legitimate or fraudul ent credentials eg company stationary order forms computers telephones or othe r resources to order recei ve or distribute chemicals recent trends in overall terrorist activities according to february 2003 testimony by the director of the federa l bureau of investigation fbi to the us senate there were 353 known or suspect ed acts of terrorism including terrorist acts by americans perpetrated within the united states between 1980 and 20012 only few incidents involved chemical f acilities attacks during the 1990s claimed 182 lives and injured over 1932 individuals3 in comparison during the 1980s although there were many more terrorist or suspected terrorist incidents only 23 people were killed nd 105 were injured4 thus although the total number of terrorist acts in the united states declined toward the end of the 20th century the casualties due to terrorism increased httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31530crs3 5 the national counterterrorism center nct c and the state

assistant director for counterterrorism and counterintelligence th attack of september 11 2001 marked dramatic escalation in tr end toward more destructive terrorist attacks which began in the 1980s9 the september 11 attack also reflected trend toward more indiscriminate targeting among international terrorists the vast majority of the victims of the attack were civilians in addition the attack represented the first known case of suicide attacks carried out by interna tional terrorists in the united states the september 11 attack also marked the first successful act of international terrorism in the united states since the vehicle bombing of the world trade center in february 199310 other potentially important trends identified by intelligence agencies include an increase in

throughout the 1990s loosely affiliated terrorist groups in particular have demonstrated growing interest in che mical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction but explosives are still th most frequently employed weapons13 during the 1990s both international and domestic terrorists attempted to use explosives to release chemicals from manufacturing and storage facilities most of these attempts were abroad in war zones such as croatia including attacks on plant producing fertilizer carbon blac k and light fraction petrol eum products other plants producing pesticides and pharmaceutical factory using ammonia chlorine and other hazardous chemicals all of thes facilities we re close to population centers in the united states there were at leas t two instances during the late 1990s when criminals attempted to cause releases of chemicals from facilities one involved large propane storage facility and the other gas refinery14 evidence that us chemical facilities ma be used by terrorists to gain access to chemicals also exists for example one of the 1993 world trade center bombers nidal ayyad became naturalized us c itizen graduated from rutgers university and worked as chemical engineer at allied signal from which he used company stationery to order chemical ingredients to make the bomb according to us prosecutor in the case against the bombers though some suppliers balked when the order came from outside official channels when the delivery address was storage park or when coconspirator tried to pay for the chemicals in cash others did not15 moreover testimony at the trial of the bombers indicated that they had successfully stolen cyanide from chemical facility and were training to introduce it into the ventilation systems of office buildings16 more recently chemical trade publications reportedly were found in qaeda hideaways17 predicted risks of chemical terrorism t h v l i d i t f n r i s k assessment depends on how much is known about the

conventional wisdom that the probability of chemical weapon use is relatively small the conventional prediction however focuses on military use of chemical weapons in future wars among nations rather than on chemical use by terrorists 21 ibid p 29with some regularity such as severe storms or floods in contrast the risk of terrorist activity is unfamiliar at least in the united states rarely experienced and likely to vary significantly over time depending on rather unpredictable social and political phenomena the risk of terrorism targeting chemical facilities is particularly difficult to assess for at least three reasons there are few prior examples of terrorists targeting chemical facilities numerous factors theoretically may increase or decrease risks and interactions among factors infl uencing risks are dynamic and changing in part these difficulties stem from the nature of terrorism and the terrorists deliberate efforts to do what is least expected that is to defy prediction for these reasons most experts have not tried to qua ntify risks existing analyses of chemical terrorism risks in the open literature are speculative and qualitative18 until the mid to late 1990s reports focused on the acquisition and use of chemical weapons such as sarin or mustar d gas one of the most comprehensive of these reports was 1995 review of the open literature on terrorism that was prepared for the canadian security intelligence service19 according to this review of the literature those authors who have speculated bout the future terrorist use of chemical agents in particular have ge nerally rated its like lihood as quite high20 according to some the risk also appears to be increasing many experts today believe that factors that might have inhi bited proliferation nd use of chemicals as weapons in the past are eroding for ex ample some experts hypothesized several years ago that the combination of chemical and strategic skills necessary to create and deploy chemical weapons would preven t the lone terrorist from using them21 security experts now believe that lack of personal expertise longer limits chemical weapon use because there is tendency fo r terrorists with similar extreme views to affiliate loosely with others with complementary skills and abilities moreover the rising level of education worldwide m eans that more people have the

terrorist groups others have argued that chemical ttacks would be unlikely due to the difficulties of producing and ffectively delivering chemical agents in sufficient amounts to produce mass

limited ambitions 1999 report by the us general accoun ting office gao now the government accountability office summa rized the situation many conflicting statements have been made in public testimony before congress concerning the ease or difficulty with which terrorists could effectively disseminate chemical or bi ological agent on us soil and cause mass casualties23 gao studied the threat and concluded that th ease or difficulty for terrorists to cause more than 1000 casualties depends on the chemi cal or biological ag ent selected the report stated experts from the scientific intelligence and law enforcement communities told us that terrorists do not need sophistic ated knowledge or dissemination methods to use toxic industrial chemicals such as chlorine in contrast terrorists would need relatively high degree of sophistication to successfully cause mass casualties with some other chemical and most biological agents on the other hand terrorists with less sophistication coul d make chemical or biological weapon and disseminate agents but these would be less likely to cause mass casualties24 other factors that might have inhibited chemical use by some terrorists in the past might not apply to loos ely affiliated terrorist groups for example some experts argue that terrorists supported by nationstat have been reluctant to use chemical weapons for fear of offending other nations and neutral parties particularly if the sponsors were signatories of th chemical weapons convention25 another possible deterrent to chemical use f ear of retaliation probably is of little concern to attackers with identifiable homeland or headquarters lack of homeland might also lessen concern about environmental damage th at may be associated with chemical production finally one must

us house of representatives committee on government reform subcommittee on national security veterans affairs and international relations referri ng to the risk of any use of chemical or biological weapons he stated attacks with chemical and biological weapons are strikingly infrequent and the number of fatalities and casualties are far lower than those caused by conventional explosives according to an analysis of 105 us incidents featured in the monterey institute database from 1900 to 1998 only one fatality resulted from chemical or biological weapon attack this incident involved 1973 assassination of an oakland california sc hool superintendent by the symbionese liberation army26 severity of harm it is generally agreed that chemical agents are likely to be the least lethal of the three weapons of mass destruction in part this judgment reflects the difficulty of producing and deliv ering large quantities of lethal chemical to the target area prior to release on the other hand industrial chemicals and pesticides are readily available for purchase and are stored in large quantities in thousands of locations throughout the ited states often near population centers key question for chemical facilities then is how much damage could terrorists do using existing stationary chemical manuf acturing processing distribution and storage facilities there are two key sources of information for answering this question accident reports and hazard assessmen ts conducted by facility pe rsonnel or outside experts there is comprehensive database for either kind of information27

emergency preparedness and prevention ffice are more detailed based on preliminary analysis of approximately 15000 facility ri sk management plans for chemical facilities that were filed under the clean air act section 112r before september 25 200031 belke concluded that the median distance from facility to the outer edge of its vulnerable zone is 16 miles in the case of toxic worst case scenarios and 04 miles for flammable worst case scenarios however many facilities reported vulnerable zones potentially extending 14 miles from the facility primarily for releases in urban areas of chlorine stored in 90ton rail tank cars and 25 miles for releases in rural terrain of chlorine stored in 90ton rail tank cars other chemicals for which reported vulne rable zones equaled or exceeded 25 miles include anhydrous ammonia hydrogen fluor ide sulfur dioxide chlorine dioxide oleum fuming sulfuric acid sulfur trioxi hydrogen chloride hydrocyanic acid phosgene propionitrile bromin and acrylonitrile belke found the median population affect ed in worst case accident was 15 people for flammable substance while the median for toxic substances was 1500 people32 affected means potentially exposed it is highly unlikely that all people within the vulnerable zone would be expos ed due to single release however anyone within the zone could be in the pa th of the chemical

chemical onsite as is found in the single process thus the epa methodology for calculating the poten tially affected population in the worst case which was developed for accidental releases may

extremely hazardous substances if they appeared on list epa published in nov 1985 as appendix in chemical emergency preparedness program interim guidance however congress gave epa authority to revise the list and the threshold quantities of chemicals based on listing criteria the intent appears to be to include only chemicals in quantities that could harm people exposed to them for only short period of time currently there are approximately 356 such substances listed for the list see httpwwwepagovswerceppehsehsalphahtml visited jan 11 2006 risk of attack is extremely small however the overall risks to chemical facilities may be increasing in contrast to the low probability of chemical terrorism possible consequences for human health and the environment from such an event could be

september 11 2001 to reduce risks at chemical facilities two key federal laws require or encourage certain chemical facility operators to reduce risks to the general public associat ed with releases of hazardous chemicals the emergency response and community righttoknow act epcra and the clean air act caa both focus on accident releases of zardous chemicals epcra in 1986 two years after the bhopal accident congress enacted epcra codified at 42 usc 1100111050 as title iii of the superfund amendments and reauthor ization act pl 9949962 epcra mandated the establishment of state emergency response commissions sercs and local emergency response committees lepcs to coordinate planni ng and response to potentially large releases of specifi ed extremely hazardous substances63 the act requires facility operators lepcs and sercs to prepare contingency plans for such releases facility managers are required to provide information to lepcs and local emergency responders fire fi ghters police officers etc about chemicals present at facilities and to notify those officials in the event of sudden release epcra requires local officials to provide information about em ergency plans and chemical hazards to the general public epcras reporting and disclosure requirements are meant to facilitate planning but sometimes they also promote risk re duction for example facility managers concerned about community re lations sometimes reduce use of particularly toxic or otherwise hazardous materials some times to the point that they longer have to report because they longer handle repor table quantities of epcra chemicals inhttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31530crs16 64 many proponents of the reporting provisi ons of epcra argue however that public disclosure of information about chemicals pr esent and released into communities sometimes prompts facility operators to reduce risks 65 the clean air act amendments of 1990 gave responsibility for the prevention of accidental chemical releases to the occupati onal safety and health administration osha and epa osha has responsibility for the protection of workers from accidental chemical releases and has promulgated the process safety management standard 29 cfr 1910119 in response to this requirement epa has incorporated the osha process safety management standard as the chemical accident prevention program for certain facilities subject to both rules other cases the public disclosure requi rement may encourage them to change chemical processes and handling in order to reduce the risk of reportable spills although epcra requires fac ility reporting and cooperation in local emergency response planning and it may encourage ri sk reduction it stops short of requiring facilities to assess or reduce risks of chemical releases64 instead the act directed the epa to study the problem and to iden tify any gaps in federal regulation caa section 112r in 1990 data accumulated by epa on chemical accidents in the united states prompted congress again to address the threat of catastrophic releases of chemicals that might cause imme diate deaths or injuries in communities it amended the clean air act caa to mandate epa oversight of risk management planning at facilities that handle more than specified threshold quantities of hazardous substances65 the act defined h azardous substances to include chlorine

trioxide and at least 100 other chemicals to be designated by epa epa was di rected to designate chemicals posing the greatest risks to human health or to the environment based on three criteria

department of energy doe was the designated lead agency for energy with respect to the chemical industry and hazardous materi als the strategy acknowledged both the potential economic c onsequences of successful attack on the sector and the potential threat to public health and safety it aimed to assure supply to downstream users of chemical products to protect and assure the quality of chemical stockpiles and to reduce th risk of malicious use of inherently hazardous chemicals the strategy noted that there is currently clear unambiguous legal or regulatory authority at the federal level to help ensure comprehensive uniform security standards for chemical facilities82 in particular the strategy observed that federal laws mig ht be outofdate and longer effective for monitoring and controlling access to dangerous substances the president proposed that dhs in concert with epa should work with congress to enact legislation to require certain chemical facilities particularly those that maintain large quantities of hazardous ch emicals in close proximity to population centers to undertake vulnerability asse ssments and take reasonable steps to reduce the vulnerabilities identified83 the strategy also proposed that epa in concert with dhs should review current laws and regulations pertaining to the distribution and sale of highly toxic pesticides and i ndustrial chemicals finally the strategy suggested that dhs and epa should encourage participati on in the chemical sectors information sharing analysis center the fact that security can be expensive also was noted the strategy described the importance of water from public health and an economic standpoint and noted that security of the water sector against terrorism had been greatly enhanced since september 11 2001 challenges facing the water sector according to the strategy included the need to protect against intentional release of toxic chemicals so as to protect the safety of people who reside or work near water facilities the strategy proposed that ep and dhs identify better ways to secure key points of storage and distribution impr ove monitoring and analysis information exchange and contingency planning and ma nage risks due to interdependencies with other critical infrastructures the energy sector was divided into two sections electricity and the oilnatural gas industries

standard approaches for vulnerability and risk assessments and physical secu rity training for industry pe rsonnel85 an advisory task force was to be convene d by dhs and doe to identify appropriate planning requirements and pproaches finally the strategy proposed that dhs and doe work with industry to develop regi onal and national prog rams for identifying spare parts requirements notifying parties of their availability and distributing them in an emergency there is mention in this section of the hazardous chemicals present in some facilities in the energy sector86 however it may be the administrations intention that certain facilities such as oil refineries electricgas utilities and bulk storage facilities would be included in and targeted by initiatives in multiple critical infrastructure sectors as the war began in iraq the presiden t launched operation liberty shield surveillance program to provide additional security for potentially threatened facilities in the critical infrastructure chemical plants were among the potential focal points of the initiative on december 17 2003 the president issued homeland security presidential directive hspd 7 transferring to dhs all epa authority for overseeing the security of chemical facilities with the si ngle exception of drinking water and water treatment plants in additi on the directive revised the ad ministrations strategy for protecting critical infrastructure by designating dhs the lead agency for the chemical sector the directive requires that dhs i dentify prioritize and coordinate the protection of

read ers are referred to crs report rl33600 international terrorism threat policy and response by raphael perl narrower focus on chemical plants might provide incentives for voluntary private sector

security enhancement perhaps the most common approach to improving site security is to harden defe nses so that sites w ould be less vulnerable to terrorists111 according to the recently released doj vulnerability assessment methodology an effective protection syst em serves three functions detection discovery or sensing of dversary action delay impedime nt to adversary progress and response by security personnel to sure that threat is neutralized112 examples of hardening tactics include increasing security patrols strengthening fences installing better locks on doors relocating sensitive chemi cal processes within the facility insta lling in truder detection systems and arms and performing background checks on employees congress has adopted such tactics in other contexts for example the usa patriot act pl 10756 requires background checks as condition for obtaining license to operate motor vehicle transporting hazardous material in commerce httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31530crs31 113

electric power press release dec 18 2000a key advantage of hardening tactics is their variety and adaptability to range of security needs other advantages include the ability to deepen defenses by adding layers of protection and in many cases relatively low costs potential weakness of this strategy is that even the most effective security measures might be disabled or overwhelmed by determin ed skilled terrorist organization for example guards might be bribed or killed passwords discove red alarms shortcircuited or computers hacked the world trade center and pentagon attacks demonstrate the vulnerability of any site to novel and vigorous attack technology assessment and inherently safer options an alternative strategy for reducing risk is advocated by environmental groups it would reduce the hazardous characteristics of the facility for example by reducing production processing storage and use of dangerous chemicals or changing the characteristics of chemicals to make them less dangerous eg by reducing volatility such tactics aim to improve the inherent safety of site and are preferred by advocates to targethardening tactics which they of ten refer to as addon safety systems113 according to this view inherent safety activities reduce or eliminate the possibility of an accident occurring throug h the fundamental re design of production systems or products reductions in chemical inventories or subs titution for hazardous chemicals at the facility114 currently there is federal us law that explicitly promotes use of inherently safer tec hnologies ist by the chemical industry two potential advantages of this appro ach are that consequences of terrorism may be reduced even if terrorist succeed s in his mission and that risks associated with accidental releases of chemicals also are likely to be reduced in addition efforts to promote inherent safety of production could fill gaps in current laws which address risks associated with specified ch emicals and industries according to the us chemical safety and hazard investigation board many reactive chemicals responsible for industrial accidents ar not covered by the caa section 112115 the chemical industry developed th concept of inherent safety116 and the acc security code requires members to cons ider it in choosing security measures many facility operators have applied this approach in recent years for example utility in ohio chose to employ ureabased pollution control system instead of another system which would have required storage of large quantities of ammonia117 shortly

wastewater treatment plants are making similar changes in chemical usage the key disadvantages of this safer facility strategy are potentially higher production and research and velopment costs delays in achieving security while new processes are put into place and at least in some cases lack of feasibility however advocates argue that use of sa fer technologies may reduce production costs by reducing regulatory burdens insurance premiums transportati on costs and waste disposal costs another pot ential disadvantage of the strategy is that some safer tactics may simply spread risk around shift the risk to other locations or populations or substitute one risk for anothe r for example in replacing an acutely toxic chemical that produces relatively severe health effects after short exposure with less acutely toxic chemical one might increase chronic risks due to lowlevel longterm exposures or environmental risks eg due to the chemicals persistence deterrence third approach to reducing risks aims to reduce theft rather than direct attacks by making dangerous chemicals in use at facility less attractive to criminals for example by introducing color or other property that facilitates detection and tracking by authorities socalled taggants or by creating and storing antidotes to toxic effects disadvantage of the use of taggants is that they act as contaminants and therefore may impede chemical processes for this reason taggants typically are useful only in end pr oducts not in intermed iate ie process chemicals generally such deterrents appear to be in the development stage and are not available for immediate application restricted access to information restricting terrorists access to information about vulnerability and location of chemical facilities also might reduce the risk of terrorism this approach was taken by the 106th congress when it enacted amendments to the caa section 112r to prevent internet posting of risk management plans and worstcase scenar ios for accidents internet access to information is particular concern b ecause it permits anonymous inquiries about sensitive us facilities from remote locations pl 107296 that established dhs limits access to sensitive information potentially useful to terrorists by exempting information about critical infrastruct ures submitted voluntarily to dhs from disclosure requirements of the fr eedom of information act foia key advantage of restricting access to sensitive information is that it is an inexpensive method of reducing risk ho wever some argue that information restriction is contrary to american values reduces public oversight of chemical facilities and consequently facility operators incentives to reduce risk and is not likely to prevent

associated with chemical pl ants are faced with at leas t three fundamentally political issues the effect of public disclosure the relative importance of diverse risks and associated costs and benefits of risk re duction and who should be responsible and held accountable for achieving results public disclosure public disclosure of info rmation about chemical hazards and risk management plans at i ndustrial facilities is controversial120 professional and trade groups representing the chemical i ndustry oppose the release of information regarding the vulnerability of facilities to terrorism and the potential offsite consequences oca to public health and the environment they argue that terrorists might use the information to target facilities that are most vulnerable or located near large populati on centers congress responded to this view when it enacted amendments to the caa section 112r in 1999 environmental and righttoknow advo cates often oppose restrictions on public disclosure they argue that communities ve right to be informed about hazards to which they might be exposed and that free access to information is important to ensure public accountabi lity of f acility managers pponents of limiting public information also point out that citizens n eed information to ssess fac ility comp liance with laws and if necessary to petition the administration or the courts for enforcement121 unsafe practices and inadequa risk management plans in particular should be publicized they contend so that communities may exert political or social pressure on plant managers to improve the inherent safety of their facilities moreover these groups want access to information about similar facilities handling comparable chemicals across the united states so that plans and accident rates can be compared and analyzed to termine the effectiveness of various safety measures informed citizens can work with local plant managers to reduce the risk of accidents they argue this view was adopted by congress in the 1990 amendments to the caa section 112r122 another argument in favor of public disclosure has been advanced by investment groups who argue investors need

about how well sec has defi ned the environmental disclosure requirements 2 little is known about the extent to which companies are disclosing such information in their filings with sec and 3 sec enforcement of environmental disclosure requirements may or may not be adequate with respect to the possibility that information may be used by terrorists right toknow advocates claim that public disclosu re of chemical hazards motivates facility operators to reduce chemical hazards thereby reducing the likelihood and severity of harm from terrorist attacks as well as the risk of chemical accidents the net effect on risk to public health and the environment of public disclosure therefore appears to depend on the relative risks of releases due to accidents versus those due to terrorism and on the extent to which those risks are reduced or enhanced by publication of risk management plans nd similar information however data are not available to calculate risks relative risks or risk reductionenhancement potential related issue is the extent to which federal laws regarding public disclosure should preempt state and local disclosure laws pl 107296 establishing dhs prohibits release under the authority of state and local disclosure laws of information including the identity of the submitting person or entity that is voluntarily submitted to covered federal agency for use by that

chemical site security enhancement there is general agreement that risks should be re duced and that the greatest risks should be addressed first but little discussion of which risks are greatest and should be targeted and at what cost for example should we focu s on lowering death rates or rates of sickness and disa bility should we focus on preventive measures or emergency response and recovery services should we allocate resources to prevent worstcase scenarios or everyday risks that add up over time are risks due to chemical terrorism worse than risks of qual or greater magnitude due to

washington dc 177 ppresidents national strategy suggests125 to what extent are we willing to sacrifice access to information about facilities in our neighborhoods privacy or government accountability for the sake of risk reducti on are we willing to shift federal resources to dhs and away from other pr ograms the answers to such questions depend on value judgments and are likely to lead to diverse policy approaches and decisions about particular federal initiatives to reduce the threat of terrorism for example on the one hand it often is argued that federal expenditures are most efficient when they are allocated with respect to relative risks and risk reduction opportunities according to this view relatively more fede ral funding should be provided to programs targeting risks that are greater and more clearly documented eg to prevent smoking or motor vehicle accidents than for programs targeting small hypothetical risks eg from exposur to pesticide residues on food based on this reasoning the risks of chemical rrorism in the united states would deserve relatively few resources because they are hypothetical and very small this is especially true for individual chemical facilities such reasoning might leave some chemical facilities vulnerable to attack as explained by the president of the louisiana chemical associati on worstcase scenarios are just that virtually every safety system in every process would have to fail for worstcase scenario to actually happen126 will the federal government or some plant operators find such scenario incredible and thus not worth additional security investments what cost is justified for risk reduction at individual chemical facilities on the other hand some have argued th at the distribution of risk is more important than the absolute or relative ma gnitude of risk scholars at the brookings institution for example argue that federa l resources to combat terrorism should be devoted primarily to avoi ding or mitigating potentially catastrophic terrorist acts127 catastrophic events in which many people are killed or injured at once often strain local social political and economic syst ems as well as emergency response resources as was well illustrated by the attack on the world trade center and again during the hurricane season of 2005 thus the brookings report focuses on protecting against nuclear chemical or biological terrorism and largescale attacks at airports seaports nuclear and chemical facilities stadiums big commercial buildings monuments and american ic ons as opposed to preventing numerous smaller attacks that might produce an equal number of casualties over longer period of time president bush has directed the dhs secretary to set priorities for critical infrastructure protection with an emphasis on critical infrastructure and key resources that could be exploited to cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from the us

first with the nuclear energy sector and with the chemical sector and shortly to follow many others across the top tier of consequences vulnerabilities and threats128 still others object to reliance on any form of costbenefit accounting with respect to public health and environmen tal risk management because quantitative analytic tools often do not consider risk factors and management options that they consider important129 for example one cannot produce reliable estimate of benefits that might accrue from basing decisions on the socalled precautionary principle or most other preventive management tools because specific kinds of damages and cleanup costs may never occur and thus cannot be validated or corrected moreover it can be argued that quantitative analysis is biased against preventive measures because the hypothetical benefits as well as the hypothetical risks accrue or not in the future and generally are disc ounted reduced in value many observers feel this kind of process inevitably estimates that preventive options will have relatively high shortterm costs and relatively low and uncertain longterm benefits responsibility and accountability deciding who should be responsible for achieving results or who should be held accountable requi res consideration of many factors including statutory authority resource availability technical competence political feasibility and moral or ethical constraints responsibility is multifaceted involving financ ial operational and managerial duties and may be layered hierarchically in addition responsibility may be shared or distributed among several private and public entities for example in the case of chemical plant safety responsibility probably will be divided in some manner to include ownersoperators of facilities insurers and some unit of government it is up to policy makers to decide upon the appropriate di stribution of each component generally people agree that the fede ral government is responsible for protecting citizens and the hom eland and that business ow ners are responsible for not causing hazards for their employees neighbors and assets however people have different views about who should be held accountable for the consequences of an act of terrorism what level of protection from risk is acceptable whether the private sector is likely to achieve that level of protection w ithout public assistance or oversight and who should bear the cost s of achieving greater safety these different views largely refl ect general political philosophies eg regarding the

entities some argue that the risks of terrorism for individual chemical facilities are so small that many facility managers are unlikely to invest sufficient resources to adequately ensure site security based on this view some argue that sufficient reductions in terrorist risks for the nation as whole can be assured only if chemical facilities are required to comply with federal standards for risk management that is if they are held accountable by gove rnment federally ma ndated standards are likely to ensure greater level of safety according to this view because administrative rulemaking procedures provide for public comments including comments by people potentially at risk if terrorist attacks but who do not directly profit from neighboring facilitie s voluntary chemical

willing and prepared to reduce significant risks for personal professional and business reasons132 they argue that wellmanaged businesses routinely assess pr ioritize and manage risks of all kinds including risks of potential exposure to hazardous chemicals due to criminal or terrorist acts business incentives to good chemical risk management include reduced legal liability reduced insurance costs enhanced reputation improved employee relations and reduced costs for remediation and vic tim compensation in the united states environmental and occ upational health and safety laws provide additional incentives to many facility ope rators to responsib ly manage hazardous chemicals some are opposed to new legislation because it might disrupt and delay installation of security enhancements by individual companies on the other hand such legislation could benefit businesses by shifting liability to the government and discouraging states from adopting di verse regulatory strategies httpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31530crs38 133 ibid 134 bush george w national strategy for the physical pr otection of critical infrastructures and key assets feb 2003 p 66 135 preston meredith

management are needed especially for addressing risks to small businesses point out that trade associations and industrial research centers have been working for several years to fill such needs such gr oups advocate flexible riskb ased approach to securing facilities arguing that most plants are not likely terrorist targets133 some business groups argue that most regulations inappropr iately force diverse enterprises to adopt onesizefitsall strategy to satisfy any public demand for assurance that risk reduction is occurring some industry re presentatives have recommended safety certification process and are willing to submit their facilities to independent audits in the national strategy for the physical pr otection of critical infrastructures and key assets released in february 2003 the bush administration recommended legislation to enhance security measures at chemical facilities134 although it had hoped to avoid that approach according to the secretary of the department of homeland security tom ridge135 he acknowledged that the administration as of midjuly 2002 had been leaning toward voluntary approach136 t h administration would assign financial re sponsibility to chemical facility owners according to ridge this is cost chemical companies have to absorb for their part some pesticide trade groups would welcome increased government assistance in the form of funding for education137 administrative support for legislation agai n was expressed at senate hearing june 15 2005 although this wa s interpreted by many news reports as change in administration policy138 robert b stephan acting undersecretary of dhs for information analysis and infrastructure pr otection testified that there has been change in the administrations position it has always been willing to work with congress to produce new regulatory authority to enhance the security of chemical facilities however the undersecretary emphasized that the administration will only support riskbased regulation of chemical s ecurity mr stephan stated that dhs was not quite ready to propose or approve of any particular legislative provisions but would be in position to do so

facilities was introduced in pr evious congresses the 107th and 108th none was enacted shift in committee structure in both the house and the senate may have affected the fate of legislation in the 109th congress the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs took the lead in holding hearings and developing legislation in the senate however senator inhofe chairman of the senate committee on environment and public works which held hearings during the previous congress placed hold on the bill because of concerns about its coverage of drinking water and wastewater treatme nt facilities which fall within the purview of his committee in the house bills were referred to both the committee on energy and commerce which held hearings during the 108th congress and to the now permanent committee on homeland security which reported bill very similar to the senate bill as the 109th congress approached the end of the 2nd session the chairman of the committee on energy nd

establishing performancebased security st andards for each tier facilities would be considered for listing ie signation if they produced used or stored substance of concern in quantity equal to or greater than threshold quantity substances of concern would be those that trigger risk management planni ng requirements under the clean air act section 112r as we ll as ammonium nitrate and any other substance designated by the secretary ba sed on the potential extent of death injury or serious adverse effects to human health and safety or the environment or the potential impact on national or economic secu rity or critical infrastructure caused by terrorist incident designated facilities would be assigned to riskbased tiers and required to complete and submit to dhs vulnerability assessments security plans and emergency response plans for terrorist incidents dhs would be required to review these submissions for facilities in the higher risk tiers s 2145 would require written dhs determination to approve disapprove or modify facility assessments and plans within 21 months of the date of enactment within nine months of the date when dhs issues regu lations concerning

proximity to population centers threats to national secu rity threats to critical infrastructure threshold quantities of substances of concern that pose serious threat and other safety or security factors that the dhs secretary in consultation with the epa administrator determines to be appropriate s 2486 also would require the secretary to identify the 600 highes t priority stationary sources each owner or operator of these highpriority facilities would be required to submit to dhs written report that would include vulnerability assessment an assessment of the hazards and preven tion preparedness and response plan that would incorporate the results of the asse ssments and meet requi rements established by dhs each plan would have to include discussion of the practicability of

the 108th congress hr 1562 would make dhs the lead agency overseeing chemical facility security but it would require consultation between dhs and epa the bill would give the dhs s ecretary discretionary authority to select facilities that should conduct vul nerability assessments and security planning but it would require designation of highpriority facilities hr 1562 would exempt from its requirements drinking water treatment f acilities required to conduct vulnerability assessment under the safe dr inking water act and fac ilities subject to the mtsa unless the owner or operator of such facility petitioned the secretary to be subject to the requirements of this act in lieu of the former act vulnerability assessments and plans would be focused in hr 1562 on security ie hardening and emergency measures in order to prevent and respond to releases caused by terrorism rather than on inherent safety measures that might reduce the consequences of an unauthorized release regardless of cause hr 1562 also would protect from public disclosure under foia and state and local disclosure laws the certification documents submitted by facility managers indicating that they have complied with assessment planning and implementation requirements this is in addition to provision that protects from public disclosure information related to vulne rability assessments and security plans hr 1562 also would withhold such information from civ il judicial or administrative proceedings except with respect to compliance with the chemical facility security legislation thus shielding facility owners from lawsuits based on those documents criminal penalties are provided for unaut horized knowing disclosure of protected information by government officials hr 1562 would authorize dhs to disa pprove any assessment or plan and to order revision if it did not comply with regu lations or if the plan or implementation were insufficient to address the results of vulnerability assessment or threat of terrorist release civil but not criminal penalties would be available if facility owners or operators failed to comply with an administrative order hr 2237 hr 2237 introduced by repres entative pallone and similar to s 157hr 1861 in the 108th congress would build on existing epa authority to oversee chemical facilities but would require consultation with

assessments of the highest risk chemical facilities by december 2006 and to complete national security strategy for the chemical sector by february 10 2006 conclusions the threat of terrorism in the united states challenges the existing balance maintained in federal ws between the publics right to know about chemical hazards and the chemical industrys ri ght to protect confidential business information at issue are risks to public health and safety nvironmental protection civil rights and duties national security and privacy some are advocating strategy of relative risk analysis and analysis of risk management options to reveal the best course of action however information appears to be inadequate for quantitative evaluation of the risks of chemical releases whether deliberate or accidental and thehttpwikileaksorgwikicrsrl31530crs48 nature of terrorism makes prediction difficult moreove r there is universally accepted level of tolerable risk obvious basis for comparison of relative risks and benefits and estab lished federal mechanism for ensuring responsible management of the risks of chemical terrorism variety of federal policy options are av ailable for enhancing chemical security in choosing among options policy makers f ace three key issues how to evaluate the risks versus the benefits of public disclo sure how to determine and prioritize the relative importance of diverse risks nd who to hold responsible for achieving results section 550 of pl 109295 the fy2007 dhs appropriation resolved these issues temporarily by providing three years of regulatory authority for dhs the law requires vulnerability assessments for highrisk chemical facilities and implementation of security plans to addre ss hazards revealed in such assessments other legislative proposals that were considered by the 109th congress would have done the same but also addr essed issues such as how to facilitate congressional oversight of dhs implementati on the role of inherently sa fer technology the criteria used to designate facilities as more or less risky and whether state and local right toknow laws should be preempted by the fe deral provisions it remains
