instruction 44 providing scheme agents with details of the litigation policy to be complied with when acting on behalf of the nominal insurer consistent with operational instruction 44 and the model litigant policy in operational instruction 45 workcover now issues this operational instruction governing the manage ment of claims by workers for compensation in relation to noise induced hearing loss including both litigated and non litigated claims this operational instruction is issued to clarify questions concerning the onus of proof and the adequacy of evidence rising out of the decision of combined civil pty ltd v stanko rikoloski 2007 nswccpd 181 11 adequate evidence at the time of making claim for noise induced hearing loss worker need only provide to the employer or the scheme agent comprehensive medical report and hearing loss assessment from relevantly qualified ear nose and throat ent specialist or other appropriately qualified medical specialist see list on workcover website together with detailed work history showing all periods of ex posure to industrial noise history of noise exposure as described in medical report can be taken as evidence of the facts asserted until such time as those facts are contradicted either by different histories given to other doctors or by expert evide nce the employment history as described to the ent specialist should accord with that described by the worker in their claim for hearing impairment and should be verified by the employers concerned 12 expert reports the scheme agents may requ ire any worker making claim for noise induced hearing loss to produce report from or be assessed by an ent who is trained as an assessor of permanent impairment prior to accepting liability b scheme agent may require worker to produce repo rt from sound recording engineer or other similar expert report concerning the noise level of the workplace in the absence of unequivocal instructionsevidence from the employer that the issue of noisy employment is in dispute such reports may only be requested when the scheme agent is in possession of similar report which if accepted by the workers compensation commission would show that the worksite was not noisy for the purposes of the workers compensation act 1987 at the time the worker was emp loyed there 13 onus of proof once worker has produced evidence sufficient to give rise to finding of noise induced hearing loss and employment at the worksite nominated in the claim form the onus shifts to the employer and the scheme agent to show t hat either the employment was not noisy or the employment was not the last noisy employment engaged in by the worker this is consistent with the nsw court of appeal decision of blayney shire council v lobley anor 4 august 1995 which held if an mployer contends notwithstanding the nature of its employment that it did not in fact cause any hearing loss and thus that the injury was not due to the nature of the employment properly understood the forensic onus of exculpating itself falls upon it for the achievement of the purposes of section 171a of the 1987 act it is enough for the worker to succeed against the employer to show that the nature of this employment was such as to give rise to hearing loss per kirby cj operational instruction 122 document name operational instruction 122 prepared by provider services group version 30
