beneficiaries 3 estimated projected growth in real gross domestic product gdp growth per capita and 4 estimated change in expenditures due to changes in law or regulations in order to even out large fluctuations mma changed the gdp calculation from an annual change to an annual average change over the preceding 10 years 10year rolling average the sgr target is not limit on expenditures rather the fee schedule update reflects the success or failure in meeting the target if expenditures exceed the target the update for future year is reduced this is what occurred for 2002 it was also slated to

neutral adjustment additionally the benchmark would be multiplied by complex formula that equals the secretarys estimate of the total amount of payments that would have been made to plans with budget neutrality divided by the secretarys estimate of the total amount of payments that would be made without budget neutrality when making this calculation the secretary would use complete set of the most

together the value of the transferred assets and calculate single penalty period or impose each penalty period sequentially if the penalty crs46 provision current law conference agreement as passed by
