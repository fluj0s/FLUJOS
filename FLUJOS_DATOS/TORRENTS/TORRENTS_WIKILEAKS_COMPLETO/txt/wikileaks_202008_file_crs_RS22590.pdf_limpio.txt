children with disabilities regardless of the severity of their disability to determine which children are eligible for special education and related services each child receiving services has an individual education program iep spelling out the specific special education and related services to be provided to meet his or her needs the parent must be partner in planning and overseeing the childs sp ecial education and related services as member of the iep team to the maximum extent appropriate children with disabilities must be educated with children who are not disabled and states and

proposed funding and grant amounts to authorized funding levels and estimated state grants at those authorized levels when congress enacted the predecessor legi slation to idea in 1975 the available estimate of the cost of educating children with disabilities was on average twice the cost of educating other children determination was made that the federal government would pay some proportion of this add itional or excess cost the metric for determining this excess cost was the national average perpupil expenditure appe the final determination was that the federal gove rnment would pay up to 40 of this excess cost that is states maximum grant under the granttostates pr ogram is 40 of appe times the number of children with disabilitie s served see section 611a2 of idea8 total funds necessary to provide each state with its maximum gran t are often called the full funding amount for idea part b grants to states although appropriations for idea part b grants to states have increas

behind act22 in 2001 the child left behind act nclba pl 107110 reauthorized and amended the elementary and secondary edu cation act esea among other purposes nclba aimed to improve public elementary and secondary educa tion for all students one mechanism for accomplishing this goal was to require that all students reach proficiency or advanced sta nding on state achievement test s of reading and mathematics by school year 20132014 public school students are to make adequate yearly progress ayp each year to meet these goals school s and local educational agencies leas that fail to make ayp for two consecutive years or more can face various penalties ayp applies not only to all students in the aggregat but also to designated subgroups such as children with disabilities ed has recognized that not all children with disabilities can be expected to achieve proficiency on academic standards set for most children as result ed permits leas to calculate ayp for small percentages of children with disabilities based on alternate achievement standards 1 of all children tested and modified achievement standards 2 of all tested another nclba mechanism for improving pub lic education is to require that all public school teachers of core subjects suc h as reading mathematics history and science are highly qualified the require ments to be highly qualified teacher are fairly lengthy however the general principle is that such teachers demonstrate subject matter competency in the subject or subj ects they teach the 2004 idea amendments modified these requirements for special educa tion teachers first of all the amendments require that all public school special education teachers must meet definition of highly qualified not just those teaching core subjects in addition the amendments made certain additional modifications to apply to the nc lba highly qualified definition with respect to two types of special education teachers those who teach only children with disabilities who are held to alternate academic standards and those teaching more than one core subject to children with disabilities
